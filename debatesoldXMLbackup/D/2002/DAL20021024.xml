      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 15<i>b,</i> motion re amendments to Standing Orders; No. 1, Data Protection (Amendment) Bill, 2002 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); No. 28, Sea Pollution (Hazardous and Noxious Substances) Bill, 2000 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); and No. 29, Railway Safety Bill, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed).</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the following arrangements shall apply in relation to the proceedings on No. 15<i>b</i>: the proceedings, including any amendments put thereto, shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 20 minutes by one question which shall be put from the Chair; the speeches, not exceeding five minutes in each case, shall be confined to the Government Chief Whip and the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the technical group and the Labour Party; and the Dáil on its rising today shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday 5 November 2002.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not agreed. This proposal has been made by the Fianna Fáil Party along with the Progressive Democrats to allow the Taoiseach to absent himself from this House from 12 o'clock on Wednesdays. This means the Taoiseach will only be in attendance from 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday until 12 noon on a Wednesday. This amounts to a denial of democracy and an abdication of his responsibility. It makes a mockery of this House. It does down the trust and confidence that the people placed in the elected representatives here. It gives the &ldquo;Harvey Smith&rdquo; to this Chamber. It is the most scurrilous piece of political skulduggery I have seen in years. In my time on these benches former Taoisigh Cosgrave, Lynch&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is not here this morning because he is due to attend an EU meeting this evening that does not start until 7 p.m. He has the assistance of the Government jet to get him there. There is no reason why he should not be here to answer questions. In addition, of the 17 Thursdays the Dáil has sat this year, the Taoiseach has been absent on ten of them or 60% of the time. When he is here, he refuses to answer any questions or give any information and now he treats this House and the people it represents, including the young people in the Gallery, with sheer contempt. I have never seen the likes of this previously. The Taoiseach refuses to come in here on a Thursday for questions that need to be answered. I have the support of all the technical group this morning although I am not so sure whether the Members from the Labour Party will change their minds. This amounts to an abdication of his responsibility. It gives the &ldquo;Harvey Smith&rdquo; sign to this House and the likes of it has not happened since the Kalif of Baghdad treated his subjects with such contempt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1: &ldquo;That item 15<i>b</i> conclude no later than 3.30 p.m.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is more significant than a proposal regarding the time the Taoiseach spends speaking here or the pecking order of Opposition parties. This is about whether the House is accountable. Up to now we have spent millions of euro on tribunals that arose from clear failures of accountability in the Parliament. The lack of answers to straight questions can result in the kind of tribunals we have seen. For the Government to propose reducing the Taoiseach's accountability to the House is a recipe for further tribunals, whether they are the result of corruption, malpractice, neglect or sheer irresponsibility. The House must reform so that it is more accountable, not less. For that reason this debate is very important and I propose No. 15<i>b</i> be amended so that the debate concludes no later than 3.30 p.m. to allow time to look into the ramifications of what the Government is proposing with the collusion of the Labour Party. It is important to explore what is being proposed, not just for what it means to Standing Orders as it is far more significant than that. We have five amendments which my colleagues wish to move.</P>

Deputy Sargent is speaking on behalf of the party and is the only Member who is entitled to speak at this stage. We then put this proposal and if the House disposes of the matter that will be the end of it and there will be no more speakers. Deputy Sargent is entitled to speak to all amendments now.

      <P>Yes. There will be an opportunity on the substantive issue for Members to speak when the debate comes before the House. We are now discussing a proposal on the arrangements for taking the debate. The Standing Order is absolutely specific that one Member from each party is entitled to speak.

      <P>What is proposed by the Tánaiste this morning is an absolute disgrace. It makes a mockery of Dáil procedure and as the Chair knows, for some time there has been intense discussion of Dáil reform. Those discussions and proposals have been torn to shreds <Col N="271" />by what I can only describe as a huckster's deal between Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and the Labour Party. That is what we are looking at. The result will be that the Taoiseach will only be responsible to the House for one hour and six minutes on Tuesdays and the same on Wednesdays.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is being excused from being accountable to the House from lunchtime on Wednesday and all through Thursday. It is a further indictment of him that he cannot be here this morning. That is an absolute disgrace given the importance and enormity of this proposal if enacted.</P>
      <P>While I can only address the House as the leader of the Sinn Féin party, I have no doubt that after an appeal to the Labour Party to come back from the brink of their sordid arrangements with the Government, they will reconsider their position and look at the potential reconfiguration of Opposition time and opportunities along with the technical group. I appeal to the Labour Party at this eleventh hour not to go down the road of giving an endorsement to the Taoiseach to absent himself from accountability to the House, damning themselves before the electorate and those who seek and deserve a real Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The central issue here is the Taoiseach's tactics in removing himself from the Chamber at 12 noon on Wednesday. Let us not lose sight of that. When the Taoiseach accepted his seal of office from Uachtaráin na hÉireann he did so on the basis of accountability, answerability and openness of a democratic system to the people of the country. He accepted that seal and to come into this House, which is the people's House, to be answerable to the people. This is the first time in the history of the State that a Taoiseach, on behalf of a Government, with the collusion of a smaller party in Government, is slapping democracy in the face. He will not come into the House. He refuses to be here. He has absented himself from the House on ten of the last 17 sittings days. How does that square with the philosophy of the Fianna Fáil Party, or the Progressive Democrats, to be public watchdog&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;that this House seems likely to meet less often than the Congress of the People's Republic of China. As Members we should be embarrassed that we are prepared to vote on motions that make us less relevant in the eyes of the people of this country. On those grounds we strongly oppose this item and the actions that bring the House into further disrepute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following on from what Deputy Kenny said about Deputy Quinn, my party and I extend our good wishes to him on his term as Leader of the Labour Party and acknowledge the good things he did in Cabinet and in the House. We regret the manner of his leaving today but there are <Col N="282" />many things on which we can agree and, hopefully, will agree in the future. However, the action taken by his party today is wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I also oppose proposal No. 2 in relation to the Adjournment of the House until Tuesday, 5 November. I would like to echo the points made in relation to the new configuration of Government and Opposition as represented on the electronic voting board, 89 to 42. At least there are 42 Deputies in the House prepared and willing to offer the challenge. I wish also to extend good wishes to Deputy Quinn as he stands down from the leadership of the Labour Party. I do so without any begrudgery or bickering with him. I believe he is wrong in the position he has taken on this issue. It is regrettable that his last act as Leader of the Labour Party was to accommodate the absence of the Taoiseach and thereby undermine Government accountability in the House today. There was another way the Technical Group and the Labour Party could have talked this through sensibly and in the spirit of constructive opposition and to focus our attention on Government, where it should be. Obviously Deputy Quinn is continuing in politics. If he is to take up his profession from whence he came into politics I hope he will not be picking up on the wrong angle in that profession as he has assuredly done in his role here today.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to take the opportunity later when we were less ruly but on my own behalf and on behalf of the Government I pay tribute to Deputy Quinn. He has served in various Ministries with great distinction. He is an extremely articulate spokesperson, both for his constituents and the Labour Party and he has led the party with great integrity and honour in recent years. I know he will remain very active in politics; therefore, he is not bowing out. I genuinely wish him and his wife, Liz, well in his retirement from the leadership of the party. We look forward to working with his successor, whoever that may be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members of the House for their generous comments. The Labour Party is opposed to the proposal for the Adjournment of the House next week. We share the views expressed by some that this House should and could be more productive but I invite all Members to maximise the advantages they currently have in holding this Government to account. One of the ways to do that, and I say this to Deputy Boyle, is to put down questions.</P>

      <P>On the question of sharing time, strictly speaking the Dáil Standing Order 119, paragraph 3, which deals with the Second Stage of Bills, does not allow for the sharing of the main spokesperson's time. Similarly, the order of the Dáil relating to statements, which can vary on a given day, does not allow for sharing by the main spokespersons. However, a convention has arisen whereby if a main spokesperson wishes to share his or her time, the Chair asks for the indulgence of the House to allow the time to be shared. If an objection is made then the Standing Order or order of the Dáil of the day must be applied and time cannot be shared. The only case in which Members may share time without the indulgence of the House is when the Dáil has expressly provided that Members may share time. If the convention of sharing time is the subject of continued dispute the Chair will have no option but to apply the Standing Orders strictly. We now move on to Leaders' Questions.</P>

      <P>I have a question for the Tánaiste. The FÁS action plan published in March of this year indicated that the numbers on community employment schemes would fall from 33,000 to 28,000 by the end of 2002. In April the Tánaiste, in response to questions, said that there were 30,809 participants in community employment schemes and that she saw that being reduced to 24,000 at the end of this year. A confidential internal FÁS report referred to in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 5 October indicated that up to 10,000 further cuts would take place on community employment schemes. The report went on to state that in light of current budgetary discussions it might be necessary to have even greater reductions in community employment schemes <Col N="288" />and that such a move would cause a major crisis at individual and community level by the end of this year and next year. Will the Tánaiste clarify the position on community employment schemes? What is the Government plan to sustain rural and urban communities where community employment schemes play such an important role in the lives of many thousands of people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste appreciate how essential and vital community employment schemes are in so many areas, particularly in the voluntary sector? Much of the work being carried out under community employment schemes will not be done in the general open market because in many cases it involves areas such as education, health, environmental and animal welfare and so on. Is the Tánaiste deliberately organising the community employment scheme cuts so that they affect the education, health and voluntary sector more than others? That is the clear perception given the degree to which the cuts affect these sectors. Will she set matters right in that regard by endorsing the work being carried out by the community employment schemes and by putting in place not just social economy schemes, which will not always stand up in the open market, but some level of guarantee that the work being carried out under community employment schemes will continue and that these areas will not be adversely affected as a result of the cuts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister for Labour in the mid-1980s responsible for introducing the social employment scheme, does the Tánaiste continue to share the view expressed by her former leader, Mr. O'Malley, that the scheme and its successor, the community employment scheme, were akin to the cutting of nettles in a graveyard and consequently of little or no value and if that ideological observation as to the value of the community employment scheme still prevails within her party? While the Minister of State has responsibility on a devolved basis for the administration of the scheme, it is she who will be responsible for negotiating with her erstwhile colleague beside her, regarding a reduction in the Estimates. Therefore, I repeat the questions put by Deputies Sargent and Kenny. Does the Tánaiste now hold that there are sections of the community who cannot avail of the social economy model, who are dependent on the provision of community employment for the delivery of services, something as basic as meals on wheels, and that the consequences of the proposed reductions will, in effect, close down the delivery of these services which cannot be delivered by the marketplace, are not amenable to market measures and require exclusively the intervention of the Department which has responsibility for the scheme? Will she deny or repudiate that there will be reductions to the degree referred to recently in an extensive reply on the Adjournment debate by her colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The community employment scheme, which was a successor to the social employment scheme, was introduced as a labour market measure when the unemployment rate was in the region of 16% and long-term unemployment was half that. The scheme effectively eliminated long-term unemployment. The community employment schemes are no longer a labour market measure, the focus is now on community service. I share the view expressed by Deputies that it is an essential part of the social infrastructure in many communities, therefore, a strong social focus will continue to be the hallmark of the community employment scheme. The numbers on the scheme at a given time will depend on the finances available. However, the figures referred to by Deputy Kenny do not include the 4,000 people who have been transferred from community employment to mainstream education. If these two figures are taken together, over the course of this year in excess of 28,000 will be involved in both community employment and working in the education sector.</P>
      <P>The Estimates for next year have not yet been agreed. The paper to which the Deputy referred was presented to the board of FÁS when it was considering the different scenarios that would operate, depending on the level of funding, and that have been made available. Since the Government has not yet agreed next year's Estimates, I am not in a position to say what the number will be for next year. However, as soon as the Estimates are finalised we will be in a position to announce the funding which will be provided. There will be large numbers of people throughout the country involved in community employment and I am satisfied that the priority areas such as the drugs task force, meals on wheels and the kind of services referred to by the Deputies will continue to be supported by community employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for her reply. She knows better than I the stage the Estimates are at. The Minister sitting beside her could tell her in two minutes whether the same numbers, or fewer, will be employed next year. She said large numbers would be employed under the social services side of the scheme but she did not indicate whether she considers there will be an overall drop of up to 10,000, together with this year's reduction, referred to in the internal FÁS report. The difference between a person receiving unemployment assistance and working on a community employment scheme is approximately &euro;24 per week. Has an evaluation been carried out of the social benefit of the range of works carried out under the community employment schemes? Surely it makes neither economic nor social sense to have 10,000 people removed from these schemes by the end of next year. Will the Tánaiste clarify the position in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the numbers involved in community employment, a couple of <Col N="290" />thousand people are involved in the jobs initiative, social economy and the back-to-work allowance. Various measures are in place and I can confirm that there will be a substantial number of people involved in community employment next year. I do not believe the figures about which the Deputy is speculating will be the reality. However, until the Estimates are finalised I am not in a position to say what the figures will be. I believe there will be more than enough resources to ensure that the priority areas as far as social issues are concerned will still be a priority for FÁS in supporting and allocating members to community employment. The rate people receive depends on the category they are in. While that is the case in regard to the average, it is not the case in relation to some categories of people who form a large proportion of those involved in community employment.</P>

      <P>On the issue of Dáil reform, having travelled to a couple of countries outside of Ireland, I recall my honeymoon in Cuba where the parliament house is actually empty and its significance is its attraction for tourists. In regard to this parliament House, this is the 20th day of the Dáil sitting since the general election. Three Bills have been dealt with and, as Deputy Boyle said, it has sat fewer days than the Northern Ireland Assembly which has now been stood down. It has also sat fewer days than any other European Union parliament of which I am aware. In that regard will the Tánaiste give those of us who are concerned about what has happened here today in terms of a further reduction of accountability from the head of Government some assurance on the prospect of improving accountability in this House by way of further reforms of the Dáil to improve rather than disimprove the situation. This includes areas such as the abolition of the dual mandate, something the Tánaiste has been frequently interested in tackling.</P>
      <P>What about being able to summon the Taoiseach here to answer questions about urgent matters, as happens in other Parliaments, rather than having set piece debates which we tend to have? What about the provision of translation facilities for a bilingual Parliament through the monitors, not just in the Chamber? What about recognition for smaller parties? The Northern Ireland Assembly recognises two Members. I ask these questions because they relate to very urgent and topical matters in the light of a retrograde decision that the Government and a majority in the House have taken.</P>
      <P>I thank Dr. John Reid for his work as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. I also pay tribute to Deputy Quinn on his last day as leader of the Labour Party. I have always regarded him as a very able and erudite parliamentarian. It is sad, however, that the last decision being made about Dáil reform moves us backwards in terms of the Taoiseach's accountability.</P>

It is of critical importance, following the referendum campaign, that this issue remains high on the political agenda. I make no bones about supporting the provision of facilities and resources for this very important committee.</P>
      <P>I ask the Tánaiste to look at the responses being given by the Minister for Education and Science. Deputies who table questions to the said Minister are referred to the departmental website. To refer those who may be technologically inferior to the Department's website is a disgraceful way of conducting business. For any Deputy to be referred to a departmental website for a one line reply is scandalous. When I had the privilege of serving for a short time in a State Department, I told the Secretary General to give whatever information he could to Deputies asking legitimate parliamentary questions so as not to have them resorting to Freedom of Information Act requests. Will the Tánaiste ensure this matter is discussed at Cabinet and that the Minister for Education and Science gives proper replies to legitimate parliamentary questions?</P>

      <P>Since the matter has been raised and in support of the broad thrust of previous comments, I draw the Tánaiste's attention to the fact that there is no restriction on the Taoiseach's office hiring advisers at salaries which nobody here, not even Ministers, can command. In any other democracy this would be seen as a gross abuse of majority power. In one case, the salary is &euro;171,000 per year. A coterie of five or six individuals have been on the payroll continuously since 17 May. My parliamentary party which, as of right, is entitled to a press officer and to have certain other positions filled is finding that those positions are being blocked. We cannot appoint persons to positions already assigned to us because the relevant Department has put a blanket freeze on the filling of posts in all Departments. It is one of the silent cuts not seen above the breaking water. They are known as &ldquo;adjustments&rdquo;. In any other democracy this would be construed as outrageous, that the Taoiseach's <Col N="292" />office can be filled by people on salaries multiples of the average industrial wage, while posts to which we are entitled cannot. The Minister for Finance has instructed that they not be filled. That is the position. It is an outrageous abuse of the existing system, let alone the reforms to which Deputy Sargent referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the House has taken a lot of time this morning and I will put my question to the Tánaiste briefly. Does the Government share my and my party's concern that the Stevens report into the murder of solicitor Pat Finucane has been delayed for a further six months and does she agree, in the interests of restoring confidence in the fragile democracy that is Northern Ireland, that the Stevens inquiry into those who were responsible for the murder should be proceeded with without further delay and that all available material should be put in the public domain? Is this concern, if it is shared by the Government, being formally communicated to the authorities in Britain and Northern Ireland?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from that, I wish Paul Murphy, the Welsh Secretary every success in his appointment to replace Dr. John Reid as Northern Ireland Secretary. In view of the sensitivity of the business around the restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly, has the Government made arrangements to meet all the pro-agreement parties as a matter of urgency in relation to the renewal of the forum on peace and reconciliation? It is a body which would allow pro-agreement interest groups and parties to continuously put forward a stream of initiatives for the restoration of the Assembly and strengthening of the fragile peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I too pay tribute to Dr. John Reid. He had a steady and balanced approach to the sensitivities and difficulties to the crisis and I wish his successor every success in the difficult work required to re-establish the institutions.</P>
      <P>Will the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which I understand is to meet before Christmas, be given new terms of reference and, if so, has the Government given any thought to it? In the light of the new situation in which we find ourselves, will the Tánaiste give us information on the efforts to re-establish the forum?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Quinn's concern in relation to the delay in the Stevens report but I have not been briefed as to the reasons for its delay. I do not know if we are aware of the reasons. I am not aware of discussions that have taken place between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his counterpart but I will raise the matter with the Minister.</P>
      <P>In relation to the pro-agreement parties, the Ulster Unionist Party is not a member of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and we must bear that in mind. I do not know if new terms of reference are proposed but I am aware that the forum was in suspense and was never stood down.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It may well have a useful role to play given the vacuum that now exists in Northern Ireland. There have been extensive meetings <Col N="295" />with parties, although I am not sure if every party has been met by Government representatives. The leader of the SDLP will be in the House meeting people today. The Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn Féin have had meetings and I recently met the Alliance Party when I was in Northern Ireland. Deputies can be assured that the Government wants to keep contact with parties on an ongoing basis through this difficult phase. I join others in expressing our appreciation to the Secretary of State, Dr. John Reid, and wish his successor well.</P>

      <P>Returning to my question regarding the murder of Pat Finucane, will the Tánaiste covey to the Government &ndash; as I understand she is not necessarily briefed on the minutiae of this matter &ndash; in light of the failure of Sir John Stevens to publish a report which was previously deferred, that confidence in the system of administration in Northern Ireland has been eroded? That erosion has been compounded by the suspension of Stormont and in the run up to the Assembly elections in May 2003, there is a need for a judicial inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane. Will the Tánaiste covey that on behalf of the Government to the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly covey the Deputy's comments in that regard. In the past, the failure to have an independent police regime in Northern Ireland caused enormous difficulties. The reforms that have come as part of the Good Friday Agreement are playing an important role in increasing confidence within both communities, particularly among Nationalists. In relation to the comment on the need for a judicial inquiry, it is important to have the Stevens report to hand as soon as possible before a decision of that kind could be made.</P>

      <Col N="301" />In moving these motions today I am conscious that the development of our parliamentary democracy has grown and developed and led to the successful governance of countries through the growth of political parties. It is those political parties who go before the electorate with one voice, joint policies and an identified philosophy. The public know for whom they are voting and know the type of policies that will be implemented in Government.</P>
    <P>Over the last hundred years democracy and the public have benefited from the fact that political parties, in a number of different countries, have grown and that is why they are so successful in the Dáil. Parties who presented themselves to the electorate in June this year were returned in strong numbers. The larger political parties have 81, 31 or 21 Members while smaller political parties have eight, six or five Members. The recognition of those parties is something that should survive in this Dáil. The public knew what it was voting for and voted for those groups and that those parties should be given priority. Of course every Member of the Dáil is entitled to his or her rights as is every one of the smaller groups.</P>

There is a difference however between a Technical Group coming together and a parliamentary party group of one voice coming together. The Technical Group has come together for parliamentary benefits but agrees to disagree on all issues.</P>
      <P>While we will continue with the process of a technical group which, although it does not speak with one voice and has rotating Leaders entitled to a Leader's question, will be entitled to speaking time and priority in opening statements, etc., we propose to restore the status and priority to the political parties that the public voted for and to whom they gave a mandate.</P>

      <P>Their rights will continue to be recognised. It is a simple matter of giving precedence and priority to the political party system. There are 166 Members in the House. One of those Members is the Taoiseach, the Leader of the Government, who has been elected not just to be answerable to the Dáil but to the people. <Col N="302" />This Taoiseach spends more time in this House than any of his predecessors. Each Tuesday and Wednesday he answers oral and written parliamentary questions, which are notified in advance so they can be prepared, for an hour and a half. They are a valuable part of our democratic process. That is how previous Taoisigh did it and it will continue that way.</P>
      <P>What makes this Taoiseach different is that over a year ago it was identified and recognised that for the benefit of democracy Leader's questions should be introduced. They would be unprepared, unseen, of a topical nature and would be raised by the Leaders of the main parties each day. That has happened, has been successful and is a central part of Dáil days. This was different from previous Taoisigh. It means that the Taoiseach has spent, and will continue to spend, three hours a week answering questions. That is at least a half an hour more than any of his predecessors. The reorganisation of that time will ensure that he will continue to take the Taoiseach's questions and questions of a topical nature.</P>
      <P>Because of the development of a Technical Group the Taoiseach is now taking questions of a topical nature from three different groups. He will continue, as heretofore, taking 12 questions each day except that they will now be taken over two rather than three days. We now have quality time, extra time, quality questions and a greater engagement by the Members of the House.</P>

      <P>We have heard many lectures about the primacy of parliament over the years. We have heard how important it is to have the Taoiseach and relevant Ministers in the House to be accountable. This is the first step in removing the senior Member of the executive of the House from accountability. It reduces the number of hours he is expected to attend the House and the times he might attend. Are we talking about some emperor who might descend on the House and honour us with his presence sometime? I am amazed that the Minister can submit such a suggestion.</P>
      <P>We have listened before to lectures about how important it is that people have a right to speak in parliament. It is the right of the Opposition to ask questions of the Taoiseach at any time. The Taoiseach has always been facilitated with a pair whenever he wanted to go anywhere.</P>

It is arrogance to try to do a deal which involves the Taoiseach absenting himself arbitrarily from the House during the ordinary business day. It is a retrograde step. The Minister mentioned Dáil reform. This is one of the issues that was presented to me when I, fortunately or unfortunately, was given the job of party Whip. One of the first items I read on Dáil reform was that the Taoiseach would be out of the House more often roaming around the country at will doing what Taoisigh would want to do on occasions such as this.</P>

      <P>He has never been refused a pair and the Minister of State knows well that no Taoiseach or Minister has ever been refused a pair provided they are abroad or out of the House on official Government business. This is not about official Government business but about putting the House down a step. It is about treating it with contempt and refusing to be present to answer questions when the Taoiseach and Ministers are expected to do so. This arrogance has manifested itself in more than one way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect the Minister of State did not mention and which was intended in the package of Dáil reform was that the commencement of busi<Col N="304" />ness following the summer recess would be marked by a parliamentary parade where the Ceann Comhairle and people of rank would parade down the steps, the Ceann Comhairle would assume the Chair and the others would bow and move into their respective positions. It did not entail someone walking ahead with a mace over his shoulder but I am sure that would have been introduced at a later stage. Neither did it entail someone entering in a powdered wig and silk pantaloons to present the mace or orders of Parliament. However, I know it was only a short step from the imperial trappings envisaged by the people who devised those Standing Orders.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State spoke about Dáil reform. The Chamber when it was first instituted worked better than it does now. Every change that has been implemented in the past ten years has been to remove the right of the individual to participate in Parliament.</P>

      <P>An example is priority questions. All they do is exclude backbenchers from their right to ask a question of the Taoiseach or Ministers in Parliament. They should never have been introduced and my proposal was to remove them to let everyone have their questions answered.</P>
      <P>This reform will be regretted and I hope the Government will see the light of day before Christmas and change these Standing Orders again. The presidential style of the Taoiseach is not compatible with the workings of Parliament. It is a sad day for democracy, openness, transparency and accountability. This is the issue. Ministers will take their cue from the Taoiseach and some have done so, treating the House with contempt.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to conclude on a subject such as this, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, because I could go on for a long time. I have seen the evidence of Ministers treating the House with contempt in the manner in which they reply to questions and in their refusal to answer them. Now they have been given a further cue by the Taoiseach who wants to absent himself from the House. Some morning soon we will find the Taoiseach will no longer come to the House and will have microphones rigged up outside his home from which he will address the nation, as is done in countries more senior to ours, as some would say.</P>
      <P>I regret the bulldozing of this order through the House this morning. I have said to the Minister of State privately that she will regret it, as will the Taoiseach. Everyone will be sorry within five to six weeks for making this decision.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá gur brónach an scéal é anseo nach gá don Taoiseach a bheith i láthair ach amháin tráthnóna Dé Máirt agus maidin Dé Céadaoin roimh meán lae. If one were to conduct a vox pop, one would find that, for many people, it represents a gross disimprovement of the accountability of the House and brings us one step closer to making this place irrelevant.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach is present, he is unable to answer questions. How much less he is able to answer questions when he is not present. In a recent Question Time, the Taoiseach took 36 questions together and his reply amounted to two pages of double spaced large print. This indicates the level of disdain and disrespect the Government has for Parliament.</P>
      <P>This would be bad enough if it was just about the workings of the Dáil but it also involves lessons and, I hope, avoiding mistakes in future. As I stated earlier, running in parallel with the Dáil are a number of tribunals. Although I take Deputy Quinn's point that it is not always the Taoiseach who does not answer questions, there are occasions when the answering of questions by a Taoiseach is critical in the holding to account of a Government. An example Deputy Quinn will remember is when Albert Reynolds was Taoiseach. There will be such situations in future when this will be the case. I am sure Mr. Reynolds would have been happy at the time to have been excused from the Dáil and to be about business elsewhere and not to have had to take questions here. I hope we are not seeing preparation for that scenario with these changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil is becoming less relevant. Where is the real agenda? Where are decisions being made? We realise there has been a diminution of sovereignty and the people have voted for that, but we also realise that decisions are made in places other than in Brussels or the European Commission. Some decisions are certainly made <Col N="306" />with private interests at heart. If those of us with experience of local authorities wish to make a parallel comparison, there is no doubt that, when local developers want to get work done, the priority is to try to meet the planner or the manager, not the local representatives. A similar pattern is developing in the national Parliament. Less decisions are being made here. For that reason it is important we look again and cry a halt to this disimprovement.</P>
    <P>The party structure has not been enhanced by the goings on of some of the parties to which the Minister of State referred. An example is the promised referendum on Partnership for Peace. It has done nothing for party politics to have promised something before a general election and to have thrown it aside afterwards. It does nothing to bring out a manifesto which sets down projects to be completed only to claim after the general election that they were only possible if money were available and that, now that it is not, the projects will not proceed. These are issues on which people judge the credibility of the party political structure.</P>
    <P>For my party and others in the Technical Group, the pecking order is not the issue. We could have worked out some arrangement with the Labour Party if it was so important to it that its members would be able to speak after those of the Fine Gael Party. What is at issue is the way the Opposition co-operates in terms of doing its job and that has not been helped by the carry on here. It is also about giving smaller parties and independent Members the recognition their mandate deserves and it is no more or less than that. The Northern Assembly has at least given us that to be going on with as an example. Two members of a party there are recognised in proportion to their size and have full rights. We need to move on from the old days of trying to close off any minority opinion that might upset the apple cart and the establishment. Standing Order 114 could have been changed to allow the six TDs in the Green Party, the five in Sinn Féin and the independent Deputies to have group status. Now we realise it was not such a big deal to change the standing order, but it is being changed for the most petty of reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party supports the rights of parties, groups and Members to speak and to be heard in this House. Today's proposed changes will not remove one minute of time from any party, group or Member but will enhance opportunities for Members to raise questions with Ministers. There will be an additional 45 minutes of such time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party does not support an interpretation of the rules that gives Sinn Féin, with five Members, or the Green Party with six Members, precedence over the Labour Party with 21 Members. We do not support an interpretation that would give Deputy Lowry or Deputy Joe <Col N="307" />Higgins a higher ranking in debate than the leader of the Labour Party.</P>

    <Title>Data Protection (Amendment) Bill, 2002  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Bill as the availability of data is a huge issue for people. Data are used in many areas for sales and other purposes. I welcome the Bill but I draw the Minister of State's attention to certain aspects of the legislation. As the Minister said, the Bill is very technical so we need to go into great detail in discussing it. It originated in the EU and much of the debate on the Nice referendum revolved around the huge amount of detailed legislation coming from Europe which deals with data. People are frustrated by this, in both their business and personal lives, as much of it is not relevant to them.</P>
      <P>I wish to address the issue of data held by financial institutions. I recently came across the case of a man who was in financial difficulties for three or four months six years ago when his cheques were not being honoured by the bank. Today he is still on a database available to all financial institutions and he cannot get a loan if he applies for one. His bank had confidence in him and knew he would get out of his difficulties and build up a thriving business, which he did, and he now employs a huge number of people. The banks should not be allowed to pass such information on to each other and the Minister of State should accept this point, which has been made by previous speakers. Banks are giving a service and charging enough for that service &ndash; there are charges for interest and there are also further charges.</P>
      <P>The example I gave can be replicated in every parish in the country. Any good business can get into difficulty and fall into arrears at some point but it is the sign of a good businessman if the business can get through it. The person involved in the example I gave was able to overcome this, and there are many other people in the same situation. In the 1980s interest rates were as high as 18 to 20% &ndash; at one stage the interest rate on overdrafts was over 20% &ndash; and people found themselves in financial difficulties for one reason or other. Some of those people are still blacklisted and that should be addressed.</P>
      <P>In the cases of people anxious to buy their own houses, Members know it is cheaper to get money from a building society or bank than a local authority. Some people are reverting to local authorities for finance to buy their homes because they are blacklisted by the financial institutions and I beg the Minister of State to change this position.</P>
      <P>In Britain employers are permitted to access police files. What is the situation in Ireland in that regard? I do not stand up for those who commit crimes but some people in society get into trouble with the law when young and we all want them to change their ways. They can become very good citizens and data on their crimes should not be held against them. These issues should be examined as many people are worried about data in those contexts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not pretend to be an expert on data protection but when I heard the Minister of State and the rest of the contributions I asked myself where we were going in this country. We are getting nearer and nearer to a police State. I am not in favour of this Bill and I hope my party opposes it as too much private information is being gathered, by whom I do not know. Who is gathering the data and what are they doing with it? There is nothing wrong with getting statistics and other data but why should my private data or anyone else's be used by private companies to make money? </P>
      <P>Every week this House passes legislation. This Bill relates to data protection and getting information, yet as a representative elected by the people, I cannot get answers to questions I put down to Ministers. The new method involves the Minister for Health and Children referring questions to the chief executive officer of the health board, while the Minister for Education and Science refers one to a website. Is this where we are going? Are we becoming like Iraq? There was a 100% turn-out recently for an election in Iraq. If those on the opposite side had their way we would have a 100% turn-out and we would know who people were voting for. I wonder what is happening and where we are going. We are turning into a police state. I was recently in the office of an official of a health board. He was able to find information on what social welfare payments a person was receiving. The next thing will be that the Revenue Commissioners will be able to tap into bank accounts to see what people have and what they do not have. Is this the next step? We should not allow this situation to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Members of the Oireachtas we all receive e-mails every day from all over the country. We received many nasty e-mails during the recent referendum campaign but the senders did not <Col N="313" />give their names. We could not respond to those writers because we could not be sure who was sending the e-mails. The senders of e-mails should be identifiable by name and address when they send e-mails to offices and homes. I suggest that the proposed legislation examine this.</P>
    <P>I can give an example of what happened to me recently as a result of the Freedom of Information Act. Journalists and others regularly request information on Members' expenses. I have no problem with that; it is their right. I was asked for details under the Freedom of Information Act. I wanted to know who was asking for the information. I put in a freedom of information request to find out who was making freedom of information inquiries about our expenses. I was told that personal information could not be given to me. I asked for that as a written reply and I said that my solicitor would obtain a legal order to test the Freedom of Information Act. Following consultation with the commissioner, the official contacted me and said that the commissioner was in agreement with me; if a person has my information then I should be entitled to his. I have not received that information to date. The person making the original request has not collected the information, probably because I wanted to know their identity.</P>
    <P>I am all for freedom, I am all for information and I am all for data, but it must be a two-way process. If a public representative asks a parliamentary question, he must be given a reply. If Joe Soap uses the Freedom of Information Act to obtain information, then Joe Washing-Up Liquid must be allowed find out who is looking for that information. It cannot be all one way. I ask that the Government examine this aspect of freedom of information. I believe in giving out all the information that is required. If I was a Minister on the other side of the House tomorrow morning I would tell the departmental officials to make everything available because then there would be no questions to be asked.</P>
    <P>I believe public information should be made available but private information should remain private. I do not believe that this Bill will protect people. The Garda Síochána has enough powers. The Criminal Assets Bureau was the best thing ever for dealing with the criminals. Information should not be collected on behalf of an individual and used against them at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I know of a case where a person applied to a bank for a loan. The loan was issued and when the person defaulted a family member undertook to repay the loan for them. They were then given a bad credit rating. People can get into financial difficulties for whatever reason, as Deputy Hayes said, and things can then turnaround for them. I wonder why the bad information can be used against them at a later stage. I do not like this Bill. I do not like what is happening in this country. We are becoming more and more like a police state. It is time to call a halt.</P>
    <P>I am glad I cannot use the Internet. Child pornography is going into every home. I do not allow <Col N="314" />my children to use the Internet because it is dangerous. There are sick, warped people in the world. We should be introducing legislation to protect children instead of which we are trying to get more information to use against people at a later stage. I am opposed to this Bill. There is enough information already available. I do not object to public information being available but private information will always fall into the hands of people who want to use it against you when you are vulnerable. The Garda and the banks will use it to suit themselves. The health boards and the local authorities will use that information against you, not for you. That is why I am opposed to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>On first inspection this is a complicated Bill. It seeks to amend the Principal Act with quite a number of amendments. It would have been easier if the whole Act had been redrafted so that everything was contained in one Act. I take the Minister of State's point when he regretted the fact that it has taken so long to bring this Bill forward and to transpose the directive into law.</P>
      <P>We live in a data age. The Internet is here to stay and will become more important. This Bill also deals with ordinary manual files. It means that from now on, people will have to be very careful about how such files are kept. If I am not mistaken, access to these files will be restricted and controlled.</P>
      <P>Directives are being introduced to control spam and e-mails. It appears it is possible for people from remote areas to gather data from a person's computer without permission. I believe it is possible to gather information relating to a person's financial, medical or business affairs if these are stored in a personal computer. I ask if this practice can be controlled.</P>
      <P>I commend the Data Protection Commissioner and his office for their work. It is very important and technical work. I have read the 2001 report and they seem to be doing a very good job. I also note that they were recruiting extra staff. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that this office has all the staff and resources it requires so that it can protect citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to data about deceased persons. The Minister of State said that he did not regard it as important even though there is a provision in the directive to enable this to occur but that it was not necessary at this time to include controls, restrictions and safeguards for data on deceased persons. I do not fully agree with the Minister of State on this point. If somebody passes away, data pertaining to them becomes readily available and if it is possible to disseminate that data everywhere that could be quite hurtful to the family and friends of the deceased. If somebody had a disease &ndash; for instance, AIDS &ndash; and they did not want it known, that data could be made available. I understand from the legislation that there are few controls in that regard. Making such data avail<Col N="315" />able could be quite hurtful to the family and to the good name of the deceased. We must ensure we protect the good name and privacy of deceased people, and this has come up in other contexts as well. A time limit could be imposed if the Minister of State so wishes, but it is an issue at which he should look again. I understand this issue is not included in the legislation, although it has been provided for under the directive.</P>
    <P>The original legislation and this Bill refer to direct marketing which is important from an economic viewpoint in that people may collect data on individuals and target them by post, telephone, e-mail or other methods. As far as I can see, direct marketing is not defined in the legislation, although it is defined in other jurisdictions. It might be useful to include a definition of &ldquo;direct marketing&rdquo; in the Bill, if it is not already in it.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, penalties for offences under the original legislation have not been increased or changed and perhaps the Minister of State might consider that. I take it the references to punts have been changed by another Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes mentioned information being held for some time by the financial institutions. I would like to instance a case where information on an individual was held by the Garda for some time. The individual was involved in an incident 12 years previously. He applied for and was awarded a job in a health board but had forgotten about the incident in which he was brought before the courts for a minor matter and given the Probation Act. After being awarded the job, he was told he could not be employed because he had not told the health board about the incident. Record of the incident was still in the system and when the health board checked with the Garda, it discovered the offence which was so minor the individual concerned had forgotten about it. Perhaps this is an area which needs to be examined, although I do not know whether it comes within the scope of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Controls on the transfer of data outside the State are welcome but I wonder how realistic it will be with the Internet. Will we be able to enforce those controls? There are also plans to monitor e-mails, web pages and so on. Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on that when summing up. How advanced is that proposal? What are the Government's plans in this regard? The EU has brought forward a directive in this area. Is it the State's intention to allow this to happen or are e-mails and web pages being monitored at the moment?</P>
    <P>I understand records of telephone bills and of telephone calls cannot be held after a certain period. Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify whether that is the case. Is there access to telephone bills or to records of telephone calls made and received?</P>
    <P>I note the Information Commissioner has made considerable efforts to inform people about the functions of his office but many people do not <Col N="316" />know their rights, and that is not the fault of the Information Commissioner. Radio and television advertising is necessary to inform people of their rights under this legislation in a simplified manner so that the lay person understands that they have rights, for example, to prevent information being processed under certain conditions and to access information being held on them. Most people do not realise they have those rights and it is important they are made known widely and constantly. Brochures and pamphlets are all very well but I do not believe people read them. A targeted radio and television campaign to inform people of their rights would go a long way to ensure this legislation meets its intended purpose.</P>
    <P>I mentioned manual data. Is there a time scale before that provision comes into force? Many small companies and individuals will have to get their act together in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to electoral activities. Politicians may put together databases for electoral purposes. This is an area of which we need to be careful. I hope that matter will be teased out further on Committee Stage because electoral purposes can cover many areas. The Bill states that the section does not apply to processing carried out by political parties or candidates for election to or holders of elected political office in the course of electoral activities. That is very broad and I suggest it be narrowed a little to perhaps the time the election takes place. Another speaker referred to the use of the electoral register which cannot be used for commercial purposes, although it can be used for political purposes.</P>
    <P>The Minister may negate many sections of the Bill by regulation. This is a matter about which I am always concerned, that is, when we include &ldquo;opt outs&rdquo; in legislation. The Bill refers to the right to object to processing data likely to cause damage or distress. The Minister can make regulations in such cases without reference to the House other than to lay the regulation before it. That is a matter about which I am a little concerned given that we seem to be moving away from accountability in the House. Ministers are increasingly taking powers to themselves to amend legislation by way of secondary legislation. We do not have effective mechanisms to examine secondary legislation which is being brought forward all the time. Ministers reply to parliamentary questions by telling Deputies to look up their web page or Internet site, as the Minister for Education and Science did recently. The Taoiseach has decided it is only worth coming into the Dáil for one and a half days per week. Ministers increasingly want to bring forward legislation outside the House and we wonder why &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; is on television so late at night and why people say the House is no longer relevant. This is a dangerous precedent.</P>
    <P>The other area I want to raise is genetic coding and testing. This is a whole new area whereby a person's genetic code can be held as data and possibly used. What safeguards are there to <Col N="317" />ensure people have rights in this area? Does the Bill give rights to individuals or do we require other legislation?</P>
    <P>I am not saying anyone should clone the Minister of State, God knows one is enough. Imagine, however, if somebody had the Minister of State's genetic code and discovered there was some genetic flaw in his make-up. I am not suggesting there is: I am sure he is perfect. What if the Minister of State, or whoever, was seeking alternative employment but this flaw in their genetic make-up was known to leave them susceptible to some form of disease? How sure are we that such information can be protected?</P>
    <P>Legislation of this nature is extremely complicated but it is also vitally important. It is very difficult for Deputies on the Opposition benches whose job it is to go through this legislation in detail and try to strengthen it by finding flaws and areas that could be improved. This is particularly so as it is amending an Act resulting from a convention. To fully understand this one must read the convention, read the original Act and then read this Bill and try to bring the whole lot together. For a Deputy on this side of the House to do that is extremely time consuming, yet we have zero resources to help us.</P>
    <P>A majority of Ministers welcome a proper, structured debate on Bills like this, especially on Committee Stage. If we want a House that is going to legislate properly, however, and if we on this side are to debate in a positive and constructive way with Ministers, we must have resources in order to study the issues and find out exactly what the legislation means in certain areas. We lag behind other countries in bringing this legislation before the House, but I wish the Bill well in its passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to admit that I have not fully studied the Bill but I have listened to some of the contributions. It is important to express a few anxieties I have regarding data generally, and some of my wishes also because there are also benefits in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot help thinking about the doctor-on-call system. I know that may sound like a health issue but it is very important in a constituency like mine at present, and I am sure the system will spread to other areas. One of the most frequently expressed anxieties of those who have to use this system is that a strange doctor visiting them does not have the background information he might need on the patient concerned. Those on medical cards in particular may not, for various reasons, have as much information available to a doctor on call. It should be possible for doctors to have that basic information stored on a laptop computer so that patients could be assured they would not be given any medicine or treatment that would have adverse effects. I have some reservations about the existence of too much data, which I will come to later. However, there are areas such as this where information could be of great value. It could save lives and it would cer<Col N="318" />tainly leave patients more at ease if the strange visiting doctor could refer to their medical records.</P>
    <P>Another matter raised on the Order of Business this morning concerned the amount of information available on education. I was very frustrated last night with the replies I received to my questions on education. I was informed that all I or my secretary had to do was connect to the Department of Education and Science website to obtain the information I required on a school in the far end of County Monaghan. This House is losing the run of itself if a Minister is not answerable to it. The type of answer we would get through a computer is one that the teachers or pupils of that school could get for themselves. As elected Members we are surely entitled to more, to the background information and to some direct answers to the questions we actually ask. This is particularly the case with the current Minister for Education and Science. He is the one who would very quickly accuse us of localism and of not having a broader remit as elected representatives whenever we raise matters regarding our own constituencies. Yet he has taken the broader remit from us by telling us we are merely entitled to the same information as any other individual that can connect to a computer.</P>
    <P>I hope that what the Ceann Comhairle promised this morning will materialise and that we get proper answers to the specific issues we raise with the Minister regarding the future of the next generation. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, was a great advocate of education and its needs, and we freely admit that probably the greatest ever advocate of free education was from the constituency and party of the Minister of State. For the current Minister to remove that promise, however, absolutely downgrades this House. Many other Members feel this way, including possibly those in the Technical Group in the Minister of State's party, headed by Deputy Lenihan. It is great to see there are technical groups on both sides of the House. This matter must be rectified and clarified.</P>
    <P>Another area of data that causes me problems is the computer system in the Department of Agriculture and Food. Different sets of computers exist throughout the country that do not seem to be interlinked. While it is very important that farmers are paid through a computer system as quickly as possible, the computers involved do not link up, for whatever reason, and anybody who falls through the system will find themselves going for months without payment through no fault of the individual farmer.</P>
    <P>The farmer is told that the computers are down or that they are not compatible. The only thing a farmer, 65 or 70 years of age, living on a small holding who may not have seen a computer wants is a cheque in his hand. It is vital that the problem is cleared up once and for all.</P>
    <P>I do not apologise for putting on record the story of an aged farmer with seven cows living in a mobile home. Through a fault in the infor<Col N="319" />mation fed into a computer one of his animals that never left his farm was recorded as being dead. Although the agricultural officers visited the farm and were satisfied that everything was correct, that was unacceptable. The veterinary surgeons visited the farm, and that was acceptable. It took from January to June before the matter got to the office in Kildare Street. The office in Kildare Street had trouble getting it to Portlaoise. Eventually I traced it through to Portlaoise, in a file, not having been put into the computer so there was no way the farmer could have been paid. That gives the computer system a bad name. There was carelessness somewhere along the line and it was the farmer who had to pay for it. I cannot understand how, for example, at the ploughing championships a computer based system with all the data available throughout the country could be set up in the middle of a field at a few days notice and yet that same system cannot be in my home town of Ballybay, serving County Monaghan, or in the Minister of State's home town of Limerick. Consequently, the people have to get on the telephone and speak to a person using a computer at his or her desk.</P>
    <P>During the foot and mouth outbreak computers and databases were set up in a parochial hall in Clontibret where anyone, including local farmers, could view their area aid forms. That is how the system should work. Two years later, although the Minister promised the problem would be sorted, nothing has been done at the DVO offices. If that were done it would take much pressure off older and less educated farmers while they or their agents could go to the office and sort out the problems in a matter of minutes. If we are to move forward with computer databases they have to be used properly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stanton spoke about direct marketing. Obviously it is a useful tool but it is often abused. It is sometimes difficult to know from where firms or companies get the names and e-mail addresses. I am aware of an aged couple who were receiving highfalutin information and were told when they had to sign the letters, return them and so on. It took months before I succeeded in getting their names wiped off the computer system. That couple thought their small farm would be taken over by this large company which did not have a clue about them. Somehow their names got on a database. Great care is needed in this area. I hope the Bill will go some way towards meeting that concern.</P>
    <P>Another issue raised was that of the danger of information being on databases for employment purposes. Young people are subject to that as their PPS numbers are on a database. A few years ago I met a very able young man, six foot plus, who desperately wanted to join the Garda Síochána. I know the family well; they have been involved with the forces of this country for generations. The only thing I could discover, which was by accident, was that at some stage this young man was in a pub on a night it was raided. He did <Col N="320" />not get the job. By the time we had traced the problem he had passed the age for entry to the Garda Síochána. We have to be careful about the information stored on databases.</P>
    <P>I heard another story on radio and I do not believe the radio programme in question would have brought on the individual unless the case was properly researched. A lady explained how she and her husband got into debt. As a result her family could not get credit cards and so on, yet a person coming to this country from God knows where can literally get a credit card immediately. If the information on the radio was correct, information on a database prevented that family from getting their entitlement and due process. If that is the case I would have serious concerns.</P>
    <P>I have a certain view on drugs, drink and all that goes with them. As one of the few who opposed the extension of the pub licensing hours I hope there will soon be an opportunity to debate that issue.</P>
    <P>Another issue raised was the material than can be downloaded from computers such as pornography which cannot be traced. Anything we can do to prevent this getting into the hands of young people must be done. In the past people did not want their sons or daughters to watch television in case they got wrong ideas on sex. Earlier in the week we discussed the issue of abuse and all that goes with it. Everything we can do to curtail the pornographic structures within the Internet should be done. We live in a global economy but as an independent nation there is an onus on us to do what we can to ensure it is traced and dealt with. We must be careful not to leave ourselves open to accusations by the younger generation when they get older that we as the leaders, at whatever level, have failed them and allowed them access to material that was not to their benefit.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I wanted to speak on this issue was because of the malicious material that can be put on computer and sent by e-mail without any signature or traceability. I have been the victim of some of this scurrilous activity which had to do with civic issues in my constituency. As a politician I was not too worried &ndash; most of us have reasonably broad backs. It is a serious matter so far as personnel within organisations have no right to reply and are not in a position to reply. We must do whatever we can to ensure those who put untrue and malicious information on e-mails and the Internet are dealt with. I hope that in this Bill, or amendments made to it, we will ensure that we, as a nation, have control over it and that it is dealt with.</P>
    <P>To return to the positive aspects, these databases are a valuable asset particularly in the areas of social welfare, pension payments, etc. One has immediate access to those who have been put on databases in recent years and in unfortunate cases involving a widow or widower, their situation can be dealt with relatively quickly. When dealing with queries from those who are now in their pen<Col N="321" />sion years and who worked under the older systems, their records are difficult to find and in many cases, because of the extraordinary level of emigration to the United Kingdom in particular where, under EU laws, the pensions are compatible, one can only get the information through addresses, factory names, etc. That problem highlights the value of quick access and availability but it angers some people on these databases who have lived here all their lives in permanent addresses and who have paid their taxes but who have been found out to have a small English pension, which can be traced, when they see other people coming here for whatever reason, and I am not decrying the fact that they come here, and being well looked after socially while their position is questioned. We have to deal with these issues on a compassionate level and ensure that they are workable.</P>
    <P>I have not studied the Bill to the extent that others in my party have done &ndash; there is an onus on them to do that &ndash; but I just want to make some comments on the structures generally and to urge that everything possible is done to ensure that the rights of the person are upheld and that this information is not made freely available to somebody at the press of a button. I am aware there is some looseness in the area because, for whatever reason, I discovered that I am on a number of computer lists which have been made available without my consent and I get letters from different companies and organisations as a result.</P>
    <P>On the issue of politics, I was astounded recently to find out that we now have access to the list of names of all those who did or did not vote in the last election, although I admit I have used it at the request of one of my constituents. All I had to do was pay a small sum of money and the list was sent to me, although I have not yet had time to examine it, but it is a worrying development that so much information can be made freely available.</P>
    <P>I want to refer finally to an issue involving a butcher who had a visit from an official from the Department of Agriculture and Food, who behaved in a very aggressive way, because of some information given to the Department that is not traceable. Regardless of who provided that information, the butcher was proved to be 100% correct but it caused great anxiety to his family and his business. If a Department is to act on any information in that way, the person who is aggrieved must have a right to that information. A Department does not have the right to act on an anonymous call and deal with it in that context. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the legislation before the House although by its very nature this legislation, which involves the IT sector, will probably be obsolete by the time it is enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of election lists raised by Deputy Crawford, who has left the House, since the <Col N="322" />foundation of the State it has been the practice of our party and some of the other parties to keep a note of who does and does not vote in elections. Those lists were not brought about by the advent of computerisation; they have been available for over 50 years. With the new computerisation voting system, I understand from the former Minister for the Environment that there is no question that the manner in which individuals vote will be on any record, other than the sum of votes in particular polling booths.</P>
    <P>The speed at which data are now processed by computers means that a special committee of this House could sit on a permanent basis to update and review legislation in this area. As every Member will be aware, data stored on computers here are available, to a large extent, internationally as well. That mobility is beneficial to those who must be in a position to use this facility but there is a genuine fear that the possible erosion of privacy and other rights will be brought into question. That is the main concern of individuals in the State.</P>
    <P>It is prudent that the Government should bring forward a set of safeguards and enshrine them in law to protect the interests of individuals while at the same time facilitate the processing of personal data for what must be legitimate use. The Bill before us today proposes to amend the Data Protection Act, 1988, which was enacted to give effect to the Council of Europe 1981 Data Protection Convention. The Minster has also taken the opportunity to improve the 1988 Act in some ways and I am pleased he has done that.</P>
    <P>The 1988 legislation provided for the establishment of a supervisory authority which will set out codes of conduct. It is important to acknowledge the interests of various sectors of our community which have made submissions and representations identifying improvements and possible ways of amending the Bill in order to improve it, and I was pleased to hear the Minister say that he will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage. This House should examine the possibility of updating legislation in the IT area on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>We have all benefited from the ongoing improvements in IT but in Departments we have seen examples of everybody's lives being made easier by the ongoing use of computerisation. Members of this House will be aware that it is far easier now to access information on constituents' queries, particularly in the Department of Social and Family Affairs where a mere telephone call can elicit information requested by a Deputy or a councillor. That is beneficial not just to the Members of the Oireachtas but also to the constituents who have genuine concerns or queries about payments or other problems.</P>
    <P>In terms of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with the use of computers we have seen significant improvements in the way the gardaí go about their daily business. One of the great strides forward is in identifying stolen <Col N="323" />cars and solving other problems before they arise. The gardaí can put information on computer which is then passed on to patrol cars which can look out for particular criminals in certain areas. This is just a personal observation, but I am concerned about the possible overuse of computerisation in areas such as local government. We may have gone a little overboard in local government and also in the health boards. On asking some officials about this, I was informed that because of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997 officers of local authorities and health boards must be very careful about the records they keep. It is important to note that this does not come cheaply. There is great expense involved in keeping such records for accountability purposes. We live in a particularly litigious society and there is always the possibility of an action being taken against an individual or a local authority. This is why they must keep their records up to date and be able to stand over them.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers have spoken of the amount of information available over the Internet. It is a concern of mine that it may not be properly policed. Perhaps the Minister could consider encouraging international policing of the Internet. Very few houses and people in the country do not have Internet access at the moment.</P>
    <P>More people are becoming concerned about the amount of personal data being stored by Departments, commercial organisations and individuals. In this Bill personal data is defined as &ldquo;data relating to a living individual who is or can be identified either from the data or from the data in conjunction with other information that is in, or is likely to come into, the possession of the data controller&rdquo;. It is fair to say that there is personal information out there on file about most people in the State. As previous speakers have said, the banks in particular have huge amounts of data on individuals. One wonders to what use this is being put. In most cases it is being put to good use, but a question was raised during a recent radio programme on which people talked about their lack of success in getting financial facilities from a bank because of the track record of their parents. This is not fair to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>I was speaking to a person recently about the success of the euro and he told me that five years ago he was able to travel to six countries in Europe and then to the USA, when there was no common currency, with only his credit card. He had absolutely no difficulty in getting funding in the various countries he visited. It is clear that the advances made in the IT sector have positive aspects and, on balance, are mostly advantageous, but we must be mindful of the speed at which these advances are taking place. As a legislative body, we should be updating our legislation on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on his proposal to introduce the new subsection 4(13), not related to the EU directive, whereby safeguards on the <Col N="324" />provision of data are provided in relation to a person's recruitment or continued employment. This is a positive move. My one plea to the Minister is to have a system which would allow him to update the legislation in this area continually.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies for their contributions and for the many interesting and thoughtful points raised during the debate. I will try to respond to some of them now, although many of them are more appropriate to Committee Stage. I agree with those Deputies who adverted to the fact that the Bill is in very technical language. It only takes a glance at it to realise that. People also said there was not much light to be found in the explanatory memorandum and I am inclined to agree. I suggest that in future, for extremely technical legislation such as this, the explanatory memorandum should contain a number of examples of how the Bill would operate in practice. This legislation is being introduced as a result of an EU directive which obliges Ireland to bring its law on protection and dissemination of data into line with other EU countries.</P>
      <P>This is an amending Bill and must be read in conjunction with the Act it seeks to amend, that is, the Data Protection Act, 1988. This Act regulates the processing of personal data of data subjects, i.e. individuals who are the subject of personal data. It does not protect data relating to companies or other entities. The rights already enshrined in the 1988 Act are as follows: in section 3, the right to establish the existence of personal data and to be provided with a description of the data and the purpose for which it is kept; in section 4, the right of access to personal data; in section 6, the right to have personal data rectified or, where appropriate, erased; and the right to have personal data removed from direct mailing or marketing lists under section 2. The Bill before us proposes to supplement these rights as follows: in section 6, it includes an additional right to have personal data blocked, i.e. marked in such a way that it is not possible to process it for purposes in relation to which it is marked; and, in addition, the right to object to processing that is likely to cause damage or distress to the data's subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Deputies mentioned CCTV cameras and their potential impact on personal privacy. The purpose of CCTV systems operated by the Garda Síochána is to maintain public order and safety and to assist in crime prevention and detection. Experience to date indicates that the installation of such systems has been welcomed and they are not regarded as an invasion of privacy. People feel safer as a result of the installation of these systems. A system of grants for community-based CCTV has recently been established and in order to ensure compliance with data protection standards, grants will only be approved for schemes that comply with a detailed code of practice developed in consultation with the Data Pro<Col N="325" />tection Commissioner. The code deals with practical matters including the location of cameras. Clearly visible signs should be in place so that members of the public are aware that they are in a zone monitored by CCTV. Signs should also indicate the identity of the responsible person or organisation and contain contact details.</P>
    <P>Deputies Rabbitte, O'Dowd, Healy and Crawford made reference to information required by law to be made available to the public and to the use of the electoral register for non-electoral purposes. The Data Protection Act, 1988, does not apply to information that the person keeping the data is required by law to make available to the public. Such data includes electoral registers. Concerns have been expressed over the years about the use of such public domain data for purposes such as direct marketing and I understand that this has been the subject of numerous complaints to the Data Protection Commissioner. For this reason it was decided to amend the 1988 Act in order to make it clear that where such data was processed for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was collected, the exemption would no longer apply.</P>
    <P>Following discussion of this Bill in the Seanad it became apparent that this new provision might have unintended consequences. For example, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment expressed concerns about the possible impact of the proposed wording on the use of personal data, held by the Companies Registration Office, by a third party for a legitimate purpose. In order to avoid such consequences I am reflecting on whether the proposed provision is essential, keeping two factors in mind. Firstly, we are proposing elsewhere in the Bill, in section 3, to strengthen the provisions relating to direct marketing and this will address the use of registers for direct marketing purposes. Secondly, Deputies will be aware &ndash; Deputy O'Dowd mentioned this &ndash; that the provisions of the Electoral Act, 1992, as amended, empower registration authorities to prepare and publish what is called an edited supplement, which omits the names and addresses of registered electors or electors on whose behalf requests had been made that their details should not be used for a purpose other than the electoral or statutory purpose. As I indicated earlier, I am considering the possibility of introducing an amendment on Committee Stage to address the difficulties that have been brought to our attention in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte inquired about the consultation process engaged in prior to the publication of this Bill. A detailed consultation paper was widely circulated in 1997 to a broad range of organisations. A significant number of responses was received up to mid-1998. The subsequent drafting process required extensive consultation with the office of the Attorney General, Departments and the office of the Data Protection Commissioner.</P>
    <P>Regarding transposition of the directive into national law, several countries have experienced <Col N="326" />difficulties in this regard. Like Ireland, France has yet to complete the transposition of the directive. While Luxembourg has enacted legislation, it appears it is not due to come into effect there until next year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stanton mentioned the absence of the definition of direct marketing. Direct marketing is covered under the 1988 Act. Our attention has not been drawn to any difficulties in that regard. In regard to the Deputy's remark concerning political activity and political parties, with a view to safeguarding essential features of our democratic system of elections several provisions in the Bill refer to the processing of personal data by political parties or candidates for electoral office. An exemption to the processing of sensitive personal data is made in the new section 2(<i>b</i>)(ix) inserted in the 1988 Act where the processing is carried out for political parties or candidates for election to, or holders of elective office, for the purpose of compiling data on people's political opinions, subject to compliance with any prescribed requirements. In addition, the right of data subject to objective processing likely to cause damage and distress does not apply to processing carried out by political parties or candidates for election to, or holders of elective political office, in the course of electoral activities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring raised the issue of child pornography and the Internet. This poses significant legislative and law enforcement challenges worldwide. International co-operation is a key to progress in this area as such co-operation is ongoing in the areas of law enforcement, policy development and international agreements. Our signing of the Council of Europe Convention on Cyber Crime is an example of one of the recent initiatives in international co-operation which will help to address child pornography issues. While the nature of the Internet demands a co-operative approach, it is important to streamline our national laws and structures in order to maximise our contribution to the fight against child pornography. Following the publication by my Department in 1988 of the report of the working group on the illegal and harmful use of the Internet, a number of child pornography initiatives were established.</P>
    <P>On the point raised by Deputy Ring in regard to credit institutions storing data, there is a central database stored by the major credit institutions containing factual information on people's credit history. One can access his or her credit details on this database by making an access request under the 1988 Act. I understand that an individual can add details to his or her credit reference file, giving people an opportunity to explain various details about their credit rating.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crawford referred to the question of processing health data, including access to the data. This will be permitted under the proposed new section 2(<i>b</i>) where it is necessary to prevent injury or damage to the health of a person.</P>
    <P>On the issue raised by Deputy Ó Snodaigh and others in regard to the definition of sensitive per<Col N="327" />sonal data, the definition is set out in the EU directive. This includes, for example, data in relation to a person's racial or ethnic origin as well as their political opinions and religious beliefs. Data in regard to trade union membership, physical and mental health and the commission of offences also come under this heading. It is important to point out that we are working on the definition in the EU directive and we cannot go beyond that.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner was established under the 1988 Act to perform a range of investigative and enforcement functions set out in that Act. The commissioner's annual report for the year 2000 not only gives informative accounts of activities undertaken during the year in question but contains valuable guiding notes and good data protection practices. The commissioner's website contains useful information and advice on data protection law and good practice.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned data protection, which I agree is a crucial issue. The 1988 Act already provides that appropriate security measures should be taken against unauthorised access to, or alteration, disclosure or destruction of, the data and against their accidental loss or destruction. It also provides that data controllers and data processors owe a duty of care to data subjects. The Bill before us strengthens these provisions by means of the new article 2(<i>c</i>) which deals specifically with security requirements for personal data.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies, including Deputies Deasy, Rabbitte and Healy referred to the risk arising from transfer of personal data to countries without adequate data protection standards, which is important. The general position is that transfers of personal data to a destination outside the EEA may not take place unless an adequate level of data protection is in place. However, data may be transferred to a destination outside the EEA if an adequate level of protection is deemed to exist. Switzerland, Hungary and Canada have data protection regimes to satisfy European Community requirements and have been formally recognised in European Commission decisions. A problem arises, however, in regard to countries such as the United States where there is no comprehensive approach to data protection and where the approach to data protection is very different from that pursued in Europe. There is a strong tendency in the US to believe that market incentives and privacy enhancing technologies will be sufficient to protect privacy. By contrast, on this side of the Atlantic countries have enacted comprehensive data protection law to give effect, first, to the Council of Europe's 1981 Data Protection Convention and, more recently, to the EU directive. This disparity of approach between the US and EU is a matter of great concern to us, given the extent of our commercial trade and other links with the US. The agreement reached between both sides under the safe harbour priv<Col N="328" />acy principles and given legal effect in a Commission decision in July 2000 is, therefore, of considerable importance. The safe harbour agreement is based on a set of data protection principles to which bodies in the US can voluntarily sign up and which guarantee adequate protection for personal data supplied to them.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the issue of the passing of personal data to other bodies. According to the onward transfer principle, data may not be passed by a body that has signed up to the safe harbour principles to a third party unless that party is subject to an EU directive, has signed up to the principles or enters a written agreement providing a level of protection equivalent to the principles. The United States Department of Commerce website contains a number of organisations, currently 250, which have signed up to the safe harbour principles. For the purpose of data transfers to other destinations, standard contractual clauses have been jointly developed by the European Commission and the member states in order to provide an adequate level of protection. If these are considered unsuitable for certain transactions, transfers may be made under terms specifically approved by the Data Protection Commissioner who currently has, and under the Bill will retain, the power to transfer a personal data to a destination outside the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory and others referred to e-commerce and the information society. It is clear from the growth of e-commerce in recent years that many consumers are buying goods and services over the Internet. Businesses have also been choosing to buy services in the same way. A certain amount of personal data would be inevitably collected in the course of such transaction, such as registration details, including name and address. There is a risk that this could be used for other purposes without the knowledge or consent of the data subject. For this reason the Data Protection Commissioner made regulations last year requiring all Internet access providers to register with his office. Any company that operates a website is also likely to be a data controller for the purposes of data protection and will need to register. The registration process requires data controllers to indicate the nature and extent of their processing operations. This safeguard will help to build confidence in e-commerce and encourage consumers to avail of the on-line services that are now emerging.</P>
    <P>In regard to information policy developments generally, Deputies will be aware that the Taoiseach announced late last year the appointment of a new information society commission. It is chaired by Dr. Danny O'Hare, former President of DCU, and has a key role to play in shaping the evolving public policy framework in this area. I should also say in the current context that an interdepartmental group on legislative issues for the information society, including representatives of relevant Departments and offices, has also been established. This reflects the importance the <Col N="329" />Government attaches to information society related issues.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the advances in e-mail and Internet technologies that have taken place in recent years. These developments are advantageous in many ways but there are also drawbacks. Several Deputies, including Deputies Deasy and O'Dowd, spoke about the problem of unsolicited communications. The former Minister for Public Enterprise made regulations last May to give effect to the EU Directive 97/66 on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector. The European Communities data protection and privacy in telecommunications regulations 2002 prohibit unsolicited telephone calls or faxes for the purposes of direct marketing to subscribers who have indicated that they do not wish to receive such communication.</P>
    <P>This option has been facilitated by the establishment of an appropriate national database in which subscribers can register their wishes. With regard to directory information, subscribers now have the possibility of indicating that they do not wish to have their personal information used for purposes of direct marketing and that they do not wish to receive direct marketing calls of faxes. Subscribers can request this opt-out from their service provider. Moreover, the additional consent of subscribers is required for automated direct marketing calls. The Data Protection Commissioner and the Director of Telecommunication Regulations are responsible for the monitoring and enforcement of these regulations.</P>
    <P>A further directive dealing with the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector was agreed in June. This new directive replaces the 1997 directive and the regulations which transpose that directive will be made in due course by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. They will also address the issue of unsolicited electronic mail, text messages, etc. The net effect of these measures together with the provisions in the Bill is that there will be a comprehensive set of legal rights available to people in relation to unwanted e-mail and other forms of communication. I admit that solving the problem of unwanted communications on a national level is difficult by its very nature, given the global nature of the Internet and telecommunication technologies.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dowd's suggestion that international instruments may be required in this area is worthy of further consideration. I share the Deputy's regret at the closing of smaller banks in rural towns and the loss of personal contact which this will inevitably entail. That is strictly outside the ambit of this legislation. I have also noted his other point on bank customers and pressure but that is outside the ambit of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan mentioned the possibility of having to revisit the directive itself. The position is that the European Commission has undertaken a review of the operation of the directive across <Col N="330" />the member states and will present a report in due course. It will then consider what further community action, if any, is needed. The Commission has already indicated that it is aware of a number of concerns about the operation and implementation of the directive and may decide to address these in the context of future action. It is unlikely that the Commission will propose any significant reform of the directive in the short-term. Moreover, any medium term proposals would take several years to negotiate into an act at member state level.</P>
    <P>This is not just a piece of technical legislation but a Bill which aims to establish an appropriate balance between potentially conflicting policy objectives and rights. We have to ensure that personal data is not used for purposes for which it was never intended, while at the same time encouraging e-commerce and facilitating international trade. We must reconcile personal privacy requirements with a need for historical research, statistical information and scientific discovery. We must also protect personal privacy while recognising the special importance of the public interest in freedom of expression. In the information society in which we now live huge quantities of data, including personal data, can be stored and processed with an ease which was unimaginable a few years ago.  </P>
    <P>The information age brings many benefits in its wake, including possibilities for improved communications and services. There are also obvious risks. We must address legitimate concerns to reap the full benefit of these new possibilities. I believe the additional safeguards in this Bill will further enhance confidence in e-commerce and e-government for the benefit of consumers and citizens. I again thank Deputies for their contributions and for raising very important issues. We will return to those on Committee Stage. I appreciate hearing the Deputies' views on the subject which we all agree affects every one of us in our daily lives. I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I will continue from where I finished last Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Bill extends Irish civil law jurisdiction to the matters covered by the convention and protocol so that parties here, including the State, can invoke the convention in Irish courts in claiming compensation under it, in the first instance, from the ship owner and, in the final analysis, from an international fund operated by IMO and funded by a levy on imports of the materials in question into states which are party to the convention.</P>
      <P>A ship owner may limit his or her liability to the amount prescribed in the convention and fire-proof his or her vessel against arrest by lodging security for that amount with the court. This amount varies according to the tonnage of the vessel but is in any event limited to about &euro;140 million. Up to &euro;350 million compensation is available in all under the proposed arrangements in respect of any one incident.</P>
      <P>The two-tier compensation arrangement mirrors that which applies to oil pollution. As with oil, contributions to the international fund are to be made by those who import the substances in question. On the basis of available information it is not expected that contributions from Irish importers to the fund will be significant.</P>
      <P>The Bill is essentially technical in nature. The definitions and descriptions set out in the convention were agreed and adopted following consideration by experts at the International Maritime Organisation.</P>
      <P>Deputies will note that for ease of reference a copy of the HNS convention is set out in Schedule 1 and the LLMC in Schedule 2 of the Bill. It must be viewed, however, in the context of the legislative and other measures which have been introduced in the past 15 or so years and in particular since 1997.</P>
      <P>The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has adopted as a strategic goal the protection and preservation of the marine environment. Central to this strategy is the protection of the overall marine ecosystem, the maintenance of the highest standards in the quality of our marine waters, the prevention of pollution at sea around our coasts and the provision of a rapid response to pollution incidents to minimise damage.</P>
      <P>The Government is anxious that our legislation complies with accepted EU and international standards while addressing specific Irish concerns. The Government accordingly recognises that action at EU and international level is an essential element of any strategy for the protection of the marine environment and to that end continues to participate fully in the activities of relevant organisations, including the International Maritime Organisation, the OSPAR Commission and the Bonn Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 1997 four sets of regulations were made under the Sea Pollution Act, 1991 to give effect to provisions of the IMO convention for <Col N="332" />the prevention of pollution from ships. Work is under way to adopt further provisions of MARPOL concerning the prevention of pollution by sewage from ships and the prevention of air pollution from ships.</P>
    <P>The Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment) Act, 1998, was enacted in May 1998. The Act &ndash; one of those to which I referred earlier &ndash; strengthens the law in relation to oil pollution by bringing it in line with current international conventions. As with many other instruments relating to maritime safety and the marine environment, these conventions are currently the subject of discussion and assessment at EU and international level in the wake of the Erika incident which occurred off the coast of Brittany in December 1999.</P>
    <P>Measures have been agreed or are under consideration in relation to the regulation of ship classification societies, the accelerated phasing-out of single-hull oil tankers, the strengthening of port state control measures and ship reporting arrangements. Work on preparing a Bill to give effect to internationally agreed compensation levels for victims of oil pollution incidents is well advanced.</P>
    <P>Building on the arrangements adopted in respect of oil tankers and vessels carrying hazardous substances, a convention was adopted at international level in relation to civil liability in respect of pollution from spills of bunker oil &ndash; oil carried other than as cargo. Work on a Bill to give effect to this convention is proceeding.</P>
    <P>The Sea Pollution (Amendment) Act, 1999 was enacted in June 1999. The Act gives effect in Irish law to the International Maritime Organisation's Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation Convention. Arrangements are in train to formally accede to the convention. The Act provides for the preparation of oil pollution emergency plans by harbour authorities, operators of offshore installations and oil handling facilities and for their submission to the Minister for approval. It also provides that the Minister may direct a local authority to prepare and submit such a plan for approval.</P>
    <P>The IMO in March 2000 adopted a protocol to OPRC providing for response measures similar to those for oil pollution to apply in respect of HNS. Work on a Bill which includes giving effect to the protocol is also at an advanced stage. The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic, came into force internationally in March 1998 following ratification by all of the contracting parties. A major assessment of the status of the marine environment of the whole north-east Atlantic was carried out by OSPAR and published in December 2000. The quality status report &ndash; QSR &ndash; describes the main impacts of human activities on the marine environment and evaluates the effectiveness of measures that have already been implemented to tackle those impacts. The publication of the report follows assessments which were carried out at national and regional levels in <Col N="333" />the past two years. For this purpose the OSPAR area was divided into five regions. Ireland and the UK were responsible in respect of preparing assessment for region III, known as the Celtic Seas region. In the first instance Ireland prepared its own QSR. This involved several Departments and agencies and was published by the Marine Institute in 1999. The second stage involved a joint UK - Ireland QSR for the region. The final stage of the process involved fusion of all five regional reports into a single QSR for the entire area.</P>
    <P>The assessment found that the Irish marine environment was generally in a healthy state but that there was no room for complacency; that particular attention would need to be paid to the scale of coastal development, pollution from rivers, sewage disposal and the atmosphere. My colleagues in Government and I share the concerns of many of our citizens at the continued operation of the nuclear facility at Sellafield in the north-west of England. These concerns were most recently brought into focus by the recent shipment of materials from Japan to Sellafield.</P>
    <P>My opinion, and that of Government on this issue is clear &ndash; we oppose the very existence of the Sellafield facility and the transportation of its radioactive material through the Irish sea. The continued existence of Sellafield and the use of the Irish Sea by BNFL as a nuclear fuel highway is a threat to the well being of the Irish people. It must be shut because of its safety history and because of the historic lack of transparency with regard to accidents and operations at the complex. Regarding the recent shipment of MOX fuel pellets from Japan, my main concerns, which were brought to the attention of the UK Authorities by my Department were to ensure that the vessels did not pass through Irish waters, to ensure that the highest possible levels of safety were applied both in terms of the vessels employed and the operational requirements applied to them. Arrangements are in place with both the UK and France that Ireland will be notified in advance of shipment dates, of the nature of cargoes and all other relevant details. My Department was notified in accordance with these arrangements in advance of the recent shipment.</P>
    <P>The Government has the capability to respond to any incident and was aware of the vessels' location once they entered the Irish Sea. I am pleased to confirm that the vessels did not enter waters under Ireland's jurisdiction. With regard to future shipments, the question of imposing a ban on the passage of ships carrying nuclear materials remains very difficult, given the right of passage enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. However, the Government will continue to pursue all legal routes to address a number of concerns with regard to Sellafield and shipments, will press in all international fora, for the application of the highest possible standards to the vessels and casks used in the shipments, and ensure that all neces<Col N="334" />sary protections of preparedness, response and co-operation are in place should an accident or incident occur.</P>
    <P>In respect of the MOX plant, we are currently suing the United Kingdom under both the OSPAR convention and the UNCLOS convention. The case under the OSPAR convention is before an international arbitration tribunal sitting in The Hague this week. We expect the case to last for the rest of the week. The judgment is expected in a few months time. We are attempting to obtain reports from the British concerning the economic justification of the MOX plant. The UK authorities have deleted important information from the publicly released versions of these reports. We want the unabridged versions so that we can gauge the impact or likely impact of the MOX facility on the Irish Sea and objectively assess the UK justification of the MOX facility. The bottom line is that, if MOX is justifiable, why will the UK not provide this information? Of what is it scared?</P>
    <P>The other case &ndash; which is being brought under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS, concerns alleged UK breaches of the Convention in relation to MOX. The Government is using every forum and means open to it to shut MOX and the reprocessing facility at Sellafield. We will continue to do so until the nuclear complex is made safe, permanently.</P>
    <P>The report of the task force on the dumping of radioactive materials in the maritime area was published in January 2000. The key conclusion of the report was that the risk to human health and to marine life from past radioactive dumping is extremely low and does not constitute a health hazard. The Government shares the concerns of many members of the public in this regard and is anxious that they should be allayed as far as possible. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, together with the universities, is continuing monitoring and other work in this sphere. In December 2000, the European Union adopted a directive on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues. The purpose of the directive is to improve the availability and use of port reception facilities for such waste. Regulations are being prepared as required by the EU to give effect to the directive in Irish law by December 2002 and to have arrangements made for implementation.</P>
    <P>Returning to the Bill now before us, a diplomatic conference, convened by the IMO, adopted the HNS convention in May 1996. The Convention has not yet entered into force. It will not enter into force until 18 months after both of the following criteria have been fulfilled. First, at least 12 states must have expressed their consent to be bound by the convention, typically through ratification or accession &ndash; this must include four states, each with a registered fleet of at least two million units of gross tonnage &ndash; more than ten times the size of the Irish fleet. Second, contributors in the states that have ratified or acceded to the convention must, between them, receive a <Col N="335" />minimum of 40 million tonnes of contributing cargo covered by the general account.</P>
    <P>Periodically, informal meetings have been held to discuss the implementation of the HNS convention. States attending these meetings agreed that it would be desirable to co-ordinate their ratification of the convention. EU member states at the transport council in December 2000 undertook to prepare the necessary legislation in this regard as soon as possible. I am committed to meeting this undertaking, not least to ensure, in view of the importance of our marine resource, that Ireland is in a position to benefit from the terms of the convention as soon as it comes into force. As has been emphasised in the recent studies to which I have referred, there is no room for complacency as far as the protection of the marine environment is concerned. We must continue to build on our achievements in order to get the full benefit of the measures we have introduced.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before us is an important part of the process of advancement undertaken at national, EU and international level in order to protect the quality of the marine environment. I know that Deputies from all parties share this objective and I accordingly look forward to your comments. In the meantime I will conclude by strongly recommending this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>The Sea Pollution (Hazardous and Noxious Substances) (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill, 2000 is a mouthful in itself to say and it is technical legislation, as the Minister of State has pointed out, but it is also important for the Irish maritime sector and for the shipping industry. The Bill gives effect to the 1996 international convention on liability and compensation for damage associated with the carriage of hazardous and noxious substances by sea &ndash; more easily referred to as the HNS convention. The Bill also allows the taking of effect of the 1996 protocol to the 1976 international convention on the limitation of liability for maritime claims &ndash; LLMC. The HNS convention complements existing arrangements, in place since 1969, regarding civil liability and compensation in relation to oil pollution. The Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts, 1988-1998 gave effect in Irish law to those international arrangements whereby limits were established for ship owners' liability and an international compensation fund was set up to pay the costs of damages caused by oil pollution from bulk tankers. The basic terms were that the ship owner would pay up to a certain limit, depending on the tonnage of the ship concerned, and the balance would be met by the compensation fund &ndash; made up from the contributions from importers of substantial quantities of oil. <Col N="336" />The HNS convention we are seeking to put into Irish law will do roughly the same for hazardous and noxious substances being transported by sea as the Oil Pollution of the Sea Bill has achieved in the past.</P>
      <P>At first glance this looks like long and complicated legislation but much of the Bill's content is taken up by the printing of the international convention itself. Only the first 18 pages of the Bill deal with implementation under Irish law. We will have the opportunity to go into detail on Committee Stage so I will discuss its importance in more general terms. However, before we move to Committee Stage, the Minister's title needs to be changed to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
      <P>Ireland is an island nation heavily dependent on trade for its existence. Many of the bulk imports and exports of the country are transported by sea. This trade includes hazardous and noxious substances. I come from one of the largest ports in the country, one which deals with these substances on a regular basis, as Cork is the home of one of Europe's largest chemical industries. In the HNS convention, as outlined, hazardous and noxious substances are defined under clear headings, for example, oil carried in bulk, noxious liquid substances, dangerous liquids, liquified gases, liquid substances with a flash point exceeding 60º Celsius, solid bulk materials possessing chemical hazards, residues from previously carried substances, etc. It does not include radioactive materials and I will return to that issue later. For those concerned about radioactive materials, they are covered under the Sea Pollution Acts, 1991 to 1999, as the Minister pointed out.</P>
      <P>Let us be clear about the issue of hazardous and noxious substances. Ireland has responsibility for 240,000 square miles of sea. That is roughly 17% of European waters. We are responsible for more waters than any other European country. We are an island close to commercial traffic and shipping lanes. Irish waters are used on a daily basis by merchant shipping, the majority of which merely passes through. Along with ships coming and going from Irish ports this makes up a significant number of vessels and the potential risk of spillage or accident is always there.</P>
      <P>Although many people do not realise it, we are a maritime nation. The sea around us is the most valuable resource we have. This Bill is an opportunity to give some protection to that resource by putting in place a legislative framework to pay the necessary compensation should an incident occur involving loss of life or personal injury, loss or damage to property or environmental damage, which involve significant costs. Under the legislation the level of compensation to be paid can be decided by conventional action through the High Court only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of compensation and the arrangements for payment will be as follows. The ship owner will have some liability which will depend on the size of his or her vessel. A maximum figure <Col N="337" />of approximately &euro;140 million can be paid by the ship owner's insurance cover. The remainder of the compensation, if required, will come from a compensation fund set up internationally and financed by the annual contributions from individual companies trading in materials covered under the HNS convention. I am glad the Minister confirmed that Irish companies will not have to pay substantial amounts although they may have to make some contribution towards the fund. This fund can be called upon to pay out up to a maximum of &euro;350 million, a substantial sum. In some tragic cases no sum could make up for the environmental damage caused by certain spillages.</P>
    <P>I have real concerns regarding enforcement of the legislation. It is right that the legislation gives Irish authorities the ability to stop and board vessels if there is reasonable concern. The Minister will have the right to appoint suitable inspectors to do that job. At present those inspectors are the Naval Service and, if a ship is in port, the Garda could be involved. I have expressed my concern on many occasions in regard to the range of services the Naval Service is asked to provide. I am concerned about the capacity of a fleet of eight naval vessels, only four or five of which are at sea at any one time, to do the work required for this as well as the work that has to be done in regard to fisheries, illegal drug trafficking and basic sea safety legislation. I am not aware that any inspection of basic sea safety legislation compliance in respect of the wearing of life-jackets by fishermen has been made or that the Naval Service is even aware of its responsibility. I ask the Minister to talk to the Minister for Defence and to the Naval Service to ensure that what we enshrine in legislation can be enforced in practice. Considering some of the substances moving through Irish waters, we need to take the enforcement of this legislation seriously.</P>
    <P>I welcome the severity of fines in regard to enforcement of the law once inspection has taken place. I also welcome the fact that ship owners can be imprisoned for up to ten years when their ships do not comply with basic legislation such as that all ships carrying hazardous and noxious substances must have a compulsory insurance certificate, must keep up-to-date logs and must provide samples of the substances they carry, etc.</P>
    <P>This legislation is necessary for practical reasons. The liability for the shipping of noxious and hazardous substances needs to be limited because insurance would not be affordable if it was not for the creation of an international fund to pay the potentially high compensation. The commercial viability of shipping also needs to be balanced with environmental protection. That is important and it is in Ireland's interest that we ensure this legislation is put in place not just here, but in other European countries. I appeal to the Minister to do what he can to encourage other European countries to put this legislation into their own domestic legal structures. This convention cannot come into practice until, as the Mini<Col N="338" />ster pointed out, at least 12 countries have signed up to it. Europe should be leading the way as it has done with other international environmental concerns. I appeal to the Minister of State to raise this issue at European meetings to ensure other countries do what we have done in terms of implementing the convention in domestic law.</P>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister of State had to say about Sellafield and the MOX plant. My party will do everything it can to assist the Government in putting not only legal but also political pressure on the British Government to close Sellafield. I accept what the Minister is doing in taking a legal case against the existence of the MOX plant and we will see what comes of that. I do not accept that we have applied the necessary political pressure to achieve the end goal, namely, the closure of Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I had the privilege of visiting Belarus, a neighbouring country of the Ukraine which has experienced the fall-out and the catastrophe which occurs when the generation of nuclear power goes wrong and there is an accident. I do not wish to describe what I experienced there because everyone in the House and everyone in the debate has a fair idea what I am talking about. Many will have met children from Belarus and the Ukraine who stay here during the summer months. I know the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is familiar with these projects.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and his senior Minister have an opportunity to act on behalf of the people. Sellafield is one of those issues on which almost the entire nation is united. We are aware of and see the dangers for Ireland and its people of the existence of a nuclear processing plant which is out of date and which has a dubious record in telling the truth and keeping accurate records. While it is not possible to close the plant overnight, we should maintain a sustained effort to make life as difficult as possible for the British Government in its defence of Sellafield.</P>
    <P>In the marine sector, we should also make life as difficult as possible when shipments of nuclear waste come through the Irish Sea. The term &ldquo;nuclear fuel highway&rdquo; is one which will alarm many Irish people who are concerned about the nuclear issue. We need to do everything we can to frustrate and make life as difficult as possible for those who promote the idea of the Irish Sea becoming a highway for nuclear fuel, even if it is only on a rare occasion. There is an irony in the fact that the pellets containing the radioactive material which were recently transported through the Irish Sea had been sent to Japan and then sent back. This means they had travelled through the Irish Sea needlessly on two occasions. The irony of that should not be lost on the Government and legislators. The Minister of State should do what he can on that and we will support him where possible and will be critical where we believe he is not applying sufficient political pressure.</P>
    <P>The sea surrounding our island is the greatest resource we have. It is not utilised enough, <Col N="339" />although its use is increasing. Resources under and in the sea can be used to much greater benefit but they must also be treasured and cared for. The legislation is a small step towards doing that. For that reason I welcome it and look forward to discussing the detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>As spokesperson on communications, the marine and natural resources I welcome the Bill and the Minister's comments on improving and protecting the marine environment. We all agree that many incidents have occurred off our coast which have not been helpful to the marine environment. It is important that as many countries as possible sign up to the convention because it will be worthwhile for the long-term effects it will have. We know how important the water surrounding our island is to us. The Bill should be able to protect the fishing industry, tourism interests, local authorities and other affected parties.</P>
      <P>The Bill is complicated but I wish to raise a few points to which I hope the Minister of State will reply. Does the Bill allow enforcement between the Garda, Defence Forces and harbourmasters and what will this cost the State? Where the polluting source cannot be found, will redress be available from the carriers of dangerous substances? Will there be a contribution from those who have ships transporting hazardous waste or material which could cause serious damage?</P>
      <P>The increased severity of Atlantic storms and the cost-cutting trends within the highly competitive shipping industry mean that accidents will continue to occur in spite of improved safety at sea. Pressure on shipping operators to maximise cargo capacity and reduce turnaround times has led to potentially unsafe shipping designs in bulk carriers and roll-on/roll-off ships. Ireland is on the doorstep of a major shipping disaster. The coastal authorities must be better informed on preparing themselves for managing serious oil spills or other shipping disasters. The Irish coastline is slowly but surely being destroyed by lack of commitment on the part of and co-ordination between State agencies on issues such as pollution. It is important that the Bill be implemented as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Regarding the strategy adopted to protect the environment and given the ongoing discussions, can improvements be made on a continuous basis above what is in place at present? Is the Minister of State happy with the current guarantees and proposals regarding protection and prevention? The Minister and his predecessor have repeatedly said that further work is required in this area and more improvements are needed, including additional care and control to ensure marine life in Ireland and throughout the world is protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When was funding allocated to implement the convention and will it be shared among the 12 countries party to the substantial Europe-wide allocation of funds to assist in ensuring the protection required is provided? There is a provision <Col N="340" />for substantial fines to be imposed for breaking the law. How many companies have breached the rules and regulations laid down by the convention? Is every vessel checked before it leaves or arrives at a port? What is the mechanism for ensuring the regulations in place are adhered to? Is it done before or after the ships come in?</P>
    <P>As a member of the Fine Gael Party and like my colleague, Deputy Coveney, I will assist the Government in its attempts to apply whatever political pressure is possible to have Sellafield closed. I welcome the Minister of State's concern, something he shares with many Irish people who favour the closure of Sellafield. I agree with the Minister that the continued use of the Irish Sea by BNFL as a nuclear fuel highway is a threat to the well-being of the Irish people. It should be shut down on the basis of its safety history alone and I will help Deputy Coveney and the Minister in ensuring that all safety procedures are adhered to within Sellafield.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important if somewhat technical Bill. The issue of sea pollution has been raised in the House on many occasions in the past. The most notable major debate on the issue was held during the last Dáil when the Sea Pollution (Amendment) Bill was discussed.</P>
      <P>As an island, the spectre of sea pollution is a very real threat to Ireland. Thousands of livelihoods and our unique marine and coastal habitats could be destroyed by a single spillage or accident at sea. It is essential that Ireland adopts the best international practice in relation to this threat. It is also imperative that we are to the forefront of international efforts to make our seas and the ships that use them as safe as possible.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House, which I welcome in broad terms, incorporates two important international agreements into Irish law. The aim of both agreements, the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea, 1996, and the 1996 protocol to the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, is to set in place an international regulatory framework requiring specific insurance for the transport of hazardous substances by sea. It also establishes a framework for calculating compensation claimed after an accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both conventions were agreed at the International Maritime Organisation in 1996. Why has it taken the Government six years to bring forward legislation to give effect to these important international conventions? This Bill was published in April 2000. It is a measure of the low priority the Government gives to the issue of marine pollution that these important conventions have not been legislated for until six years after they were made and that the legislation giving effect to them, albeit introduced two and a <Col N="341" />half years ago, is only now being debated in the House.</P>
    <P>Both agreements which are annexed to the Bill are of a technical nature, but their importance cannot be understated. The Minister referred to the <i>Erica</i> incident off Brittany in 1999. We also remember the incident that took place in the Galapagos Islands off the coast of Ecuador when the <i>Jessica</i> ran aground in a tiny harbour in the islands and threatened to engulf this unique ecosystem with its 240,000 tonne cargo of oil. On that occasion it was only through good luck that the leaked cargo went out to sea, causing minimum pollution to the islands. In the past few days a film was shown on television about the <i>Exxon Valdez</i> case in Alaska which caused enormous damage to the marine environment.</P>
    <P>While the Bill before us does not relate directly to oil cargoes, previous experience reminds us just how fragile and vulnerable are our shorelines and islands. As I stated, I welcome the general thrust of the Bill. However, there are some matters to which I want to draw attention. The first is that the Bill refers to the maritime area of the country. It will, in effect, require vessels travelling up to 200 miles out from our coastline to be insured and to carry a certificate of insurance on board. It will give the State power to carry out inspections of these vessels, to seek the certificate of insurance and to prosecute for breaches of the legislation and, depending on the nature of the offence and where it is committed, to impose fines of up to £1 million or five years in prison. It would be helpful if, along with the explanatory memorandum, a map identifying the exact jurisdiction to which the Bill will apply was circulated to Members. If such a map was supplied we would be able to see that what is intended in this legislation is to extend the jurisdiction of the Bill to an area of water which is ten times the size of the land area of this island.</P>
    <P>I join Deputy Coveney in raising the issue of enforcement. There is a huge contradiction in the Bill. The Bill provides that vessels carrying hazardous and noxious substances such as oil, chemicals and so on within an area which is 200 miles out from our coast must carry insurance, that the Minister will have the power to appoint inspectors who may board vessels to see whether they have insurance and the power to prosecute them if they do not. The Bill then goes into great detail on the kinds of offences that could be committed, how big a fine may be imposed, what type of civil liability may result and so on. However, under the heading &ldquo;financial implications&rdquo;, the final paragraph of the explanatory memorandum states:</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that no additional Exchequer costs will be incurred in implementing this Bill when it is enacted. It is also anticipated that there will be no staffing implications for Departments of State, State Bodies and local authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="342" />Will the Minister explain how he will be able to appoint inspectors to police this area of water, which is ten times the size of our land area, if no money will be spent and no staff will be appointed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Naval Service will be expected to do it all again. It is not realistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is a lie. It is a grandiose statement that we are belatedly &ndash; six years after the event &ndash; signing up to important international conventions because, presumably, some of the officers of the IMO in London are making inquiries about what has happened in regard to Ireland's ratification of them. The Minister, when he goes to the next IMO conference, wants to be in a position to state that Ireland's Legislature has approved the legislation and that the conventions are ratified. However, there is no intention of doing anything about it. There is no point saying we are going to have a regime that requires ships to carry insurance if they are carrying dangerous substances, or that we are going to appoint inspectors to go on board and demand to see their insurance and if they do not have it we will take them to court and prosecute them and impose fines of £1 million or five years in prison and so on, if there is no intention of doing anything about it. How can the Minister appoint inspectors if there is no extra staff and no extra money? Will people be taken off other functions in the Department? Will the Minister appoint fishery officers as inspectors? Will he take people from the Inland Fisheries Board who go up the estuaries in dinghies to check if salmon fishermen are fishing at the right time of night or weekend and appoint them as inspectors?</P>
      <P>As Deputy Coveney says, given the range of responsibilities that exist for the Naval Service and the important work it has to do in fishery protection, protection of our coastline against drugs, arms smuggling and terrorist activity, it does not have the resources to take on this role. We are creating the idea that our seas will be policed like our roads by the maritime equivalent of the &ldquo;Kitkat&rdquo; man, stopping vessels to ask them for their dangerous substances insurance. It will not happen and the Minister needs to explain how this Bill will be enforced. It is nonsense for the Legislature to implement legislation as we have done in many other areas when no resources are provided and there is no serious intent on behalf of the Department to implement it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw attention to section 4 of the Bill, which relates to the power of the Minister to introduce regulations to cover difficulties arising in respect of the operation of this legislation. I fully recognise the need for such a section, however, I am somewhat concerned at the freedom the section gives to the Minister. The section states: &ldquo;the Minister may by regulations do anything which appears to him or her to be necessary or expedient for removing that difficulty&rdquo;. As a parliamentarian, I am anxious about ceding complete power <Col N="343" />to Ministers to do anything which appears to him or her to be necessary. While I acknowledge the following section outlines the procedure for laying of regulations before the House, the language and freedom of action, untrammelled by democratic control contained in the section, goes too far. As regulations contemplated by section 4 cannot be introduced until three years after the passage of this legislation, the Minister should consider producing a report to an Oireachtas committee after a period of approximately 18 months. That report would outline difficulties which have arisen in the operation of the legislation and contain the proposed regulations designed to overcome these difficulties. This would be a much more accountable and democratic way to introduce regulations than the <i>carte blanche</i> contained in section 4.</P>
    <P>Section 7 refers to offences and penalties under this legislation. I was particularly struck by section 7(3) which states: &ldquo;Where an offence under this Act is committed by a body corporate and is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to, any neglect on the part of any director, manager, secretary or other officer of such body corporate or a person who was purporting to act in any such capacity, that officer or person shall be guilty of an offence&rdquo;. I welcome the inclusion of this section. I hope the principle behind this section will become a regular feature of Irish law. The Labour Party has produced a Private Members' Bill to deal with corporate manslaughter, a principle that is echoed in this legislation. We are all aware of the tragedies that have occurred in Irish building sites, for example, in recent years. If it is proved that the management of a company has neglected and ignored our health and safety laws and that this neglect has been proven to contribute to the death or serious injury of a worker, the management of that company should be made accountable for the neglect in court.</P>
    <P>On section 13 of the Bill, the Minister should explain why some cargoes and ships are being made exempt from the legislation. In particular I find the provision in article 5 of the convention, which excludes hazardous and noxious substances that are carried in a packaged form, strange to say the least. Anyone familiar with the sea knows that the forces of corrosion and erosion in the sea are powerful enough to tear asunder any form of packaging. The Minister should explain the inclusion of this exemption. Has the Government made any efforts to amend the convention or will it make any efforts in future to close this loophole that makes no sense?</P>
    <P>I have referred to the implementation of this Bill and some of the exemptions contained in it. I draw attention to another exemption that I would like the Minister to explain. It arises in section 9 of the Bill which states: &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Convention (other than Article 48) shall have the force of law in the State and judicial notice shall be taken thereof.&rdquo;<Col N="344" />Article 48 is the article that provides for raising the limits of the amount of insurance which a vessel is required to carry. Article 49, which comes after it, provides for a means for amending those limits. It appears that the way in which this is being implemented in Irish law will prevent the State, at some stage in the future, from increasing the limits of insurance which vessels would be required to carry. I do not understand why that is the case and the Minister should explain this in his reply.</P>
    <P>In his remarks, the Minister referred to the issue of MOX and the fact that radioactive materials are not covered by this legislation because they are covered by a separate convention. Since this legislation is mainly about the issue of insurance, are vessels carrying radioactive materials required to be insured? If so what is the level of insurance required? I understand there is a separate code governing the carriage of radioactive materials, but the issue that arises in this legislation and the primary issue that arises in these conventions is that of insurance. Since we have had recent examples of vessels carrying radioactive materials travelling close to our coastline, we need some clarification on whether these vessels are required to have insurance and, if so, what is the insurance regime that applies. Has this State enacted in its own legislation the requirements of those conventions?</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister referred to the MOX shipment that took place and in particular the shipment from Japan that returned the MOX pellets, the safety records of which had been falsified in Sellafield. He stated that the Government took a particular course of action on that. I am conscious we are discussing this in the week when the Government, through the OSPAR Convention, is taking the UK before the courts in The Hague. I support the Government action on that and I am sure the Government has the full support of the House in that effort. I do not wish to take away from that action which we all hope will succeed by the critical remarks I wish to make in relation to the MOX shipment.</P>
    <P>The action that was taken by the Government in relation to the MOX shipment, which occurred last summer, could not have been weaker. The Minister says here that the position his Department took was to draw to the attention of the UK authorities his concerns to ensure that the vessels did not pass through Irish waters and that the highest possible levels of safety were applied both in terms of the vessels employed and the operational requirements applied to them. That effectively says we have no objection to the vessels going through the Irish Sea. As I stated at the time, the Government should have taken a strong stand by stating that that vessel should not have come through the Irish Sea. I know the Minister of State will say we cannot do so because, as he said, the question of imposing a ban on the passage of ships carrying nuclear materials remains difficult given the right of passage enshrined in the UN convention on the law of the sea. That <Col N="345" />may be the case if it were ever tested in an international court but there is no justification for the politically lily-livered approach the Government took on this issue last summer. It hid behind what amounts to an international legal nicety.</P>
    <P>Every state has the right to protect its coastline and to protect its people from vessels travelling on the high seas when those vessels pose a danger to the people, the environment and the security of the state. Any state and Government worth its salt would assert that right politically and put it up to the neighbouring state, which is primarily responsible, not to allow that shipment into the Irish Sea. That position was never taken up by our Government which, to my knowledge, did not state to its UK counterparts that the MOX shipment should not travel through the Irish Sea. When the ship passed close to the coasts of states on the other side of the globe, those states took the position that it should not travel close to them. The Minister of State knows well that the shipment of MOX fuel was re-routed a number of times and took the most circuitous route.</P>
    <P>The Government did not take a position which would refuse permission for that shipment to travel through the Irish Sea and it should have done so. Had it done so and asserted its right politically and strongly, the shipment could have been stopped.</P>

      <P>I do not have the time to go into as much detail as I would like but I want to send a message to the Minister of State, who is unfortunately on his own and outnumbered significantly by Opposition Members. If his colleagues are listening on their monitors I send a message to them and to Labour Members, if they think the unruliness and small difficulties which have arisen in the Opposition parties are a problem, they should wait until we really get stuck into the Government and show what real Opposition is about.</P>
      <P>Part of our work in Opposition will be to look at Bills like this and ask the Government hard questions about what it plans to do. It says it has a lot done and more to do, and this Bill is a clear example of where very little has been done and there is everything to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no great difficulty with the detail and content of the Bill. As Deputy Gilmore said, it is incredible that we are taking so long to bring it to the Dáil to get it ratified but I am pleased we are doing so as it will be helpful in protecting our maritime environment. Asking the Government what it has yet to do relates to more than just passing legislation and what it will do in reality to protect our environment. This is not a hypothetical risk or something that could happen in the future &ndash; hazardous journeys and accidents at sea happen on a regular basis. I read a useful report <Col N="346" />from the Minister of State's Department which dealt with the need for an Irish emergency towing vessel which was issued in 1999. It makes excellent and succinct reading.</P>
    <P>As we speak, approximately 29 shipping vessels and 100 fishing vessels of various sizes are in Irish waters. The report examines the history of accidents and risks at sea, which are very significant. We had a spillage in Dublin Bay recently where oil, which may not be covered by this legislation, spilled from a vessel loading in Dublin Port and serious damage was done to the lugworm beach ecosystem in Dublin. There was also a spillage in the Galway docks area but there are so many examples that one could spend the day listing them. Recently a 50,000 ton vessel was stranded off Greystones, County Wicklow. It was carrying 154,000 gallons of intermediate fuel oil, which is probably covered by the Bill. The Irish Coastguard requested the vessel's owners to organise a salvage operation to be overseen by Coastguard staff. We could not do it ourselves and we had to wait for tugs and other equipment to come from Britain.</P>
    <P>There are two clear lessons as to what needs to be done. First, the highest risk of accidents is close to shore and it seems clear from our accident history that that is where we have the greatest problem. It does not necessarily come under the aegis of this Bill but I urge the Government to ensure greater co-ordination in relation to pier and port accidents in terms of responsibility for and authority in dealing with them. That may come up in the impending foreshore licence legislation but it is crucial. There is no point in us passing legislation which means we are safe from maritime accidents if we do not look after what happens in our ports. There is a lack of co-ordination and clear designation of who has responsibility.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers mentioned the Naval Service but the primary body for implementing this legislation is the Coastguard as the interesting point about the need for a towing vessel is that the Naval Service is not necessarily the right agency to tow vessels in distress. The Coastguard is the agency and it is important to resource it properly. I could not agree more with Deputy Gilmore when he says it is incredible that the Bill states that there are no financial implications. We cannot just pass legislation with the right aspirations. We must back them up with the financial resources for avoidance.</P>
    <P>The report has three laudable suggestions but like many of the reports the Government issued in the past five years, there is much the Government said it would do but it has done nothing. There have been numerous recent press references to &euro;10 million being allocated to the Coastguard to implement the recommendations of the report but there is no sign of that happening. The report recommends that we designate the coasts of Counties Mayo, Galway and Donegal as buffer zones where shipping is not allowed too close to shore. We have failed to achieve that in the Inter<Col N="347" />national Marine Organisation and if there is an accident which destroys the incredible resources of those coasts, the Government will have questions to answer.</P>
    <P>The Government has not yet brought in the monitoring system the report recommends which would monitor every ship in Irish waters to determine the current status of shipping at any one time. The technology is now available to put a transponder in every ship so that in addition to having insurance they can be charted as they come through Irish waters. Again, we do not see the Department acting on this.</P>
    <P>The report also mentions towing vessels. We should do more than talk about Sellafield, we should set up a joint arrangement with our British neighbours for a towing vessel, which either we or they could provide, to cover both sides of the Irish Sea. Drawing a line down the middle of that sea is useless if oil pollution drifts to either side. We should also have our own vessel in the Shannon area to cover the western coast. There is no indication in this Bill or in anything the Minister of State said that that is what he intends to do. The Government has done nothing and there is a lot to do. It will be the job of the Opposition to push them in that direction.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Seo mo chéad uair mar Aire úr agus gabhaim comhghairdeas le mo chomhleacaí agus tá súil agam go mbeidh comhoibriú againn go ceann cúig bhliain agus an Rialtas seo i réim. This is my first opportunity as Minister to take parliamentary questions and wish my colleagues every success. I am sure we will have a wonderful and fruitful working relationship over the next five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dispute between my Department and the Irish Dental Association arose out of a claim by the association for substantial increases in the fees payable to dentists under the dental benefit scheme and the imposition of increased charges by some dentists, in breach of the contractual arrangements for the provision of dental benefit. The action by dentists started in early March this year. Patients continued to be treated under the <Col N="348" />scheme at that stage while efforts were made to find a solution to the underlying issue. In the absence of a resolution my Department ceased to accept claims from dentists who were not prepared to adhere to the contractual arrangements in early August. However, the scheme continued to operate and patients continued to be treated by dentists who were prepared to adhere to these contracts.</P>
    <P>Due to the progress made in recent discussions with the Irish Dental Association, the association agreed to recommend to its members to return to operating the scheme. The level of inquiries from dental practitioners in relation to their patients' entitlements under the scheme are now at or close to pre-dispute levels. This suggests that most, if not all, dentists previously in dispute are operating the scheme.</P>
    <P>To benefit under the scheme insured persons must be treated by a dentist who has contracted to provide services. During the dispute insured workers were advised through the press to check that their dentist was not imposing increased charges prior to starting treatment. Patients were advised that where dentists offered to treat people as private patients this was outside the terms of the scheme and the Department will not be in a position to refund any costs arising. Those who could not obtain treatment under the scheme during the short period when service was disrupted should now be able to receive treatment.</P>
    <P>Because of a time lag between authorisation of claims and the issue of payments to dentists in respect of treatment provided, it will be some months before the impact of the resumption can be properly assessed. For the same reason it will be some months before the impact on scheme expenditure will be available.</P>
    <P>I refute the insinuation in the Deputy's question that my objective in refusing to deal with dentists involved in this dispute was to save money. My objective was to preserve the scheme for the benefit of insured persons. This still remains my objective in the context of the discussions now taking place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister well on her appointment and I am looking forward to having a good working relationship with her. I am afraid, however, judging by her first answer, that her officials have taken control of her already. I am disappointed because I know her a long time and thought that she would be a Minister who would control the Department rather than the Department controlling her. However, I wish her well and look forward to working with her&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;not for the next five years, but perhaps for the next year. That is how long I give the Government, judging by the way people outside are talking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" />I stand over the statement in my question. The dispute continued for months. The Minister and the Department did not make any great effort to resolve it. If the Minister insured her car tomorrow morning, paid the insurance premium, was involved in a road accident and the insurance company then refused to pay out, something would have to be done. I ask what she will do for the PAYE workers who paid their contributions and then had to pay money out of their own pockets to obtain a service. How will she resolve this matter and pay back the money?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the objectives of the scheme is to ensure those who are insured under the scheme get value for money. I am sure the Deputy will agree that where dentists are working outside the terms of their contract, charging over and above what was agreed with the Department, that is equally unfair and unpalatable to those who pay PRSI. There was a dispute over the past two years and a review of the scheme. My predecessor offered to have it independently evaluated, but that was not agreed to. I reiterated that offer when I was appointed Minister in order to facilitate the concerns of dentists, but it was not acceptable to them. I was, therefore, left with no option but to protect those involved in the scheme and ensure they received what had been agreed by contract with the Department and that an extra charge would not be imposed. I had no choice but to take the course of action I took. I regret very much that people were inconvenienced. My Department did its utmost to facilitate them by referring them to dentists working within the terms of the scheme.</P>
      <P>As I indicated, I am not in a position to evaluate the cost of the scheme as a consequence of the dispute. If patients are being treated privately, the Department and I cannot refund the fees paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that her Department has been told to cut back &euro;101 million. Because of the number who use the scheme, the Department has saved &euro;1.5 million during the dispute.</P>

      <P>If a person takes legal action against the Department, it will cost a lot more than what it would cost to pay them. If a person produces a genuine receipt to show that he or she has paid for a service for which they had already paid through PRSI, the Department should reimburse him or her.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is answering his own question. The crux of the problem was that people were not being provided with the service <Col N="350" />for which my Department had contracted with dentists&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The recently published household budget survey carried out by the Central Statistics Office presented results from the survey undertaken between June 1999 and July 2000. The household budget survey is a survey of a representative sample of all private households in the State. The previous survey was carried out in 1995.</P>
      <P>The survey shows the changes in average disposable income of households at different income levels. The economic policies pursued by the Government in recent years have seen significant increases in income at all income levels. That incomes at the higher levels rose more quickly than at lower levels does not take away from this important fact.</P>
      <P>The survey complements the analysis of the results of the 2000 Living in Ireland survey published by the Economic and Social Research Institute in July this year. These results confirmed that households at all income levels gained significantly in real terms over the period from 1994-95 to 1999-2000. This is reflected in the sharp decrease seen in the level of consistent poverty in recent years. Consistent poverty &ndash; a combined measure using income thresholds and the experience of deprivation &ndash; is the measure used for the global poverty reduction target in the revised national anti-poverty strategy. The level of consistent poverty has fallen from 15.1% in 1994 to just 6% in 2000. The Government is committed to reducing it to below 2% &ndash; or eliminating it &ndash; by 2007. In addition, the revised NAPS provides that progress in relation to the proportion of the population falling below relative income lines, particularly for a sustained period, will be monitored over the lifetime of the strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policies pursued in recent years by the Government to combat unemployment and reduce the level of consistent poverty have brought about a significant improvement in the situation of those on lower incomes. The revised NAPS contains ambitious targets across a number of areas &ndash; including a significant commitment to raise the lowest social welfare rate to <Col N="351" />&euro;150 in 2002 terms &ndash; which will further our goal of creating a society where everyone has the opportunity and incentive to participate fully in the social and economic life of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the dispatch box. Unfortunately, this is only one of the hats I am forced to wear in this House.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the Government, now in its second term, has been successful in redistributing wealth &ndash; unfortunately, in the wrong way and to the wrong people? The income gap has widened throughout the Government's terms. Its policies indicate a lack of willingness to tackle the root causes of poverty and to achieve a fair society. The Minister's reliance on consistent poverty&mdash;</P>

      <P>A question, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I started by saying &ldquo;Does the Minister accept&rdquo;. I would have thought that was fairly conditional.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the use of the indicator of consistent poverty is unique in Ireland? All other measurements of income poverty show this country performing poorly regardless of whether the 60%, 50% or 40% lines in average income are used. The gap between the most wealthy and the least well off in this country is the second highest in the OECD outside the United States. The policies the Government is pursuing in light of rising unemployment and inflation running higher than the European average will make the situation worse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy. Indictors of poverty, relative and consistent, are academic. The ESRI, my Department and I agree that the use of consistent poverty is a better measure and indictor. Reliance on income is not a true reflection of poverty, which is the purest view if one looks at relative poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Government targeted and this Government will target resources at those who are less well off. The reduction in the live register and the increase in employment have, as a consequence, increased household income. We have reduced poverty as a consequence of the increased number of people participating in work. More importantly, we have targeted certain vulnerable groups, particularly the elderly and children, and there has been an increase in spending by my Department from £4.5 billion in 1997 to £7.4 billion, or &euro;9.4 billion, last year. That is a true reflection of the increased resources and the more targeted approach to the alleviation of poverty. The levels of consistent poverty have halved. It is my intention and that of the Government to try to address the elimination of poverty. I agree <Col N="352" />with the Deputy that participation in society and the targeting of resources are important. We have addressed the poverty issue, although we have not, unfortunately, eliminated it. We have targeted those who are most vulnerable.</P>

      <Quest>the measures she intends to take to counteract the effects of inflation and recent price increases on social welfare recipients; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the consumer price index is published on a monthly basis by the Central Statistics Office. The latest published CPI report relates to September 2002 and shows that the annual rate of inflation in the previous 12 months was 4.5%. It is projected that the average rate of inflation for 2002 will also be 4.5%.</P>
      <P>Budget 2002 made provision for substantial increases in all personal and qualified adult social welfare rates as well as child benefit. The level of increases provided represent real improvements, well ahead of projected inflation for 2002. This was on top of increases provided over the previous four budgets which substantially exceeded the rate of inflation for the period in question.</P>
      <P>Among the significant increases in last December's budget were increases in weekly personal rates of payments of between 7.4% and 11.8%. This represents significant real increases, ahead of projected inflation. There were increases in weekly rates of qualified adult allowances of between 12.6% and 14.9%. This also represents significant real increases ahead of projected inflation. Furthermore, these increases were, for the first time, paid from the beginning of January 2002, 13 weeks earlier than in 2001.</P>
      <P>Since 1997 the personal rate of payment for most recipients under 66 years has increased by at least 37% and the corresponding rate for a couple by over 44%. The personal rate of old age contributory pension has gone up by nearly 50%, with a couple both over 66 years of age getting 54%. This represents significant real improvement for older citizens.</P>
      <P>In relation to payments for children, record increases in child benefit were provided in 2002, continuing the Government's policy of investment in children. These increases, which applied with effect from April last, amounted to an increase of 37.1% for each of the first two children and an increase of 34.9% for the third and subsequent children. This comes on top of increases of 59% and 54% in 2001 and means that there has been a trebling of child benefit rates since 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases announced in the last budget, therefore, not only fully protect all recipients from projected inflation in 2002, but also provide substantial real improvements in their standard of <Col N="353" />living. The question of further increases in payment rates for 2003 will be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in congratulating the Minister on her portfolio. She is deservedly one of the most popular Members of the House. I wish her well, but hope her administration will not last too long.</P>
      <P>Like me, the Minister buys groceries on a regular basis. Is it not a demonstrable fact that we are being ripped off right, left and centre, particularly since the introduction of the euro? Is it not true that the miserable &euro;10 per week the Minister's predecessor gave people on social welfare last January has been wiped out by inflation? The report from which the Minister selectively quoted said that inflation in basic goods and services, including insurance, is 11%, while it is 10% in health costs and charges and 7.5% in food. The Minister's party gave a miserable 9% increase, yet 7% of that was taken back in food costs. St. Vincent de Paul stated recently that 60% of the poorest 20% of the population's income goes on food. Therefore, the massive inflation in goods and services and in food has eroded the miserable social welfare increases given last January. People are reeling from these increases.</P>
      <P>It is a disgrace that the Minister has taken over this Department at a time when one in five women pensioners are living in consistent poverty. That is the Minister's responsibility. It is necessary, therefore, for the Minister to go to Cabinet to ask for a mechanism to combat inflation in the forthcoming budget. Workers, through my colleagues in the trade union movement, re-negotiated the PPF. There was nobody to re-negotiate social welfare increases and those on social welfare have been left to deal with the most rampant inflation this country has suffered due to the introduction of the euro in particular. I urge the Minister to do something about it over the coming months.</P>

      <P>As I indicated, the increases in social welfare benefits and assistance are real increases over and above the inflation figures to which the Deputy referred. The Deputy spoke about the price of food, an important issue for those who must live on low incomes.

In the context of the budget, I will address the issues raised.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if she will redress the anomaly which results in discriminatory child dependant allowances being paid to certain categories of social welfare beneficiaries; and if she will increase the rate to ?21.60 per child, irrespective of the type of payment issuing.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are currently three different weekly rates of child dependant allowances payable to social welfare recipients, &euro;16.80, &euro;19.30 and &euro;21.60. Since the time of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare, which recommended a rationalisation of the rates of child dependant allowances, the number of different rates has been reduced from 36 to the current three. While further rationalisation could allow the introduction of a common rate, the gains from this approach would have to be weighed against the costs.</P>
      <P>To bring all child dependant allowances up to the highest rate currently paid would cost in the order of &euro;60 million annually. The policy direction followed by successive Governments has been to concentrate resources for child income support on the child benefit scheme which is neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of parents and does not contribute to poverty traps. The loss of child dependant allowances by social welfare recipients on taking up employment can act as a disincentive to taking up available work opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's commitment to this policy is reflected in the substantial resources we have invested in the child benefit scheme since entering office. Over our first three budgets annual expenditure on child benefit increased to &euro;730.1 million, a rise of more than 40% on pre-election levels. Following payment in June 2001 of the historic increases in child benefit rates of &euro;31.74 and &euro;38.09 per month respectively, total <Col N="355" />expenditure on child benefit was increased to over &euro;1,143 million per year.</P>
    <P>With increases in the same order paid from April 2002, total Government investment in the scheme has risen to &euro;1.556 billion and will reach &euro;1.9 billion when the current programme of multi-annual increases is complete. This means that we will have moved from a position in 1994 where 70% of child income support for a family claiming social welfare payments was in the form of child dependant allowances to a position in 2003 where child dependant allowances will account for less than 33%.</P>
    <P>The issue of increasing child dependant allowances has been raised on a number of occasions. I believe, however, that the substantial investment in the child benefit scheme which the Government has made in recent years has been of major benefit to families and a most effective use of the resources available for child income support. The question of further rationalisation of child dependant increases will be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context and in the context of priorities generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I say to the Minister, as a mother, that this anomaly really upsets me. For somebody on the lower rate of &euro;16.80, to be upgraded to the &euro;21.60 rate would mean a difference of &euro;250 a year. That is a lot of money for people on social welfare. A woman on disability allowance gets &euro;16.80. How you can you tell her that her child is worth less than that of another person receiving deserted wife's benefit. I ask the Minister to immediately redress this problem in the next budget.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, last year took &euro;650 million out of the social insurance fund. There was &euro;1.483 billion in that fund. The Minister could take the money out to remove this anomaly and bring about equality. Will the Minister consider putting this matter to the Equality Authority because this is not equality? We have three different levels of payment. Under the Constitution we are supposed to treat all children equally, but this is not happening. Will the Minister consider, in the budget, bringing everybody up to the same rate of &euro;21.60? Even that is minimal given the way inflation has been increasing in recent weeks.</P>

      <QRef>[19551/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent publication of the Green Paper on Basic Income by the Department of the Taoiseach fulfils a commitment in the last Government's action programme. The purpose of the Green Paper is to encourage debate among the wider community on the benefits of basic income while also identifying the effects of such an approach.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a basic income system in Ireland not only would represent a fundamental shift in the way in which we organise social protection in this country but would also imply a radical overhaul of the taxation system. It is likely that such a shift, would have major implications in the short and long-term for both our society and our economy. The Green Paper plays an important part in summarising those implications together with identification of the main advantages and disadvantages associated with the proposal. Some of the advantages which are claimed for the basic income approach include a simpler social welfare system, the removal of poverty and unemployment traps and of take up problems, the provision of an independent income for all, including those not in the paid workforce, and a more effective mechanism of tackling relative income poverty.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper also identifies a number of problems with the basic income approach having significant negative implications for the economy. Essentially these arise from the need to apply a single income tax rate of 48% on all income to fund the basic income scheme as proposed. While there is room for discussion of what the appropriate rate might be, it is likely that the system would result in a significant rise in the tax rate for many people. If the cost of the system was estimated on the basis of current social welfare rates rather than those which were actually used for estimation, the tax rate would be higher or incomes of many social welfare recipients would fall.</P>
      <P>Of particular interest to me as Minister for Social and Family Affairs is the assertion that a basic income system would produce a simpler social welfare system for both clients and administrators. However, the proposed system would involve the introduction of a social solidarity fund to respond to the many cases where the basic income as proposed would unacceptably reduce disposable incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially, this would mean the introduction or reintroduction of a number of targeted means tested schemes and the Green Paper notes the possibility that &ldquo;this modified basic income <Col N="357" />approach would thus be just as complicated to administer as the current tax/social welfare system and negates many of the perceived attractions of basic income&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The key test in any radical proposal of this nature is whether the gains which are claimed can be achieved through a more gradual reform of the existing system. The Commission on Social Welfare in 1985 briefly considered a basic income type approach but rejected these in favour of reform of the existing mixed systems. Those who argue in favour of a basic income system will have to make a convincing case as to why such improvements cannot continue to be made in the context of the current system, rather than opt for the uncertainties and risks of this approach. I look forward to the discussion and debate on the topic arising from the publication of the Green Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the publication of the Green Paper is a commitment the Government made out of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, does the Minister think that her job is now done or does she see this progressing beyond the debate stage to perhaps a White Paper, to legislation or to the adoption of basic income principles in our social welfare system?</P>
      <P>I am disappointed to hear the Minister trot out the income tax level needed, a canard that has been used on a regular basis. The money can be raised in several other ways, such as through indirect taxation or the social insurance fund. It is a matter of how we collect tax and how we prioritise the spending afterwards. I encourage the Minister not to leave this important paper, which we welcome, on the shelf to allow it to form the basis of an ongoing debate that will then lead to a more detailed Government response. If the Minister takes that approach, many of us here on the Opposition benches would welcome it and would be willing to further progress on an ongoing basis.</P>

However, it is an opportunity for people to see the issues concerned, evaluate the figures, bring this matter to the attention of the wider community and encourage debate. Once the Green Paper has been completed and the debates held we will await progress thereafter.</P>

      <P>As the House will be aware, on 7 October I announced that the Christmas bonus for 2002 will again be paid at a rate equivalent to 100% of the person's normal weekly payment, but with an increased minimum payment of &euro;30. The cost of this measure is estimated to be &euro;103.3 million. Payment will be made in early December and it is estimated that it will benefit 1.1 million persons comprising 740,000 recipients and an estimated 400,000 dependants.</P>
      <P>The bonus will be paid, as in previous years, to recipients of all long-term social welfare payments including retirement and old age pensioners, widows, widowers and one-parent families, carers, invalidity pension and disability allowance recipients, persons in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance and farm assist and people on employment support payments.</P>
      <P>Recipients of short-term payments do not qualify for the Christmas bonus. This includes persons in receipt of short-term unemployment payments and disability benefit, maternity benefit, carer's benefit, family income supplement and supplementary welfare allowance. An estimated 190,000 people receive these short-term weekly payments.</P>
      <P>The focus of the Christmas bonus has always been on long-term welfare payment recipients who rely on the social welfare system for financial support over the long-term. There are no plans to extend entitlement to the bonus payment to short-term schemes and any such extension could only be considered in a budgetary context having regard to the resources available and the significant cost which would be involved.</P>

      <P>There is great anger on the part of those on short-term benefits who will not receive the Christmas bonus. Does the Minister consider it fair that a person on carer's benefit, who gave up employment to look after their mother, father, brother or sister, and who had paid their stamps and dues to the State will not get the Christmas bonus while others who may never have made a contribution to the State will get it? Those in short-term employment and on short-term benefits are upset as they have the same needs and difficulties as those on long-term benefits. Will the Minister consider paying the Christmas bonus to those in receipt of the carer's allowance? They have paid their dues to the State and when they need help, owing to a reduced income, they will not get the Christmas bonus. This is mean of the Government. The Minister, as a mother, should give an undertaking to deal with this issue immediately and pay those on short-term benefits.</P>

      <P>It is sanctimonious of the Opposition to refer to that. As a consequence of the Christmas bonus I have been able to persuade the Government quite easily that a 100% Christmas bonus is important and we have been able to continue that ilk in recent years. One of the difficulties with short-term benefits is that they are short-term. They could last a week, ten day or two weeks in which case a person could be in receipt of a short-term benefit today and not at Christmas when hopefully they have returned to work or whatever. That is one of the huge difficulties in the context of short-term benefits. The focus has always been on supporting those with long-term needs and, in particular, all those in receipt of long-term benefits and in long-term schemes must be supported as it is part of their overall household package funding. The 100% Christmas bonus is important to them and as a consequence will cost over &euro;103.3 million.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree there are anomalies in the system as it operates? The Minister referred to short-term benefits. If a person did not move on to invalidity benefit he or she could be on disability benefit for a lengthy period. Those people are excluded. I agree with my colleague, Deputy Ring, that we encourage people to go for carer's benefit. If caring for two elderly parents, a carer could be out of work for three years. Perhaps the Minister will look at this again in the context of this year.</P>

While the Department recognises they are on low incomes, they will not get the Christmas bonus. Christmas is a difficult time for these people. As Deputy Broughan said, something must be done. Those in receipt of FIS should get the Christmas bonus. If the Minister were to agree to pay it, it would be money well spent and is badly needed by these people.</P>

I have agreement with Government to pay the 100% bonus on the long-term benefits. I agree that in the context of some of the schemes there are anomalies whereby short-term benefits become long-term and that people do not opt for invalidity pensions, as the Deputy indicated, although entitled to do so after a year. Certainly there are anomalies in that area. In the event of resources becoming available to me I will look at that scheme. As Deputies will appreciate, tinker<Col N="360" />ing with any scheme could cause consequential problems on the other side. Even to change disability benefit from being a short-term benefit to a long-term benefit may not be to the benefit of others who wish to move to invalidity pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Letterkenny office administers the child benefit and treatment benefit schemes. Service at the office was affected by an industrial dispute which commenced in October last year and gave rise to backlogs which continued to affect the service for some time after the dispute ended towards the end of last year. In order to concentrate the staff resource on processing the claims intake and clearing the backlog, normal telephone service had to be suspended for some time. Backlogs were cleared and claim processing returned to pre-dispute levels during this period. Normal telephone service was resumed in August. There are now no significant delays on the treatment benefit side in terms of claim processing or the telephone service.</P>
      <P>On the child benefit side, claim processing is now generally at acceptable levels for a monthly payment. Claims for new families are being processed in four weeks and for families claiming for additional children in two weeks.</P>
      <P>At this time of year there is a seasonal peak in the case of claims for children over 16 who resume full-time education. The overall volume of telephone calls increases as a result. Staff are being redeployed as circumstances allow to deal with the increased volumes of telephone calls but the over-riding priority is to clear the claims as quickly as possible. The situation is being monitored on an ongoing basis and every effort is being made to minimise any inconvenience to customers while this seasonal claims influx is being addressed.</P>
      <P>The situation this year is also affected by the preparations for a new computer system which will come into service very shortly. Its introduction represents the first phase in a programme of change which has the capacity to change the way my Department works and interacts with its customers. In the child benefit context, the immediate benefits will include improved processing times for claims and a better service to customers, including system generated notices to alert them to their potential entitlements under the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">

      <P>This dispute has caused great frustration over the past number of months. Would it be possible for the Minister, or some of her staff, to make the occasional telephone call to Let<Col N="361" />terkenny just to find out what is going on there? People were told by the Department that the dispute was settled, yet when they rang the offices, they could not get through because the telephones were not being answered. Some of these people had to wait 15 or 16 weeks for their benefits, yet they could not get anybody to answer the telephone. That is not fair. There should be some type of monitoring in the Department, and in all Departments, whereby somebody would occasionally ring the offices to find out how the services are operating.</P>
      <P>The main complaint I hear in my clinics concerns the difficulty people experience getting through to Departments by telephone. When officials in Departments come on the line, they will not give their names. For example, they should say: &ldquo;My name is Mary Coughlan and I am dealing with your problem.&rdquo;  If that happened, I can guarantee that there would not be as many complaints about the Minister's Department. I ask the Minister to ensure that happens.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the concerns of many of our customers and public representatives in the context of the dispute and its aftermath. I took the opportunity to meet the members of staff in Letterkenny at the time and I am sure the Deputy will appreciate the sensitivities arising out of the dispute and the fact that additional resources were made available to deal with the backlog. However, 70,000 claims have been made since September, a time when young people have made up their minds about what they intend to do and they are given additional entitlements under the child benefit scheme.</P>
      <P>I have made telephone calls to the Department and taken a few people by surprise. I have an ongoing mechanism, through my own MinMac, of examining service delivery. One of the more exciting developments, and I hope members of the Opposition will have an opportunity to see it, is the new service delivery model that will be initiated soon in Letterkenny. As a consequence of that we will have greater efficiency in delivery of the schemes in Letterkenny and progress over the coming years in the other schemes. The Deputy will appreciate that every time an application is made it involves the completion of certain documents, but this new system will result in a more effective service.</P>

      <P>I am committed to providing an efficient service to all my customers. This <Col N="362" />includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to carer's benefit is based on satisfying medical, employment, PRSI and residency conditions. There is inevitably a time lag involved in making the necessary investigations and inquiries to enable timely and accurate decisions to be made. In addition to the work my Department has to carry out, there is also an onus on applicants to furnish all necessary documentation. Time can elapse through delays by persons applying for benefit not supplying all the necessary information in support of their claim. Since January 2002, my Department has received a total of 1,195 applications. There are 208 claims awaiting decision and all these claims are at an advanced stage of processing.</P>
      <P>The carer's benefit scheme has been in operation for just under two years. In the past year the number of applications has increased by over 50%. The increase in the number of new claims affects the time taken to process claims. The average time for deciding an application for receipt of the benefit is currently in the region of eight weeks, although in many cases they are processed within a much shorter timeframe. In any case, where there is a delay in processing a claim, payment is backdated to the date of original application.</P>
      <P>The level of resources required and the standard of claim processing is kept under review to ensure that applicants receive a good quality service having regard to the conditions governing the scheme. If the Deputy has any particular case in mind where a particular difficulty is being experienced, perhaps he would advise me and I will do my utmost on his behalf.</P>

They make the application and they cannot understand the reason it takes so long to be processed. These people cannot live on fresh air. They need this money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down a question recently concerning the delays in all sections of the Department. These delays are not good enough. I welcome what the Minister said in reply to the earlier question <Col N="363" />about upgrading the delivery of services but at certain times of the year, particularly in summer, major difficulties are experienced in terms of getting replies from the Department. Something will have to be done about that because many of these people do not want to have to apply for this benefit. They have given up work to look after their loved ones, thereby saving the State a great deal of money, so I ask the Minister to deal with these issues as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>We spent a lot of time bringing the carer's benefit Bill through the House. The Minister's predecessor announced the establishment of carer's benefit approximately four or five years ago and it is disappointing to find that such a small number of people have benefited from it. Is there a deficit in terms of information because some people do not know whether they should apply while they are working or when they have stopped working? As Deputy Ring said, if someone is caring for an elderly father or mother, or a child with a severe disability, he or she may have to give up work very suddenly &ndash; we may be talking about that matter arising from later questions. Would it be possible for the Minister, through Comhairle, the other information network and perhaps the family resource centres, to produce more information on carer's benefit because it appears to generate a great deal of interest when people hear about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly take up that proposal and I will ask the information section of the Department to examine the possibility of greater advertisement of the availability of the benefit.</P>
      <P>In the case of people who have a problem with income, there are other income supports available through SWA in the interim. I appreciate that does not take away from the fact that when someone makes an application for a scheme, they expect to get their money as quickly as possible. Perhaps we could examine the lead in to it in the context of benefit being made available. Eight weeks is the current turnaround time on the scheme and there are not any particular claims which are causing excessive difficulty. Currently over 20,101 people are in receipt of carer's benefit, which is a doubling of the previous figure. That is an indication that more people are taking up the scheme.</P>
      <P>I notice a number of questions with regard to turnaround of a number of applications. I am doing my utmost in terms of raising this issue on a regular basis with a view to greater efficiency and effectiveness. It is not always the fault of my Department, however. People do not always submit the relevant information and we often give a great deal of latitude in the context of applications being made. Deputy Ring uses the parliamentary questions process effectively and efficiency and always gets his answers.</P>

      <P>The Government's legislation programme includes a number of initiatives in my area of responsibility. My priorities for the remainder of this year are the Civil Registration Service Bill and the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 2002.</P>
      <P>The Civil Registration Service Bill will provide for reform of the existing births, marriages and deaths registration legislation. This Bill will provide a legislative framework for the new modern civil registration system being implemented by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children. The first phase of this new system will be ready for implementation in January 2003.</P>
      <P>The Bill is aimed at reforming and consolidating all civil registration legislation from 1844 into a single enactment. It will provide for the creation of electronic registers of marriage, adoption, stillbirths, divorce and civil nullity; the re-organisation of service delivery and the removal of current restrictions with regard to registration of life events and obtaining certificates; a new administrative structure for the General Register Office and the delegation of authority for certain tasks to regional authority level; and streamlining of procedures for registration of births, deaths and marriages. The Bill is currently being drafted by the parliamentary counsel's office and it is my intention to have the Bill published as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 2002, will provide for the implementation of increases in social welfare payments and PRSI changes, if any, which will be provided for in the budget and which would be scheduled to take effect from January 2003. It would be my intention to introduce the Bill before the House in the first week of December. The Money Advice and Budgeting Service Bill was presented to the House on 9 March 2002 and is currently on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 2002, I know from past experience that it would be very valuable, in the coming weeks when the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs is established, if the Minister outlined to the committee &ndash; which was a very good one in the last Dáil &ndash; her priorities for 2003 in order that it may have a chance to examine them, irrespective of the amount of funding available from the Department of Finance. In general, I was disappointed with the legislation programme. There is little legislation under the remit of the Minister's Department, despite the huge issues which need to be addressed &ndash; some of which have been raised today &ndash; such as the targeting of children of very low income families in a pro<Col N="365" />gramme for child benefit. It is disappointing that there is almost no legislation planned despite these problems.</P>
      <P>It is particularly disappointing that the Public Service Broker Bill seems to be on the long finger because the Minister's predecessor indicated this would be a major Bill which would facilitate all our customers and constituents in relation to information, applications for schemes and so on, as we have discussed. This would truly introduce e-government to the Department of Social and Family Affairs, but seems to be on the back burner. I urge the Minister to introduce the Bill as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>It is also disappointing not to see a MABS Bill, which is the fault of the Minister's predecessor. After five years we have a very good money, advice and budgeting service, but it has still not been placed on a statutory basis. I urge the Minister to consider as a priority the legislative programme of her Department and try to introduce some of these measures as soon as possible, liaising closely with the new Joint Committee on Social Affairs.</P>

      <P>The Minister might also write and let us know what areas her Department lost to her colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív. I tabled a question today which was transferred to his Department. Second, when the legislation regarding birth and death certificates comes before the Dáil, I hope those who issue the certificates are paid. They were doing this as a favour to the State and should be paid something substantial. It is very valuable work and particularly helpful to those looking for death certificates and who have go to their community welfare officer. At one time these workers were only getting a pittance. I hope their services will be recognised in the new Bill.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the recent report from the Equality Authority, Implementing Equality for Older People; her views on the main recommendations of this report; her plans to implement any of the recommendations of this report; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Equality Authority, Implementing Equality for Older People, was published in June this year. It is very wide-ranging and contains recommendations in relation to the legal status of older people, the application of upper age limits for entitlement to services, policy making in relation to older people, work issues, income for older people, health and community services and education. As we all know, the demographics of our society are changing and in the future older people will comprise a much greater proportion of our overall population. In the circumstances, this report is very timely and to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The recommendations in the report which refer to my Department relate to the adequacy of and conditions for entitlement to pensions, the coverage of occupational pension schemes, issues relating to care allowances and respite care, transport needs of older people and the need for better information provision and greater consultation with older people and their organisations. The recommendations are either in the course of being implemented, covered by commitments in the Government programme or being considered within my Department. Substantial improvements have been made in rates of pension in recent years. The Government has set a target of &euro;200 per week for pensions to be achieved by 2007. Issues relating to the conditions for entitlement to pension are being considered in the context of the second phase report of the review of the qualifying conditions for old age and retirement pensions which was initiated by my predecessor and is nearing completion. I expect to be bringing forward proposals in this regard during 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see it as an important priority to achieve an increase in occupational pension coverage and I am confident that the personal retirement savings accounts which I am launching in conjunction with the Pensions Board will increase coverage significantly and be of particular benefit to lower <Col N="367" />paid workers and those in part-time or contract employment. In relation to the issue of care, I will shortly be publishing a consultation document on the future financing of long-term care in Ireland which will provide useful information to enable this issue to be advanced. In the area of information provision, a range of initiatives have been taken. I refer in particular to the booklet, Entitlements for the Over-60s, prepared by Comhairle, which I am arranging to have issued to all of the Department's customers over 60 years of age. My Department has in place a wide range of consultation mechanisms involving older people, including customer panels to discuss older people's experience of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>I refer also to the commitment in the Government programme to removing disincentives for those of pension age who want to consider some form of employment. Facilitating greater workforce participation by older people in this way would be of great benefit for society and older people themselves. I am committed to developing and improving our services for older people in line with the recommendations in the report referred to in the question. The National Economic and Social Forum recently formed a project team to consider the conclusions of the report of the Equality Authority and the implementation of its recommendations. My Department is actively involved with the forum in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that older people are the group which has been least protected by equality legislation, and that the Government needs to ensure we have an equality provision for seniors in the Constitution? The Government needs to take this step because of the EU directive, operational from 2005, which will rightly ban all kinds of age discrimination in every aspect of our society. I know that constitutional protection is not the Minister's decision but that of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. She might, however, be part of the decision. I welcome what she said about flexible working and phased retirement, but is it not a key issue for her own administration to change pension entitlement if persons are to be allowed to draw a pension while continuing to work after 65 years of age, should they so desire? These are issues that urgently need to be teased out to ensure there is direct equality. I welcome the Minister's remarks, but we need a fundamental approach to all these problems, especially in the area of pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his comments. I appreciate that, given the demographic changes that will take place in this country over the coming years, active retirement and the support thereof will be very important. Participation in the workforce by older people will be equally important. When the social affairs committee is set up it will be my priority to inves<Col N="368" />tigate how this can be done. I look forward to proposals from the Deputy or anyone else. I will not take on a constitutional amendment in the context of equality and the elderly. However, the targeting of support networks for the elderly is most important. I will be taking on board in due course the issues outlined in the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the booklet for the over 60s. However, there is a problem in that these people are entitled to a different support mechanism towards restructuring their houses and so on. It is currently very difficult to obtain the different grants from health boards and county councils. I urge the Minister to work with her colleagues to ensure that sufficient funds are made available to make that booklet a reality. There is no point having a nice booklet if people who come to my office or the county council offices discover the goods cannot be delivered.</P>

I had an opportunity to meet the staff who worked on the booklet. It is an excellent production and will be more than helpful to Members of the House. I am sure they received a copy of it. Perhaps the Deputy will refer the other issues to my colleagues.</P>

      <P>Every person who is dissatisfied with a decision or a claim to a social welfare payment made by a deciding officer of my Department or with certain decisions made by health boards in regard to supplementary welfare allowance has a statutory right of appeal. If an appeals officer considers that an oral hearing is required to determine the question at issue he or she will arrange for the case to be listed for hearing. At present approximately 60% of all cases coming before appeals officers are referred for oral hearing. The policy of the appeals office is to hold hearings at venues as convenient as possible for the appellant. In the Dublin area appeals are heard at the appeals office headquarters. The rest of the country is divided into seven circuits as follows: Cork, Galway, Mayo, north-east, north-west, south-east and south-west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any given week there will normally be five appeals officers on circuit outside Dublin. The areas selected for hearings are based on the num<Col N="369" />ber of appeals on hand and the length of time cases are on hand. A small number of cases are given priority where exceptional circumstances arise.</P>
    <P>I regret the figures sought by the Deputy of the length of time on a county basis it takes to have an appeal heard are not available. There is, however, a table following this reply showing the number of cases awaiting appeals. Those who are waiting longest can expect to be scheduled for hearing when an appeals officer is next in the area. However, some cases may not be in a position to proceed because, for example, the proposed date does not suit the appellant or their representatives. In general, however, efforts are made to deal with as many hearings as possible when an appeals officer is in an area.</P>
    <P>A national list system from which hearings would be granted in strict chronological order, while it might appear equitable, would be unworkable in practice. The present system has advantages in terms of efficiency and accessibility which would be lost if the age of the appeal was to be the sole criterion for determining when a hearing should take place.</P>
    <P>During the three year period to 2000, the number of appeals received increased by over 25%. However, average processing times were broadly maintained at around 22 weeks. My objective is to achieve an improvement in this. A consultancy study of the appeals office, which included an examination of all the processes involved in dealing with claims to the appeals stage has recently been concluded. The report is being considered with a view to implementing improvements to the system generally.</P>

      <P>Is there a possibility of increasing the number of staff dealing with appeals? I know of a number of cases where appeals have been going on for a very long time. It might solve the problem if the number of cases being appealed could be limited. I do not have the exact figures available to me but a number of appeals are won. It begs the question, if people are winning appeals why do they have to appeal the case in the first instance?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>A processing time of 22 weeks has been the average since 1977, even though there has been an increase in the number of appeals. However, it is not satisfactory. There are 17 appeals officers who are not necessarily out on circuit at the one time where they must deal with <Col N="370" />decisions. A number of appeals are dealt with by a deciding officer but a number have gone to oral hearing. The Deputy referred to the availability of oral hearings throughout the country. I appreciate that is an issue and I have raised it with the new appeals officer in the context of the review.</P>
      <P>I take on board what he said in regard to the necessity for appeals. This matter is always evaluated. However, it is obvious that the independence of the appeals office is a good thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a precedent in the Department of Social and Family Affairs. I am asking the Minister to investigate this matter because it is creating a number of problems in regard to waiting lists. When people go to social welfare offices throughout the country they are told by staff that if work is available they must get out there and do it. This is a complaint made to me at meetings throughout my constituency. For example, for the first time this year when people who worked in Bord na Móna for 25 or 30 years tried to collect their stamp money they were told that work was available. North Mayo is the biggest blackspot in the country. The figures are not a true reflection of what is happening because many people who try to collect their stamp money must go to the community welfare officer. Twenty two weeks is an outrageous length of time to wait for an appeal. No one else should be assessed until the backlog is dealt with because it is wrong to have people waiting 22 weeks for an appeal.</P>

      <P>The appeals office is an independent office in which I have absolutely no role. The reason it was set up was to be independent. On the other issues raised, in certain areas such as north Mayo, parts of Donegal and parts of the inner city perhaps there are difficulties in regard to the availability of work. However, it is incumbent on me and on the Deputy to ensure that where suitable work is available people should take up that work and not rely on the State. In that context, the scheme indicates that one must be available for work. This matter must be looked at to ensure people are facilitated through the job facilitator in consultation with FÁS and other agencies in regard to suitable work which is available. I am sure Deputy Ring will agree that we must ensure people in north Mayo and throughout the country are facilitated in regard to work through the mechanisms of the Department.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned the consultancy study on appeals. There have been a number of such studies, including academic studies and so on, which recommended that the appeals system should be put on a statutory basis. Why not put it on a statutory basis? The Acting Chairman is a distinguished former Minister for Social Welfare. This is something which should have been given some attention over the years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ahern told me eight or nine months ago that there was a backlog of 7,000 cases and that if he could reduce it to 4,000 he would regard it as a reasonable service. It is nowhere near to that figure. There is a huge backlog and 22 weeks is an outrageous time to wait for an appeal.</P>

That is not taking from the fact that people wish to have appeals dealt with and the number of spurious appeals is minimal. People's angst has been outlined in the House. I have concluded from the consultants' report that greater delivery of services is needed. I have no proposals to change the status of the appeals office as it a very efficient and effective way of dealing with the issues. I will raise that matter again with my officials in the context of the delays and I will try to ensure there is a greater delivery of the service.</P>

      <P>There are almost 107,000 pensioners receiving an Irish non-contributory old age, blind or survivor's pension. Of these, some 10,577, 10%, also receive a British retirement pension. These contributory British pensions are paid directly to the people concerned by the UK Department of Social Security and not through my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These Irish pensions are means-tested and entitlement is affected by changes in pensioners' means, including the value of their British pensions. Entitlement is reviewed periodically to take account of increases in the British pensions and <Col N="372" />allowance is made, at this stage, for the effects of changes in the exchange rate since the previous review.</P>
    <P>The latest review of entitlement in these cases was completed some months ago. In the event that a currency fluctuation or some other factor gives rise to a reduction in a pensioner's means, it is open to him or her to have his or her entitlement reviewed by writing to my Department indicating the circumstances giving rise to the request. Sterling appreciated fairly significantly in the past two to three years against the ECU and, therefore, against the Irish punt. This increased the value of British pensions to Irish-resident clients. More recently, this favourable sterling exchange rate has remained broadly stable at those higher levels against the euro. The current relatively stable exchange rate would not of itself warrant further systematic reviews of BRPs. Any future review work on these cases, taking account of UK budget rates increases on British retirement pensions themselves, will take into account the exchange rate then prevailing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the meanest of the mean and it is the one thing that upset my constituents. People who have worked in England have British pensions. This Government takes money from them because sterling was stronger than the punt and now the euro. It is the one issue that has continued to arise during my time in politics. Like the Minister I come from a county where there has been major emigration and many people are who are receiving partial British pensions are penalised by the Government. They were receiving an Irish pension, were assessed and the money was taken from them. That is the meanest of the mean. We talked about the Nice referendum for the past three or four weeks and the funding we received from Europe. We were funded by these emigrants in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s when this economy was on its knees. That was the money that kept it alive. When those people returned to live here they received a small portion of the Irish pension. The next thing a social welfare officer visited them, examined their circumstances and took the money from them. That is outrageous. The changeover from sterling to the euro is too high and is calculated too early in the year. The Department was not as fast at giving it back to them when the situation was reversed. The Government did nothing for them. This is wrong and the Minister should speak to her officials in this regard. These people are in the latter part of their lives. They have worked hard for their money, contributed to the State but are getting only a portion of a pension. This is mean.</P>

      <P>Some of the Minister's colleagues in Donegal were annoyed when the Department pursued 10,000 of these clients. That was the figure given by the Minister's predecessor. What has the Department saved? What was the average cutback? The Minister may not <Col N="373" />have the information today but I would like her to submit it to me. I agree with the previous speaker that this cut was the meanest of the mean. In my county, like that of the Minister and Deputy Ring, thousands were forced to emigrate to England. They were glad of a job. They have a small pension from their work there and it is being used against them.</P>
      <P>I visited an elderly person in Cootehill who depends on the small British pension to allow her obtain extra home help which is not available from the health board. It was a mean cut. How much did the State benefit?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>This is red tape which annoys people more than anything. We do not make much money from it. Will the Minister work out how much is saved and what it will cost to implement this examination and recoup the money?</P>
      <P>What will happen to the Christmas bonus for British pensioners? Will they be entitled to it? When I was a councillor this problem was frequently brought to my attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what to do with the members of the Fine Gael Party. This is not a cutback. I do not believe they know what cutbacks are. Some of them were not here when there were cutbacks because their party put the country in a black hole from which we could not escape. We are still paying for their ineptitude.</P>
      <P>To revert to the question, I represent a Border county and I appreciate that this annoys people. Deputy Ring was correct. This is a social security scheme. People are eligible for a pension on foot of their UK contributions. We have a <i>pro rata</i> system. It is only when people do not have an adequate income from their social insurance in the United Kingdom that they may be eligible for a non-contributory pension. As a consequence they are eligible for other ancillary supports. Reviews take place and as a consequence there can be changes. The Department does not penalise under the reviews unless there are wholesale problems or lack of control. That has not happened. If there is a change in the UK pension and a change in the exchange rate, people on a UK pension could be better off than our non-contributory pensioners.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter with the Minister for Education and Science. Are the Minister and the Minister of State aware that the school retention initiative has been replaced by the school completion programme and that New Ross vocational college was included in that initiative? However, since the initiative was replaced, the school has not been selected for the school completion programme.</P>
      <P>The teachers and I believe that the college should not have been omitted from the school completion programme. New Ross, as a community, has many early school leavers and, as a young person, I believe it is important to keep people in school and college for as long as possible to give them the opportunity to get a proper education. I ask the Minister of State to make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, I am happy to reply to the Deputy and I thank him for the opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school completion programme, which is a new and expanded programme to deal with early school leaving, was introduced earlier this year. The school completion programme incorporates the elements of best practice established by the eight to 15 year old early school leaver initiative and the stay in school retention initiative at <Col N="375" />second level, the pilot phases of which came to an end in August and July 2002 respectively.</P>
    <P>The school completion programme is designed to deal with issues of both concentrated and regionally dispersed disadvantage and is a key component of the Department of Education and Science's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving. Significant funding will be made available to this programme over the next three years, comprising &euro;23.1 million in 2003, &euro;23.5 million in 2004 and &euro;24.1 million in 2005 under the national development plan with assistance from the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>The school completion programme recognises that a wide variety of home, community and school-based factors can contribute to low school attainment and early school leaving. Improving student retention to completion of senior cycle at second level can only be achieved by enhancing the educational experience of those for whom school may be irrelevant or unimportant. Consequently, strategies designed to address the needs of young people at risk of early school leaving must include a range of actions that impinge on these aspects of young people's lives; these strategies must therefore be holistic and child-centred by nature. The school completion programme aims to develop local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. It entails targeting individual young people of school going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes.</P>
    <P>The programme will focus on the areas of greatest need. Sites for participation have been selected on the basis of a detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level using the Department of Education and Science's post-primary pupils database. This analysis also identified the main feeder primary schools. A total of 82 projects &ndash; 65 new projects sites together with the existing 17 ESLI projects &ndash; have been selected to participate in the school completion programme.</P>
    <P>A local management group must be established to manage each of the projects at local level. School completion projects must have representatives of relevant schools and parents, together with local statutory, voluntary and community agencies. This local management group will consult with the local home-school-community liaison committee, where one exists, on a two-way advisory basis. Evidence generated from the pilot phases of the school completion programme shows that the most effective way of addressing educational disadvantage is through an integrated services approach.</P>
    <P>The local management group, therefore, will be required to assess the needs of marginalised, educationally disadvantaged young people at local level and to devise an integrated, costed, focused and targeted retention plan that will support these young people in their school, home and <Col N="376" />community life. Representatives of schools and agencies on the local management group must engage school staff and parents in a consultative and planning process in order that the retention plan supports the needs of all young people at risk. The retention plan will offer in-school, after-school, out-of-school and holiday time supports to young people at risk.</P>
    <P>A national co-ordinating team that comprises a national co-ordinator and four assistant national co-ordinators supports the school completion programme. It is the task of the national co-ordinating team to advise on and monitor the integrated area based retention plans that support the young person at risk at local level.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 82 school completion projects, the Department of Education and Science is continuing to support 53 second level schools, which were funded previously under the stay in school retention initiative but were not selected for the project phase on this occasion. These 53 schools, which include New Ross vocational college, will be supported under the stay in school retention phase of the school completion programme on a phasing out basis over the next three years to 31 August 2005.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the amount of funding available to this programme in future, any decision to include further project sites will be based on a selection process using the most current detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level from the Department of Education and Science's post-primary pupils database.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that in a town like New Ross and other towns across the country there is a programme similar to the one I talked about. It encourages people to stay in school especially where there is a high drop-out rate. It is important we encourage pupils to stay in school and continue to third level. I will make sure this scheme continues after 2005 in New Ross vocational college.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the issue of Dublin Bay and the proposed 52 acre infill by the port company. While many people feel this is a local issue, that is not the case. The issue of the bay is about the preservation of the environment and of a valuable national asset. People who see it as a local issue are misguided. It is a national issue as Dublin Bay belongs to the people of Dublin and Ireland, not just to the port company.</P>
      <P>I was elected on this issue and it is essential I accept my democratic mandate and say to the Dáil and the Minister that the people want me to reflect that view here. I follow in the tradition of that great politician, Seán Dublin Bay Loftus, and I hope the Minister will respect the wishes of the people and do all in his power to stop this infill and the destruction of our bay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" />Not only would this be an environmental disaster for all concerned but it has the potential to affect the whole city, particularly in regard to flooding. It does not make economic sense when we consider the traffic congestion problems in our city. We need new radical ideas to develop our ports and successive Governments should have listened to the detailed plans and proposals to develop our port north of Dublin put forward by people such as Seán Dublin Bay Loftus. People are genuinely upset at the prospect of our bay being filled in, with further pollution of our seas. It is not acceptable and the Government and port company must listen to the will of the people. It is no good lecturing Tony Blair and his Government about Sellafield when our own port company wants to wipe out 52 acres of our beautiful bay.</P>
    <P>I ask the port company to follow the good example of Dublin City Council which is spending over &euro;200 million cleaning up the bay. This is an example of good practice which should be heeded by everyone with the interests of the bay at heart. I pay tribute to the great work of groups like Baywatch, an environmental group based in Clontarf, and the Clontarf residents' association. These voluntary groups have been the backbone of the professional campaign to preserve our bay and I commend them. I intend to be their voice in the Dáil. Despite what many parties might say, I will honour that mandate. It is simply not acceptable that a port company can force a policy on people against their will while sites are lying idle in the port and space is freely available. Will the Minister tell me if there is a hidden agenda here and is there a possibility of the 52 acre real estate being available on the open market? Let us have transparency and openness in this debate.</P>
    <P>Another potential damaging project in our community is a planning application by a company called Minichem, which deals in chemical and hazardous waste, in the port area. This could be a mini-Sellafield and it is up to all of us to be on our guard about this recent development. I urge all parties to back local groups in their campaign against the 52 acre infill. This issue is important and I urge everyone here to take the broader view, the long-term interest of the bay, the environment and the country.</P>

      <P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to inform the House of the position regarding the proposed reclamation of 21 hectares of foreshore in Dublin Bay. Dublin Port Company made an application to the Department on 17 July 1998 for approval under the Foreshore Act, 1933, for the reclamation of 21 hectares of foreshore within the port area. The company indicated that the proposed reclamation was necessary to cope with <Col N="378" />expanding traffic by creating additional deep water berthing facilities.</P>
    <P>In view of the amenity and ecological importance of the area in question and the nature and extent of the proposed reclamation, my Department engaged experts to review the environmental impact statement which accompanied the port company's application. The experts' brief required them to form an opinion on whether the EIS met statutory requirements and was sufficient to allow a decision to be made on their proposal. In the event, the consultants came to the view that the statement did not meet statutory requirements and the port company was advised accordingly.</P>
    <P>Having reviewed the situation the port company decided that the appropriate way to proceed was to commission a new environmental impact statement and to make a fresh application. This new application was received in the Department on 7 March last. Again, because of the sensitivity of the area concerned and the scope of the proposed reclamation, the Department sought expert advice on the adequacy of the environmental impact statement. The experts' evaluation of the statement was received in the Department this week. Their report is quite lengthy, in excess of 100 pages, and it will be considered in detail by the Department.</P>
    <P>Having considered the experts' report, the Department will advise the Minister as to whether the environmental impact statement meets statutory requirements and provides all the information required to permit the proposed development to proceed to public consultation. If the proposal is found to be ready to go to public consultation, the port company will be instructed to commence the process. This will involve giving public notice and the making available by the port company of documentation relating to the proposed development. All interested parties will have a period of one month to make their views known and full account will be taken of submissions and observations received before a decision is made on the proposal. In the event that it is found that the EIS does not provide the necessary basis for public consultation the port company will be advised in detail as to the further information required.</P>
    <P>My Department has also considered the planning status of the proposed reclamation, having regard in particular to the provisions of Part XV of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. The advice available to the Department indicates that planning permission is required for the proposed reclamation. The port company has been advised accordingly. I understand that it is currently consulting its advisers on the issue and will revert to my Department on the matter in the near future.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that full and careful consideration will be given to this major proposal before a decision under the Foreshore Acts is made on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important issue for the Adjournment debate. The nurses at Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, are on a work to rule. It started last Monday week and has continued all this week. The fall-out is that elective admissions have been cancelled and the surgical clinic closed. About 120 people are admitted to the elective admissions section and about 200 to the surgical clinic per week. The result therefore is that more than 300 people per week are being affected by this work to rule.</P>
      <P>The workload of the nurses at Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, has increased dramatically in recent months. Although the nurses do efficient and effective work and a new surgeon has arrived in the hospital, the staff are overworked. There is ongoing discussion with the health board but the reality is that funding is not available though everyone agrees it is needed. I am informed that the health board does not intend taking any action until after Christmas and into the new year. Given the cutbacks and budget tightening in the South-Eastern Health Board, the reality is that there is not a sufficient number of nurses to do the job. I hope the Minister of State has good news in this regard. He knows the constituency and hospital well and has visited and made announcements there. I look forward to a positive response from him.</P>

      <P>I respond on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. I am happy to address the issue raised by the Deputy and thank him for raising it. I have an extensive answer, some of which deals with general matters and the rest with the detailed matters raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I would first like to outline for the House the hugely significant measures for nurses and midwives that have been implemented over the past four years. The Commission on Nursing, which produced its report in 1998, proposed a radical blueprint for the development of the professions of nursing and midwifery. The recommendations of the commission were accepted in principle by the Government and implementation of those recommendations is now well advanced.</P>
      <P>By far the most significant of these recommendations was the proposal to transfer the education of nurses into the education sector and the introduction a four year undergraduate degree course. The new degree commenced in 13 higher education institutes this month. This development is supported by a capital development programme in the education sector involving expenditure of some &euro;243.2 million by the end of 2004. This will be accompanied by annual revenue costs of around &euro;90 million per annum when the programme is fully up and running.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recruitment and retention of nurses and midwives has been an issue of concern in recent years. Developments in the education of nurses have coincided with a dramatic increase in the <Col N="380" />number of places available for nursing students. This year 1,640 nursing places are available, 58% more than the number available in 1999. In addition, there are in excess of 800 places available on specialist postgraduate courses, including accident and emergency, coronary care, oncology and so on. A comprehensive package of initiatives, including payment of fees and other financial supports, are available to nurses on these courses.</P>
    <P>A major concern of the Commission on Nursing was the question of professional development and career pathways for nurses and midwives. The commission recommended the establishment of the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery for the purpose of furthering the development of nursing as a profession with a particular emphasis on post-registration education and training. The commission also recommended changes in the grading structure and the introduction of clinical nurse/midwife specialists and advanced nurse/midwife practitioners. To date, almost 1,400 clinical nurse/midwife specialists and advanced nurse/midwife practitioner posts have been developed under the auspices of the national council.</P>
    <P>In accordance with recommendation 4:55 of the Commission on Nursing, a national pilot programme for the formal training of health care assistants commenced in November 2001 and was successfully completed in May 2002. The deployment of health care assistants will reduce the level of non-nursing tasks being performed by nurses and midwives and will allow for the more effective utilisation of the professional skills of nurses and midwives.</P>
    <P>The measures that have been taken will transform the profession of nursing and the high capital and ongoing investment in the profession must be acknowledged. In addition, significant pay increases have been awarded to nurses in recent years over and above those provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This synopsis is intended to bring to the attention to the House the serious commitment of the Government to the development of nursing as a profession.</P>
    <P>The issues in Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, revolve around nurse staffing levels in theatre and general wards in the hospital. The staff shortage in theatre arose as a result of two members of staff being on maternity leave. Replacements were put in place by management on 14 October 2002, the day the industrial action began. Despite this, the work to rule extends to theatre.</P>
    <P>While nurse staffing levels in the general wards are acknowledged by the South Eastern Health Board to be lower than in other centres in the region, the board is satisfied that the existing levels are consistent with adequate patient care and safety. The health board has responded to the Irish Nurses Organisation to the effect that this issue will be given priority in the 2002 service plan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="381" />According to information supplied to me by the South Eastern Health Board, management has made extensive efforts to engage the Irish Nurses Organisation in consultations and this has not been reciprocated by the union since the beginning of October. The health board requested and has been granted a Labour Relations Commission hearing on 6 November. Despite this, and in contravention of good industrial relations practice, the industrial action continues.</P>
    <P>This action by the Irish Nurses Organisation has led to the cancellation of elective surgical operating lists and surgical outpatients and is disproportionate to the issues at stake. The INO should engage in discussions that will be facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission on 6 November. Users of the health service are necessarily in a vulnerable position and this type of action is ultimately to their detriment. In this and all other industrial relations issues in the health service, I call on unions to engage through the established industrial relations procedures and mechanisms.</P>
    <P>While the right to take industrial action in furtherance of their aims is acknowledged as legitimate, professionals such as nurses must have due regard to the effects on those who depend on the health services. The taking of industrial action should be contemplated only <i>in extremis</i> and when all other avenues for resolution have been exhausted. This is clearly not the case in this instance.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the issue of adopting policies which will increase Garda visibility. I do so with reference to my region but it is a national issue. I do not do so with the intention of criticising the Garda but of supporting the work its members do.</P>
      <P>I received information recently which underlines the difficulties faced by people. If a school had a change of principal every year or more often, it would have difficulties. I live in the Garda district of Buncrana where six superintendents have served since 16 October 1997. I do not know if this is healthy. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has not taken this matter but that is not to underestimate the role of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan. Nonetheless, I hope the message is relayed strongly to him that the optimum service cannot be given if there are six superintendents in five years. I appeal for that to be addressed. I wish the new superintendent well and hope that I am still talking about him in glowing terms in five years time and not about the sixth person to have replaced him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed that the current strength in the Buncrana district is 78, which includes all ranks. I do not know if they are all on active service or if some of them are on leave. Everyone wants Garda visibility on the streets to prevent <Col N="382" />petty crime and improve public order and in built-up areas to prevent speeding. When I asked if a greater number of public order and ordinary offences occurred from Monday to Thursday or from Thursday to Monday, I was surprised and astonished at the response that the Minister was informed by the Garda authorities that the information sought by me was not readily available and could only be obtained by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources. If people do not know whether Thursday to Monday is worse than Monday to Thursday in terms of the number of crimes committed, petty or otherwise, I do not know where we will begin to deal with this issue. Surely such basic data should be readily available.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that, in my area, 11 gardaí are on duty on a Saturday. On Sunday, eight are on duty and I assume that includes Saturday night and Sunday morning. I am also concerned that on occasion only one vehicle is available for patrol. Does anyone in Garda headquarters know the size of Inishowen? Do they know its Border location, that we are adjacent to Derry city and that we are the centre for social interaction in the north west?</P>
    <P>I did not come here to undermine the chief superintendent or anybody at local level because they are doing what they can with the available resources. As a Border location, we suffer break-ins at houses and premises. Last night there was yet another serious break-in. We know this will get worse as Christmas approaches. We want Garda visibility and personnel. Eight gardaí on the entire peninsula of 30,000 people cannot deal with the problems. This would not be acceptable in Dublin. It is not acceptable in Inishowen either.</P>
    <P>There is much work going on behind the scenes. Gardaí are often occupied with paperwork. In the interests of visibility on the ground it is time others were brought in, especially to deal with paperwork. I ask, too, that people report crime. They may be afraid to do this or think it would be a waste of time. However, I can get no information to questions I ask in the House if people do not report in the first place.</P>
    <P>My time is extremely limited and I await the Minister of State's response. I reiterate the points I have already made <i>vis-à-vis</i> the tiny number of personnel deployed. Let us consider whether the period from Thursday to Monday is more dangerous or busy than from Monday to Thursday. If so, why are there fewer gardaí on duty during that time? It is time for a massive revamp and to focus on what is really needed and adopt a targeted approach in order that there is Garda visibility on our streets when we need it.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I welcome this opportunity to set out for the benefit of the House the current position. The House will be aware that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for the overall pro<Col N="383" />vision of resources for the Garda Síochána. The Minister will continue to ensure the Garda Síochána has adequate resources to tackle crime. The Government has substantially increased the number of gardaí in recent years from 10,800 in 1997 to a current strength of approximately 11,860 members. This is set to increase in the near future to 12,200 &ndash; an historic high.</P>
      <P>A study of further civilianisation in the Garda Síochána was completed as part of the bottom-up review of the organisation recommended in the Garda steering group report of 1997. The objective of the study was to carry out a detailed analysis of existing posts held by gardaí to assess the potential for further civilianisation; examine the options for career structure and related matters, and establish the implications for control of civilian staff by the Garda Commissioner. The study identified approximately 500 posts throughout the organisation suitable for civilianisation. These include administrative posts in Garda headquarters and various offices located in divisions and districts. Implementation of this programme of civilianisation is ongoing.</P>
      <P>The impact of this development will result in a higher presence and visibility of gardaí on the streets, thus enhancing public safety and reducing public fear of crime and street violence. The releasing of gardaí will also result in putting expensive training and experience to better use; improved traffic movement; and more resources for interventions with juveniles, youth clubs and special projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More generally, the question of maximising Garda personnel resources is being considered as part of a major ongoing review of Garda organisational structures under the strategic manage<Col N="384" />ment initiative programme of modernisation. The outcome of this review will be submitted for consideration by Government when completed.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that the Commissioner is vested, under section 8 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, with the general direction and control of the force. The detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas is a matter, in the first instance, for the Garda authorities. I have been informed by the Garda authorities that Garda manpower levels and visibility on the streets are matters determined by operational demands and can vary from time to time. The Commissioner is satisfied with the present arrangements, including those in operation in Border regions. Border areas are receiving particular attention and resources are deployed to combat and reduce incidents of crime. Crime prevention plans have been drawn up and are in operation to combat crime in Border areas. Garda resources currently available in Border areas are utilised as effectively as possible. The matter is under constant review and any improvements that can be made in the present patrolling system in Border areas which will improve the effectiveness of law enforcement will be adopted whenever feasible.</P>
    <P>The Inishowen area is policed by Buncrana district. Current personnel strength, all ranks, of Buncrana district is 77. The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available, the needs of Buncrana district will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 5 November 2002.</P>

      <P>The free schemes share a common set of broad objectives, including the provision of assistance to those living alone by targeting them with specific benefits and supporting older people and people with disabilities in their wish to remain in the community as opposed to institutional care.</P>
      <P>The original objective of the telephone allowance scheme was to provide an element of protection and security for older people and people with disabilities in their own homes where they were either living alone, or with people who would be unable to summon help in an emergency. An additional objective of the scheme now is to encourage social contact and to assist in the prevention of social isolation for those living alone.</P>
      <P>The proposal to extend telephone allowance to pensioners resident in nursing homes does not fit easily within the community care objectives of these schemes. In addition, those living in nursing homes and other residential institutions have daily support and contact with other residents and nursing staff.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, however, access to the telephone allowance would be of benefit in terms of facilitating contact with family and friends. The current arrangements for the free schemes are kept under review. Any changes in the arrangements, as the Deputy has proposed, would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the context of overall Government priorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 44 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to carers on <Col N="386" />low incomes who look after people in need of full time care and attention.</P>
    <P>There are currently more than 20,100 carers in receipt of carer's allowance. This means that almost 39% of the 52,000 carers, estimated by a census pilot survey to be caring for more than three hours per day, are in receipt of carer's allowance. This is an increase of more than 118% in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance in the past five years.</P>
    <P>Provision was made for a number of significant improvements for carers in budget 2002, which are as follows: allowance rates increased by &euro;10.23 for carers aged under 66 and &euro;12.73 for carers aged over 66; carers' benefit rates also increased by &euro;10.17 per week to &euro;132.70; from April 2002, the weekly income disregards in the carer's allowance means test increased by &euro;32.28 to &euro;191 for a single person and by &euro;64.57 to &euro;382 for a couple; in addition, for the third successive year, provision was made for an increase in the respite care grant by &euro;127 to &euro;635 and to &euro;1,270 for carers who are caring for more than one person. These increases ensure that a couple with two children, earning a joint income in the region of &euro;22,617, qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance or they can earn up to &euro;36,364 and still qualify for the minimum carer's allowance, plus the free schemes and respite care grant.</P>
    <P>The question of further improvements or changes in the carer's allowance scheme will be considered in a budgetary context. My Department is involved in a study to examine the future financing of long-term care in Ireland, which explores strategic issues relating to the financing of long-term care, both in terms of cost and possible partnership approaches and the possible role of the PRSI system in this regard. I am pleased that this study, which was undertaken in consultation with the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance, is expected to be published before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The development of the range of supports for carers will continue to be a priority for this Government and, building on the foundations now in place, we will continue to develop the types of services across all Departments which recognise the value of the caring ethos and which provide real support and practical assistance to people who devote their time to improving the quality of life for others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 23 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>The latest Household Budget Survey, published in October, presents results from the survey carried out between June 1999 and July 2000. This representative survey of Irish private households is the first such survey since 1994-95.</P>
      <P>The survey shows the changes in disposable income of households at different income levels over this period. While the change in income varied across different income levels, that rent incomes have increased significantly at all income levels over the period.</P>
      <P>What these figures do not show is the sharp decrease we have seen in consistent poverty over recent years. Consistent poverty &ndash; a combined measure using income thresholds and the experience of deprivation &ndash; is used for the global target in the national anti-poverty strategy which has been reviewed in consultation with the social partners. Consistent poverty has fallen from 15.1% in 1994 to 6% in 2000, the latest figures available. The Government is committed to reducing consistent poverty to below 2%, and ideally eliminating it by 2007. In addition, progress in relation to the proportion of the population falling below relative income lines, particularly for a sustained period, will be monitored over the lifetime of the strategy.</P>
      <P>The Conference of Religious in Ireland's pre-budget submission claims that the gap between rich and poor has widened by &euro;243 per week over the past five years. This is based on a calculation of social welfare increases for a long-term unemployed person compared with the changes for a person on &euro;50,790 per annum arising for tax reductions, wage increases, and the take-up of an account under the Government's special savings incentive scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures do not take into account that the number of long-term unemployed people has fallen dramatically over the past five years, alongside a corresponding decrease in unemployment and increase in employment. Since April 1997, long-term unemployment has decreased from more than 90,000 people to around 20,000, or from 5.6% to 1.2%. In addition, unemployment overall has fallen from 10.3% to 4.2%. Approximately 370,000 more people are in employment now than were employed in 1997. For those that remain on social welfare, the rate of increase for social welfare payments has far exceeded the rate <Col N="388" />of inflation over the past five years, providing significant real increases in disposable income for vulnerable groups in society.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government is committed to implementing the revised national anti-poverty strategy with specific targets across thematic areas related to poverty and its focus on particularly vulnerable groups.</P>
    <P>Most notably, the target on income adequacy is to achieve a rate of &euro;150 per week, in 2002 terms, for the lowest rates of social welfare by 2007, a target welcomed by the social partners.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to combating social exclusion, ending marginalisation and creating a fairer society. Successive budgets have represented major steps towards these goals and this has been underlined in the progress made on reducing consistent poverty and unemployment. The most vulnerable in society, that is children, older people and those dependent on social welfare, have all benefited greatly from the improvements made.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to bringing the maximum rate of the widow's and widower's contributory pension for those over 66 years of age into line with that of the old age contributory pension. A number of special increases have been granted in recent budgets in pursuit of this objective and the maximum rate now stands at &euro;144.80 per week against a rate of &euro;147.30 for the old age contributory pension.</P>
      <P>Widows and widowers are also benefiting from the improvements in the free schemes which were announced in budget 2001. Under these arrangements all persons aged over 70 years of age are entitled to the full range of these non-cash benefits regardless of their means or household composition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In budget 2000, a new scheme was introduced, the widowed parent grant, to help with the special needs of this particular group in the immediate <Col N="389" />aftermath of a bereavement. This involves the payment of a special grant of &euro;2,500 to a widow or widower with dependent children.</P>
    <P>The increase in the rates of child benefit are of benefit to widows and widowers with children. Since 1997, the monthly rates of child benefit have been increased threefold. Since April this year, monthly child benefit payments are &euro;117.60 per month for each of the first and second children and &euro;147.30 per month for the third and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are special arrangements in place whereby an individual in receipt of a widow's or widower's pension or one-parent family payment may also receive half-rate disability benefit or unemployment benefit in addition to his or her pension. This provision applies where the person satisfies the relevant contribution conditions and dual payment can continue for up to 15 months.</P>
    <P>Social welfare provision for widows and widowers will be kept under review and further improvements will be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>At the end of August, the latest month for which full expenditure data are available, overall voted expenditure for my Department was some &euro;50 million below profile. The most significant element of this under-spending was on unemployment and related services, &euro;36 million, carer's allowance, &euro;10 million, free schemes, &euro;8 million, family income supplement, &euro;6 million, and old age non-contributory pensions, &euro;4 million. This under-spending arose because demands under the schemes were less than expected. There was also some over-spending, the most significant of which was on supplementary welfare allowances, &euro;18 million, and child benefit, &euro;7 million.</P>
      <P>In relation to the social insurance fund, at the end of August, expenditure was some &euro;48 million higher than profile. The most significant elements of this over-spending were on old age contributory pension, &euro;36 million, unemployment benefit, &euro;8 million, and disability benefit, &euro;4 million.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to increasing the rate at which the qualified adult allowance, QAA, is paid for those over 66 years of age to the rate of the old age non-contributory pension and to allow for the payment of this allowance directly to the qualified adult. This process commenced in budget 2001 with increases of up to &euro;19.05 per week granted at that time. Further increases were granted in budget 2002 and QAA rates now stand at between 66% and 77% of maximum personal rates. The question of making further progress on this objective is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>From October, qualified spouses and partners of people entitled to a retirement or an old age contributory pension have the choice of having their part of the payment paid directly to them in accordance with the conclusions of the working group on administrative individualisation. This facility will be extended gradually to all pensioners.</P>
      <P>The Government is also committed to extending pension cover to as many people as possible. In recent years more flexibility has been introduced into the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory pension scheme, including a reduction in the average number of contributions required for a minimum pension to ten, the introduction of <i>pro rata</i> pensions for those with mixed-rate insurance records and the special pension for those with pre-1953 insurance contributions. These measures are of benefit to many women who have gaps in their PRSI records due to working in the home looking after children, or caring full time for an elderly or incapacitated person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The homemaker's scheme was introduced in 1994 and allows for periods spent out of the workforce caring for children or sick relatives to <Col N="391" />be disregarded when a person's contribution record is being averaged for pension purposes. This scheme is being reviewed as part of an overall review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pension and changes to the scheme will be considered in the context of the findings of this report.</P>

      <P>While the United Nations Human Development Report can contribute to our knowledge of human development and poverty issues globally, the data used in relation to Ireland, and the weightings applied to these data in the composite calculation of poverty, do not accurately reflect the results of other research conducted in relation to poverty levels in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The weightings ascribed in the calculation, by the UN, of its human poverty index place a particular emphasis on functional illiteracy scores drawn from the international adult literacy survey, IALS. In this regard, a report on the results of the IALS from the Department of Education and Science stated that interpretation of these results as revealing a high level of illiteracy in the Irish population is unwarranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" />That being said, the Government is very conscious of the need to tackle the issue of literacy. Substantial investment has been provided under the national development plan to progress this area. The revised national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, also contains key literacy targets to be achieved by 2006 and 2007.</P>
    <P>While Ireland's position on the poverty index is primarily a result of the use of the IALS data for functional illiteracy, some of the other data used in this exercise are also inaccurate. While the long-term unemployment rate quoted for Ireland is 5.6% &ndash; relating to 1999 figures &ndash; the level of long-term unemployment at that time was just over 2%. This has since fallen to just over 1%.</P>
    <P>Results from the 2000 &ldquo;Living in Ireland&rdquo; survey show that consistent poverty is now down to 6%, continuing the downward trend we have achieved in recent years. These figures demonstrate the real progress that has been made in tackling poverty. The new poverty reduction target contained in the revised national anti-poverty strategy is to reduce the numbers experiencing consistent poverty to below 2% and, if possible, to eliminate consistent poverty altogether.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that poverty remains a problem within Irish society. While we have made much progress in recent years, the revised NAPS contains ambitious policy objectives and targets across a number of areas including education, employment, income, health and housing and accommodation and will further our goal of creating a society where everybody has the opportunity to participate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>The level of staffing in each of my Department's offices is reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted, as far as possible and, as appropriate, to reflect the changing demands which arise from increased claim loads, changes to scheme conditions and other factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These reviews involve the comprehensive measurement of workloads in each office and the identification of the staff resources required to handle this work. A further analysis of require<Col N="393" />ments is well advanced and it is due for completion shortly. Readjustments will be made to staff numbers, if appropriate, following this review.</P>
    <P>In the case of the schemes to which the Deputy refers, the average processing times, in weeks, for these applications at present are as follows: old age contributory pension, ten weeks; old age non-contributory pension, eight weeks; widow's non &ndash; contributory pension, five weeks; widow's contributory pension, four weeks; and farm assist, four weeks.</P>
    <P>These figures relate to the elapsed time from the date the initial claim is made until the date on which a decision on entitlement is given. In cases where a means test is required, a certain level of delay is unavoidable. Furthermore, in some cases significant delays are caused by the necessary inquiries into the circumstances of claimants for certain schemes or in verifying the insurance record of claimants for insurance based payments, particularly pensions. Factors outside the Department's control can impinge on the time taken to make a decision in any case. These factors include delays in claimants supplying necessary documentation or in securing key information from other agencies, including agencies abroad.</P>
    <P>It should also be borne in mind that many applications for pensions and allowances are made in advance of eligibility commencing and that, even though there is apparent delay, payment may be awarded well in advance of the relevant event. For example, 85% of claims for old age contributory pension were awarded before pension age where the claim was received one month before pension age.</P>
    <P>In addition, many applicants for payments are already in receipt of another social welfare payment which normally continues until entitlement to pension or allowance is determined. The clearance times achieved are an indication of performance in a given period having regard to all of the factors affecting entitlement. The overriding consideration is to ensure that customers receive their correct entitlement and decisions cannot be taken until all appropriate information is received. I am very conscious of the need to deliver a quality service to customers to preserve and build on the high reputation which my Department has for service to its customers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy (NAPS) uses the measure of consistent poverty, developed by the ESRI, to measure the progress made in relation to addressing the issue of poverty in Ireland. Consistent poverty uses income thresholds combined with deprivation indicators to measure the number of people or households in poverty.</P>
      <P>The revised NAPS, published by the Government in February this year, contained a new target to reduce the numbers of those who are &lsquo;consistently poor' below 2% and, if possible, eliminate consistent poverty.</P>
      <P>Recent years have seen significant reductions in the level of consistent poverty in Ireland, due, <i>inter alia,</i> to increases in employment and reductions in unemployment. In 1994, the level of consistent poverty was 15.1%. This was reduced to 6% in 2000, the latest year for which figures are available.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that there is no single way to measure poverty. No one method can provide all the answers. Income alone does not tell the whole story concerning living standards and command over resources, and it is also necessary to look more broadly at a person's exclusion from participation in society because of lack of resources. This is particularly the case in trying to capture trends in poverty in a situation of very rapid growth in average incomes such as we have experienced in this country in recent years.</P>

      <P>The revised national anti-poverty strategy, Building an Inclusive Society, launched earlier this year, recognised that its implementation would require a mobilisation of resources across a range of Departments and agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revised NAPS aimed to build on the structures already set up under the original NAPS. The institutional structures consist of the following elements: a cabinet committee on social inclusion chaired by the Taoiseach; a senior officials group to report to the cabinet committee; a national office for social inclusion under my direction; social inclusion units in key Depart<Col N="395" />ments and, on a phased basis, in local authorities; a social inclusion consultative group and forum; support from the Combat Poverty Agency; and support from the National Economic and Social Forum in terms of monitoring the social inclusion elements of partnership agreements.</P>
    <P>The implementation of this revised national anti-poverty strategy has already commenced, with the Cabinet Subcommittee on Social Inclusion and Drugs and the senior officials group on social inclusion continuing to meet on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>The process of establishing the new national office for social inclusion, which will take over the functions of the NAPS unit in my Department, is well advanced and a director of the office will be appointed in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>A technical advisory group, representative of relevant Departments and agencies is being established to assist in the development and implementation of the NAPS, and in particular in relation to the development and delivery of a NAPS data strategy. It is intended to hold the inaugural meeting of this group in November.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the National Economic and Social Forum will convene its first annual social inclusion forum early in the new year. Preparations for this forum have already begun. It will report progress on the revised NAPS to individual members and representatives of the community and voluntary and other sectors and will enable them to contribute to the process of informing the second national action plan against poverty and social exclusion required at EU level. This plan, which will be harmonised with the revised national anti-poverty strategy, is due to be submitted in summer 2003 and will run until 2005.</P>
    <P>In terms of the rollout of the NAPS to local government level, a pilot project of local authority social inclusion units set up under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, is ongoing. There are currently nine local authorities participating in this programme. The units work internally in local authorities to develop understanding of how local authority operations impact upon poverty and <i>vice versa.</i></P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear scheme is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department. The scheme assists certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school clothing and footwear. Participants in approved employment schemes, such as community employment and the back to work allowance, and recognised education and training courses, such as the back to education allowance and VTOS, can also qualify.</P>
      <P>I am happy to report that the full allocation of &euro;15 million has been taken up this year. A sum of &euro;15.1 million has been spent so far. While the closing date for applications was 30 September 2002, processing and payment of late applications is ongoing and I expect that expenditure on this year's scheme will be in the region of &euro;15.5 million.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied with the level of publicity given to this scheme. For example, I issued a press release on 19 August 2002 reminding parents that there were only six weeks left at that time to apply for the allowance. That received widespread publicity in the media.</P>
      <P>Current indications are that about 74,000 families with approximately 166,000 children will benefit from the scheme this year. This is an increase compared to 2001, when some 64,000 families with approximately 143,000 children benefited.</P>
      <P>A working group is in the process of finalising a review of the back to school clothing and footwear scheme as part of my Department's series of programme evaluation studies. The review examined all aspects of the scheme, including the rates of payment as well the income limits, the means test, time of payment, the eligibility criteria and other issues. I expect the group's report to be finalised early in the new year, at which time consideration can be given to making changes in the operation of next year's scheme.</P>

      <P>Recent data from the Quarterly National Household Survey published by the CSO show that almost 51% of persons at work aged 20 to 69 have supplementary occupational or personal pensions cover. While there are no comparable data, indications are that this coverage rate is broadly in line with the last available information from 1995. A fall in occupational coverage of employees is balanced by rising personal pensions cover of self-employed people.</P>
      <P>The Pensions Board report on the national pensions policy initiative estimated that 70% of workers over 30 years of age require supplementary pension cover if they are to maintain their pre-retirement standard of living.</P>
      <P>The Government aims to increase private pensions coverage in line with this target and, in this regard, the introduction of personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, provided for in the Pensions (Amendment) Act, 2002, will be a key instrument of this strategy. Participation in a PRSA arrangement will not be compulsory but employers will be required to facilitate their employees in this if they do not already offer a pensions scheme.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the new products will be available to the public early in 2003. An information-awareness campaign to alert the public to the need to provide themselves with additional pension cover is also planned for next year. There is a statutory requirement to review the effectiveness of the overall strategy in increasing private pensions coverage within three years.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is generally available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over. It is also available to carers and to people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme, in conjunction with the Northern Ireland concessionary travel scheme, provides free travel on cross-Border routes for pass holders of both jurisdictions.

      <P>It is acknowledged in the revised national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, that older people and women are vulnerable groups. Eurostat figures confirm that older women living alone are a particularly vulnerable group.</P>
      <P>One of the overall objectives of the revised NAPS is to eliminate consistent poverty for older people and to improve their access to appropriate health care and housing supports, and to support older people to live independent and fulfilling lives.</P>
      <P>In relation to support for our older people, the Government has committed significant resources to improving the rates of social welfare pensions. This is the most effective way of ensuring that the position of all our pensioners is improved.</P>
      <P>The action programme for the millennium set a target old age pension rate of &euro;126.97 by 2002. In the review of this programme, the Government committed to the early achievement of the &euro;126.97 rate and, furthermore, extended it to other social welfare pensions. This target was achieved one year ahead of schedule in the case of old age contributory pension and widow's contributory pension and was achieved in this year's budget for old age non-contributory pension. New targets have been set in the Government programme which will see a minimum pension rate of &euro;200 per week by 2007.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The improvements announced in budget 2002 saw the old age contributory pension increase to &euro;147.30 per week and the old age non-contribu<Col N="399" />tory pension increase to &euro;134 per week. Overall increases in old age pension rates since this Government came into office amount to between 37% and 49%.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to bringing the maximum rate of the widow's and widowers' contributory pension for those over 66 years of age into line with that of the old age contributory pension. A number of special increases have been granted in recent budgets in pursuit of this objective and the maximum rate now stands at &euro;144.80 per week against a rate of &euro;147.30 for the old age contributory pension.</P>
    <P>Other improvements in this area include changes in the assessment of capital under the means tests for non-contributory payments. There have also been significant improvements in the area of the free schemes.</P>
    <P>Older people will remain one of the major priorities for the Government and improving their position will be a priority consideration in the budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The focus of my Department's publicity campaign in the farm assist scheme is a promotional video which I announced last July and which I formally launched at the national ploughing championships. The video describes who may benefit under the scheme, how to apply and how means are calculated. It also gives practical examples of farming families who have qualified for a payment under the scheme.</P>
      <P>In the first seven months of this year, from 1 January 2002 to 26 July 2002, 734 claims for farm assist were registered. In the 12 week period from week ending 28 July 2002 to week ending 18 October 2002, 493 applications for the scheme were made. This indicates a marked increase in the rate of farm assist scheme applications since the beginning of the publicity campaign.</P>
      <P>Of the 493 farmers who applied for farm assist since end of July, 421 are still registered, the remaining 72 applicants have ceased to claim. I am including a breakdown by county of the 421 new registrants in an appendix to this reply.</P>
      <P>Of the current farm assist scheme claim load of 8,393, a total of 40 customers have requested a review in the period July 28 to October 18, 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulties that farmers and their families are encountering at present. My <Col N="400" />Department recognises these difficulties and takes account of any loss of income or any additional costs incurred due to the adverse weather conditions. The increased take-up of farm assist, as indicated, shows that increasing numbers of farmers are benefiting from the scheme.</P>
    <P>The farm assist scheme is a practical response by my Department of the plight of low-income farmers and it represents a long-term safety net for them. It not only benefits farm families with children, but provides increased payments to farming couples without children and to single farmers on low income.</P>

      <P>In addition to their pension entitlements, old age pensioners qualify for what are known as the free schemes, including the free television licence, the electricity-gas allowance and the telephone allowance. These schemes are generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who fulfil a means test. They are also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no plans at present to expand the range of services covered by the schemes to <Col N="401" />include the cost of home insurance. A review of the free schemes in 2000 suggested that the schemes as currently constituted provide a basic package of necessary household benefits for the targeted group and that no further goods and services should be covered by the schemes.</P>
    <P>However, the Government is aware of the ongoing issues in relation to insurance costs. These are being addressed by my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

      <P>Since October 1996, when responsibility for the main means-tested payment for people with disabilities, i.e. the disabled person's maintenance allowance, was transferred from the health boards to my Department, a range of significant improvements, including improvements in the means-testing arrangements, have been introduced. As a result, there has been a substantial increase in the number of recipients of disability allowance &ndash; up from 34,500 in October, 1996 to 61,774 at present, an increase of 79%.</P>
      <P>The improvements in the means-testing arrangements which have been provided for include substantial increases in the amount of earnings from rehabilitative employment which may be disregarded for means test purposes, major improvements in the method of assessing capital, exemptions of the proceeds of sale of a person's residence from means assessment and easing of the rules for payment of disability allowance where a partner is in receipt of another payment. In addition, eligibility for the back to work allowance scheme has been extended to recipients of disability allowance and blind person's pension. Under this scheme a person is allowed to retain his or her weekly payment on a sliding scale in addition to their income from employment or self-employment. While significant improvements have been made in the means-tested payments for people with disabilities in recent years, I will continue to examine the potential for further improvements in this area. Any such improvements would have to be considered in a budgetary context and having regard to other priorities.</P>

      <P>In assessing means for social assistance purposes account is taken of any cash income the person may have, together with the value of capital and property. For the purposes of assessing the value of capital and property a notional assessment method is used. The use of the notional method avoids the necessity of frequent reviews of the entitlements of a very significant number of recipients whenever interest rates fluctuate or whenever the capital is moved from one investment option into another.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 2000, provided for the introduction of a new assessment method for capital and property which came into effect in October of that year. This new method applies to all social assistance schemes other than supplementary welfare allowance. Under these arrangements the first &euro;12,697.38 of capital is disregarded and the assessment is on a sliding scale for amounts above this. At present, a single pensioner with capital of up to &euro;20,315.80 qualifies for a full pension while a single pensioner with capital of up to &euro;63,486.89 qualifies for a minimum pension.</P>
      <P>The new system continued and enhanced the policy of ensuring that those with modest amounts of capital receive the greater share of available support, whereas the small proportion of people with large amounts of capital are assured to be in a position to avail of it to contribute, at least partially, towards meeting their needs. Any changes to the current method of assessment of capital and property would have significant financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 42, and 46 together.</P>
      <P>The current dispute referred to applies only to dental benefit and not to optical benefit. The dispute between my Department and the Irish Dental Association arose out of a claim by the association for substantial increases in the fees payable to dentists under the scheme and the imposition of increased charges by some dentists in breach of the contractual arrangements for the provision of dental benefit. The action by dentists started in early March this year.</P>
      <P>Patients continued to be treated under the scheme at that stage while efforts were made to find a resolution to the underlying issue. In the absence of a resolution, my Department ceased to accept claims from dentists who were not prepared to adhere to the contractual arrangements in early August. However, the scheme continued to operate and patients continued to be treated by dentists who were prepared to adhere to their contracts.</P>
      <P>Due to the progress made in the discussions with the Irish Dental Association on 9 October the association agreed to recommend to its members to return to operating the dental benefit scheme.</P>
      <P>The level of inquiries from dental practitioners in relation to their patients entitlements under the scheme are now at or close to pre-dispute levels, suggesting that most if not all dentists in dispute are operating the scheme.</P>
      <P>The negotiations are being resumed on 1 November and I look forward to a fair and equitable conclusion. Because of time lags between authorisation of claims and the issue of payments to dentists in respect of treatment provided, it will be some months before the impact of the resumption can be properly assessed. For the same reason it will be some months before the impact on scheme expenditure will be available. It is only then that an indication will be available of the extent to which persons have opted for private treatment or delayed treatment until the dispute was resolved.</P>
      <P>To benefit under the scheme, insured persons must be treated by a dentist who has contracted to provide services. During the dispute, insured workers were advised through the newspapers to check that their dentist was not imposing increased charges prior to starting treatment. Patients were advised that, where dentists offered to treat people as private patients, this is outside the terms of the dental benefit scheme and the Department will not be in a position to refund any costs arising. Those who could not obtain treatment under the scheme during the short period when service was disrupted should now be able to receive treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="404" />I want to refute any suggestion that my objective in this dispute was to save money. My objectives was to preserve the scheme for the benefit of insured persons and this is still my objective in the context of the discussions which are now taking place.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by some 80 private transport operators. The vast majority of these private contractors operate in rural areas. The underlying feature of the scheme is the use of spare capacity.</P>
      <P>My Department is always willing to consider further applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme. While my Department pays transport providers to operate the free travel scheme, it is not in a position to provide services where none exists.</P>
      <P>In this regard, an interdepartmental committee on rural transport has commissioned a study on the availability of transport services in rural areas. I understand the study is nearing completion and will be published before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, 33 community groups have been selected to receive funding under the rural transport initiative, RTI. The aim of the funding is to encourage innovative community-based initiatives to provide transport services in rural areas with a view to addressing the issue of social exclusion in rural Ireland which is caused by lack of access to transport. This initiative is being managed by Area Development Management, ADM, on behalf of the Department of Transport and funding of approximately &euro;6 million has been provided for this purpose.</P>
      <P>My Department is in discussions with Department of Transport and ADM on the role of the free travel scheme in regard to these pilot projects.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>Child benefit is payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years and continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education or who have a physical or mental disability.</P>
      <P>The family income supplement, FIS, scheme is designed to provide an incentive for low-paid workers with families to take up or remain in full-time employment. It provides a weekly payment related to income and family size. A qualified child for the purpose of the scheme must be under the age of 18 or, if in full-time education, aged between 18 and 22.</P>
      <P>Apprenticeship courses consist of a combination of paid employment plus block release during which a training allowance is paid by FÁS. The rate of pay is determined by the relevant industry body but can be substantial. Periods on apprenticeship courses are not regarded as periods of full-time education for the purpose of child benefit or family income supplement and there are no plans to extend the qualification criteria to include such periods. Any further extension of child benefit or the payment of the child dependent increase would have to be considered in a budgetary context in the light of available resources and overall priorities.</P>

      <P>Child poverty was identified as a central issue for consideration in the review of the national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS. Children have been identified as one of a number of groups that are vulnerable to poverty. As a result, one of the objectives of the revised NAPS, Building an Inclusive Society, in line with the national children's strategy, is to eliminate child poverty and to move to greater equality for all children in terms of access to appropriate education, health and housing, thus breaking the cycle of disadvantage and exclusion experienced by certain children in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the revised NAPS contains a commitment to set the equivalence rate for basic child income support at 33% to 35% of the minimum adult social welfare payment rate. This commit<Col N="406" />ment is allied to one which aims to achieve, by 2007, a rate of &euro;150 per week &ndash; in 2002 terms &ndash; for the lowest rates of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Other targets relevant to children in the revised NAPS include halving the proportion of pupils with serious literacy difficulties by 2006; reducing the number of young people who leave the school system early, so that the percentage of those who complete upper second level or equivalent will reach 85% by 2003 and 90% by 2006; reducing the gap in low birth weight rates between children from the lowest and highest socio-economic groups by 10% from the current level by 2007.</P>
    <P>The most recent data supplied by the Economic and Social Research Institute suggest that we are continuing to make significant inroads on the level of child poverty in Ireland. Consistent poverty for children fell from 16.9% in 1997 to 12% in 1998 and further to 8% in 2000, underlining the positive effects that falling unemployment has on households with children.</P>
    <P>Child benefit offers a most effective means of channelling income support to low-income families in order to tackle child poverty. Payments now amount to &euro;117.60 for the first and second children and &euro;147.30 for third and subsequent children &ndash; a trebling of payments since 1997. The investment of the past two years has yet to be reflected in the child poverty rates as the latest poverty figures relate to the year 2000.</P>
    <P>Finally, the national children's strategy contains an ambitious series of policy objectives in relation to children for the next decade and provides us with a framework through which we can significantly improve the lives of all our children.</P>

      <P>The recent CSO survey on pensions coverage showed that just over 50% of workers have supplementary pensions cover. The Government aims to increase this to 70% in accordance with the targets suggested in the national pensions policy initiative. The overall objective of the Government's pension policy is that all citizens will have an adequate income on retirement, the main components being the social welfare pension and occupational pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, the Pensions (Amendment) Act, 2002, provides for the introduction of PRSAs, which will be available to the public in early 2003.

      <Quest>when the supplementary welfare allowance payment to asylum seekers, under the direct provisions scheme, was last increased; her proposals for a further increase in this payment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The income maintenance needs of asylum seekers are met for the most part through the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme administered by the health boards. The main objective of the scheme is to make up the difference between a person's means whether in cash or in kind and their needs. Where a person has access to some resources in kind or in cash, through the social welfare system or otherwise, the relevant legislation requires that this be taken into account in determining entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>This is the case with asylum seekers who arrived since 10 April 2000. They are provided with full board accommodation, including all meals and other services under the system of direct provision operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In such cases, the recommended weekly allowance is &euro;19.10 per adult and &euro;9.60 per child to provide for personal requisites. Furthermore, exceptional needs payments are made by the health boards in cases where they are deemed to be appropriate.</P>
      <P>A small number of asylum seekers are in receipt of other social welfare payments such as one-parent family payments, pensions and disability allowance. In addition, asylum seekers with children are entitled to child benefit.</P>
      <P>A working group was established in April 2000 to examine the issues relating to assessment of need for supplementary welfare allowance purposes. Among the issues examined by the group are the existing arrangements for the payment of basic weekly supplementary welfare allowance to people who have means other than cash to partly meet their basic needs and the payment rate appropriate to asylum seekers in direct provision. The group's report is currently being examined in my Department and I hope to be in a position to address the issues raised in the near future.</P>

      <P>My Department has a comprehensive control programme which includes checks and reviews carried out on a regular and targeted basis to ensure that social welfare payments are only received by those who are entitled to them and that employers and the self-employed are fulfilling their PRSI obligations. Over the years, the reorganisation of my Department's structures and ongoing technology developments have combined to facilitate a more co-ordinated, more focused and more effective approach to control.</P>
      <P>There are more than 600 staff working full-time or part-time on fraud and abuse control activities, including specific investigation units which work at local, regional and national levels within the Department. These units, one of which works in conjunction with Revenue staff, carry out inspections of employers in relation to their PRSI obligations, investigate cases of concurrent working while claiming social welfare payments, review customers' means for assistance payments and monitor their ongoing entitlements to social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>My Department's medical assessors medically examine recipients of illness payments to ensure they fulfil the medical conditions for the receipt of these payments.</P>
      <P>As a result of control activities carried out by these staff, savings amounting to &euro;269 million were achieved in 2001 and a further &euro;211 million has been saved during the first nine months of 2002. In addition, my Department has introduced a new over payment recovery procedure. Prosecutions are considered in all serious cases of social welfare fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The control programme is carefully monitored and the various measures are continuously refined to ensure that they remain effective. I am pleased to report that since taking up office, my Department has completed a comprehensive analysis of existing control strategies. Arising from this, the following are in the course of completion: a revised control strategy for the Department with specific strategies for each scheme; a risk analysis of schemes in relation to fraud and error; a value for money study of control procedures and processes, being carried out with the Comptroller and Auditor General; development of an enhanced debt management and recovery process; enhanced structures and reporting mechanisms in relation to supplementary welfare payments, being carried out in conjunction with the <Col N="409" />health boards; specialised identity verification training for staff at local level.</P>
    <P>I am committed to ensuring that social welfare payments are available to those who are entitled to them and that they are delivered in an effective and efficient way. I am also determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected and I will take whatever steps are necessary to achieve this.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme is administered on my Department's behalf by the community welfare service in the health boards. The scheme is currently being reviewed by an interdepartmental working group chaired by my Department, as part of my Department's series of expenditure reviews.</P>
      <P>The current review is a fundamental appraisal of the scheme aimed primarily at improving customer service and administrative efficiency. All aspects of the scheme are being examined. The review also provides an opportunity to address the role of the health boards' community welfare service generally in tackling poverty and social exclusion.</P>
      <P>A wide consultation process was undertaken which resulted in 145 submissions being received by the group. Progress in this review has been slower than anticipated due mainly to the number and nature of the issues raised. In view of that, the working group proposed earlier this year to draw up an interim report. Work on that has not yet commenced, however, but will be re-examined early next year when I expect that sufficient progress will have been made to enable the production of an interim report.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for 2001 ewe premium on 50 breeding ewes and 100 hoggets. The application was received in my Department on 29 December 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 25 March 2001 the entire sheep flock of the person named was culled as a precautionary measure in the foot and mouth disease crisis. One hundred and forty-three of the sheep slaughtered, 64 ewes and 79 hoggets, would have been potentially eligible for the ewe premium scheme if the person named complied with the terms and conditions of the scheme. My Department is not satisfied that he did, as he purchased 79 sheep in February 2001 at three marts on six different days. He has been unable to satisfy my Department that he had the number of sheep that he entered for the ewe premium scheme in his ownership and possession at the date of lodgement of his application and that he maintained those sheep on his holding. His flock register does not support various claims he has made in regard to the sale of sheep and the killing of sheep by dogs. He appealed the decision to refuse ewe premium to a regional inspector in my Department and later to the headage and premia appeals unit. <Col N="412" />Neither review saw any reason to alter the decision already made. As the person named was unable to show that he had not made an irregular application by applying for premium on sheep which were not in his ownership and possession on the date of lodgement of his application, he was debarred from the 2002 ewe premium scheme in accordance with EU regulations, in addition to being refused 2001 ewe premium.</P>
    <P>The person named lodged an area aid application for 2001 and under that application established a forage area of 13.07 hectares for suckler cow, special beef and extensification premium purposes. The person named lodged a suckler cow premium application on 23 March 2001. He had a suckler cow quota for 17 cows and would have been considered for payment on 17 animals if he had sufficient forage area to support that number. His forage area, however, was only 13.07 hectares and there is a limit of two livestock units per hectare on suckler cow and special beef premium payments combined. The maximum number of livestock units that can be taken into account for payment purposes is 13.07 multiplied by 2, equal to 26.14. In calculating the number of suckler cow grants that can be paid, account must be taken of the number of ewes for which ewe premium was applied. That number was 150 and at a livestock unit value of 0.15 each they account for 22.5 of the 26.14 livestock units available for payment. Accordingly, only 3.64 suckler cows can be considered for premium. Payable orders amounting to &euro;750.39 premium and &euro;9.75 compensation will issue shortly. Even if the herd of the person named had not been depopulated he would not have qualified for any more suckler cow premium or euro compensation in view of his high stocking density.</P>
    <P>The person named lodged an application for special beef premium on 9 April 2001 but since the animals on the application were already slaughtered the application could not be considered. In any event the forage area available to him would not have been sufficient to cover both suckler cow and special beef premium payments. As indicated, the forage area was not even sufficient to cover the entire suckler cow application. The foot and mouth disease compensation paid to the person named for the slaughter of his animals took the loss of EU slaughter premium into account.</P>
    <P>The person named was also an applicant for extensification premium under the census system. In order to qualify for the high rate of premium he would have needed to have an average stocking density throughout the year of less than 1.6 livestock units per hectare and to qualify for the low rate of premium the stocking density would have to be less than 2.0 livestock units per hectare.</P>
    <P>The first census date for 2001 was 11 March. On that date, the person named had cattle that were equivalent to 44.8 livestock units. Averaging this number over the five census dates gives 8.96 and after the application of a 20% reduction on <Col N="413" />foot of a concession granted by the EU the number of bovine livestock units to be taken into account for stocking density purposes is 7.168. This figure and the number of livestock units attributable to the sheep entered for the ewe premium scheme, 22.5, gives the total livestock units to be taken into account for extensification premium purposes, 29.668. When 29.668 is divided by the forage area of 13.07 hectares it gives a stocking density of 2.2699. This is in excess of the 2.0 livestock units per forage hectare necessary to qualify for extensification premium.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the suckler cow premium and euro compensation already mentioned there are no further premium payments due to the person named for 2001. The person named was paid compensation under the foot and mouth disease compensation scheme amounting to &euro;34,633.71.</P>

      <P>As was indicated in a reply given to the House on Tuesday, 15 October 2002, Ireland's debt strategy for developing countries was launched publicly last July. The debt strategy document, prepared jointly by Ireland Aid and the Department of Finance, was forwarded to Ireland's representatives at the IMF and the World Bank in advance of the recent annual meetings of these institutions. Both executive boards are fully aware of Ireland's policy on developing country debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind the Deputy of the Government position on debt cancellation as stated in the debt strategy document. We have concluded that, in principle, the total cancellation of the debts of the heavily indebted poor countries, HIPC, is a politically acceptable objective and one that we would <Col N="414" />support. Total cancellation would have to be funded largely through additional donor contributions. In order to mobilise the necessary funds for total debt cancellation, a greater number of donors, particularly the larger economies, would have to increase their ODA more rapidly and take concrete steps to meeting the UN target of 0.7% of GNP on ODA.</P>
    <P>The total cancellation of HIPC debts should be accompanied by strong monitoring and accountability mechanisms to ensure that the additional funds available to HIPC Governments, through debt cancellation, would be directly channelled into increased social expenditure, particularly in respect of HIV and AIDS.</P>
    <P>While we support, in principle, the total cancellation of HIPC debts we believe that, in practice, the additional donor contributions required to achieve this will be difficult to mobilise. The additional ODA commitments made by major donors &ndash; EU and US &ndash; at the international conference on financing for development would not be sufficient to cover total debt cancellation. In any case, these contributions will be used to fund a number of development activities and not just debt relief.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 to 65, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The general position is that where architectural planning for a building project has commenced, decisions on projects proceeding to tender and construction are taken in the light of the annual allocation for primary school buildings, the financial commitments to be met and the priority to be afforded to individual projects. In view of the extensive nature of the programme, my Department has no plans at present to start architectural planning for further major primary school building projects.</P>
      <P>My Department will be reviewing the position in the light of the allocation to be made for the primary building programme in the 2003 Estimates. The most up to date position on all major building projects is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie. When the situation changes the website will be updated. In the meantime, boards of management should ensure that essential health and safety issues at each school are attended to. They should therefore continue to use the devolved grant for minor works and if the cost of any works of an emergency nature exceeds the amount available under the devolved grant, they may apply to my Department's building unit for grant aid.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the submission on music in the primary school on behalf of the Forum for Music in Ireland, March 2001, and the extensive range of recommendations contained therein for the improvement of music in the primary school. I note, in particular, the importance placed by the forum on music in the primary school and its welcome for the music section of the primary curriculum 1999.</P>
      <P>In November 2001, my Department availed of an opportunity offered by the forum at a plenary meeting of its members to respond in some detail to the submission and to its recommendations. Many of the forum's recommendations are dealt with in the content objectives of the new music curriculum, in the very comprehensive teacher guidelines that accompany the curriculum, and in ongoing initiatives by my Department and its agencies.</P>
      <P>Support for schools and teachers is now a key element in the implementation of curricula. My Department will support the implementation of the music curriculum through the provision of in-service for teachers. The in-career development unit of my Department also continues to support other training initiatives from schools and teacher groups in the area of music education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to material support for music education, my Department has already provided over &euro;7.5 million in grant aid for arts education, including music education, at primary level and will consider the further provision of a special <Col N="419" />curriculum grant when the music element of the revised primary curriculum is being implemented. As with all curricular initiatives, the need to support the implementation of the music curriculum will be kept under review within my Department. In this regard, the views of the forum are welcome and have been noted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Advisory Council for English Language Schools, ACELS, operates under the aegis of my Department and is responsible for the quality assurance of the teaching of English as a foreign language in Ireland. ACELS regulations stipulate that teachers must have a primary degree, or equivalent, and a TEFL, teaching English as a foreign language, course of a minimum 70 hours duration. The degree requirement is fully supported by industry and teachers' associations that are represented on the board of directors of ACELS. Holding a primary degree is a prerequisite for accreditation schemes around the world and can be considered as an international norm where English language teaching is concerned. Ireland's growing reputation as a provider of quality English language teaching would be seriously jeopardised, if the degree requirement were to be removed. For these reasons, no change is contemplated in the regulation concerning teachers' qualifications.</P>
      <P>At present there is no recognition scheme for TEFL teacher training courses. In accordance with its remit to control standards in teacher training, both initial and in-career, for EFL teachers in Ireland, the ACELS initiated a project in 2000 to recognise such courses and qualifications and to provide a framework for professional development for English language teachers in Ireland. This project has involved all the major stakeholders in the country through regular consultation. Following on from this, it is proposed that the recognition scheme will be implemented in March 2003. Under this scheme, all teachers who successfully complete courses, which are recognised in accordance with the key standards and guidelines, will be registered with the ACELS once they are employed by a recognised language school in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="420" />From March 2003, when the teacher training scheme is implemented, all trainees wishing to work in a recognised school will need to successfully complete a course that meets the key standards and guidelines. However, teachers currently working in recognised language schools, who meet the requirements as they stand, will be able to continue teaching in the recognised sector.</P>

Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;65 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

      <P>The information as set out in my reply to the Deputy's question of 17 October 2002 is accurate in respect of the current position of the occupational therapy services. It is acknowledged that there are substantial waiting lists for the various therapy services. In this connection, it was pointed out that efforts are under way to increase the numbers of therapists that are currently available to the health boards in a bid to reduce waiting lists in this regard. It will be a number of years before substantial improvements are made in terms of the numbers of occupational therapists available. In the meantime, my Department is currently engaging with the Department of the Environment and Local Government with a view to streamlining assessment procedures for the disabled persons' grant for housing modification and I will be in touch with the Deputy as soon as possible with the outcome of these discussions. As the Eastern Regional Health Authority is responsible for the provision of health related services in the eastern region, I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the chief executive officer with a request that the statistical information requested by the Deputy is forwarded as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>Since 1 January 1993, general practitioners have been allocated an annual target budget for expenditure on drugs for their GMS patients. This scheme is called the indicative drug target saving scheme. Targets are determined by national norms and form part of an agreement between my Department and the Irish Medical Organisation.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to limit the escalation of the annual costs of GMS drugs, general practitioners participating in the scheme are permitted to accrue savings under this scheme which can then be used to fund general practice developments at their practice premises for the benefit of their patients. Applications for funds from the scheme must be formally approved by the local health board in advance of payment by the GMS payments board.</P>
      <P>A review of the scheme undertaken by Professor Michael Murphy, which was published in July 1997, found that there were changes in prescribing behaviour as a result of the scheme. Some doctors made savings through enhanced prescribing of generic medications and there were no discernible negative effects on the overall quality of prescribing.</P>

      <P>Arising from the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, one of the key actions for dealing with the public hospital waiting lists was the establishment of the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF. The NTPF was set up in April and referred its first patients for treatment at the end of June.</P>
      <P>Health boards and hospitals have been asked to identify public hospital patients waiting longest on in-patient lists, so that they can be offered treatment under this initiative. The NTPF is initially concentrating on adults who have been waiting on in-patient lists for more than 12 months and children waiting for more than six months. Public patients, who satisfy this criteria can apply to their GP, hospital consultant or to their local health board liaison person to seek to have their treatment carried out under the NTPF. The patient's consent to being treated under this scheme is also sought. Capacity is sourced by the NTPF and patients are referred for treatment.</P>
      <P>To date, capacity has been sourced in private hospitals in Ireland, Northern Ireland and in England. In the current year the NTPF expects to treat up to 2,000 patients and from January 2003 it expects to refer 600 patients per month for treatment. To date, approximately 1,000 patients have been treated under this initiative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national children's strategy, published by the Government in November 2000, provides for new arrangements which are intended to bring a better focus and greater impact to Government <Col N="428" />activity in relation to children through stronger leadership and co-ordination. These new arrangements, which are now in place, include the following. First, the Cabinet Committee on Children meets on a quarterly basis to review progress in implementing the strategy and to agree priorities for action. Second, there is a broader role for the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan. The Minister of State reports to the Cabinet committee on progress made in implementing the strategy.</P>
      <P>Third, the National Children's Advisory Council has an independent advisory role in relation to the implementation of the strategy and provides advice to the Minister of State in that regard. The council maintains the partnership approach developed through the strategy to influencing policy on children's issues. It has a membership of 30 and includes representatives of the statutory agencies, voluntary sector, research community, parents and children.</P>
      <P>Fourth, the National Children's Office leads and oversees implementation of the national children's strategy. This involves progressing actions under the three national goals of the strategy. These include children having a voice &ndash; greater participation and listening to children's views; children's lives will be better understood &ndash; improved information and research; and children will receive quality support and services.</P>
      <P>There are two important aspects to the work of the National Children's Office. First, individual Departments retain responsibility for implementing the strategy and the office co-ordinates and monitors progress in this regard. Second, the office progresses actions under the three national goals of the strategy in regard to certain key policy issues identified by the Cabinet committee as priorities and which require cross-departmental action.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet committee has assigned the lead role to the National Children's Office in three key policy areas which require cross-departmental action. These include co-ordinating and monitoring the implementation of the Children Act, 2001, co-ordinating and monitoring the implementation of the national youth homelessness strategy and the development of national play and recreation policies. Substantial progress has been made to date in implementing the national children's strategy. Funding of £3.815 million has been provided to the National Children's Office in 2002 to support it in its role in the implementation of the strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to promoting the strategy at national level, progress in the three priority areas identified by the Cabinet committee includes the following. First, co-ordinating and monitoring the implementation of the Children Act, 2001. The Cabinet committee decided that the National Children's Office should take the lead role in <Col N="429" />relation to co-ordinating the implementation of the Children Act, 2001. The office has established a working group for this purpose which comprises high level representation from this Department and the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science and their respective local level agencies. The working group meets regularly to review progress in implementing the Act and to bring forward further proposals for implementation. Progress reports were submitted by the working group to the Cabinet committee in March and September this year. To date, the Cabinet committee has approved proposals prepared by the working group relating to the provisions of the Act to be commenced in 2002 and 2003. The first commencement order under the Act came into force on 1 May 2002.</P>
    <P>Second, the National Children's Office has been assigned responsibility by the Cabinet committee in relation to co-ordinating and monitoring the implementation of the national youth homelessness strategy, which was published in late 2001. The health boards have lead responsibility for implementation of the strategy and they have prepared detailed action plans in this regard. These plans are to be phased in over 2002-04. The National Children's Office is setting up a monitoring committee, representative of the relevant stakeholders, which will hold its first meeting shortly.</P>
    <P>Third, regarding developing national play and recreation policies, it is proposed to address the play needs of children under 12 years of age in a national policy. It is hoped to submit the play policy to Government by the end of the year. The recreation needs of older children will follow next year and research to inform the national recreation policy is currently out to tender.</P>
    <P>The holding of an annual Dáil na nÓg was identified in the strategy as a measure to support the first national goal of the strategy that children will have a voice. The first Dáil na nÓg took place on Wednesday, 5 September 2001 in the Mansion House, Dublin. Dáil na nÓg 2002 took place on Friday, 11 October 2002 at the same venue and, as in 2001, over 200 children between the ages of eight years and 17 years, representative of every county and socio-economic group, attended. The event was hosted by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan. Over 155 of the delegates to Dáil na nÓg 2002 were selected by the county and city development boards, many of them through a local Comhairle na nÓg. The remaining delegates were nominated to represent minority groups.</P>
    <P>The agenda for Dáil na nÓg 2002 included debates on the environment and on drug and alcohol abuse, and included a 30 minute question time where the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, responded to questions put down by the <Col N="430" />delegates on children's issues. A report of Dáil na nÓg 2002 is close to finalisation and will be circulated shortly.</P>
    <P>With regard to research, on 5 April 2002, the then Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and the former Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Hanafin, jointly announced the decision of the Government to establish Ireland's first long-term study of children growing up in this country. A longitudinal study was identified in the strategy as a key measure to achieve the national goal that children's lives will be better understood. The study will monitor the development of 18,000 children from different backgrounds &ndash; 10,000 from birth and 8,000 nine year olds &ndash; through to adulthood, yielding important information about each significant transition throughout their young lives. It will seek to identify the circumstances which allow children to thrive and those which hinder children's development. A request for tender to carry out the study is due to be published in 2002.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, the former Minister of State with special responsibility for children, Deputy Hanafin, invited applications for the 2002 national children's strategy research awards. Funding of &euro;200,000 is being provided for new projects. One masters scholarship, two doctoral scholarships and one post doctoral fellowship have been awarded to commence in the academic year 2002-03. This recent round of the fellowship programme builds on the two scholarships awarded last year, which will be completed in 2003 and 2004.</P>
    <P>With regard to promoting the strategy at local level, city and county development boards, CDBs, have been identified as the key bodies to lead implementation of the strategy at local level by ensuring that children's issues, as identified in the strategy, are addressed in their strategies for economic, social and cultural development. Children's participation in the development of these strategies has been highlighted as an important aspect of these local plans. A number of the local strategies, already published, have identified their role in the implementation of the national children's strategy. A number of CDBs around the country have developed local play policies in anticipation of the national initiative referred to earlier and Comhairle na nÓg has been established in most CDB areas to give children a voice at local level and to select/elect delegates for Dáil na nÓg.</P>
    <P>A series of nationwide visits by the Minister of State with special responsibility for children and officials of the National Children's Office commenced in February 2001. The purpose of these fora was to promote the strategy among children, families and local communities and to build their support and involvement in the implementation of the national children's strategy. Six fora were <Col N="431" />held and a total of some 1,500 people, including children, attended to hear about the strategy.</P>

      <Quest>if the Government will provide immediate funding for the vital roll out of BreastCheck and cervical screening; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. The target population consists of approximately 136,000 women and it represents about 50% of the national target population. To the end of August this year, 91,906 women had been called for screening and 68,184 women have been screened, representing an uptake of 74%. I understand that BreastCheck is on target to complete phase one of the programme by December 2002.</P>
      <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and it is essential that the programme is driven by international quality assurance criteria and best practice. The board of BreastCheck has recently submitted a business plan to my Department for the national expansion of the programme. My Department is currently discussing the plan with BreastCheck and especially the linkages with the existing symptomatic breast disease services. I am committed to the national extension of BreastCheck and a decision in relation to this will be considered in the context of the overall investment programme for cancer services for 2003.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, any woman irrespective of her age or residence who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area. Phase one of the national cervical screening programme is in operation in the Mid-Western Health Board since October 2000. Under the national health strategy, a commitment has been given to the full extension of the cervical screening programme to the rest of the country. The experience gained from phase one should be of assistance in the context of implementing this commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process of planning and organising the national programme is a major undertaking with significant logistical and resource implications that requires careful consideration. Accordingly, following discussions with my Department on the matter, the chief executive officers of the health <Col N="432" />boards initiated an examination of the feasibility and implications of a roll out of the national programme. I understand the chief executive officers will be reporting on the outcome of the examination soon.</P>

      <P>I recently met with the chairperson of the board of the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, regarding the proposed transfer of a small number of specialist paediatric and neonatal surgical operations to Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin. By way of background to this issue the Deputy will be <Col N="435" />aware that the future provision and extent of paediatric surgery services was reviewed in 1998 by a committee established by Comhairle na nOspideal. The committee was asked to consider this issue in the absence of agreement among the three paediatric hospitals on the nature and structure of a replacement consultant paediatric surgeon post which had arisen at Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin.</P>
      <P>Comhairle recommended the concentration of a very small number of specialist paediatric and neonatal surgical operations in Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, with all three paediatric hospitals continuing to provide non-specialist paediatric surgery and less complex urology services. I am advised by Comhairle that a very small percentage of the children undergoing paediatric surgical procedures at Temple Street would require access to the specialist surgical services under consideration. However, I am also aware of the concerns which have been raised by Temple Street hospital in relation to the proposed transfer of this work.</P>
      <P>I propose to have further discussions with Comhairle and the Eastern Regional Health Authority with a view to progressing an early resolution to the continuing difficulties in this area. In the wider context I will also be progressing a national review of paediatric services. The review will focus on the future organisation and delivery of hospital services for children. The aim of the review will be to enhance the range and level of services available at regional level and to determine the most effective configuration of tertiary service. The scope for developing certain highly specialised services on an all-island basis will also be explored.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>Irish regulations require that, subject to certain exemptions, every vehicle and every trailer attached to a vehicle should be equipped with wings or other similar devices to catch, so far as practicable, mud or water thrown up by the rotation of the wheels, unless adequate protection is afforded by the body of the vehicle.</P>
      <P>Directive 91/226/EEC sets out the technical requirements which a spray suppression system must meet in order to obtain EC type approval certification for heavy goods vehicles. The purpose of the directive is to ensure that national standards for spray suppression equipment do not constitute barriers to trade. The directive ensures this by setting type approval standards and requiring that the sale of new vehicles fitted with the specified equipment may not be prohibited in any member state.</P>
      <P>While the directive does not require member states to make spray suppression systems obligatory, it is my intention to introduce regulations which will make the fitting of such systems mandatory on new vehicles. Retro-fitting spray suppression systems to vehicles already in use poses certain technical difficulties and has significant cost implications especially in the case of older vehicles. However, the question of requiring spray suppression systems on all vehicles is under consideration in the context of the proposed regulations to implement Directive 91/226/EEC. I expect that preparation of these regulations will be finalised shortly.</P>

      <P>A pilot campaign by Dublin City Council to encourage the use of daytime running lights on a voluntary basis in the greater Dublin area has recently been completed. I understand that evaluation of the effects of the campaign is being conducted currently for the city council.</P>
      <P>The European Commission decided recently to undertake a comprehensive study into the use of daytime running lights, DLR. The general aim of the project is to assess the positive road safety effects of DLR use and to investigate possible and perceived negative effects, including effects on vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and motor cyclists. It is intended that the results of the study should inform the future requirements of the European Union in this regard.</P>
      <P>Decisions in regard to the use of daytime running lights in Ireland will take account of the evaluation of the Dublin City Council pilot campaign and the outcome of the comprehensive European Commission study.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116, 128 and 129 together.</P>
      <P>The National Roads Authority, NRA, carried out a nationwide seat belt survey in 1999 which showed that driver seat belt wearing rate increased marginally over the eight year period from 51% in 1991 to 55% in 1999. The survey also showed that male driver wearing rates declined slightly from 49% to 48%, female driver wearing rates increased from 61% in 1991 to 68% in 1999. The wearing rates for rear seat passengers in 1999 was 20%.</P>
      <P>The NRA has carried out a further comprehensive seat belt survey this year. While the report is not yet finalised, preliminary indications show that substantial progress has been made in relation to seat belt wearing. The results of this survey will be available shortly.</P>
      <P>The National Roads Authority carried out speed surveys on inter-urban sections of national routes in 1997 which showed widespread exceedance of speed limits, with 40% of cars exceeding the 60 m.p.h. speed limit and 26% exceeding the 70 m.p.h. motorway limit.</P>
      <P>A national speed survey of free speeds was also carried out by the National Roads Authority in 1999 and published in 2000. The results of those surveys indicate that 51% of cars exceed the general speed limit of 60 m.p.h. on two lane national primary routes, with 13% in excess of 70 m.p.h.</P>
      <P>Following these surveys, the high level group on road safety recommended in their second progress report that a revised target for speeding to reduce the number of vehicles exceeding the 60 mph speed limit on single carriageway national primary routes from 51% to 40% by 2002 should be set for the remainder of the strategy.</P>
      <P>The NRA has subsequently carried out a sample free speed survey, based on a subset of the original sites from the 1999 survey and has also carried out a comprehensive speed survey, the results of which will be available shortly. Preliminary indications from this survey show that improvements have been made in relation to speeding on rural roads. The results of both and the seat belt survey will be used to gauge progress since 1999 and as a benchmark for future strategies.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive review of speed limits was carried out in Ireland between 1990 and 1992. This left urban speed limits unchanged at 30 mph and 40 mph, but increased the speed limit for heavy goods vehicles from 40 mph to 50 mph and the general speed limit from 55 mph to 60 mph. The motorway speed limit of 70 mph was introduced in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Changes to this regime are not proposed in the immediate term, the priority must instead be to secure a much higher level of compliance with existing limits. However, the Government does not rule out the option of revising speed limits if enforcement of existing limits does not show good progress towards the road safety strategy goal of reducing present excessive levels of speed<Col N="443" />ing by 50%. The situation continues to be monitored in line with this approach.</P>

      <Quest>when he intends to introduce random breath testing and reduce the blood alcohol content to 50 milligrams; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)">

      <P>The Road Traffic Act, 2002, extends the grounds on which a member of the Garda Síochána may require a driver to provide a preliminary breath specimen to include situations where a driver is involved in a road accident, or where the Garda considers that a road traffic offence has been committed. This is in addition to the present grounds where the Garda has formed an opinion that a driver has consumed alcohol.</P>
      <P>The steps being taken in the Act represent a move towards random breath testing however, by extending the grounds on which a member of the Garda can request a preliminary breath specimen, but maintain an efficient use of resources. This is the most effective and targeted manner in which we can use the resources available to us and equates to standard practice in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Government policy as set out in the current road safety strategy states clearly that a move towards unqualified random breath testing is not envisaged within the period of the strategy given its possible negative implications for wider public attitudes to and co-operation with the Garda. The approach which is now being taken will lead to a significant improvement in driver behaviour with subsequent benefits for road safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish position on proposals to reduce the blood alcohol content to 50 milligrams is based on the principles set out in the Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002. These recognise the relatively recent introduction of the 80 milligrams blood alcohol limit in Ireland and the consequent priority to improve compliance with this requirement rather than to move to new limits. We apply an 80 milligrams limit with very strict application of driving disqualification. Lower blood alcohol limits operating in some countries do not necessarily attract such strict penalties. The strategy also states that in con<Col N="444" />sidering the adequacy of the present 80 milligrams limit in Ireland the Government will have regard to developments internationally, as well as progress towards relevant national road safety targets.</P>

      <P>The Government Strategy on Road Safety 1998-2002 recognises that the influence of drugs on driving behaviour is an issue of increasing concern. Identification of the presence of drugs is however more complex than for alcohol. Consequently, considerably more work is needed to develop a more detailed regulatory regime in relation to drugs and driving. A number of research programmes are being carried out internationally in this area and the strategy commits the Government to monitoring and assessing these developments.</P>
      <P>In order to advance research in relation to drugs and driving in Ireland, my Department has provided additional funds of some &euro;250,000 to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, MBRS, over 2000 and 2001 for a two-year programme of drug analysis of blood and urine specimens.</P>
      <P>The analysis of 2000 specimens for the presence of drugs by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety was completed in 2001. The preliminary findings of the survey showed that 37% of samples screened were positive for drugs. The extensive survey conducted during 2000 and 2001 will identify true trends in the types of drugs being taken, their combination with alcohol and the extent of polydrug use. The confirmation analysis of specimens here continued in 2002 and the data collection and report is scheduled for publication towards the end of 2002.</P>
      <P>These early findings underline the Government's view expressed in the road safety strategy that drugs and driving is an issue of growing concern. While it is too early to draw definitive conclusions, the research programme when completed will, along with other international analysis and research in this area, inform development of better testing methods for the presence of drugs, changes in enforcement practice and procedures and, possibly, changes to existing legislation.</P>
      <P>The MBRS is aware that screening devices have been developed for roadside drug testing. Such testing devices are in prototype stages and the MBRS is keeping abreast of developments in this area.</P>

      <P>The Government's strategy on road safety recognises that telematics, or intelligent transport systems, ITS has great potential to improve the overall management of transportation, including road safety. It is Government policy that the relevant Irish transport authorities should support the application both of developments in the field of ITS to road safety, drawing on international work in this field.</P>
      <P>Practical examples of the application of ITS in Ireland include the real-time parking information signs in Dublin and the variable information signs on the approaches to Kildare. The introduction of variable signage on the M50 for traffic management and road safety purposes is also well advanced.</P>
      <P>ITS is an unfolding concept and further progress in exploiting it, particularly for road safety purposes will depend on the pace and scope of developments in the field. Accordingly, my Department has recently joined ERTCO which is a European body concerned with the promotion of telematics on road and public transport in Europe which will help inform future developments in Ireland. My Department is currently considering the role of telematics as part of a future transport research programme.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Dublin City Council in association with the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the National Roads Authority, Trinity College Dublin and my Department, has organised a conference on ITS for early November. One of the main objectives of the conference is to promote increased understanding of the potential contribution of ITS to improved traffic management, which would include road safety, as well as public transport in Ireland.</P>

      <P>My Department is committed to the full and effective implementation of the Freedom of Information &ndash; FOI &ndash; Act, and disclosure of information is made in accordance with the law in all cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The long title of the Act states that the intention of the Act is to &ldquo;enable members of the pub<Col N="448" />lic to obtain access, to the greatest extent possible consistent with the public interest and the right to privacy, of information in the possession of public bodies&rdquo;. However, in order to allow Government business to be properly conducted the Act recognises that it will sometimes be necessary to exempt from release certain types of information in some circumstances. The exemptions that may be applicable to certain records, held by public bodies, are set out in sections 19 to 32, inclusive, of the Act. Among the key exemptions are records relating to: Government meetings; law enforcement and security; confidential and commercially sensitive information; personal information, other than information relating to the person making the request.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Act also allows for public bodies to grant access to part of records. Where part of a record is deemed to be exempt, section 13 of the Act provides for access to the remainder, where this is practical and does not mislead. The public body is required to comply with this section when it is practicable to do so. Accordingly, the question of referring files to the Garda Síochána, where decisions have been made in accordance with the provisions of the Act, to refuse or part grant access to records does not arise.</P>

      <P>I am committed to providing the Garda with the necessary resources to assist them in the fight against crime, including the provision of modern technology. In this area, the resources available to the Garda have been significantly enhanced in recent years. I refer the Deputy to a detailed reply I gave to his colleague, Deputy Durkan, on this matter in response to Questions Nos. 158 and 161 on 17 October 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government Road Safety Strategy, 1998-2002, provided for the implementation of a penalty points system in support of road safety <Col N="453" />enforcement. The legislation necessary for this measure was passed by the Oireachtas in March 2002. Excessive speed is recognised as one of the most significant contributions to road accident causation and to address this specific issue, officials of my Department, together with the Garda Síochána have been working closely with the Department of Transport on the introduction of a manual system for penalty points for speeding offences with a view to its introduction by the end of October 2002. I fully support this initiative. The issue of road safety and, in particular, detection of speeding offences has already been the subject of significant investment in enforcement measures by the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>A contract for the development of a computerised fixed charge processing system for the Garda Síochána to facilitate the introduction of an electronic system for notification of penalty point offences to the Department of the Environment and Local Government was signed in September 2002. Work is now under way on this project. From a Garda Síochána perspective, this computer system will facilitate the full implementation of the relevant provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 2002. As part of the overall computerisation of the process, electronic interfaces are also planned between the relevant agencies and Departments, that is, the Garda Síochána, the Courts Service and the Department of the Environment and Local Government to ensure that the penalty points imposed on offending drivers are recorded on the national driver file maintained by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I am committed to the completion of this overall project as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of figures on budgets and manpower, I am informed by the Garda authorities that in the time available it has not been possible to prepare the figures requested. I will forward the information directly to the Deputy as soon as it comes to hand.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible, in the first instance, for the day to day allocation of resources, that there is no specific budget for Operation Lifesaver. The operation comes under the remit of the Garda Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am further informed that the number of personnel allocated to Operation Lifesaver over the past five years is not readily available. There are <Col N="454" />currently 30 Garda traffic units in operation. The primary function of these units, which comprise a total of 471 gardaí, is the road traffic law enforcement operation know as Operation Lifesaver. Other divisional and district personnel also contribute to Operation Lifesaver through their enforcement activities.</P>
    <P>The Government's National Strategy on Road Safety, 1998 to 2002, identifies three key offences &ndash; speeding, drink driving and the non-wearing of seat belts &ndash; as contributing to serious and fatal accidents on our roads and prioritises these for enforcement. Operation Lifesaver commenced in 1997 and focuses primarily on these offences and also on ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users.</P>
    <P>The operation involves extensive patrols and roadside checkpoints. The Garda also use local and national media to promote road safety. The Garda, along with my Department, are represented on the inter-agency high level group on road safety and report to the group on their enforcement campaigns on a regular basis.</P>

      <P>The Solicitors (Amendment) <Col N="455" />Act, 2002, the relevant provisions of which will be commenced by ministerial order shortly, strengthens the disciplinary regime for solicitors in a number of respects, of which the following are examples. It doubles the size of the tribunal to cater for an increased workload and the speedier processing of cases. The tribunal will be required to make a separate finding on each ground of alleged misconduct. Regard must be had to previous findings of misconduct by a solicitor when imposing a sanction in the current case. The maximum amount which a solicitor, in respect of whom there has been a finding of misconduct, may be ordered to pay to an aggrieved party or to the Law Society's Compensation Fund will increase from £5,000 to &euro;15,000. There will be a right of appeal to the High Court on all aspects of the tribunal's work. The Act provides for remedies against solicitors who fail to co-operate with investigations. The circumstances in which the Law Society may refuse to issue a practising certificate or impose conditions on a certificate are spelt out in more detail than before. The circumstances in which the society can send an investigator to inspect documents at a solicitor's office are also extended.</P>
      <P>I am confident the new provisions will make the disciplinary regime for solicitors more effective. Their operation will be kept under review. In that context, I remind the Deputy that the Progressive Democrats' Election Manifesto 2002 contains a commitment to establish an office of statutory ombudsman to protect the interests of clients of the legal profession. This commitment is not included in An Agreed Programme for Government between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. However, in the foreword to the agreed programme, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste state that, in Government, it is open to either party to seek to persuade colleagues to pursue any individual policy included in their respective manifestos. Accordingly, it remains open as to whether proposals to Government for the establishment of a statutory ombudsman for the legal profession will be made. I look forward also to the outcome of a study currently being undertaken by the Competition Authority on legal professional services.</P>

      <P>The MapInfo GIS system has been developed by the local government computer services board to assist the management of the public road network by local authorities, including the management of road accident data.</P>
      <P>MapInfo is now fully operational in thirty one of the thirty four county and city councils. The remaining three local authorities have computer-based data systems in place which perform similar functions.</P>
      <P>The 2000 non-national road grant allocations included provision for the first time of funding to enable low cost safety improvement works on non-national roads to be carried out by local authorities.</P>
      <P>In 2000 and 2001 expenditure of &euro;2,637,864 enabled low cost safety improvement works to be carried out at more than 200 locations on non-national roads. A sum of &euro;2,541,973 was allocated under this grant category in 2002 and it is expected that by the end of this year improvements will be carried out at a further 152 locations.</P>

    <P>
    </P>
    <P>There has been a pattern of underexpenditure on this scheme since its inception. Such underexpenditure by other local authorities in 2001 allowed Clare County Council to benefit from an additional allocation of &euro;12,060. This persistent trend of underexpenditure was taken into consideration when in 2002 my Department made an allocation of &euro;3 million to local authorities. So far this year a total of &euro;1,189,933 has been drawn down.</P>
    <P>The scheme is administered by local authorities who are required to prioritise applications on the basis of a stated scheme of priorities. All grant allocations to local authorities are allocated and drawn down by them on an annual basis, in line with normal procedures for Exchequer funded grant schemes.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the RAPID Programme is a focused initiative by the Government to target the most concentrated areas of disadvantage in the country. The programme also calls on Departments and State agencies to bring about better co-ordination and closer integration in the delivery of services. Strand I of the programme targets 25 urban areas while strand II is targeting 20 provincial towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" />There are four designated RAPID areas in South Dublin County Council; one in north Clondalkin and three in Tallaght. The north Clondalkin RAPID area consists of twelve local authority housing estates, grouped in the three sub-areas of Quarryvale, Rowlagh and Moorfield. The Tallaght RAPID areas include Fettercairn, including Brookfield, Killinarden, including Cushlawn, and Jobstown.</P>
    <P>Under the programme, priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the designated areas through the front-loading of State resources, available under the national development plan.</P>
    <P>A total of 173 project proposals have been forwarded to Departments for consideration under the plans from the four designated areas in South Dublin County Council and these are being considered at present in the context of Departmental budgets.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of carer's allowance at the weekly rate of &euro;122.60. This is the maximum rate of allowance payable where one care recipient is being cared for. At the time of her application, she also applied for an increase in the rate of her carer's allowance for a second care recipient. This application was refused as the full-time care and attention condition was not satisfied in respect of this additional care recipient.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was notified of this decision and of her right to appeal to the social welfare appeals office. She subsequently appealed this decision and submitted further medical evidence in support of her appeal. Following an oral appeal hearing the original decision to refuse an increase in her carer's allowance was upheld. An appeals officer's decision is final and conclusive and can only be reviewed in light of new facts or fresh evidence. The person concerned was notified accordingly.</P>
      <P>Further medical information was submitted by the person concerned to the social welfare appeals office. In this regard, a medical examination of the care recipient was undertaken on 1 May 2002 but this has not altered the decision of the appeals officer. Under social welfare legislation decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>It is assumed the Deputy's question refers to the link-work experience programme, which is administered by FÁS. In this programme, people are placed with employers to gain both work experience and training. Participants are considered to be FÁS trainees, continuing to receive the standard FÁS training allowance. No payment is made either by the employer to the employee, or by FÁS to the employer. Accordingly, a person would not normally be regarded as being under a contract of service with an employer and have a class A PRSI contribution. If there is any doubt as to whether class A PRSI should be paid, my Department can investigate and decide the issue.</P>
      <P>Regulations provide that credited contributions are awarded for the duration of a training course provided or approved by FÁS, ensuring continuity in the person's PRSI record.</P>
      <P>To qualify for maternity benefit, a person must be either in paid employment and entitled to leave under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, or self-employed and satisfy the relevant PRSI qualifying conditions, which include having a certain minimum number of paid contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under certain circumstances, a person who is pregnant but who does not satisfy the contribution conditions for maternity benefit and is not in receipt of wages from her employer, may receive an unemployment payment for the dur<Col N="462" />ation of the maternity leave. This is subject to satisfying all the statutory conditions for receipt of such payment and provided there are no other factors which could call into question her general availability for work.</P>
