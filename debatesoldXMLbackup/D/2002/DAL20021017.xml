      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister for Agriculture and Food prepared to apologise on behalf of the Government to the people about the manner in which they were misled before the last general election in order to secure office? I am sure he read in the newspapers today that a poll confirms that three out of four people believe the Government misled the public in order to secure office. Does he accept that the weak and vulnerable will pay for the Government's binge as a result of cutbacks in health services, education, housing, extra charges and additional inflation? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people will reflect on that question as they go to the polls in the Nice treaty. It is important for the Minister to be forthright and honest to ensure the result of the poll is not decided by the anger felt among people towards the Government but on the basis of the Nice treaty itself.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister be forthright about the misjudgment he and his Government made about the state of the economy before the last election? Will he take this opportunity before the poll on Saturday to set the matter right? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the charge made by Deputy Richard Bruton and supported by Deputy Sargent. The figures in today's edition of <i>The Star</i> speak for themselves. Given the Minister's experience in Government, does he recall any time that the public was so deliberately misled by the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach? Can he indicate if the Estimates have been completed? Will the Estimates confirm that a further reduction of &euro;1.7 billion will manifest itself when they are published? Can the Minister confirm that the Estimates have been completed and will they show the reality of those figures? They will give substance to the scale of deception and lies presented to the people during the campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding the national finances was clearly outlined in Private Members' time last week by the Minister for Finance. I refer people to his detailed and lengthy reply. I read the polls in today's newspapers which contain interesting reading. The leaders of all political parties would do well to study the figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will recall for the Minister what the Minister for Finance said in the House last week. He said he made an appeal to Ministers in January to stay within their budgets. However, by the end of that month they had increased their budgets by 50% more than was allowed. He made another appeal to them in March to stay within their budgets. However, the following month spending increased by a further 34%. Does the Minister know that the Minister for Finance made another appeal in April to his colleagues, but spending increased by 50% more than was allowed in the Estimates? Does the Minister accept the conclusion that the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach are solely responsible for the deception or does he accept that responsibility also lies with himself and his colleagues? Are we continuing to be misled by the Government which told us last week it would come in on budget with a 14% increase in current spending? Is the Minister aware that means that, in the last quarter of the year, the health Estimate &ndash; the Minister for Health and Children is not here today &ndash; will have to be cut by &euro;170 million? That is enough to run all the five casualty hospitals in Dublin. Will we see such savage cutbacks? There will be a cut of &euro;169 million in education in the last quarter of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will we see the details of these cutbacks, which will be imposed on weak sections of our community, if the Government is still determined to come in on budget, or will the Government slide away yet again from the statements it makes in the House and elsewhere? Will a massive hole open up in the public finances for which the poor of the country will pay? This is international day for combating poverty, but the Government is contributing at every hand's turn to additional difficulties for people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>As a betting man, has the Minister placed any bets on who will lose his job first, Mick McCarthy or Bertie Ahern? I hoped the Tánaiste would be here as I wanted to ask her about the treasonous language emanating from Ministers, particularly the Tánaiste herself, in threatening economic meltdown if the Nice treaty is rejected. Does the Minister agree that the outcome of the Nice treaty referendum has nothing to do with the 1,000 jobs which will have been lost by the end of the week, including the 120 job losses announced this morning by EMC Corporation in Ballincollig?</P>
      <P>In 2001 some 4,000 jobs were lost in the area of foreign direct investment. Does the Minister agree that a trend has emerged which has been identified in the United Nations world report on trade and investment which notes that in 2001 foreign direct investment in Ireland fell by 60%? On that basis, will he accept the reality that foreign direct investment in Ireland is primarily affected by our level of corporate tax and that a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the referendum would have no effect on FDI, other than perhaps protecting our low corporation tax regime? Does he accept that it is treasonous for Ministers to talk down the economy in the context of the outcome of the Nice treaty referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that Ireland, among all the countries of the European Union, has been the greatest beneficiary of market integration across Europe and that as a result of the efforts of many Governments we have positioned ourselves to be best placed to take advantage of larger markets and those markets which do not have barriers? Does he also agree <Col N="1025" /> that just recently the chief executive of the IDA issued a blunt message to the people when he stated that his job of attracting international investment would become far more difficult if they vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the Nice treaty? Does he agree that the policy advocated by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaigners of revising and abandoning the open, confident way we have approached Europe will lead us into a cul-de-sac?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister failed to answer my previous question, but is uniquely placed to answer this one. Will he outline to the House what his bargaining position in the Agriculture Council will be if Ireland votes &ldquo;No&rdquo; to enlargement on Saturday? Given his experience &ndash; he is, perhaps, the most experienced Minister for Agriculture and Food in the history of the State with respect to European affairs &ndash; will he articulate to the House and to those who believe a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote will do no damage to Ireland's standing within the European Union his concerns about what such a vote will mean for this country, particularly in the context of the review of the Common Agricultural Policy and the reform of its supports between now and 2006-07?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Richard Bruton and Deputy Quinn that membership of the European Union has been enormously beneficial for the economy and for attracting jobs. Some 10% of the workforce is employed by multinational companies which have been attracted here because it is the gateway to Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, why are they leaving?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>More than 300,000 jobs have been created by these companies. There are no circumstances under which they would have been attracted to Ireland if we had been a remote economy on the periphery of Europe. This view was endorsed by Séan Dorgan of the IDA when he clearly stated that Europe, not just our corporate tax regime to which Deputy Sargent referred, has been important for economic development. The Deputy should also note that we will retain our veto if we vote in favour of the Nice treaty as it has no effect on taxation matters.</P>
      <P>With important negotiations imminent on the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy and the WTO trade round, rejection of the treaty would make my position as our negotiator on agriculture far more difficult because our success in Europe is due to alliances we forge with other countries. In the Agriculture Council, for example, we have only three of 87 votes. If Deputy Rabbitte or any of the other contenders for the leadership of the Labour Party were in that position, I doubt he or she would do terribly well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Networking is our strength and a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in support of the Nice treaty will be essential if we are to maintain our position in the Council of <Col N="1026" /> Ministers. In the area of farming, for example, more than &euro;1 billion in direct payments to farmers will be made this week alone. This would not be possible without our membership of the European Union. During the most recent negotiations on agriculture, the Agenda 2000 negotiations, we got a good deal despite having so few votes in the Council because we were able to garner additional support from other member states. All those member states have asked us to support the Nice treaty, as have all the Governments of the applicant states. In terms of the goodwill towards Ireland in Europe, it is extremely important that we have a resounding vote in favour of the treaty on Saturday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have to remind the Minister that we already voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; in a democratic decision on the Nice treaty. However, I will not dwell on the reasons for a second referendum. May I assume that the Minister's failure to address the job losses to which I referred indicates that he accepts they would have happened regardless of the Nice treaty? The difficulties we currently face have nothing to do with the treaty.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy ask a question, please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that having three votes out of 87 is not an ideal negotiating position and that having a veto in reserve provides an insurance policy, even if it is one we hope we would not have to use as we have not done in the recent past? Whatever influence we now have as a member of a European Union of equal legal partners, we will not increase it by losing our guarantee of a commissioner and our veto in 30 areas as well as agreeing to renounce a veto over enhanced co-operation, a decision which is likely to result in a federation of countries, of which Ireland will not be a part, taking the driving seat in the European Union? How can the Minister argue this will increase our influence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to jobs, before we joined the European Union we had a workforce of one million and now we have a workforce of 1.7 million. It is inconceivable those additional 700,000 jobs would have been created without the 400 million market in the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to influence in Europe and the veto, the use of the veto is totally overstated; it is only used as a last resort. We would not get very far in this Chamber if one person could veto everything we tried to do. We have created alliances and got support for our position, and that is how we have made a success of Europe. Europe has been the single most important successful influence in building the confidence of our people since the foundation of the State. We had political independence, but economic independence <Col N="1027" /> only flowered since we became members of the European Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to influence in Europe, Vaclav Havel who was interviewed yesterday said that having come out of repressive totalitarian regimes in the east they were looking west for freedom of expression, opportunities for their people and particularly to Ireland to give them that opportunity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Our position is a little like Paul McGinley's when he had the chance of winning the Ryder Cup and it was down to the Irish representative. It is down to Ireland in this case to allow those applicant countries to have opportunities for their people and we should not let them down.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us will agree that the loss of an infant is a particularly difficult and sad occasion. To have that compounded by the revelation that the organs of a dead infant were used, examined or taken without the consent of the parents is particularly traumatic. When Parents for Justice was set up and it was decided to establish an inquiry, assurances were given that full answers to legitimate questions would be provided to the parents and relatives of the dead infants. We learned last night that after a two and a half hour meeting with the Minister for Health and Children the Parents for Justice group withdrew from its co-operation with the inquiry on the basis that it was not satisfied that the terms of reference and the statutory basis of the Dunne inquiry would meet its requirements.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food, acting on behalf of the Government, because no doubt he has been briefed on this matter, if the Government is prepared to establish a statutory inquiry to give statutory standing to the Dunne inquiry to address the legitimate fears the Parents for Justice group has on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, in raising this sensitive and important matter. All of us know these parents suffered extraordinary trauma in the loss of their children, but to learn that organs were taken without their consent for experimentation has been a massive blow. We must ensure their case is heard promptly. After the judgment in April it was clear that the route of proceeding by way of a Dáil committee would not stand up to scrutiny as a public inquiry. The representatives of the parents alerted the Minister about the problem with the approach he proposed to take. Why has he not done anything since April to come up with <Col N="1028" /> an alternative method whereby a full public inquiry, which he promised, will follow on from the initial inquiry? Why has he not done anything to secure and identify the way in which this public inquiry will take place? He has left the parents very uncertain about the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, I very much support the request made for a statutory inquiry by the leader of the Labour Party and supported by the leader of Fine Gael. The answer to the request should be &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;. Will the Government, having met with the relatives and considered the matter, agree to the establishment of a statutory inquiry, given that currently witnesses are avoiding the inquiry due to the lack of compellability?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>There are major criminal as well as ethical questions over the sale of pituitary glands to a large pharmaceutical company. Will the Government take this matter as seriously as it should and make the inquiry statutory?  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the speakers that this is an extremely traumatic matter and the Minister has dealt with it in a very compassionate way. Earlier this year parents stated that the first phase of the inquiry was rigorous, compassionate and comprehensive. The Minister met the chairperson of the inquiry, Anne Dunne, SC, last month, and a progress report has been made to her on the deliberations so far. The Minister regrets the decision of the Parents for Justice group to leave last night's meeting and withdraw its co-operation from the inquiry.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that the Minister and the Government are committed to a statutory inquiry. The Minister will meet the parents shortly because he put forward a number of options to them. He wants to make sure that the difficulties regarding the Oireachtas inquiry in the Abbeylara case will not impede the establishment of a rigorous, fair and comprehensive inquiry in this regard. The bottom line is that the Minister and Government are committed to a statutory phase of this inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the assurances given by the Minister for Agriculture and Food on behalf of the Government. Will the Minister agree that, having regard to the way in which the Committee of Public Accounts did its work in the DIRT inquiry, there was a belief that in some respects a parliamentary committee procedure of inquiry, as manifested from that performance, was the road to go until such time as the courts ruled in respect of the Abbeylara inquiry and effectively demonstrated that the Oireachtas was incapable of compelling witnesses or obtaining the kind of information that would be absolutely central to the workings of such an inquiry? If that is what has now changed, which I gather is the position, can the <Col N="1029" /> Minister for Agriculture and Food confirm that the Minister for Health and Children when he next meets the Parents for Justice group will lay out before it a road map that will lead to the establishment of a statutory inquiry that will address the issues of compellability and other such matters in order that the parents involved can be assured that all the facts in so far as they are obtainable can be obtained and consequences relating to those facts will flow from the inquiry? If the Minister is saying that the Government is committed to a statutory inquiry, could it be inferred that the Minister for Health and Children will provide a detailed framework, including the terms of reference, of such a statutory inquiry? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on his initiative, particularly for the support and encouragement it gives to traditional arts. By encouraging traditional arts we are not only safeguarding our cultural heritage, we are widening the appeal of the arts generally. A people proud and conscious of their culture will be more open to and understanding of other forms and modes of expression.</P>
      <P>As we approach the referendum, which I believe will help facilitate the enlargement of the EU, it is particularly relevant that the Minister is putting structures in place which will encourage individuality and difference in a very positive way. It will help Ireland retain and develop its distinct cultural voice. This is necessary not just in an enlarged European Union but in a world made small by financial and media empires which in one way or another, by design or not, encourage homogenisation. That levelling process and reduction to a mean can only be resisted and defeated by nations whose people believe in themselves and have strong traditions and culture. Hopefully that self-confidence will be seen not only in the arts, but will express itself in our acceptance of exceptionality and excellence. In education there is an increasing tendency, notably in England, to ensure that everyone succeeds. Exam standards at university level are being lowered, leading one to wonder what happens when everyone has a double first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ultimately it will not be economics which will distinguish the Irish, Danes, Belgians, Dutch and other small countries from one another and their <Col N="1032" /> larger neighbours. They will be distinguished by their individuality as expressed in their traditions and the strength and depth of their cultures. Despite, or perhaps because of, our turbulent history we are lucky to have passed down in music and by word of mouth traditions, skills and attitudes that strongly distinguish us. As a consequence we have a literary legacy that is the envy of the world. Our writers and poets have repeatedly drawn on those traditions, given them new life and meaning and broadcast them to the world.</P>
    <P>It is enormously encouraging that the Minister has chosen to underline the importance of our traditional arts by establishing a standing committee and ensuring that two of its members sit on the Arts Council. His initiative will give new heart to every branch of the traditional arts. I hope this new development will also encourage the Arts Council to spend more time and money supporting small groups and organisations throughout the country. Such bodies are making genuine attempts to bring high art out of its gilded palaces and to the public at large.</P>
    <P>The largest medieval monastic ruins in Europe are in Kells, County Kilkenny. The ruins lie on a beautiful site beside the King's River, seven miles from Kilkenny city. For the last four years a committee of three local residents, in co-operation with the local community, has hosted a sculpture exhibition featuring sculptors such as Barry Flanagan, Lyn Chadwick, Elizabeth Frink and Peter Randall-Page. They are major international artists who have exhibited in galleries and museums throughout the world. At the same time, 20 young Irish artists exhibit their own work. Aidan Dunne in <i>The Irish Times</i> described Kells as one of the highlights of Kilkenny Arts Week.</P>
    <P>Approximately 4,000 people visited the exhibition on its opening day this year. The organisers believe between 12,000 and 15,000 people visited the exhibition over its two week run. Most of these people would never visit the IMMA, a contemporary art exhibition or a gallery because these are seen as intimidating spaces, available only to those who are familiar with them or can afford to visit them. Perhaps that is how some of the high priests of the art world prefer it.</P>
    <P>Art, by its nature, is elitist and I have no complaint about that. However, those of its administrators who are paid and whose institutions are funded with public money should make a greater effort to educate and enlighten. Kells does that. No one is intimidated at Kells. Children play around the pieces while fathers and mothers look and sometimes poke at the exhibits, wondering, speculating and learning. A great deal of what they see is challenging and thought-provoking, but they and the artists love it.</P>
    <P>Sculpture at Kells has everything the Arts Council could ask for &ndash; international quality contemporary art, work by emerging young artists, community involvement and huge crowds of visitors. The only thing Kells does not have is a sensible amount of Arts Council funding. Nearly <Col N="1033" /> as many people visit Kells in a two week period as visit the IMMA in six months. I do not know how much public money the IMMA receives, but I do know how much is given to Kells and also how much it needs. Kells is run on a shoestring budget, which covers costs for the transport of pieces &ndash; within Ireland and abroad &ndash; security, artists' fees and expenses, insurance and brochures. The total comes to approximately &euro;30,000, a remarkably small sum for such a large exhibition.</P>
    <P>As already stated, I do not know how much money the IMMA receives and I am not complaining about it. However, Sculpture at Kells, which attracts approximately 15,000 visitors in two weeks, received &euro;10,000 from the Arts Council this year. This is a derisory sum and it is disgraceful that so much effort and success has attracted so little reward or recognition. Perhaps the Arts Council does not like to acknowledge or be reminded that so much can be done with so little. The people of Kells may not thank me for placing this information on public record. After all, next year, when it is hoped to feature five major Irish sculptors, Kells will again need Arts Council support. I look to the Minister to ensure that this is given and in far greater measure than this year's paltry offering.</P>
    <P>I wish to make clear that I have no difficulty with money being given to the arts, nor do I have any difficulty with such money being spent on projects that do not show a financial return. I understand and accept that this is often the case. In ancient times, storytellers and artists always had a place at the Ard Rí's table. Beauty and creativity should be celebrated and the profit comes from the enhancement of people's lives. How would the Ard Rí have felt if an artist had arrived with a retinue of handlers and administrators, all of whom wanted to sit at the top table even if, incidentally, the artist was obliged to sit on the floor?</P>
    <P>Administrators are necessary, even if it always seems that there are too many of them. By and large, they try to do a good job but too often they are employed because of their expertise and not because they are professional administrators. As a consequence, the public funds given to them are often inexpertly distributed. We need to ensure that the bodies we fund are lean and mean, with the experts balanced by people from a commercial background. We also need to ensure that administration and the funding of pet projects do not absorb the lion's share of what is available. That aim will not be easily achieved. The high priests will not like it. I am sure clouds of incense will confuse and complicate and there will be tension. However, I urge the Minister to persist and take whatever steps are necessary, if indeed they are necessary, to ensure that we get value for money &ndash; something which is very necessary in this era of belt-tightening.</P>
    <P>I have used Kells as an example. However, I am sure there are many such places throughout the country which, if given a little funding and <Col N="1034" /> advice, would advance the cause of art in an efficient and practical way. In my constituency, the internationally recognised Butler Gallery needs more space and money. It cannot house its growing important collection and, for many other reasons, the space it currently occupies is not ideal.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the controversy caused by a recent exhibition at the Butler Gallery of work on video, which some people found challenging. As a result of their concerns, the Garda nearly closed the exhibition because it breached certain sections of the Censorship Act. The Act apparently requires that all works on video or film be submitted to the censor. This has serious implications for museums and galleries, particularly because these mediums are increasingly being used by students and artists. The legislation in Britain makes an exception in respect of art of this nature. In my opinion, the legislation in this country which deals with this area should be scrutinised and updated.</P>
    <P>I also wish to draw the Minister's attention to another local issue which is relative to the legislation and the question of funding. I want to highlight the work undertaken by the Young Irish Film Makers, a project which employs young teenagers to produce, cast, film and edit movies. It has involved young people, North and South, in the film business and worked with people from the European Union and the United States. The Young Irish Film Makers have done an extremely good job for that form of art in this country. They may be based in Kilkenny, but their work has a national and international appeal. However, they receive an extremely low level of funding which causes serious difficulties on a year to year basis. Without the support of FÁS and other State agencies, they would not be able to continue their work. I believe they have an equal right to be considered for increased funding from the Arts Council or through any appropriate measure the Minister might introduce. Art of this nature, produced at local level, helps teenagers to appreciate other forms of art.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the activities of the Young Irish Film Makers and the way in which this project is funded. I would be delighted to invite him to visit Kilkenny Castle on 26 October to attend the first showing of their latest film, which follows on from their previous feature &ldquo;Under the Hawthorn Tree&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Reference is made to finance in various sections of the Bill. The impetus behind the legislation could end up as so much wishful thinking if the appropriate level of funding is not dedicated to supporting the initiatives in the Bill. I have no doubt that the Minister will do his best in the context of current financial circumstances and the forthcoming budget to fulfil the major aspirations set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw his attention to the last paragraph of the explanatory memorandum which relates to section 31 of the Local Government Act, 1994. I serve on a local authority and I am <Col N="1035" /> aware that while there are many worthy art projects, of one kind or another, in my locality, it is never possible to extend the kind of financial support required by any individual project which comes before us for consideration. It is wishful thinking to state that when the Act comes on stream, local authorities will be able to fund such projects. In reality, no funding is provided. The money required to help local groups is not available in the necessary amounts to sustain a project from year to year. In the context of this legislation and the finance that is available at national and local level, the Minister would assist the arts if he focused on the local scene in each county and if he supported, in a more realistic way financially, that section of local government which deals with funding the arts.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I welcome the opportunity to bring these issues to the Minister's attention. On Committee Stage he should put as much focus as possible on funding the arts across the sector.</P>

      <P>I support most of the actions proposed in the Bill in terms of the adjustments to the Arts Council. However, one issue in the Bill is a matter of serious concern to me and many people throughout the country, that is, the proposed formation of a standing committee for the traditional arts. Unlike the committees dealing with other aspects of the arts, it will have particular responsibility for recommending funding for people or organisations within the traditional arts and music area. This is a deeply flawed suggestion and I urge the Minister to change it.</P>
      <P>Any Minister who would assume responsibility for appointing a majority of the members of a board which would control our traditional arts is taking on a responsibility of which any politician should be wary. There will never be any praise, just a lifetime of opprobrium for a Minister who puts himself or herself in that position. The phrase &ldquo;our traditional arts&rdquo; is ridiculous because painting and pottery are traditional arts. Our definition of &ldquo;arts&rdquo; has changed in recent years, thankfully. It has moved from a split definition of the arts whereby one part of the country listened to traditional music while the other part listened to classical music. That is no longer the case. Our traditional music is enjoyed across the country, in large and small homes and in every corner of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is special about our traditional music is that it is a living tradition, unlike some of the musical traditions in central and other parts of Europe which have died. Ours is a living musical tradition which is evolving, creative and changing. It is impossible to confine it by a standing committee. The Minister comes from Kerry which is <Col N="1036" /> a great centre for this music. If one hears Steve Cooney playing a Kerry slide with one of the Begleys, is it traditional or is it contemporary? It is a world away from how it was played 20 or 30 years ago. It is exciting and makes one dance. It is fantastic music but it is contemporary, not traditional. It is part of a world music tradition and is one of the most popular forms of world music.</P>
    <P>When Martin Hayes takes a tune from his father he is living on a tradition, but then he draws the notes out and turns the tune inside out. He can bring it to a jazz tune and back to a traditional one in a single session. One cannot cage it. Would &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo; have been seen as traditional or contemporary? Would the Minister's appointees to the board have approved it? We do not know. The decisions regarding funding are best left within the proposed Arts Council structure. By all means have a standing committee to examine how traditional music is developing and where funding might go. However, the Minister should not have the majority of appointments within any such committee. It should be a broader based committee involved in constant discussion with the people in the sector. Traditional music is also an industry. Many people are involved in it and groups such as Altan and Dervish travel throughout the world. These people are sometimes the leading players in bands across the world and they have different needs from those playing in a local session.</P>
    <P>Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann was influential in seeking this proposed change. The organisation does fantastic work and is a strong force in the Minister's constituency. Its branch network is not necessarily strong in every part of the country but in some places it is a fantastic force. Where local people pass on a tradition, Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann teach it to others in the great collective way of traditional music. However, it also has another organised structural or administrative side which should not have a strong role in terms of deciding where funding should go in traditional music or defining what traditional music is or how it should be defined in the future. Looking at the consultation process that led to this Bill, there is a sense on the part of people involved that Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann had a strong say in it and that the supposedly open consultation process, including meetings in Dún Laoghaire and elsewhere, never recommended the standing committee proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The majority of people I know in the traditional music sector are deeply concerned about the nature of this committee. I urge the Minister to consider amending the provision on Committee Stage. By all means, have a separate standing committee, but traditional music should not be any different from classical music, painting or any of the other arts which are constantly evolving and changing. If we try to cage it, we will kill it. The Minister should be wary of that. It is akin to the Minister trying to appoint a majority of members to the board of the GAA and thinking <Col N="1037" /> it is possible to hold on to what is so great about the GAA. Traditional music has the same roots in Irish society but it is a plant that moves in many different directions. It works best when it is left to its own strong local centres. Certainly, we should fund it. The Arts Council has a poor record in funding this area to date but that is no reason for turning around the structures that have worked.</P>
    <P>The Arts Council, and this includes the traditional arts area, must be kept at arm's length from political control. It is only then that artists are properly free and can be of use to society by speaking back to us about what is happening in society. The Minister taking excessive control of the traditional arts will kill that voice, not just for Irish people but for people across the world. I ask the Minister to consider reviewing this on Committee Stage. It was not his responsibility when it was drafted. I was surprised to see it among the first Bills brought before the new Dáil. The Minister has a responsibility to the people of Kerry, Ireland and the world to ensure we do not kill our fantastic and ever evolving musical tradition.</P>

      <P>My initial reaction on reading this Bill was to wonder if it is an arts Bill <i>per se</i> or a Bill, the main function of which is to establish a revised version of the Arts Council. While section 2 defines &ldquo;arts&rdquo; and section 9 describes the general functions of the council, the rest of the Bill deals mainly with the membership of the Arts Council, the mechanisms for appointing and removing such members and standing committee members, funding, reporting, auditing, staffing and so forth. These are necessary but I was disappointed that the Bill contained no vision for the promotion of the arts, to make them more accessible, and no vision for the role of art or the artist in Irish society. That concerns me and I hope it is not an indication of a downgrading of the arts or a narrowing of the visionary possibilities afforded by a strategic promotion of the arts.</P>
      <P>While the Bill does not address this issue, it is strange to see arts, sport and tourism gathered together under a single Department. There are much greater synergies between arts and heritage or arts and culture than between arts and sport or arts and tourism. It is vital that the arts are not just seen as a recreational activity. Although that is one of the many categories into which they fit, it is still only one of them.</P>
      <P>There should be an arm's length approach between the Arts Council and the Minister or Government. The new Arts Council will have a membership of nine comprising a chairperson and eight other members, all of whom will be appointed by the Minister. There are three standing committees, each consisting of five persons, three of whom &ndash; in other words, a majority &ndash; will be appointed by the Minister. It seems extraordinary that, with so many bodies representing the arts throughout the country, ministerial appointees will effectively control both the Arts Council itself and the standing committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1038" />If anything, the arts should challenge our vision of the world. If the Arts Council and its three standing committees are going to reflect the Minister's views, then the future of the arts will be restricted, to say the least. The arts are all-embracing, covering many different forms of expression and, therefore, a council whose function it is to promote the arts, must reflect that diversity of thinking. Perhaps the Minister will have this vision. I hope so, but what guarantee do we have that his successors will be so enlightened?</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to reconsider the method of appointing members of the Arts Council and its standing committees. He should devise a mechanism to ensure that the broadly based area termed &ldquo;the arts&rdquo; can be represented and can make a real contribution to the promotion of the arts in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I also wish to deal with the issue of the arts in education. The word &ldquo;education&rdquo; may appear in the Bill, but if it does I did not spot it and there was certainly no specific reference to the role education can play in promoting, experiencing, introducing and appreciating the arts.</P>
    <P>At one stage I worked as a mathematics teacher and while the arts did not feature in the maths curriculum, nonetheless, I was aware of the huge potential of the arts in education generally. The arts have the potential to help to ensure that education in its widest possible sense can lead students forward, awakening not just the mind but also the spirit. They can stimulate creativity and facilitate many different forms of expression, as well as promoting a holistic approach to the development of the entire person. The arts have the potential to ensure that schooling, and education generally, achieves the objectives I have outlined.</P>
    <P>While the arts should form an integral part of the school curriculum, particular opportunities exist in transition year where they can be fostered through music, art, dance, drama, mime, artistic expression courses and other pursuits. Transition year has the flexibility to allow teachers to incorporate many different facets of the arts into the secondary school curricula. If the Government is serious about promoting such ideas, then the arts must be central to the educational process.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Bill envisages a role for local authorities in community art projects, but adequate resources must be made available to enable the authorities' functions to be properly fulfilled. I am concerned that while local authorities will be well equipped to prepare plans for the development of the arts within their functional areas, they may experience some difficulty in implementing such plans due to a lack of resources. However, I do not wish to be too pessimistic about this point.</P>
    <P>I lived in County Leitrim for 12 years and found a vibrant artistic community there. The arts in Leitrim are supported by a number of community and voluntary groups, as well as agencies and the local authority which has played a major <Col N="1039" /> role. The north Leitrim men's arts group is a successful community arts initiative. It comprised a group of men with no background in artistic endeavour who successfully completed a painting course. The project enhanced their self expression, self esteem and their quality of life. This type of initiative must continue to be supported under the aegis of the Arts Council.</P>
    <P>The vibrant artistic community in Sligo also deserves to be properly resourced so that the arts can continue to play a significant role in enhancing the quality of life for local people there.</P>

      <P>Don chuid is mó, tacaíonn Sinn Féin leis an mBille seo, mar tá sé thar am an reachtaíocht ealaíona a athrú agus a thabhairt chun dáta. Fáiltím roimh aon bhogadh i dtreo aitheantas a thabhairt do luach na n-ealaíon agus don ról lárnach atá acu i bhforbairt agus cur lenár sochaí.</P>
      <P>Aithníonn muid chomh maith go bhfuil gá le tuilleadh tacaí Stáit do na healaíona traidisiúnta &ndash; na healaíona Gaeilge san áireamh &ndash; gné den ealaíon nach bhfuair an maoiniú caoi thar na blianta.</P>
      <P>Among other measures, the Bill establishes three permanent standing committees: one concerning traditional arts, another for local government and the arts, and the third for new art and innovation. I welcome unreservedly the trend towards the promotion of arts at local authority level, and hope that this will extend into increased promotion of community arts and to greater funding by local authorities of all aspects of art, including bursaries, scholarships and commissioning.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the clear identification of the need to cultivate and promote the traditional arts, which this Bill does for the first time. Previous Acts wholly omitted the traditional arts, and the pronouncements, funding decisions, policies and actions of the Arts Council over the decades and generally ignored them. This attitude is reflected in the unacceptably paltry proportion of funding received by the traditional arts sector &ndash; a shameful 1% of the arts budget. It is hardly reflective of the sector's national significance.</P>
      <P>Separating the traditional arts from other arts, as this legislation seeks to do, carries risks, however. Some people have raised legitimate concerns that the separation of traditional arts from new arts can lead to an unhealthy ghettoisation that could have the effect, albeit unintended, of undermining the traditional sector by consigning it to heritage arts, rather than recognising it as a living tradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traditional arts are evolving, developing and adapting as our society develops and adapts to the new millennium. This fact must be recognised in the provisions of the legislation. As the Bill moves towards enactment, care must be taken in developing the remit of the other standing committees on local authority and the arts and artistic innovation to avoid any suggestion that tradit<Col N="1040" /> ional arts play no role there. Traditional arts are as contemporary as any other arts and also play a significant role in local artistic endeavour. Indeed, the PriceWaterhouseCoopers report on the consultation process, which preceded this debate, stated: &ldquo;Art is art, including traditional Irish arts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Some concern has been voiced about the definition of traditional arts in the Bill. They must, of course, be interpreted in the broadest sense, and the definition should be arrived at through a process of broad consultation with all relevant parties, as soon as possible, to assist the functioning of the Arts Council and its standing committees.</P>
    <P>Irish language advocates have criticised the Bill, as it stands, for its failure to even mention Irish language arts, much less grant them equal standing. This must be corrected on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Eamon Ryan's concern as to why only the traditional arts sub-committee will be able to make recommendations on the advance of moneys. That matter will also have to be addressed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill's provisions establish firm ministerial control over the Arts Council and other bodies in terms of policy. The Bill stipulates that all council members will be ministerial appointees, and it reduces by almost half the number of members currently on the council. Arts Council members can also be removed at the Minister's discretion. Given these provisions, the arts community has expressed concern about the Bill's potential for excessive ministerial control over the council. Sinn Féin also believes the Bill could have the effect of creating unnecessary and inappropriate political control over the arts. We therefore call for additional measures that would further increase the independence, but still maintain the accountability, of the Arts Council.</P>
    <P>We are disappointed that the Bill does not address the elitist structure that Aosdana has become, nor the fact that many who have a substantial independent income are still in receipt of State moneys, while there are hundreds of struggling artists, writers and performers who are surviving on very little or living in poverty. I hope this will be addressed by future reform of the Arts Council and in future arts policy.</P>
    <P>We are also concerned that this Bill fails to legislate regarding arts education or to set out the basis for necessary co-operative links with the Department of Education and Science, despite the Minister's stated intention of doing so when the Bill was first placed in his portfolio. We welcome the Minister's indication of willingness to entertain some changes to the Bill on the next Stages, given the varying concerns raised in all sectors of the arts and the need for direct involvement of artists in formulating policy. We hope there will be ongoing consultation with all sectors concerned, both during the passage of the Bill and, following its enactment, during its implementation.</P>

      <P>As the Minister said, the programme for Government aims to ensure that cultural activity is available and accessible to all and commits to the enactment of a new arts Act to provide a more inclusive definition of the arts and also to map out on a statutory basis a new relationship between artists, the Arts Council and the Minister.</P>
      <P>I want to see real ministerial responsibility. People are complaining about political influence or political interference in the arts. I actually want to see more ministerial influence and positive interference because at present there is a great need for someone to take a grip of the entire arts sector and give it a fair shake down.</P>
      <P>I approach this from a musical background and I preface my remarks with that in mind. I am delighted that the arts have taken centre stage on the legislative agenda so early in this term. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, stated in his opening speech that &ldquo;The Bill before us is the product of experience gained with having a Cabinet Minister representing the arts at the Cabinet table.&rdquo;. This single role no longer applies and, as a person with an arts background, I am very annoyed about this. The area of the arts is a huge sphere as are tourism and sport. When one starts adding all the different elements together, it is difficult, even for the Minister, who has a great interest in all of these issues, to give the arts the dedication they need. This is so because there has not been enough dedication down the years. The Minister is going down an incredibly difficult road trying to overcome these difficulties because the arts are now being delegated into a dispersed Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might have been better to have linked the arts to education, which is also a huge field. RTE came before the arts committee of the previous Dáil complaining &ndash; I suppose &ldquo;complaining&rdquo; might be too strong a word &ndash; about the issue of funding for the concert and symphony orchestras. I put it to them that people in County Donegal and other places which are far from the schools of music in Dublin, Kerry, Cork or Galway, do not come into contact with orchestras and do not get to see at close quarters what a violin, never mind an oboe, looks like. If the 100 piece concert orchestra came to the new theatre in Letterkenny and groups of three orchestra musicians spent the day visiting 33 primary schools in the area, these would benefit from a session getting to know what three instruments look like and how they are played. The Department of Education and Science could give something towards that aspect of the visit which would probably cover the cost of the orchestra coming to Letterkenny in the first place and, therefore, the concert that evening would be financially viable. I proposed that as a solution to two problems, the lack of music in the schools and the funding for the orchestra's tours. I tried to raise that issue by way of parliamentary question, asking what plans the Minister had to discuss the matter with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources <Col N="1042" /> and the Minister for Education and Science, but I was told that it was not the Minister's responsibility. Instead of there being two Departments involved, it would now take three Departments to deal with the suggestion I proposed in the previous Dáil term. Under this legislation, the Minister seems to be moving towards reaching out to other Departments. I agree that the Minister must reach out to other Departments because they definitely come into this equation.</P>
    <P>I must declare my interest in this matter. I have an honours B.Mus degree, a Masters of Philosophy in Music, a PGCE in music, an LTCL in performance and Grade 8 in four instruments, three of which I got on the same day when I was in fourth year in secondary school. My success in music was achieved despite my geographical location, far from the schools of music, far from the orchestras and far from the opportunities enjoyed by the children of parents who could afford to send them to schools of music. I achieved that success because my mother was a musician and came from a musical background. I owe my musical achievements to her, not to primary or secondary school or university. It was not that we had plenty of money to go far afield for lessons and, needless to say, at the time there were not many music teachers available in my locality. I received no instrumental tuition, bar the short time when there was a local town band and I subsequently went to the band in Derry when our own band collapsed.</P>
    <P>What equivalent do they have in the North? I have many relations teaching in primary schools and secondary schools, not as school music teachers but as peripatetic music teachers who come in to give free education to the children in terms of instrumental development.</P>
    <P>I studied music in Belfast rather than Dublin because I got free tuition in three instruments as part of my course. If I had come to Dublin, I would have had to pay for the performance aspect. If I had studied art in the universities of Dublin, Cork or other cities of the State, I would expect to have to paint and painting would be part of my art course fees. If I had studied science, I would expect to encounter a Bunsen burner. Therefore, it is unbelievable that the cost of instrumental tuition would not be covered by the fees in a third level music college.</P>
    <P>When I taught in England or in the North, arts meant music, theatre and art. I taught them as either single subjects or combined subjects, depending on the school concerned. However, music meant listening, composing and performing. In my time at school, music meant listening only. That is no reflection on the teacher but on the resources available and on the school's priorities. One cannot pretend to teach music without providing some element of composition and performance.</P>
    <P>How will we create people who perform for others if we refuse to invest in local young people, a percentage of whom will stay in our communities and teach? How will we do this in regions <Col N="1043" /> like north-east Donegal which is so far from the perceived centres of Dublin, Cork or Galway &ndash; often people do not realise that my home is 20 miles further from Galway than from Dublin &ndash; unless we embrace the Border facilities, which is beginning to happen? How will we get people to play instruments other than the piano if we cannot offer support for people to buy instruments to form brass and reed bands or orchestras? The current supports for school instruments, which come under the Department of Education and Science, are either insufficient or are not being thrust at the schools. At Easter 1997, when I left the school in Derry in which I taught, I had about £40,000 sterling at my disposal to spend on instruments for the school, together with an already fine selection of resources and a number of peripatetic teachers who came in to teach individuals. Where are our priorities? The gap, between that £40,000 in funding and what we would be given here, needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>Music is not all about making young musicians. One lesson I learned from my time in Belfast was that it is proven that children's physical dexterity, rhythmic development, speech development and numeracy development are all improved through music. If primary schools focused more on music, would there be the same level of dyslexia or similar complaints arising in the seven plus age group? We do not need experts to teach this music. Anyone can sing songs, clap hands or bang drums. When I had £40,000 at my disposal in a school in which I taught, I spent £5 on dowelling rods which I chopped and sanded into 30 sets of wooden blocks. This cost very little money but created enormous fun and excitement for the children. The people who taught me when I studied for the postgraduate certificate in education gave me insights into how to do a great deal with little money and my pupils got more fun from the wooden blocks than from the very expensive keyboards which I also purchased, and I had more fun teaching with them. One does not have to be an expert to teach music. One simply needs a little incentive to find music where one might not have known it existed. We must give people the vision to see that music is important and not beyond their capabilities.</P>
    <P>The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism must work with the Department of Education and Science to sell the message that education and the arts are interlinked and that there is a value for both in co-operation.</P>
    <P>I do not make my living from music but my life has been enriched by my exchange with it. Nowhere in the world is a musician shunned. Music has taught me much about teamwork and patience and has given me an emotional outlet. If I am in bad form I can take out my frustrations on the piano rather than on another person and this has been healthy for me. If music can be healthy for me it can be healthy for other people.</P>
    <P>Should I be penalised for living in Donegal? I am delighted we have a new location for artistic <Col N="1044" /> expression in the Grianan theatre in Letterkenny and I am also delighted that a number of people teach music in the county and go beyond the call of duty to provide opportunities for others. Working in the field of arts in Donegal is a labour of love as much as a livelihood. We have a youth orchestra in Donegal but it survives despite the system and not because of it. This must change.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the current structure of the Arts Council. The representation on the board of the council does not have a sufficient geographical spread. There is no representative from north of a line from Dublin to Galway, the traditional border which I often encounter. This leaves a large section of the country with no representative and no one who can tell the story of the Border counties. Those involved in the arts in the Border counties are like children standing outside a sweetshop but who have no money to spend. A couple of miles up the road from us we see what is provided for primary and secondary schools in Northern Ireland. The Arts Council should hear from a representative of the Border region. There are as many experts there as anywhere else.</P>
    <P>When did Inishowen last see the impact of the Arts Council? When did we have a seminar hosted, a concert sponsored or a music publication financed? When was our collective view sought? Where or to whom has the huge increase in funding gone? The Arts Council budget has risen from &euro;26.44 million in 1997 to &euro;48 million this year. Is the Arts Council elitist and should it be? If, as the Minister says, the Arts Council is the vehicle through which the Government supports the arts in Ireland and if it has come a long way and is well established as the major driver of artistic development in the country, I have missed this and the region I represent would like to know more about the activities of the Arts Council.</P>
    <P>Small performers are not being supported. The Donegal County Council arts officer does much work with the tiny budget available to him but how can a young person who shows potential make progress if his only option is to find a teacher in Dublin? Does anyone realise the time and expense involved in travelling to Dublin for music lessons? Nevertheless, people in Donegal do this. I speak to many people who have been told by adjudicators at local feiseanna that their children have talent and should pursue further musical study but who cannot afford to take a full day once a fortnight to take a child to Dublin and to pay for music lessons.</P>
    <P>The Royal Irish Academy of Music examination fees increase constantly. The academy is a wonderful institution and it is good to have it. However, does the academy seize every opportunity to give young people the chance to reach the heights that a little nurturing would yield? Young talent should be encouraged so that Ireland can derive benefit from it in the future.</P>
    <P>The Royal Irish Academy of Music and the Irish Permanent have recently co-operated in a scheme for high achievers. I commend the <Col N="1045" /> academy and the Irish Permanent for this initiative but the scheme is not perfect. Children who perform exceptionally well in the academy's practical exams are advised of this by letter and are called to audition at a location anything up to 100 miles from their homes. This involves a day's travel for themselves, their teachers, their parents and their accompanist. The successful few may be asked to perform at a concert at another venue equally far away and a smaller number are then selected to perform in Dublin where they might receive a monetary prize. Each occasion involves expense for the young person's family. Would it not be better, after the examination, to send pupils a letter of congratulations, invite them to perform at a concert of high achievers in Dublin or at a regional venue and ensure that all involved are at least afforded travelling expenses? I hope this suggestion can be considered, as the current dragging out of the process does not serve any purpose, with people expected to attend at venues where public transport is frequently not available. The initiative of rewarding success is welcome but young musicians should not be asked to climb a metaphorical Everest as well.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Science, talk to me about the non-recognition of the performing arts course in Sligo? When will the north west achieve the recognition it truly deserves.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Select Committee on Education and Science I used every opportunity to develop the role and significance of music in education, from music as therapy to music on school buses. The links at an interdepartmental level between arts and education will show how seriously the Minister is pursuing his brief and I am confident he will make a difference, above and beyond the legislation before us today.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister taking a hands-on approach to the promotion of the arts inside and outside the State. I was interested to learn that the Arts Council recently granted money for five publications, two of which were in Armagh. I commend the all-Ireland nature of the way the money is dispersed. When I worked in Belfast there were a number of different places where I could seek finance. I suggest we develop reciprocal arrangements with funding agencies in Northern Ireland, which seem to have more money at their disposal.</P>
    <P>The Minister is empowered to give directions to the Arts Council to prepare and submit a plan. There should be a regional policy of financing young bands and orchestras. Sports grants have done much to help regional and local sports facilities. If every county knew that money was available for arts facilities they would quickly find ways to spend it. Money could readily be spent by local bands. Any band could easily spend &euro;100,000 on new instruments and uniforms and I do not know how many bands there are in County Donegal. Great work is being done with the tiny amounts of money that are coming into <Col N="1046" /> the county but much more needs to be done. It must first be recognised that local bands are of use and of importance.</P>
    <P>When I was a member of the Donegal County Council arts committee I introduced a bursary system whereby a small amount of money was put aside for five categories of the arts. An annual competition was held for the award of an arts bursary. Such recognition of achievers is important.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 6 of the Bill which requires local authorities to draw up arts plans and will allow them to have an input into Government arts policy. The promotion of artistic standards, of knowledge of the arts and of public interest in them is well and good but more basic activity is required. We must give money to those who are trying to help beginners. We are very good at recognising those who have achieved great heights but how can a learner proceed from grade one to grade eight and into the system? We will have an input. Promoting knowledge of the arts and improving standards and public interest is useful but measures will have to be more basic than that. Funding must be given to those trying to help beginners. We are good at the other end. We recognise people when they have achieved great heights but we should be concentrating on how they get from grade one to grade eight and into the system. That is where funding is required. Money should be provided where we hope to see development.</P>
    <P>On section 9, the Arts Council should be given a reasonable spread whatever about reducing the number of people. There is a lot within this Bill. I am glad the Minister will take on board comments made on Committee Stage. I congratulate all those in Donegal involved in the battle to develop the arts. They are working hard and need support and funding. Investment will pay dividends. I hope the Minister takes my comments as constructive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatBreen" hpid="Mr. P. Breen Mr. P. Breen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Arts Bill, 2002 is the first significant piece of legislation on the arts since 1973 and, as such, it must be seen in a positive light. It repeals the Arts Acts of 1951 and 1973, sets out the parameters for the State within which arts policy will be formulated over the coming years and defines the over-arching structures through which this policy will be defined and delivered. While the Bill is to be broadly welcomed as a means to update the development and promotion of the arts, there are some areas of sections 11 and 21 that are highly problematic and detrimental to the arts in my constituency of County Clare. Section 21 provides for three standing committees on the arts to be established and to focus on the three district areas of the traditional Irish arts, innovation and the arts and local authorities and the arts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of serious issues arising from the provision of these standing committees. Clare is the home of traditional music in Ireland. <Col N="1047" /> There is much disquiet in the county about section 21(10) of the Arts Bill, which gives the standing committee on traditional Irish arts the power to recommend those to whom the Arts Council will provide funding. The other two committees will not have this power. I am worried that, as the legislation now stands, the five members of the standing committee on traditional arts will be able to define the make-up of traditional music, and make funding recommendations accordingly. This is so even if their definition of what is traditional is contrary to the Arts Council's funding priorities or definitions.</P>
    <P>Traditional music has historically been under-funded by the Arts Council but this mechanism is not the way to address the problem. Traditional music is the cultural lifeblood of Ireland and it needs the support of Government to continue and flourish. However, to isolate it from other art forms is not to safeguard it. The annual Willie Clancy festival in Milltown Malbay, which attracts untold thousands from every corner of the globe to one of the greatest traditional music spectacles in the country, is one example. The idea of categorising our music in this way is the opposite of what we want and to fund it along these lines is even more outrageous.</P>
    <P>That Irish traditional music will stagnate in isolation rather than continuing its evolution is the message from County Clare. Irish music and artists should be supported on the basis of quality performance rather than on the standing committee's definition of Irishness or tradition. The Glór centre in Ennis is the national centre for the performance of Irish music and dance. It is an asset of which the people of County Clare are very proud. However, Glór and the other music festivals in County Clare should be free to programme on the basis of quality alone. To fund them in this way is not the way forward. The traditional arts have been too low on the Arts Council's priorities to receive the funding they merit. That is where both the problem and the solution lie.</P>
    <P>This is a funding problem and needs to be addressed within the structures of the new Arts Council, rather than being provided for in the legislation. The proposal for the standing committee on traditional Irish arts will not reassure anyone in that sector that funding for those arts will be in any way enhanced. Given that this committee of five can arrive at a definition of tradition that may contradict the Arts Council definition, and can recommend funding on that basis, this proposal will further undermine the credibility of the council in the area of traditional arts funding.</P>
    <P>Unlike the situation which existed prior to this legislation, the Arts Bill is structured so that the Minister and the Department can facilitate the new Arts Council in employing officers and policies in particular areas. Traditional arts funding should be made a high priority through this channel. The recommendations in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report on the Arts Bill submissions <Col N="1048" /> suggest that logic and fiscal rectitude are the answer to the problem of traditional arts funding, and they are to be found inside the existing structures. This is fully reflected in the Bill before the House and I call for the provisions of section 21(10), that allow for a standing committee on traditional arts to decide which persons shall receive funding from the Arts Council, to be removed without delay from the Bill. The standing committee should have the same powers as the other committees, which is the power to advise on policy and other matters relating to the traditional arts.</P>
    <P>There are clear criteria in the Bill for making up the three standing committees. This is to the further detriment of the legislation. The Oireachtas, on this and future readings of the Bill, should look closely at the basis of the standing committee system. The criteria for establishing the proposed standing committees need to be established. There should be some mechanism for the council to be advised on specific policy areas but the reason that the three current areas are selected above other areas, such as education, is unclear. There may be a case for removing the standing committee system completely from the Bill. This is something that has been repeatedly put to me and it would be remiss of the House not to investigate it.</P>
    <P>A case can be made for including a mechanism to review the standing committee remit on the arts in Ireland. What is relevant for three committees now may not be relevant in five or ten years' time and we should allow for this. There is also a case to be made for appointing committees with new remits such as education and the arts, an area that seems to be particularly lacking. I support any call in the Bill to have such a committee established. However, any committee that provides policy guidance and advice to the council should not have the power to recommend funding.</P>
    <P>The basis of the standing committee system and the criteria for establishing standing committees needs to be identified by the Oireachtas to allow for the coherent enlargement of this mechanism. The Oireachtas should closely examine section 21 to establish whether there are proper criteria for establishing standing committees of the Arts Council, and whether the area of education and the arts should, among others, be added. In doing so, the Oireachtas should consider whether the standing committee system as proposed should be removed from the Bill and whether a review system should be included.</P>
    <P>In providing for a separate traditional arts committee, this Bill implies that there is a distinction between innovative, or contemporary, and traditional arts. This is a false and retrograde distinction, as Irish artists working with traditional art forms routinely contemporize and innovate. Examples such as Altan, Riverdance, Christy Moore and Micheál Ó Súilleabháin, not to mention Martin Hayes and Seán Keane from County Clare, bear this out. Section 21 leaves open the <Col N="1049" /> question of whether innovation in traditional forms will be recognised and valued in the committee's terms. It implies that such forms may be deemed to be worth funding.</P>
    <P>Festivals such as the one in Feakle in east Clare promote and encourage innovation in traditional music. One cannot be separated from the other in Feakle and such a dynamic has to be recognised in the Bill. Different types of music should not be kept in different compartments &ndash; that is not how the music world works. Similarly, Irish music and Irish artists should be supported on the basis of quality of performance, rather than on the standing committee's definition of Irishness or tradition. It is unwise to isolate one genre or style of Irish music. I am extremely concerned that the Arts Bill, 2002, will separate Irish music from other musical and cultural activities. It would be wrong to put Irish music in a cul-de-sac where it will languish without access to other music and art forms.</P>
    <P>Section 21 is divisive, as it will undermine innovation in traditional forms, as well as the Arts Council itself. To enshrine this proposal in legislation is to enshrine division and to seriously damage the role of the Arts Bill in the development of the traditional arts. Alternative solutions need to be examined on Committee Stage. Given the serious concerns of artists and arts administrators in relation to the provisions of the Arts Bill, I ask that the committee be open to taking oral submissions on section 21 as part of its Committee Stage deliberations. The legislative process, which has the potential in this case to benefit the arts, will be incomplete if this is not done.</P>
    <P>Section 11, which I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, dictates that the council shall consist of nine members, rather than 14 as is the case at present. As a representative of County Clare, I am concerned that this proposal will mean that a full regional representation on the board will not be possible. The problems I have already outlined will be compounded by the fact that a broad spectrum of art forms will not be represented on such a small board. Section 11(1)(<i>b</i>) has to be amended to provide for a higher number of council members if this deficiency is to be remedied. I suggest that the House consider the insertion of a section asserting that the composition of the board of the Arts Council should reflect the regional dimension of arts participation in Ireland and the wide diversity of Irish art forms. Such an amendment would mean that the membership of the Arts Council could be maintained at closer to 15 than nine.</P>

      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Andrews, with the agreement of the House. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Arts Bill, 2002, which is long overdue. Many years have passed and the arts in Ireland have seen many changes since significant legislation was passed in this area. In essence, this Bill sets out to define the role of the Government in developing arts policy. It also makes changes to <Col N="1050" /> the structure of the Arts Council and clarifies the relationship between the council and the Government. While I realise that every section will be the subject of a full and detailed examination on Committee Stage, I wish to highlight one or two key sections which are of particular interest to me and to those with whom I have spoken in recent times.</P>
      <P>I commend section 6 which requires local authorities to &ldquo;prepare and implement plans for the development of the arts&rdquo;. This highly innovative and forward-looking proposal will be one of the key elements of the Bill when it is implemented. As a member of Laois County Council, I found it thoroughly worthwhile some years ago when local authorities were asked to draw up heritage plans. Everybody involved benefited, as the people of the county could see that matters of heritage were taken seriously at a local level. The involvement of local authorities in drawing up such plans is excellent and I am sure it will lead to sustained development of the arts. I am particularly pleased that a standing committee has been established under section 21(1)(<i>b</i>) to deal with the development of the arts through local authorities. It is important that the legislation does not merely establish the Arts Council and ask local authorities to prepare and implement arts plans, without backing up these proposals. I am pleased that the standing committee will liaise with the local authorities and, above all, help to ensure that the plans are implemented as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>There has been a vacuum in this area until now. The Laois Arts Festival will run between 24 and 31 October this year and will include children's events, cinema, comedy, dance, traditional music, rock music, visual arts, ballet, literature and theatre. Funding for the festival has been provided by the Arts Council, Laois County Council, the Laois Leader programme and the <i>Leinster Express.</i> Many contributions have also been received from the private sector. The performance of arts in County Laois was greatly enhanced some years ago when the Dunamaise Theatre was opened in Portlaoise. There had been a great vacuum in the county until then, as those who wished to participate in the arts, whether as performers or spectators, had to travel outside the county. The people of Laois had quite a low participation rate in the arts, but the Dunamaise Theatre in Portlaoise provided a much needed boost. The role of the local authorities will be enhanced by this Bill in so far as they will be specifically charged with drawing up and implementing arts plans. I hope this will mean that arts festivals and similar events will not only be protected, but that they will go from strength to strength. I appreciate and welcome the increased involvement of the Government, through the local government structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Arts Council has not looked after the traditional arts sector as we would wish. The former Minister, Deputy de Valera, sought submissions on this issue some months ago and I know the <Col N="1051" /> detailed submission I made at that point was carefully considered along with several hundred other such submissions. I do not know how many other Members of the Oireachtas took the time to make their opinions known, but I was pleased to do so in view of the need for improvement in this area. The essence of my submission at that time was that there should be a formal structure for the traditional arts. I may have even asked for a separate council to deal with the traditional arts, but I am happy with the outcome of the public consultation process. The Arts Council will be legally required to establish a standing committee on the traditional arts. I am glad the new committee will be empowered to make recommendations on funding and policy. This historic measure must be implemented as soon as possible. The Bill's approach will not separate the traditional arts from the rest of the arts world, but will ensure that they have the separate identity they need.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the traditional arts have been overlooked in the past as a consequence of élitism, but we are moving away from such problems. The arts are for all the people of Ireland and not just for a select group. The involvement of the local authorities will help to further develop the arts for the general public. On previous occasions, the Arts Council only allocated 3% of its budget to the traditional arts, which was a significant mistake. I am pleased there has been decisive Government action on this issue.</P>
    <P>Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and other groups will be involved in the consultation with local authorities. There are seven active branches of CCE in County Laois and they make a major contribution. The original arts legislation did not refer to the traditional arts but the Bill corrects this. Membership of the Arts Council will be reduced from 17 to eight members and a chairperson, which will make it more effective.</P>
    <P>The traditional arts comprise a wide variety of activities including songs in both Irish and English, instrumental music, dance and storytelling, recitation and dramatic forms in both Irish and English. Their strengths have been their roots in the community, continued usage over time, their central role in the community's heritage and the way in which they inform the identify of the community. They must be fostered and I welcome the proposed establishment of a standing committee for the traditional arts.</P>
    <P>There is much more to the arts than the traditional arts and I have given the example of the ambitious arts festival in County Laois as a result of the tremendous work of voluntary committees. I hope the burden on their shoulders will be lightened in the years ahead through more direct involvement by local authorities in the provision of funding and additional staff. We are pleased that local authority staff have been appointed in the arts but I look forward to an increase in numbers in the future, thereby, helping to ensure as many people as possible participate in the arts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fleming for sharing time. When taxpayers' money is expended, there should be accountability and the notion of value for money is associated with all expenditure. The arts have a capacity to improve society and discharge an important social function and, in this context, there is accountability. If arts have this potential, we have a duty to open up the coffers generously. However, the arts must be different in some ways. Pressure could be exerted upon the Arts Council to justify spending in the context of reduced spending on more worthy social aims.</P>
      <P>However, there are tangible environmental, social and economic benefits of the arts upon which we should not be afraid to comment. There were 180 students in my year when I sat the leaving certificate but only four of us took music as a subject. That reflects the peripheral nature of such activities in society and the way in which the curriculum is devised. Musical and artistic interests can only be fulfilled outside the school and of the 180 students in my year, the vast majority were obsessed with one form of music or another but they had no outlet whatsoever in the school curriculum to indulge those interests. There are many non-State funded arts organisations filling the gaps and I hope the wider definition of arts in the legislation will fill these gaps in terms of funding.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harkin made a comment earlier which set me thinking about whether sport should be included under the Department's umbrella. It is appropriate that arts and sport should be covered by the same Department although it is difficult to measure the value and benefit that would accrue from investment in these areas. The Arts Council should engage in a process of developing community identity in a real way. Society is less a collection of individual communities than was the case heretofore and the council could direct its attention to the areas where performance, display, creation and participation can allow communities to communicate and develop shared identities.</P>
      <P>It is in this sense that a truly independent Arts Council must be created to acknowledge the difference that exists between a Government's narrow search for value for money and the artist's search for something that is worthy in itself. We are not all arts critics but the Arts Council has served a useful social purpose throughout the State and that is central to the debate that the council must create. The council has developed its own arts plan and it is conscious of the debate between value for money and the value of art itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council's website states: &ldquo;We must encourage a situation where the long-term viability of organisations is underpinned by a mixture of supports from various sources and success with audiences&rdquo;. It is, therefore, not satisfactory that arts should be good as they must satisfy a large number of people and gain a wider audience. The council is conscious that arts funding must move <Col N="1053" /> from allocation by a single source and justify itself in terms of popular success. Its website also states: &ldquo;It will mean greater clarity around the purpose for which grants are given and more effort being put into assessing their impact.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is difficult to measure the benefit of arts funding and to produce a balance sheet that indicates there has been worthwhile investment. However, the council is conscious of that and I am glad the new arts plans and legislation provide changes in structure that reflect that debate. The arts plan states: &ldquo;Arts planning should reflect priorities that are capable of testing by public consultation and measurement with reference to targets and outcomes&rdquo;. These are semi-commercial means of measuring the level of funding to be invested in the arts.</P>
    <P>The amendment of the definition of the arts in section 2 is to be welcomed. The definition in the 1951 Act included the usual mainstream arts and it was barely amended in 1973 to include the word &ldquo;cinema&rdquo;. The new definition casts the net more widely, although it omits the words &ldquo;painting&rdquo; and &ldquo;sculpture&rdquo; from the original definition, which might require explanation. The Dance Theatre of Ireland and Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann have their headquarters in my constituency and both organisations are delighted that dance has been included in the definition.</P>
    <P>Section 24 mirrors its equivalent in the 1951 Act with one difference. It underlines the independence of the council and the disbursement of funds. This power is unfettered by the power provided in section 5(3), which allows the Minister to give a direction in writing requiring the legislation to comply with specified Government policy. The council shall comply with the direction under the section. I am not sure what is its purpose or in what circumstances the Minister would issue such a direction. This power may attract attention on Committee Stage. As a statutory body, the council is required to comply with legislation in the areas of employment equality and so on and the Minister might explain the section when he replies. Under section 6 local authorities are required to prepare plans for the arts and, in so doing, comply with Government policy on the arts whereas the Arts Council has to comply with Government policy without qualification.</P>
    <P>Ireland was one of the first nations to establish an arts council in 1951 and this year a new arts plan has been drafted for the period 2002-06 with a budget of &euro;314 million. A new Minister has been appointed and I wish him luck as we enter a new and exciting time for the arts.</P>

      <P>This Bill is the creation of the previous Minister in the former Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and its proposals for the administration of the arts need to <Col N="1054" /> be questioned. I oppose the perception that the Bill is advantageous to the promotion and administration of the arts. It stresses the independence of the Arts Council but seeks to grant more powers to the Minister and to centralise politically areas that are already administered by the Arts Council.</P>
      <P>The Bill ignores the opportunity to tackle the fundamental difficulties behind the widest possible expression of artistic activity, the democratisation of the arts. There are problems with the interference in Arts Council activities. The Bill seeks to give a guaranteed funding stream to traditional arts, music and culture. That is welcome but in introducing a specific reference in the legislation that concentrates on one art form, the Minister is risking the alienation of practitioners of other arts forms. If it is possible to dedicate a funding stream and decision making process to one area of the arts, why not do it for all of them?</P>
      <P>The Arts Council is perceived outside Dublin as being based in and influenced by Dublin. The Bill misses the opportunity to take a regionalised approach to the arts. This approach has been effective in Britain, where the Arts Council works on a regional basis and access to funding is more widespread.</P>
      <P>The Bill is insular in the way it views the practice and enjoyment of the arts in this State. We should take pride in our ability to express ourselves artistically at international level and I am disappointed we are not aiming for structures to reflect that. Film has had a stuttered history in the past decade and its potential has never been truly realised. By combining many elements of Irish artistic life, it could be more effective, from the writing of scripts to directing, from acting to set design and lighting.</P>
      <P>This legislation should also tackle international representation of festivals in Ireland. Cork city holds international choral, jazz, film and folk festivals and in 2005 will be the European City of Culture. All those things happened in spite of the organs that should have been more progressive and enlightened in bringing about these events. I am worried that planning for the European City of Culture year is not as advanced as it should be and that the artistic community is not as involved as it might be. This should be addressed.</P>
      <P>A greater onus has been placed on local authorities in the promotion of artistic activities in administrative areas. The council of which I have been a member for 11 years has a proud history of such work, with the highest<i> per capita</i> allocation of grants under arts legislation. By putting a greater onus on local authorities, however, without having it matched with greater remuneration and support from central Government, this will remain a pious hope. How can extra resources be provided at local level to meet the needs that exist in the local communities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must promote the arts and get rid of the perception that they are the preserve of the privileged. Much art can be enjoyed on a broad based level. Current structures and even those proposed <Col N="1055" /> in this legislation will not achieve this unless there is a change in the philosophy behind the arts and their place in society. I look forward to tabling amendments on Committee Stage that will change this Bill for the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a blossoming of the arts in all areas in recent years. There is no doubt that the arts have moved from being seen as elite to a central part of every community. In Clonmel there are the South Tipperary Arts Centre, the new museum, the Gallowglass Theatre Company, Clonmel Theatre Guild and St. Mary's Choral Society in music. In other towns there are also such societies. It is right, therefore, that a new Arts Bill should be enacted. The regulation of the arts goes back to the Arts Acts of 1951 and 1973. Thirty years later we need new ideas on how the arts can be brought to local communities and made more accessible.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, although I have some concerns about it and I hope they will be teased out on Committee Stage. Some speakers have raised the extent to which the Minister and his Department will have control over the arts. Art, by its very nature, should be as independent as possible of political intervention. There is a provision in the Bill which halves the number of representative members on the Arts Council and it is a particularly worrying feature. The reduction in the number of members will not allow for a spread of regional membership or of the art forms that should be represented on the council, including performers, artists and organisations, and that will impinge on its ability to perform its functions.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers referred to the provisions relating to local authorities in the Bill, which I welcome, given that many local authorities are already involved in promoting the arts. Tipperary (South Riding) County Council promotes the arts generally in the county through the South Tipperary arts centre, the Tipperary Excel centre in Tipperary town and many other local sites. However, an opportunity has been missed to provide local authorities with a mandatory responsibility for developing the arts. With that goes the question of funding local authorities to perform work in this area which will have to be addressed.</P>
      <P>The place of the arts in education has not been given enough attention in the Bill. For too long young people have not had access to art and music through their normal educational experience, be it at primary, secondary or vocational level. The provision of an arts curriculum as part and parcel of the school and educational experience should be made integral to this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hesitate to describe as amateur the many choral, dramatic and musical societies that are near-professional, putting a huge amount of time, effort and their own money into performing the arts in local communities. Over the years it has been brought to my attention that they have had little or no support from the Arts Council and <Col N="1056" /> that should be addressed in this Bill. For a long time there was very little in the way of art forms in many of our towns with the exception of these amateur musical, dramatic and choral societies and the work they have done, and are doing, has not been given enough recognition. Funding should be made available to these societies and their activities should be brought under the umbrella of this Arts Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion of traditional Irish art forms in the Bill as it is time to recognise and embrace them through the Arts Council. I fully agree with the statements that have been made about these art forms. When the word &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; is used, we always think it refers to that which is of the past, which is history, but Irish traditional art is a contemporary art form drawing on the past and showing us the way to the future. Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann has very much welcomed the provisions in the Bill, but I am unsure that the standing committee system is the right vehicle through which to support Irish traditional art. Whatever the vehicle is &ndash; and it will be discussed on Committee Stage &ndash; recognition and support of these arts through the legislation must be supported on all Stages of debate in this House and included in the Act passed by the Oireachtas. The Bill was unanimously welcomed by the several hundred delegates from here and abroad who attended the Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann annual congress in Cultúrlann na hÉireann. Comhaltas is a huge national organisation and will hold its annual fleadh cheoil in my home town, Clonmel, in 2003 and 2004. The organisation has developed traditional art in all its forms over the last number of years to the point where they now have mass support and a large number of young people are involved in various forms of music, song and dance. The fleadh cheoil in Clonmel in 2003 will be attended by something like 250,000 visitors, 10,000 performers and in the region of &euro;15 million will come into the local economy which is why it is time that this form of art was properly supported and funded.</P>
    <P>The matters I wish to see addressed on Committee Stage are those of direct control of the arts by the Minister and the Department, arts funding, mandatory responsibility for local authorities, the arts in education, the reduced size of the Arts Council and the implications for regional and artistic representation as well as the question of funding for amateur arts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF" hpid="Dr. Devins Dr. Devins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Devins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Fiona O'Malley. I welcome the Arts Bill which will make existing arts legislation more relevant and appropriate. The Bill will revamp the Arts Council which will continue to be the main State agency for the promotion and development of the arts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation recognises the council's independence in terms of the allocation of funding while requiring it to establish three standing committees, one to cover arts activities of local authorities, one to cover Irish traditional arts and one <Col N="1057" /> to cover new art and innovation. As a local authority member, I welcome the requirement that such authorities prepare and implement arts plans within their geographic areas. Some local authorities already do that and I congratulate Sligo County Council in that regard. It will be to the benefit of the arts in general that this is now a requirement for all local authorities. I also welcome the provision that local authorities may provide financial assistance to stimulate public interest in the arts. I would like a specific requirement that local authorities provide financial assistance. I congratulate the many arts officers who are doing great work in their areas at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken an innovative step in setting up the standing committee on traditional art. There has been an overwhelming response from the public following the publication of the White Paper. More than 50% of the submissions relate to Irish traditional arts. Irish traditional arts were not given any specific mention in previous arts legislation, namely, the Arts Acts, 1951 and 1973. The Bill corrects that omission. I note with interest that there is no definition of traditional arts. I assume that was done deliberately as the imposition of a rigid definition might result in a particular element or section of traditional art being excluded as it may not have been considered at the time of passing the legislation.</P>
    <P>However, there is a body of opinion which feels the definition of traditional arts in the legislation would be of benefit. Perhaps the definition used by UNESCO may be appropriate. UNESCO defines traditional arts as the totality of tradition based creations of a cultural community expressed by an individual or group and recognised as reflecting the expectations of the community in so far as they reflect its cultural and social identity and its standards and values which are transmitted orally by imitation or by other means. Its forms are, among others, language, literature, music, dance, games, mythology, rituals, customs, handicrafts, architecture and other arts. In addition to these examples, account should be taken of traditional forms of communication and information. It encompasses everything for which traditional art stands.</P>
    <P>The setting up of a distinct standing committee to deal with new art innovation is a bold step forward and reflects the exciting developments occurring in the arts in Ireland today. While there is a repository of artistic achievement in Ireland, art, by its nature, should be at the cutting edge of society. It should challenge society and provoke us all. At times we may not agree with it, but if we are engaged by art in its many diverse forms, it has already succeeded. I look forward to the work of the standing committee.</P>
    <P>The second area to which the Bill relates is the Arts Council. That primarily deals with its composition, functions and membership. The introduction of rolling membership will be of great benefit to the continuity of the council. One of the areas where the Arts Council has done great <Col N="1058" /> work is in the distribution of funding to all artistic endeavours throughout the country. I know from first hand experience the help and encouragement such funding has given to various art developments in Sligo and Leitrim. It has been a great boost to a variety of endeavours, ranging from theatre to visual arts and literary performance.</P>
    <P>There is one area to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention and it would be of great help in the further development of the arts. The Model Arts and Niland Gallery in Sligo is one of the newer exhibition spaces in the country. It is home to a permanent collection of Irish art, including the greatest number of Jack B. Yeats paintings in the world. It is entirely appropriate that the collection of Yeats paintings is housed and exhibited in Sligo. The monetary value of this collection is immeasurable, but the artistic value is immense. It has acted as a focus for many exciting exhibitions. The gallery is housed in an old model school which has been totally revamped. It now has appropriate staff, superb exhibitions and storage and security practices which rival any other exhibition space in the country.</P>
    <P>Under section 1003 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, approved body status is a designation whereby persons donating heritage items of a certain value to an approved body may claim relief to the value of that item against their liabilities for taxes. This designation currently lies with the five national collections, all of which are housed in Dublin. The Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, has the authority to approve other bodies for the purpose of this relief. The board of the Model Arts and Niland Gallery, which is a municipal gallery in Sligo, has applied in the past for approved status. Denial of this status seems counter to the Arts Council's philosophy of strengthening arts and heritage provision in the regions. That philosophy is shared by the Minister who comes from the artistically rich County Kerry. My belief, which is shared by the board of the Model Arts and Niland Gallery, is that denial of approved status may negatively impact on its ability to acquire objects which should remain in the area for the benefit of the viewing public and thus contribute as a focus of its collection in addition to the active exhibition and research programmes it undertakes. Granting this status will not impact negatively on the acquisitions practice of the national collections. On behalf of the people of Sligo and Leitrim, I ask the Minister to consider granting approved body status to the Model Arts and Niland Gallery.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on this worthwhile Bill. There is an exciting time ahead for the arts in general, particularly in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD" hpid="Ms F. O'Malley Ms F. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Bill. It is 30 years since an Arts Bill was introduced in the House and a lot has changed in Irish society and in art practice during that time. Identifying arts and culture is probably the most significant and central element in the evolution of a <Col N="1059" /> nation. The arts are also important from an economic and social perspective. We are fortunate to have an internationally recognised musical and literary tradition. Before I was elevated to the House, I worked in the arts in London. During the mid 1990s I was at the coalface of contemporary cutting edge practice. Irish theatre and literature were often the best there was around at the time. The status granted to artists by the Finance Act, 1969, was applauded and deeply appreciated by arts practitioners because it gave artists status in Irish society, which was envied by people in other countries.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill to reduce the size of the Arts Council. The reduction in the number of its members from nine to seven and the introduction of a rolling membership system will contribute to the easier and better running of the council. I also welcome the inclusion of the functions of a local authority in developing the arts and art practices. Perhaps the Minister should go further and make it mandatory for local authorities to develop the arts. I have some reservations about the Bill. I am sure everyone agrees that the arts have been well served by the Arts Council, which has operated on the principle of keeping things at arm's length. We should continue with that. I am concerned about the development of standing committees. They may take away the freedom and independence of the Arts Council to develop its own priorities. Priorities may be imposed through the three standing committees.</P>
      <P>I have always subscribed to Ciarán Benson's philosophy which he outlined in his book entitled <i>The Place of the Arts and Irish Education.</i> His philosophy is to make the arts part of everyday life and not a refuge from it. The best way to achieve that is through the education system. I lament the fact that the education system has not been incorporated in this Bill. We should investigate how this could be done on Committee Stage. Bringing the arts into the curriculum would make them part of everyday life.</P>
      <P>My other slight reservation about the Bill concerns the definition of the word &ldquo;arts&rdquo;. There is no need to differentiate between traditional and contemporary arts. It makes them appear to be in opposition. The more loosely the arts are defined, the less likely it will be that elements of arts practice develop in opposition to each other. Traditional arts and contemporary arts are not mutually exclusive. Our traditional music, for example, is evolving and has contemporary elements. The decision to differentiate in this way is unnecessary and I recommend its deletion.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. I am delighted it has been given such priority on the legislative agenda for this session and I look forward to the debate on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate. As Deputy O'Malley stated, it has been a long time since the previous <Col N="1060" /> Arts Bill. The whole debate around the Bill has been very positive and has given the arts community and the general community, which is just as important, the opportunity to discuss the role of art and culture in our society. As well as Professor Benson's considerable contribution, many other reports covering various aspects of the arts, such as dance and music, have been published in recent years.</P>
      <P>I hope all the viewpoints expressed in the wider debate on the arts will inform the Minister's decisions. He is new to this field and has inherited the text of the Bill from his predecessor. We have heard a range of opinion on the Bill both inside and outside the House. I ask the Minister to take time to weigh up all the points that have been made, particularly with regard to the traditional arts, before finalising the legislation.</P>
      <P>Two clear but opposing views have emerged on this issue. I recognise that all the protagonists have expressed their views with genuine goodwill and in the desire to see the best for the traditional arts. This area needs to be prioritised as it has not always been emphasised to the extent it should be. The Bill needs to be amended and I ask that the Minister takes time to incorporate all elements of the debate in the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill should contain a broader vision, a sense of what the arts mean to society. The word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; should also have been retained in the title of the Department. As Deputy O'Malley stated, there is a wider dimension to all this. It would have been feasible to include a broader vision in the text in order to strengthen links between the arts and wider society. I hope the new Minister will have a broad mind on these issues.</P>
      <P>By and large, the current arm's length relationship between the Minister, his Department and the Arts Council has been positive and has given a great deal of confidence to people working in the arts. It has also created a strong requirement for accountability. I became aware of this through my long-standing membership of the board of a professional, regionally-based theatre company, which is largely funded by the Arts Council, the Island Theatre Company in Limerick.</P>
      <P>While we may not always agree with the decisions taken by the Arts Council, for the most part it enjoys a positive and healthy relationship with the various organisations it funds. It is a mutually respectful relationship which keeps companies and venues on their toes, ensuring they account for every penny of funding allocated to them and forcing them to seek business, rather than expecting to get their entire funding from public sources. This has been positive for all aspects of the arts in recent years.</P>
      <P>Partnership is the proper relationship between the Arts Council and the Government of the day. These proposals appear to move us towards a type of autocratic system in which the Minister makes policy, the Arts Council implements it and it then comes down the line. I ask the Minister to reconsider his proposals in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" />While reducing the number of members of the Arts Council would have benefits, it would also have several downsides which need to be considered. It is important that each element of the arts is represented on the council to ensure that its expertise is drawn from all the art forms. The geographical aspect should not be ignored because the arts have developed significantly in recent years in local authorities and the regions generally. It is important, therefore, to reflect that geographical spread. I will not suggest a specific figure, but I ask the Minister to reconsider the number of members on the council.</P>
    <P>The main item of contention relates to the standing committees. I have doubts about the reasons for the nature and number of standing committees. Again, I ask the Minister to re-examine the issue. The three committees proposed appear to be have been chosen at random. I also share the concerns of other Members about separating traditional arts from innovation. The omission of education is another major concern because these matters are all interrelated.</P>
    <P>The selection of traditional arts raises a question about why other art forms were not selected. Why have traditional arts been placed in a separate category? I am going to a festival this weekend in Limerick, the Sionna festival. It starts tonight with fiddlers while tomorrow night will feature accordion players and various support musicians. On Sunday there will be a family day in the city hall. The principal organiser of the festival is the Irish World Music Centre, based in the University of Limerick. It is also supported by Shannon Development, Limerick City Council and, I believe, Limerick County Council &ndash; I am not sure if other local authorities are involved. Given that the festival has elements of all the areas covered by the standing committees, which one would apply?</P>
    <P>The Irish World Music Centre is a very innovative part of the University of Limerick. While it is primarily rooted in the traditional arts, it also has roots in other parts of the world. As such, it is a good example of the need to reconsider the proposal to fragment and separate the different arts sectors. I am particularly concerned at the proposal to give the traditional music committee funding powers or at least the power to make recommendations on funding, while the other committees have no such powers. This is a mistake which changes the balance in the Arts Council. Its current balance should be maintained and the wider Arts Council should continue to make the funding decisions.</P>
    <P>My concern about the measures dealing with the traditional arts stem from my strong admiration for the work being done in that area. Traditional arts are not set in a particular time. Naturally, therefore, there will be innovation and they will move forward. I question how they can be separated from other elements of the arts. I am also concerned by the proposal to establish a committee of five members, three of whom will be nominated by the Minister. While I do not <Col N="1062" /> wish to be personal about any Minister, this is not a good way to proceed.</P>
    <P>The perception of an Arts Council in partnership with Government but with a separate identity and a level of independence and responsibility should continue.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to listen to all the concerns expressed and to take the time to amend the Bill to make it as strong and effective as possible and to make it work for the various elements of the arts in Ireland. We have a fine tradition, particularly in literature, theatre, music and dance, but we are also developing in terms of the visual arts. However, not enough emphasis is placed on the requirements of individual artists, especially when they are temporarily out of work, an issue also raised by my colleague, Deputy Lynch.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is probably a criticism of ourselves to say it is a long time since we discussed an arts Bill, but this is not the first debate we have had on the arts. I am interested in one of the first sections, which states that the Minister shall promote the arts inside and outside the State. That statement recognises that Irish art, in its widest form, is of value to the rest of the world. We have seen this in recent years, whether through Ceoltas on the Great Wall of China or through Fr. Liam Lawton's church music recorded in Chicago. Our range is so broad that it is being recognised worldwide. The Minister is also promoting the arts inside and outside the country.</P>
      <P>This Bill focuses on the Arts Council with which I have had arm's length dealings in recent years in formulating the national children's strategy. I found its policy on art and its ideas far too restrictive and narrow in that it did not recognise the breadth of interest children and young people can and should have in the arts. I would welcome any new developments in the Arts Council which would encourage it to look beyond the restrictive remit it has had in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation refers to three specific committees. While I am critical of the Arts Council for being too restrictive in my dealings with it, I would hate to think we would be &ldquo;chunnelling&rdquo; them into being too restrictive again in examining only three sub-committees. The Minister might examine that aspect to ensure it does not contradict new elements of the arts that the Arts Council might examine. At least recognition is being given in those three committees to Irish traditional arts, rud nach raibh le feiceáil nó le cloisteáil i gComhairle na n-Ealaíon go dtí seo. There will always be a challenge in that regard. Other speakers mentioned the fleadhanna ceoil in Clonmel or Sligo and our wide range of music. It is important that such music is recognised as part of our arts and culture and developed even further. The challenge exists not only for the Minister to promote that art form throughout the world but <Col N="1063" /> also for the Arts Council to recognise and support it.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes specific reference to local authorities. It is only in recent years we as a public or as public representatives have acknowledged the role local authorities can and do play in local authority areas. In recent years we have seen the development of some wonderful local theatres in Dún Laoghaire, Tallaght and Ballymun. They bring the arts to the community. Local authorities have a key role to play in the arts in their planning and development &ndash; many of them are preparing new planning and development regulations &ndash; funding, participation on management boards, sponsorship and so on.</P>
    <P>Another exciting project, which brings the arts to the community, is the writer or artist in residence in schools, many of whom are funded by the local councils. I have seen first-hand the valuable work carried out by young students, be it in Our Lady's in Booterstown where they had a writer in residence or the transformation of an old school building by an artist in residence in Harold school in Glasthule, all with the support of local authorities. That is what art and involving children in education is all about.</P>
    <P>Equally, schemes such as the write a book scheme, where children are encouraged not only to devise a story but to physically write, bind and present a book and then obtain a certificate on the basis of that, are valuable. That is the type of encouragement that should be given by our education centres, as in the case of the Blackrock Education Centre, and through the local authorities.</P>
    <P>While some people have been critical of the Bill, pointing out that education is not specifically mentioned, it does not have to be mentioned but it must recognise the role it has to play in the arts. I am talking about the arts not only as a subject or as an academic area but in terms of its contact with the community. This is where the link between the local authorities, which are specifically mentioned in the Bill, the schools and community groups is valuable.</P>
    <P>While art and culture, which is part of our identity, cannot be totally encapsulated in a Bill, this gives us an opportunity to ensure the bodies given responsibility for the arts capture art as part of our heritage and moreover as the essence of our being, expression and individuality as a nation. As we move forward in Europe and in wider cultural conflicts and challenges, art is becoming all the more important for us. As part of our campaign on Nice, we had a session with Ceoltas which involved a Hungarian singer and Hungarian fiddler, an Irish dancer and a few Irish Ministers doing an Irish dance. That showed the international appeal of Irish music.</P>
    <P>I hope the Arts Council plays its role in regard to the Bill. I also hope the Minister will reconsider the prescriptive nature of the committees. We as national and local legislators have a role <Col N="1064" /> to play in ensuring the arts not only develop but thrive in the future.</P>

      <P>I will make a brief contribution to the debate.</P>
      <P>This is the first time in 30 years a Bill on the arts has been introduced. There was a good deal of tension in the old Arts Council and many officers resigned. That is probably why this Bill is now before the House. I note it is proposed to reduce the membership of the Arts Council.</P>
      <P>The only experience I have had with the Arts Council was when I sought funding from it for a group of children who were going abroad to promote the arts. I was annoyed that I could not get funding from the council. I tabled a parliamentary question asking where the Arts Council had spent the money allocated to it and I am sure the Minister of State will be delighted to hear the answer to this. I hope the new Arts Council will realise there are artists all over the country and not only in Dublin. Some 99.9% of the money allocated to the old Arts Council was spent in Dublin. There are artists in Mayo, Achill, Cork, Kerry and elsewhere. I was annoyed about the refusal of funding and requested details of the council's spending for the previous three years and learned that the money was spent mainly in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I have nothing against Dublin or its people. Some of the ushers think I am very much against Dublin. I love Dublin, its people and the ushers who do a great job in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope they will be looked after in the Bill we discussed yesterday because they do an excellent job. I want to compliment Mayo County Council and the county manager. I have a lot of battles with the county manager but he must be complimented on his work with the arts. Mayo County Council was one of the first councils to appoint an arts officer. At the time I was not too keen on that, I felt the money could have been better spent elsewhere but it was the best money the council ever spent. Every single person in this State can be creative in one way or another. The number of talented people is amazing if they are given an opportunity to demonstrate those talents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke of writers in residence. Mayo County Council has had a writer in residence for many years, it also has an artist in residence. It has brought the arts out to the people. Deputy O'Malley is right in saying that the arts must be brought into the schools. We will face challenges in the coming years. We will be part of a bigger Europe, different traditions will come <Col N="1065" /> to this country and we will have to be able to cope with that. We must also protect our existing traditions. Those involved in the arts have always found it very difficult to make a living. They are very talented people but part of their problem is that they are not business-orientated. They are more concerned about their art. Sometimes they do not even wonder where the next cup of tea or dinner is coming from. There should be help and support for them in every county. The arts have made a big contribution to Ireland, particularly internationally. Paul Durcan, for example, is recognised all over the world. He is from Mayo and is a very mild mannered, talented man who loves what he does.</P>
    <P>Sometimes the arts can be given a bad name. There was a case recently in Ballindine, County Mayo, where somebody erected a structure &ndash; I cannot even describe it &ndash; in the middle of the village. The village had recently been enhanced and the residents were outraged. The council then had to take down the structure and I do not know where it intends to put it. The council should consult with local people and bring them on board in this area, rather than dictating to them.</P>
    <P>Those involved in the traditional arts are going to be recognised in this Bill. I love Irish music and dancing. I must compliment Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann for its work in promoting the traditional arts over the years. It deserves to be supported and I am glad to see that will happen in this Bill. I have seen how the traditional arts have been revived in Mayo. We have held the Fleadh Cheoil in Ballina on two occasions and it brought thousands of people to the town. It is wonderful to see people on the street of any town singing, dancing and enjoying themselves. It is good to see them being taken away from the pubs. That is something we should all be trying to do. We should be encouraging young people to be involved in the arts and take these onto the streets or into the schools and community halls.</P>
    <P>I have never said that I am an expert in the arts. I support the people who have made an effort in this area over the years. Artists are never recognised until they are dead, their works become very valuable then. Yet they have to make a living and be supported while they are alive.</P>
    <P>I have heard many speakers asking that political interference be taken away from Arts Council. We are elected to this House, the Minister is responsible to it and I believe the Arts Council should be answerable to him. If I, or any Member, wants to raise any issue about the Arts Council we should be able to table a question. That is not political interference &ndash; it is our duty as public representatives. It is our job to ensure that the Arts Council spends its money well and spreads it throughout the country. Ministers are elected to make political decisions where necessary. A Minister can make a political decision but he must then stand over it.</P>

      <P>It annoys me to hear Members trying to take powers away from the Minister and other public representatives. We are the people who go before the interview boards at election time. That board is a difficult one. On the last occasion, they were not to happy with those on this side of the House and they made a lot of changes. I am sure it will happen to the other side of the House at another stage. I do not agree with those who say matters such as Arts Council funding should be kept away from politicians. The Minister should be responsible to this House for any Act passed by it.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the traditional arts will be recognised in this Bill. It is wonderful to see how those involved have trained young people. I see the work they do in my area. It is part of our culture and it should be supported and promoted. The arts have to be protected and looked after and those involved in the arts have to be assisted and helped. The arts should be brought into our schools so that young people can recognise what is out there. Every person, irrespective of background or culture, has talent. Mayo County Council held workshops in isolated and disadvantaged areas which gave people an opportunity to write or draw. The amount of talent uncovered was amazing. It benefited people in that it brought them out of their homes and gave them greater confidence within themselves. If the arts can do that, they should be supported. I am glad to hear that every council will have to draw up an arts plan. The Arts Council has responsibilities. The last council did not spread the money equally. It primarily supported art in Dublin whereas we want to see support for the arts all over Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I dtús báire, ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a ghabháil leis an Aire. Earlier a question was asked which almost shocked me as it came from a source that I deeply respect, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan. She asked why traditional art was being put in a separate category. It is on that issue that I compliment and congratulate the Minister. It is put there because it is so special and important to our culture and way of life. It has been treated poorly <i>vis-à-vis</i> the contemporary arts and other sections of the arts in the past. It has been put there because of the very respectable lobbying of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. All of us involved in the arts are aware of the work of that organisation. Comhaltas was established 51 years ago when the Arts Act, 1951, came into force. I was deeply concerned that the Bill, as originally drafted, did not contain a specific category or nominated niche for traditional arts. This is an important matter and we must ensure that traditional arts are fostered and given fair recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traditional arts cover a huge spectrum of activities. The Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, commented on the promotion of the arts abroad. When people in foreign countries think about Irish art, they expect it to be of a traditional nat<Col N="1067" /> ure in the form put forward by participants in Comhaltas and associated groups and that is what they should see and hear. We need to protect and nurture the traditional arts and the people involved in that area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring referred to gatherings. I understand that at least 200,000 people attended the most recent annual Fleadh Cheoil and crowds of that magnitude have flocked to many other annual cultural gatherings.</P>
    <P>Why should we include a category for traditional arts? To answer this, we must return to people's definition of art. What is art to some people is pure rubbish to others. There is a grave danger that the traditional arts will lose out in the more sophisticated world of the cultural arts such as opera, etc. Many people felt that there was an imbalance within the Arts Council, particularly in terms of the way it allocated funding. I compliment the Minister on giving the standing committee the right to disburse funding to individual artists to help them in their work and to help promote our country. We make no apologies for doing that because it reflects Irish life and that is how it should be. As Deputy Ring stated, when one considers the allocations, it appears that funding is being distributed in the major centres &ndash; Dublin and Cork in particular &ndash; and that larger amounts of money are being given to the more elite groupings as opposed those involved in the area of traditional arts. We should make no apology for protecting the way of life of people involved in the traditional arts.</P>
    <P>Before we entered the then EEC in 1973, we were informed that we would lose our culture and way of life. That argument was recently trotted out by an individual in the campaign on the Nice treaty and it is completely incorrect. The major increase in the number of Gaelscoileanna in urban areas is but one example of how we are protecting our culture, language and way of life. This must be done on a statutory basis and it should be encompassed by the legislation before us. The contemporary arts have their place and must be nurtured and protected, but not to the detriment of the traditional arts. I draw the attention of the Minister to the work being done, particularly by Comhaltas, with children from the age of three or four. In any city, village or town one will find people involved in work in this area.</P>
    <P>Most Members have been somewhat parochial in their contributions and I will try not to be an exception to that rule. One marvellous prospect to which we can look forward in terms of culture in the near future is that, for the first time in more than a decade, a city in Ireland, Cork, will be European Capital of Culture in 2005. Cork will be following in the distinguished footsteps of great European cities including Dublin, Salamanca and Athens to name but a few. I know that the people of Cork and everyone else are excited about hosting this great event.</P>
    <P>An expert team has already been assembled to work on the project. We anticipate that our links <Col N="1068" /> in Europe &ndash; political, spiritual and cultural &ndash; will be enriched during this event. Ireland will be host to a dynamic multicultural event and we look forward to welcoming our fellow Europeans to Cork during 2005. We will be provided with an opportunity to place the Irish tradition and ethos to the fore in our dealings with our European neighbours. I am sure Cork will do us proud because it has a rich artistic heritage and tradition.</P>
    <P>One of the aspects of the Bill with which I am particularly taken is the promotion of the concept of the involvement of local authorities through local arts officers, etc. It is essential and it should be mandatory for every local authority to be involved in the arts. In the past, contributions from central funds have not been matched by a requisite level of co-funding from some local authorities. Certain local authorities have not done their bit, but Cork is not one of them. The local authority in Cork has helped foster and develop its rich artistic heritage and tradition. This year, the city council will offer funding of &euro;320,000 to arts organisations based in the city.</P>
    <P>The Minister has accepted the argument that there should be fair representation of all art forms and that small communities with small projects should be given fair recognition and not swamped by larger projects. Cork's art office runs a number of programmes on supporting and developing the work of artists and art organisations in the city. These include a scheme of bursaries &ndash; the North-South bursary, a drama practitioners' bursary, a film production bursary, a music bursary, a bursary for tuition at third level in choreography which grants access to this area to students both in UCC and Leeds, with which we have a working relationship, and the Tyrone Guthrie residency bursary &ndash; which is extremely important. A study reviewing the arts infrastructure in the city and anticipating future demands was commissioned recently and a programme of art events in the libraries in the city also forms part of that work. The total funding under the scheme is in excess of &euro;150,000.</P>
    <P>I recommend that other local authorities follow the lead given by Cork in terms of carrying out a study into the arts infrastructure in their areas and into the need for promotion and assistance in the arts. The artist's life has traditionally been lonely. In the past, many artists only became famous following their deaths. They were only lauded when they had died and no longer required financial support. It is essential that we should provide support to artists, particularly the younger generation, when they need it. Artists have always needed sponsorship and support right back to the times of the landed gentry and I would like to see the State and local authorities taking a lead role in this area.</P>
    <P>Cork's well developed, mature arts infrastructure is one of the city's most obvious assets and I would recommend it to any city or town seeking to establish such an infrastructure. It has some of Ireland's finest performing arts venues and visual <Col N="1069" /> art centres. In addition, a number of art organisations which have national and international significance have been established in Cork. In 1989, in an example of how one can achieve a number of objectives at the same time, the National Sculpture Factory was established in Cork. It is housed in a city council owned former tram shed of approximately 60,000 square feet. The factory is one of Ireland's most active artists organisations. The tram shed would have been a derelict building by now. It had been used by the ESB after the trams shut down. The council achieved the three objectives of bringing an old building back into use, of retaining it in its historical context and installing a factory in it. It was win, win, win as a result of using initiative and foresight. It did not involve huge expense.</P>
    <P>The Opera House in Cork, which was in danger of closing at one stage, has been supported with funding of up to &euro;1 million. Again, this was an example of co-operation. In the early 1990s, six members of the city council were seconded from the council to act as directors of the Opera House, a combination of the street credibility of the public representatives and the artistic ability of the people directly involved with the Opera House. Between us we managed to make it a winning formula and with the assistance of the State and the Department, the Opera House was refurbished and reinvigorated. The Everyman Palace theatre and the Graffiti Theatre Company have also benefited enormously from substantial capital contributions from Cork Corporation. It is easy for local authorities to simply demand money from the State without making a local contribution but one must pay extra for these facilities. It is the icing on the cake for many people.</P>
    <P>Wandesford Quay artists studio and gallery represents a considerable investment by Cork Corporation in the visual arts. Again, the premises was a warehouse owned by an old printing company, Colemans Printers. It was purchased by the city council in 1997 and refurbished to provide a new artists' studio, printmakers' workshop and a new gallery. A cultural development initiative scheme grant, an Arts Council capital contribution, a grant from the URBAN pilot project and significant investment by the city council financed the development. Fenton's Gallery, Cork Printmakers and Blackwater artists studios are now housed on the premises. This is another success story as a result of local initiative, foresight and support from the statutory bodies, including the Department.</P>
    <P>Cork's cultural life has integrated into the fabric of the city through investment in the infrastructure of the city. Recently, the new Millennium Hall, including a concert hall, was opened. It is a civic structure for the city and it is also a cultural centre for the city and its visitors. If one includes investment in capital infrastructure, the library service, archives, the museums, the Cork Vision Centre, Fota House and other associated areas, the budget for the arts and cultural sector for 2000 was approximately £11.92 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" />A national study carried out three years ago found that Belfast and Cork were the two authorities which contributed most to supporting the arts in the form of direct co-funding. It is easy to seek 100% funding from Government but co-funding involves some degree of pain in the form of service charges and other means of raising revenue. If we want the arts, we must support them. The city's motto, <i>Statio bene fide carinis,</i> means a safe harbour for ships and it is our enthusiastic hope and expectation that our city of trade, commerce, poets and composers will be a safe and vibrant harbour of art and culture in 2005 and beyond.</P>
    <P>On another occasion I will appeal to the Minister to ensure adequate funding is available for 2005. I promise we will not seek more than 50%. The council will put in a minimum of &euro;5.5 million from local funding but it will be seeking co-funding from the Minister.</P>
    <P>There will be questions about this legislation, as there are about every Bill. However, I commend the Minister on setting up the standing committee and the recognition of what is called the &ldquo;traditional arts&rdquo;, that is, our culture as opposed to the other arts I have mentioned. I compliment him on the general tone of the Bill. A programme is being put together that will facilitate participation by the public at all levels.</P>
    <P>Questions have been asked about the appointment by the Minister of members of the Arts Council. I am not familiar with the membership of the Arts Council although I am aware of the council's work, having been in contact with it on many occasions, particularly with regard to Cork Opera House. However, I have read the reports in one of the monthly magazines about the infighting and turf wars that take place. That is to be expected in any group. My fear is that if membership were confined to outside appointments there would be a return to the old situation where elitist groups, composed of people from a small sector of society, would be able to manipulate the system to ensure that specific arts would be looked after to a greater extent than merited. I am glad there is provision for the Minister to appoint people who have a proven track record and who have shown they will cater for the arts generally. That is important.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Ring that representatives who are elected to speak for the public should have a say in how things are done and how the money is spent. I do not subscribe to the view that there should be no political involvement. Life is about politics. We are elected to pursue issues on behalf of the public and it is correct that the Minister, who will fund the body through his Department's Vote, should have a say, especially if things go wrong. There will be areas where the Minister and his advisers will disagree with a body and it is only right that he should have a way of pulling in the reins, as it were, when necessary.</P>
    <P>This Minister has a proven track record. I am sure he will take on board the points made in this debate. Concerns were expressed about the arts <Col N="1071" /> being linked with tourism under the same Department. There is no more appropriate location for the arts than in conjunction with tourism. The arts are relevant to everybody but particularly tourists who come here to see the local traditional arts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil lúcháir orm deis a bheith agam cúpla focal a rá faoin mBille seo. Everybody is aware of the importance of the arts in advanced democratic societies. This Bill has had a long gestation and was only published in April, in the dying days of the last Administration. It was a long wait. The first Arts Bill, which established the Arts Council, was enacted in 1951, more than half a century ago. It was one of the pet projects of the then Taoiseach, Mr. John A. Costello, who was anxious to establish such a council. The second major amendment to the Bill occurred in the 1970s when it was steered through the House by Fine Gael, which was then in Government. I do not wish to be overly political about these matters, but the arts have become politicised in recent years.</P>
      <P>The main point of the legislation, which is opportune, seems to be to give statutory recognition to the independence of the Arts Council. Having read through the Bill, however, I am not sure that will happen. As far as I can make out, the Bill gives the Minister responsibility for formulating overall State policy on the arts whereas, up to now, arts policy was formulated by the Arts Council's members appointed by the Minister. Nevertheless, they were independent of the Minister. Handing over responsibility for arts planning to the Minister may prove to be a fatal flaw in this legislation. I would prefer to see an independent Arts Council, but the Minister will be nominating members of the board which will be reduced from 17 to seven members. With the Minister's two appointees, that will make a total of nine. I would like to hear the Minister's views on this matter. I realise the Bill was published by his predecessor, Deputy de Valera, but does the Minister have the same views on this core issue?</P>
      <P>My memories of the arts and matters concerning artistic endeavour generally in recent years, particularly over the past 12 months, are coloured by the controversies that were generated in the sector. For example, almost half the members of the current Arts Council resigned from the board and, presumably, there must have been good reasons for doing so. I recall that the former chairman, Professor Brian Farrell &ndash; an important member of the community with a national status in the academic and broadcasting sectors &ndash; resigned from the council along with other members. I do not think we ever received a proper explanation for those resignations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another controversy concerned the Irish Museum of Modern Art. While we are all proud of what has been achieved there, a major controversy arose over its eminent director, which <Col N="1072" /> attracted international attention. Deputy Fiona O'Malley, who contributed to this debate earlier, made serious allegations when she resigned from the board, saying &ndash; and I am quoting from memory &ndash; her action was prompted by &ldquo;gross political interference&rdquo;. We do not want art to become a political football.</P>
    <P>Another controversy arose over the Abbey Theatre, one of our greatest national institutions, the centenary of which we will shortly celebrate. The theatre premises have had a chequered career. The first time I attended a play there it was situated in the old Queen's Theatre in Pearse Street. The current Abbey stands on the site of the original theatre and the management is doing excellent work with limited facilities. A decision has now been taken to construct a new Abbey Theatre. Several locations were mooted and the theatre's board was anxious to relocate on a green field site that was offered in the docklands area, free of charge. Accusations were made that the Taoiseach was anxious to retain the theatre in his own constituency. Another site was suggested on the other side of O'Connell Street, which formerly housed the Carlton Cinema complex. Before the general election, however, a decision was taken to re-develop the Abbey on its present site. It will be difficult to do so because additional property will have to be purchased for the extension. A national theatre should enjoy a prime site in the city centre with access to the River Liffey. If that is achieved it will be a great advantage to theatre-goers, but I am not sure if that will be the outcome.</P>
    <P>There was yet another controversy over the location of the Performing Arts Academy. I am not sure if Dublin City University was mentioned but there was some political wrangling in that case also. It would be desirable to avoid such controversy in future because the arts are too important to become embroiled in local politics.</P>
    <P>The world wide contribution of Ireland's performing artists is rightfully recognised and that recognition is well merited. Their international reputation is out of all proportion to our relatively small population. In this regard, I can cite the important contribution made by internationally recognised singers, musicians and dancers from my own county of Donegal. These include the leading male dancer in Riverdance, Breandán de Gallaí, who is from my own parish of Gweedore. He has performed in the Riverdance show all over the world and, in so doing, has introduced traditional Irish music and dance to millions of people in every continent.</P>
    <P>Last year, following the events of 11 September, I visited New York where a museum has been established to honour the memory of those who perished in that awful tragedy. One evening, while watching television there, I saw a programme showing footage of the tragic events of 9/11 and the theme music was from a recording by a lady from my own parish, Enya. Sales of her records were boosted in the aftermath of the tragedy because the music is so soothing. Altán, <Col N="1073" /> whose members are also from Donegal, have performed all over the world, as has our famous singer, Daniel O'Donnell. The artistes I have mentioned come from one small part of the country.</P>
    <P>The Bill envisages the establishment of three standing committees, one of which will deal with traditional art. I recognise the contribution made by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann to the promotion of traditional Irish song, music and dance. I hope CCE will be given the resources to continue its work both here and abroad, as a result of the provisions of the Bill. When tourists come here they always want to hear our traditional music, and CCE has done excellent work in providing such entertainment, particularly during the summer months.</P>
    <P>The arts are blossoming throughout the country. In almost every county there is an arts officer. There is one in my county. Arts exhibitions are some of the most pleasant functions I am obliged to attend as a public representative in my own area, and there is one almost every month in places like Falcarragh, Dunfanaghy, Letterkenny and Donegal. There are so many people involved in the different arts &ndash; painting, sculpture, etc., and some people who have retired take it up as a pastime and it becomes a great hobby. Indeed, I am sure there are such exhibitions in every part of the country.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a radical new approach to arts education or, more accurately, to making the arts an integral part of education. Arts education has for too long been considered an extra subject in our schools, a stand-alone subject that would give students some cultural appreciation and an opportunity to experiment with paint, movement or a musical instrument. This attitude represents an impoverished view of the arts and an equally impoverished view of education. It is now well recognised by arts educators and academics that a properly integrated and delivered arts education can make an enormous contribution, not only to the arts but to our social, economic, spiritual and environmental well-being.</P>
    <P>Education is primarily about young people. It is now believed that an arts education makes a profound difference to young people in many important ways. An arts education helps to expand creative and critical capacities, enhance problem solving skills, increase cross-cultural understanding, build self-esteem and gain necessary skills useful in today's workplace.</P>
    <P>The case for arts education as an overall stimulus to learning is too significant a subject for today. However, science tells us that an education in the arts uses multiple forms of intelligence in contrast to traditional academic subject areas that generally focus on specific types of intelligence such as linguistics or logic. We now know that the arts help to develop intuition, reasoning, imagination and dexterity, contributing to every aspect of a child's school life and personal development. In the modern Irish economy, the greatest need is <Col N="1074" /> for people with imagination and creativity, talents fostered through arts education.</P>
    <P>Recent research suggests that arts education can also deliver a positive effect on the incidence of crime. Juvenile delinquency is too often a symptom of school failure and a misdirected search for recognition, achievement and self-expression. The arts provide a different way to address these needs. We all know this, yet we have been slow to use the arts as a means to address this problem. In the United States, three cities which rigorously evaluated their arts programmes for at risk youths found that these programmes decreased involvement in delinquent behaviour, increased academic achievement and improved the youths' attitudes to themselves and their future.</P>
    <P>The arts transcend nationality, ethnic identity, race and gender, and an arts education provides a universal language that is able to cut across cultural barriers. In this multicultural millennium, anything that unites people is critical to our future well-being and the emerging disease of racism in our society, which the Government is shamefully neglecting, calls for a multifaceted response. However, a core element of the response must be found in the arts and, specifically, an arts education.</P>
    <P>I would hope that there would be an amendment to this Bill to incorporate a special committee. I ask the Minister to consider the provision of such a committee which would deal exclusively with the promotion of the arts in the education system from junior infants right up to senior cycle in secondary schools.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil as ucht labhairt ar an mBille. Cuirim fáilte roimh an Bhille ach sílim go bhfuil laigí ann.

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few relatively brief comments on the proposals in the Arts Bill. First, I agree with the tenor of Deputy McGinley's comments that the arts should not be used for partisan political advantage. During the period in office of my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the first time such a ministry was created, the arts in Ireland received for the first time growing amounts of State funding. Civil servants often want to tidy things up into small packages which can be handily administered and I would strongly warn the Minister against listening too much to the advice of civil servants when it comes to the question of administering the arts. If the arts are to flourish, the one element required is diversity. Although diversity is often difficult for any of us who are involved as administrators, it is absolutely essential to a flourishing arts culture in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the Minister is proposing to substantially reduce the size of the Arts Council. There <Col N="1075" /> will be an opportunity to come back to that, but the reason for having a substantial council was that the arts are so diverse and it is only fair that the diverse areas of artistic activity and endeavour are reflected. This is particularly important when it comes to making the case, presenting the case, and then being in some ways the unfortunate Minister who must make the decision as to how to allocate the money fairly. If the diverse voices and groups which represent the arts community are not getting access to the table, however, they will find it increasingly difficult to make their voices heard.</P>
    <P>One of the proposals in the Bill concerns a council for the traditional arts. I wish to hear from the Minister what this concept is based on. As somebody who is quite involved in elements of the so-called traditional arts, I see traditional Irish music, song, dance, etc., as not only traditional but living arts. There are people working in those areas who are not only performing older works of art but writing, composing, working out new developments, drawing attention to areas of our heritage, etc. This is stimulating, not only for artists throughout Ireland, but also for the public who have the opportunity to enjoy it. I am concerned that the development of this notion of a traditional arts committee, which will report to the Arts Council and which will have partial responsibility for giving advice on the advance of moneys to any person, could see a narrowing of the remit so that only those in the loop might actually be favoured. If we are to grow, develop and make flourish those artistic expressions which go back in time, history and culture to earlier days in Ireland, we must build a broad house. To confine it in any narrow sense could be potentially disastrous for the artistic community. Reference has correctly been made to the fine work done by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, which is known throughout the country. However, the Minister should bear in mind the work of other groups. In Dublin, for example, Píobairí Uilinn has single handedly revived the tradition of piping and has been hugely influential in other areas of traditional music and culture, the Góilín club specialises in singing and a number of groups specialise in various areas of dance. Some of these groups are part of Comhaltas and some are not, as is their right.</P>
    <P>The traditional arts council is to consist of a chairperson appointed by the Minister and four other members, at least two of whom will be appointed by the Minister. This concept is very narrow. How can such a small committee give expression to the huge diversity in the area of so called traditional arts? If there is to be a council for traditional arts why not have a council for contemporary arts? Reference has been made to a PricewaterhouseCoopers study but I am not sure the findings of the study are reflected in the legislation. There are some amazingly talented musicians such as Con O'Driscoll of Cork, who is probably writing some of the best traditional Irish <Col N="1076" /> songs. The Minister may even feature in some of these songs because one of the features of much of the current writing of &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Irish song writers is their political bite and satire, a tradition which goes back to 17th century Gaelic writing, with which I am sure the Minister is familiar. I would hate to see this immensely enjoyable, qualified and productive area of the arts frozen out by a politically correct &ndash; in the Minister's own party terms &ndash; traditional arts council.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of my experience in the anti-apartheid movement in the days before the situation in South Africa changed. One of the features of those days was the creation of councils of traditional this and that, which were not good at bringing the past into relevance to the future. I hope the Minister will think carefully about the kind of one-size-fits-all body he is attempting to establish.</P>
    <P>There is a wealth of traditional arts activity in south Armagh, for example. I am sure the Minister is familiar with the works of people like Fintan Vallelly. If we retain a narrow concept of a traditional arts council, is the work of such people in documenting, recording and relating contemporary work to our cultural history to be included in the concept of the traditional arts council? There will be an opportunity for the Opposition to address these issues again on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>To what extent have all the practitioners of the so called traditional arts of music, song or dance, the bulk of whom have a highly active contemporary life, been genuinely consulted? Can the Minister give a commitment that in the new dispensation of the traditional arts council these groups, which are spread throughout the country, will be made part of the new structure? When Deputy Michael D. Higgins was Minister with responsibility for the arts he held an open house &ndash; a teach fáilte &ndash; for everyone who wished to be part of the arts. It is essential that the Minister gives a commitment that this will happen.</P>
    <P>May I cite an example with which the Minister may be familiar? In 1998, when we marked the bicentenary of the 1798 rebellion, a huge amount of work was done throughout the country, particularly in the south east and in County Armagh, by people working in Irish song, music and dance in recovering the complex history of 1798 and the lost songs and music which relate to that era and to the figures who led the United Irish movement, which was the genesis of the idea of an Irish Republic. Out of that work has come a vibrant contemporary awareness of the 1798 tradition. Is the Minister satisfied that the people who contributed to that work will be involved in the traditional arts council, or will they even want to be? The council sounds like a council of elders who will keep a politically correct watch over everybody. One cannot do this with the arts. If the arts are to mean anything they must be diverse and that diversity inevitably brings contentiousness. However, it is not for the Government or political parties to make a judgment on that matter. It is <Col N="1077" /> for artists to work and to express themselves and for the State to facilitate them in so doing.</P>
    <P>As someone who enjoys being educated and has enjoyed the performances of people in this area for a long time, I am deeply concerned at the tenor of the Bill and I look for reassurances from the Minister that this will not be a way of politically managing &ndash; perhaps in the Fianna Fáil interest &ndash; the traditional arts. To do so would be a travesty.</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor, Deputy de Valera, produced, like Deputy Michael D. Higgins, much extra funding. Can the Minister reassure us that there will be no partisanship in his approach to the Bill? This area is too important to spoil it with politics. Recent achievements have been so substantial and so enriching of the culture of this island that we must not risk damaging them. I hope the Minister can answer my concerns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend my warmest thanks to the Members who have contributed to Second Stage of this important legislation. The opinions voiced were constructive and we have had a very illuminating and valuable debate so far. At the commencement of the debate, I indicated that I would reflect carefully on the comments of Deputies and I will do this before Committee stage. A number of important issues have been raised and, in responding, I will try to deal with them as specifically as I can.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies appear to be concerned that the new configuration of my Department with responsibility for sport and tourism as well as for the arts may have negative implications for the profile and priority that had previously been given to the arts. For example, it was suggested that the needs of the arts might be made subservient to those of the tourism sector. I reassure the House about my position on where the arts fit into the broader scheme of things.</P>
      <P>I regard the arts as being crucially important in their own right, for all sorts of reasons. The arts allow participants and audiences to express and nourish their creativity. Artists create beauty, they comment on and interpret the world around them, they criticise, they praise, they mourn what is not and imagine and suggest what might yet be. The arts brighten and enrich our lives, and fundamentally contribute in a very positive way to the development and maintenance of a healthy, rounded society. I would not be prepared to see the arts relegated to a second level of importance, and I assure Members that it will not happen on my watch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The challenges over the coming years are ones of sustainability and enhancement. These challenges will be all the more difficult against the background of the less favourable economic environment in which we find ourselves. The creation of the Department with its current configuration gives us in addition the opportunity to explore and exploit effective synergy between the arts and other sectors within my remit or else<Col N="1078" /> where. Any mutually beneficial symbioses between the arts and tourism, or between the arts and any other sector, can validly be explored without doing injury to the integrity or priority of the arts.</P>
    <P>Deputies Deenihan, Lynch, Gogarty, and O'Dowd raised concerns about the independence of the Arts Council, and the implications, in that context, of section 5 which defines my functions as Minister. The Bill as drafted presents no danger to the role of the Arts Council, or to the independence from Government of artistic expression. I sometimes think there is confusion about what is meant by having an independent Arts Council. For me, this means especially that the &ldquo;arms length&rdquo; principle is observed both in the decisions to allocate money and in the determination of what qualifies as art. In other words, the Minister nor the Government of the day should not be able to give unfair advantage in the allocation of arts funding, applications for funding should be objectively evaluated by an independent council on the basis of artistic merit without regard to political content or leanings, and no Government should be able to bend artistic expression or comment to its own ends.</P>
    <P>However, funding is made available for the arts by the Government and the Oireachtas to the Arts Council. There has been for a number of years a Minister with specific responsibility for the arts. There cannot be a complete removal of the democratic process from the determination of the broad policy framework within which the Arts Council operates. To accept otherwise would bring the concept of autonomy too far and would mean that I was abrogating my responsibilities as Minister.</P>
    <P>In that context, it is appropriate and a responsibility for me as Minister to set broad policies for the development of the arts to be implemented through the Arts Council and to be in a position to direct the Arts Council to comply with ministerial or Government policies. This situation is not unique. What arises here is the issue of general direction and prioritisation. There is no question of me or any of my Ministerial successors using, or being able to use, these provisions to seek to influence individual funding decisions. The Bill will, for the first time, in section 24 (2), give statutory protection to the traditional &ldquo;arms length&rdquo; independence of the council in the funding of the arts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan also suggested that this Bill is not an Arts Bill but an Arts Council Bill, and Deputy Lynch was critical that the Bill does not mention the welfare of artists. In the main, State funding for the arts is delivered through the Arts Council. What the council does, and how it does it, is crucial to the welfare and development of the arts sector. A major objective of this legislation, therefore, is to establish a good and effective context for the operation of the Arts Council, and if that is done, the rest will flow from it. It should not be forgotten that the council is operating under legislation that dates back to <Col N="1079" /> 1951 and 1973, some 50 and 30 years old respectively. The functions set out for the Arts Council in section 9, which include the promotion of knowledge, practice and appreciation of the arts, and the improvement of standards in the arts, will, if effectively discharged, lead to a vibrant arts sector, where the artist is valued and rewarded.</P>
    <P>Several of the Deputies, in their contributions to this debate, recognised the important contribution that local authorities can make to the welfare of the arts within their areas. Their contributions also stressed that without funding little can be done. I recognise the importance of funding for arts activities by local authorities, and of funding right across the arts sector. I will give of my best during my time in this office to strengthening the relative profile of the arts for Government, particularly in the context of financial allocations. However, we must be realistic and recognise that, for the immediate future, funds will not be as easily obtained as they were in recent years. However, I will make the strongest possible case for the arts.</P>
    <P>The importance of the arts in our education system is accepted by all sides of this House. I have already made clear my belief that for the welfare of the arts, and of children of all ages, attention must be paid to this area. Deputies will understand that the development of the school curricula falls, not within my remit, but within that of another Minister. Time and time again in any debate on the arts its position in the educational system is raised. It is my intention, therefore, to initiate discussions with the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to explore how the expertise of my Department and the Arts Council can be better used so that the experience of the arts given to our school children at all levels might be enhanced.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies expressed concern about the smaller size proposed for the Arts Council. Much of the debate on this matter has focused on perceptions with regard to representation. We must be careful about this issue and I would be concerned if this principle was carried to a stage where representatives of individual disciplines saw their role as being to look after their own art form, rather than taking a broader view. It must also be recognised that it will never be possible to represent everybody on the council. It is possible for a smaller council of carefully chosen people to properly balance treatment of different art forms and regions.</P>
    <P>There has been much debate as to whether there should be a committee of the Arts Council dealing with the traditional arts. It should be pointed out that my predecessor became involved in a great degree of consultation and the debate in this House reflected the differences of opinion which existed in that consultative process. Whether this is justified or not, some people feel the traditional arts sector has been treated less well than it deserves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1080" />Arguments have been advanced for either a new and separate council for the traditional arts, or the ring-fencing for the traditional arts of a substantial portion of the Arts Council's funds. Others have argued against these suggestions on the basis that it would be inappropriate to isolate from the remit of the Arts Council any particular art form or set of art forms. It has been suggested that the arm's length principle is potentially an uneasy bedfellow for the concept of ring-fencing.</P>
    <P>The Arts Bill, 2002 reflects an effort to strike an acceptable balance by requiring the Arts Council to establish a standing committee on the traditional arts, charged with making recommendations to the council in relation to the advance of moneys to those involved in the traditional arts. There are differing views on this matter, but I have made clear on a number of occasions that I intend to listen carefully to the views of all participants in the debate. In this context, I wish to add that I plan to take particular notice of the opinions of Members of the House on this subject. Although I do not intend to ignore the views that have been expressed, I have an obligation to strike a balance and I intend to do so to the best of my ability. I have said on many occasions that it is of immense importance to me that we ensure that genius is encouraged. In that respect, it has to be recognised that not everyone can be a genius. It is a fact that geniuses are in a minority.</P>

I recall once sharing a train carriage with one of the greatest Gaelic footballers ever to play the game. He asked me whether I thought he would be better off if he had concentrated on his studies, rather than sport. I told him that he would probably be better off in life if he had concentrated on his studies, but that the lives of millions of people, many of whom had never seen him play, would have been lessened if he had not persevered with the game. I am convinced that the man in question made the right decision when he chose to concentrate on football, as it is an art form in itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to introduce the Railway Safety Bill, 2001, to the House. The primary purposes of the Bill are to establish an independent statutory public body, the Railway Safety Commission, with wide-ranging powers of inspection, investigation and enforcement; to require railway undertakings to put in place a formal safety management system and describe the components of that system in a document called a &ldquo;safety case&rdquo;; and to establish an independent statutory public body, the Railway Safety Advisory Council, comprising representatives of organisations with an interest in railway safety.</P>
      <P>One of my main priorities as Minister for Transport will be to continue the good work of my predecessor, Senator O'Rourke, in improving railway safety. There is a wide consensus of opinion that the laws governing railway safety which date back, in the most part, to Victorian times are no longer appropriate for today's railway systems. The Bill provides a modern but flexible means of independently overseeing the safety of our railways. It covers not just the Iarnród Éireann network but also the Luas, the planned metro network, heritage railways and other railways which have an interface with a public road or another railway.</P>
      <P>Following a derailment at Knockcroghery in November 1997, my predecessor commissioned an independent review by consultants led by IRMS of all aspects of the safety of Iarnród Éireann's railway network and of the legislative framework for regulating railway safety. In the report, published in late 1998, IRMS concluded that the Iarnród Éireann network had been a safe one historically, but also recognised that a shortfall in investment at that time was affecting safety. IRMS recommended that substantial investment was required urgently in infrastructure renewal and that it was necessary to introduce more formal systems and processes within Iarnród Éireann to further improve safety standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March 1999, the Government approved a &euro;546 million railway safety investment programme, to be implemented between 1999 and 2003. The programme is proceeding satisfactorily. Up to the end of 2001, Iarnród Éireann had replaced 246 miles of track with continuous welded rail, permanently closed or made safer 371 level crossings, including 217 high risk level crossings, renewed 228 bridges and fenced off 150 miles to deter trespassers and stray animals. Significant funds have also been invested in upgrading cuttings and embankments and in improving safety management systems. In 2002, Exchequer and EU funding of over &euro;150 million is expected <Col N="1083" /> to be invested in further safety improvements under the programme. Iarnród Éireann has invested over &euro;400 million of Exchequer funds since the beginning of the programme and substantial funding will continue to be available for the remainder of it.</P>
    <P>I intend to seek Government approval in the near future for the reconvening of the railway safety task force to make recommendations for a new five-year railway safety investment programme, to commence in 2004. Since its 1998 report, IRMS has carried out two further follow-up reviews of the safety of Iarnród Éireann's network. IRMS found in its 2001 report that Iarnród Éireann had made substantial progress in improving the safety of its railway infrastructure. Given the level of investment in public transport, it is vital that we ensure that investment in our railways is accompanied by the introduction of effective and formal safety management systems and that such systems are independently validated. This is my first priority and the reason I am introducing this Bill. In its 1998 review of railway safety, IRMS recommended a new regulatory framework for railway safety to include substantial strengthening of the powers and resources of my Department's railway inspectorate, updating the legislation governing railway safety and moving towards a &ldquo;safety case&rdquo; method of validating railway safety.</P>
    <P>The Railway Safety Bill, 2001 is designed to put in place a modern regulatory framework for railway safety. During the drafting of the Bill, careful consideration was given to the IRMS recommendations and to regulatory regimes in other countries. The number of serious and horrific accidents in Britain and across the EU in recent years has given rise to great concern. We cannot deny that railway accidents occur and will continue to occur, unfortunately. The potential for such accidents is with us all the time, but we can learn from them and thereby continuously strive to reduce the risks involved. Despite the number of recent high profile railway accidents, railways remain one of the safest modes of travel. The provisions of this legislation have taken into consideration the lessons learned from other countries. It does not replicate the safety regime in any one country, rather it takes account of different regimes and experiences in other countries and defines a framework appropriate for the scale of the Irish rail network and the nature of its operations.</P>
    <P>I propose to outline briefly the main provisions of the legislation, which is separated into 11 parts. Part 1 includes standard provisions in regard to such matters as the short title, interpretation, orders and regulations and repeals. Part 2 deals with the establishment of the railway safety commission and includes related standard provisions. Section 10 states that the principal functions of <Col N="1084" /> the commission will be to foster and encourage railway safety, regulate and enforce railway safety and investigate and report on railway incidents.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, the EU Commission published its proposals for a new railway safety directive. The Commission proposes that railway accident investigations should be a function of a separate permanent body, independent of the railway industry and the safety regulator. There are clear synergies to be gained from retaining the regulatory and accident investigation functions within one body. Other member states share my views on this issue and it would be premature to modify the Bill at this stage in the EU legislative process. I intend to make my position known to my fellow Transport Ministers during the negotiation directive.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides that the railway safety commission will comprise up to three members. It is my intention to initially appoint one but I will keep under review the need to increase this in light of the workload of the commission. The chief railway inspecting officer of my Department will be the first commissioner. Further appointments to the commission will be made by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners. I envisage, in making further appointments, international experience will be an important factor in the selection of candidates.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides that the two other railway inspecting officers of my Department will transfer to the commission on its establishment. It is envisaged the commission will have a permanent staff of nine, of whom seven will be technical experts and two administrative. Section 28 provides that the commission may impose a levy from 31 December 2004 on railway undertakings to partly or wholly fund its activities. As the LUAS will be operational shortly after construction is completed towards the end of 2003, this means that there will be at least two significant railway companies to share the cost of a levy. The planned construction of a metro system will further reduce the financial cost to each company.</P>
    <P>Part 3 places general duties of care on railway undertakings, persons working on railways and other persons. Section 38 states it will be the general duty of a railway undertaking to ensure, in so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety of persons in the operation of its railway. Section 39 places duties on a number of other parties, including staff of a railway undertaking, contractors working on the railway and any other person who is on or near railway property.</P>
    <P>Part 4 deals with safety management systems, safety cases and related issues. Section 41 requires that a railway undertaking implement a formal safety management system and describe that system in a document called a &ldquo;safety case&rdquo;. The safety case approach was recommended by IRMS and I am satisfied it is the most appropriate approach for Irish railways. The legislation <Col N="1085" /> specifies that the safety case should contain at least a general description of the operations of the railway undertaking, a statement of the safety objectives and policy of the undertaking, an identification of the hazards and risks and the mitigating measures in place to reduce these risks.</P>
    <P>Sections 46 and 47 relate to the assessment of the safety management system by independent experts, and the submission and acceptance of the safety case by the commission. The commission will issue a safety certificate where it is satisfied the safety case demonstrates that the railway undertaking can comply with its general duty to operate a safe railway. Section 48 requires a railway undertaking to implement the safety management system described in its safety case. The courts may impose a fine of up to &euro;500,000 for failure to do so.</P>
    <P>Part 5 deals with the investigation of railway incidents. It provides for three possible approaches &ndash; an investigation by the railway undertaking, an investigation by the commission or a tribunal of inquiry. This mirrors the investigation hierarchy in the existing law but substantially strengthens and modernises the legislative framework. Section 54 requires a railway undertaking to investigate railway incidents and submit a report to the commission. The commission may designate an inspector to observe such investigation.</P>
    <P>Section 55 empowers the commission to investigate any railway incident. The purpose of an investigation by the commission will not be to bring a criminal prosecution but to improve railway safety by establishing the cause of the incident and making recommendations for the avoidance of similar incidents in the future. Section 57 requires the commission to publish its report of the investigation. Section 61 provides that a tribunal of inquiry may be held into a railway incident. It is intended that this power will be invoked for the most serious railway incidents only.</P>
    <P>Part 6 deals with the making of regulations in relation to specified matters and the review of legislation by the commission. Part 7 addresses the enforcement powers of inspectors of the commission. These are modelled in many respects on the powers enjoyed by inspectors of the Health and Safety Authority. Section 70 details the considerable powers entrusted to inspectors to enter railway property to carry out examinations or searches necessary for the purpose of exercising a function under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 73 to 76 give a range of powers to inspectors to take enforcement action where the operation of a railway undertaking is likely to pose a risk to safety or where a person is contravening a provision of the legislation. An inspector may issue a notice requiring a railway undertaking or other person to submit an improvement <Col N="1086" /> plan, rectify a failure to comply with the Bill or cease specified activities until remedial action is taken. The purpose of an improvement plan will be to allow a railway undertaking or other person, when directed by the commission, to submit a plan setting out how it proposes to remedy a risk to passengers or persons working on a railway. This power is likely to be used by the commission where the level of risk is perceived to be relatively low and does not require urgent or immediate remedy.</P>
    <P>The purpose of an improvement notice will be to enable the commission to require that a railway undertaking or other person rectify, by a specified date, a failure to comply with the Bill. This power is likely to be used by the commission where the level of risk is perceived to require more immediate attention or where a person has failed to submit an improvement plan. The importance of an improvement notice is reflected in the &euro;300,000 fine that may be imposed by the courts for failure to comply with the notice.</P>
    <P>A prohibition notice will enable the commission to require a railway undertaking or other person to immediately cease an activity that poses an immediate and substantial risk to the safety of passengers or persons working on a railway until such time as the matters specified in the notice are remedied. This power is likely to be used by the commission in the most extreme cases and, hence, its importance is reflected in the &euro;500,000 fine that may be imposed by the courts for failure to comply with the notice. Provision is also made for the commission to make an application to the High Court for an order immediately restricting or prohibiting an activity that poses a serious risk to the safety of persons. This phased approach to enforcement is linked to the severity of risk in a particular situation and is in keeping with best practice internationally.</P>
    <P>Part 8 deals with the establishment of the railway safety advisory council and sets out its membership and functions. The council will comprise 14 members including representatives of railway undertakings, railway unions, the commission, mobility impaired people, the public interest, a statutory body involved in worker or public safety and, perhaps, others. The council will have an independent chairperson. Under section 80 it will be the general function of the council to consider issues relevant to railway safety and to make recommendations, as appropriate, to the commission or the Minister. I am confident the council will make a valuable contribution to railway safety.</P>
    <P>Part 9 sets out a detailed regime for the testing of specified safety critical staff of railway undertakings for intoxicants, that is, drugs and alcohol. This is a significant innovation in the area of railway safety. Section 82 lists the specified limits for presence of alcohol in the body. For fairness, I have set these limits at the same level as in the <Col N="1087" /> Road Traffic Acts. As the trend internationally is for these limits to progressively reduce over time, I have reserved the power to make regulations, subject to a resolution of each House of the Oireachtas, to vary the specified limits in the future. Section 83 provides that this part will apply to all passenger railways except heritage railways. The classes of safety critical railway workers affected are also specified. These will include, for example, train drivers, signal men, guards and maintenance workers.</P>
    <P>Section 84 places a number of duties on these safety critical workers. They must not have a level of alcohol in their bodies above the specified limit at a material time and must not be under the influence of an intoxicant to such an extent that they are unfit to carry out their work or could expose a person to danger. A duty is also placed on railway undertakings to take reasonable steps to ensure these safety critical workers are not unfit for work, do not expose others to danger through intoxicants and do not have a level of alcohol in their bodies above the specified limit. To discharge this duty, section 85 requires that a railway undertaking draw up a code of conduct in regard to intoxicants and as to the procedures for the taking of samples from safety critical workers. These codes and procedures must be submitted to the commission for approval. Affected workers and their representatives must be consulted in drawing up the codes and procedures.</P>
    <P>Section 86 requires a railway undertaking to appoint a medically qualified person to take samples from safety critical workers in accordance with the agreed code of conduct and procedures. Section 87 empowers that person to take samples in certain instances, including at random, for stated cause, and after an accident. Section 88 sets out requirements in regard to disciplinary measures to be taken by a railway undertaking against those who breach the requirements in regard to intoxicants.</P>
    <P>These provisions give railway undertakings strong legal powers to deal with intoxication through internal disciplinary procedures and place substantial legal obligations on railway employees with safety critical jobs. It can be argued that we should go further and make it an offence to be intoxicated in addition to or in substitution for the provisions of Part 9. I would particularly welcome the views of Members of the House on this issue. There has been much debate on this point and I will return to it on Committee Stage and listen carefully to what Members opposite have to say. There is a view that being intoxicated while in charge of a train or its safety should be dealt with using the usual internal disciplinary procedures. There is a view that it should be an offence dealt with by the Garda. This has been the subject of protracted and difficult discussions involving my predecessor, trade <Col N="1088" /> unions and representatives of the workers involved.</P>
    <P>Part 10 of the Bill deals with works on a public road in the vicinity of a railway and also to infrastructural works on the railway. In framing this part of the Bill, my Department had in mind the tragic events near Selby in England in February last year, when a car left the road at a flyover and came to rest on the railway below leading to a very serious railway accident. In that instance, the roadside barriers on the flyover clearly did not prevent the car's descent onto the railway below.</P>
    <P>My Department came to the conclusion that the best way to avoid a similar occurrence here was to require a road authority or any other party that is planning to carry out works near a railway, such as erecting roadside barriers, to consider first if those works might affect the safety of an adjacent railway and if so, to consult with the railway undertaking concerned. It was recognised also that major new works on a railway could similarly be a potential risk to a public road and therefore a similar requirement has been placed on railway undertakings to consult with a road authority.</P>
    <P>Part 11 of the Bill deals with various procedural matters such as prosecution and service of notices. Section 94 provides that specified classes of records relating to accident investigations by a railway undertaking or the commission, or relating to inquiries by a tribunal, be kept confidential. Such records would include witness statements, medical information regarding persons involved in a railway incident and also train data recordings, the railway equivalent of an aeroplane's black box.</P>
    <P>However, the commission or a tribunal will be able to disclose these records where, in its opinion, the benefit to the public interest of doing so outweighs any adverse impact on a current or future investigation or inquiry. Clearly, one effect of this section is to exclude these records from release under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>This section has been included following careful consideration of comments received from Iarnród Éireann, its trade unions and the Public Transport Partnership Forum. Also, similar provisions are already set down in regulations, based on international law, covering air accident investigations in Ireland. These provisions take account of the views of experienced investigators.</P>
    <P>The intention of these provisions is to improve railway safety by encouraging the co-operation of parties involved in railway incidents, through the reassurance of confidentiality and thus enhancing the ability of investigators to establish the cause of railway incidents. Its purpose is not to keep information from the public but to encourage people who have information about a railway incident to come forward. In any event, non-dis<Col N="1089" /> closure of information is subject to an over-riding public interest test.</P>
    <P>Only the specified records relating to railway incident investigations will be excluded from the Freedom of Information Act. I will be requesting the Minister for Finance to apply the Freedom of Information Act to both the commission and the Railway Safety Advisory Council. All other records of the commission and the council will be subject to the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 94 are based on the view that, on balance, the public's right to travel safely outweighs the public's right to know. Perhaps some Deputies may disagree with this view and I will therefore welcome and consider any comments they may wish to make.</P>
    <P>The new regulatory framework, together with the major investment which this Government continues to make in our railways, will lay the bedrock for safe railway travel in the future and will provide assurance to the travelling public that safety will continue to be of paramount importance to the Government. Railway safety is at the top of my agenda and I therefore ask Members to facilitate the early passage of this Bill into law. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse everything the Minister said. This is the most important legislation to come before the House in the last five years. There is an urgent need for it and it should have been enacted years ago. It is a miracle that we have not seen a catastrophe like those that have occurred in England.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for the monitoring and inspection of railway infrastructure and the investigation and publication of reports into railway accidents and both are long overdue. It also grants wide-ranging enforcement powers. I hope the Bill will be dealt with expeditiously and this side of the House will support the Minister in its enactment. The Government Chief Whip should, however, avoid scheduling it for a Thursday evening because a number of Members want to speak on the issue; it should not be left so late in the week.</P>
      <P>The Bill puts in place the new regulatory framework for rail safety and will apply to all railways to which there is public access, including the Irish Rail network, light railway metro and the heritage railways. It also applies to those aspects of industrial railways that may interface with public road or railway networks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The placing of a primary duty of care on the railway undertakings to ensure the safety of persons in the operation of the railways is long awaited and very welcome. Duty is placed on both the staff of railway companies and local authorities. In Knockcroghery and at other automated level crossings in County Roscommon there have protracted negotiations with Irish Rail about upgrading. Irish Rail should upgrade these <Col N="1090" /> crossings in conjunction with the local authorities rather than the local authorities having to force Irish Rail to implement some of the measures. Hopefully, with this legislation the pressure will come from on high and Irish Rail will cease to police its own network as has been the case heretofore.</P>
    <P>Rail safety is only debated in the House and outside when there is a major catastrophe in the UK or when we have incidents like the one in Arklow almost two years ago, the train crashing through the level crossing at Kiltoom, County Roscommon &ndash; as it has on numerous occasions &ndash; or the tragedy at the railway station in Dundalk where an employee of Irish Rail was crushed during the shunting of trains. I will return to the issue of Kiltoom level crossing which typifies the lack of action taken by Irish Rail.</P>
    <P>On 9 October the Minister issued a response to me relating to rail safety for which, he stated, Irish Rail has statutory responsibility and he indicated that the company had assured him it operates its network according to a strict standard with the highest level of safety in place for customers and staff. Referring to the most recent incident at the level crossing at Knockcroghery in February 2001, the Minister for Public Enterprise said the standard of rail safety was totally unacceptable and that the rail safety inspectorate was inhibited from effectively doing its work because of Irish Rail's failure to provide full and timely information. The Minister raised concerns about public safety based on the company hiding behind what it claimed was confidential information. In the Minister of Transport's response yesterday to questions raised about level crossings, it could be seen that the amount of information provided to the current rail inspectorate is inadequate and that Irish Rail has, at times, tried to cover up some of these incidents. We have rarely, if ever, seen the company carry out work subsequent to an investigation. Instead, it has tried to put the blame as far as possible on staff and to use them as scapegoats rather than look at improving the level of safety. The Kiltoom level crossing is an ideal example of this. Over the last ten years the crossing has seen ten times as many incidents as has the total network between Athlone and Westport, yet every time an accident happens the driver is blamed. It is unusual for the driver to be wrong in so many incidents at one crossing which brings us back to the fact that the company is not prepared to upgrade the signalling there with the result that by the time the driver finds out the gates are closed he is already on top of them.</P>
    <P>The Little report of May 1998 highlighted the poor condition of our rail network and the miracle that we had not seen a serious rail disaster. The one thing we should learn from Knockcroghery is if that incident had not happened, we would <Col N="1091" /> still have a Third World rail network. Going through the Little report and looking at some of the photographs contained in it showing the condition of the sleepers and the network as a whole, it is hard to fathom how there has not been serious carnage. Two of the worst lines detailed were the Mullingar-Sligo line and the Athlone-Westport-Ballina line, both of which saw the risk of a serious accident increase by 30% every year as a result of their condition. Sadly, it took an incident like Knockcroghery, in which thankfully no one was injured, before any action was taken to upgrade the rail network. We have seen a dramatic improvement in the condition of the permanent way since then. Work is ongoing and Irish Rail has gone over budget in upgrading the permanent way throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It is important to refer to a number of incidents on the network because in one of his replies to me over the last week the Minister stated the railway inspectorate has carried out no formal investigation in the last five years. There is a type of informal arrangement with regard to the Knockcroghery level crossing incident, but other than that there have been no serious investigations carried out which highlights the urgency of introducing this legislation. In June 1998 a locomotive travelling from Connolly Station to Drogheda became detached from its carriages near Skerries. In July 1999 a freight train from Dundalk crossed the River Boyne at Drogheda under a green light signal and collided head on with a mechanical digger. In the winter of 1998 an empty passenger train <i>en route</i> to Dublin approached the Mallow beet factory on a green light and halted just on time when another train emerged from the plant. There was also, of course, the incident with the Cork-Dublin passenger train, the lead portion of which left half its carriages in the tunnel at Kent Station and continued on its journey to Mallow. Not one of these incidents has been investigated by the rail safety inspectorate to any great extent and I hope the Minister can provide the House with a guarantee that when the new commission is established it will carry out thorough investigations and ensure that incidents like this are not repeated.</P>
    <P>While it is not the main purpose of the Bill to provide for prosecutions, the only way we will see action taken is when they occur and the commission must ensure they do. The biggest rail safety issues are the atrocious signalling on the network, which raises again the debate on mini-CTC, and the nature of level crossings. There is huge concern about them everywhere as we debated here yesterday in relation to the death of Sister Bowles in Limerick. Two years prior to her death a milk tanker went through the same level crossing as she did, leading to the sustaining of serious injuries by the driver. He was on the critical list in hospital yet two years later someone <Col N="1092" /> had to die at the same place and I am almost certain no work has been carried out there since. In Slieve Corbally, Dunamon, County Roscommon, a young woman was killed when she drove onto a level crossing where there was a double bend in the rail line and no sight distance either side. Consequent to her death and the dragging of her car down the line, Irish Rail set about investigating what could be done at unmanned level crossings to upgrade them, yet no work has been done at that particular site. That is typical of Irish Rail. It is prepared to carry out internal investigations, but when it comes to implementing recommendations the company falls very short.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Hogan, also raised the matter of the level crossing at Knockmoylan, County Kilkenny, on the Waterford-Dublin line, which thankfully has not seen a fatality. There has been a significant number of near misses at the level crossing, yet Iarnród Éireann has not done anything to upgrade it. Yesterday the Minister spoke about 151 incidents which have occurred at level crossings throughout the country since January 1998. Of those 151 incidents, 116 did not involve a train. However, the remainder did and some had fatal consequences, while others were near misses. What remedial measures have been taken at those level crossings to ensure similar incidents do not happen again? I doubt if the number is in double figures. As regards the Kiltoom level crossing, ten times as many incidents have occurred at that level crossing as at any other level crossing between Athlone and Westport, yet nothing has been done to upgrade it. There was an incident near Shelton Abbey in Arklow when two locomotives decoupled from the rest of the train.</P>
    <P>The level crossing at Kiltoom typifies the inaction of Iarnród Éireann. There are 22 similar level crossings on the train route. There have been five incidents at Kiltoom, yet there has been less than half that total at the other level crossings on the route. The distance between the gates and the signals has not changed for more than 100 years, although the track has been upgraded and the speed of the trains has increased. There was an incident at Kiltoom level crossing in December 2000 and in February 2001 the semaphore signal at the gates indicated the gates were open for the train, although it is possible they were frozen by the weather. That highlights the problem with the signals. The only way to address that problem is to increase the distance between the gates and the signals. Coloured signals should be installed at Kiltoom instead of the archaic system which is there at present.</P>
    <P>It is important that we install the mini-CTC signalling system. Although I know the Minister is strapped for cash, we could help to improve safety by ensuring the mini-CTC is operational as soon as possible and by making fibre optic cable more accessible. The present signalling system <Col N="1093" /> works through fibre optic cable, which is the backbone of broadband information technology. Leasing out a State asset to any competitor in the telecommunications sector would help to generate income which would ensure the network is completed and used successfully to ensure safety and broadband access throughout the country. Everyone could benefit from it because the additional capacity is available on the cable at present. However, a major problem is that the State does not own the cable. It is in the private control of Eircom and BT. If that network was opened up and made more accessible, it would generate income which would ensure the work was completed and the continued upgrading and maintenance of the rail network.</P>
    <P>While I have been critical of Iarnród Éireann today, it is not the first time it has been criticised for its failure to provide full information to the railway inspectorate on the safety aspects of its operations. During the last Government the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, apologised to the House for giving wrong information which had been provided to him by Iarnród Éireann. Deputy Jim Higgins and I said the information was incorrect at the time. That should not be tolerated. I am glad this organisation will have teeth and will be able to pursue the company to ensure it carries out the recommendations of its investigators.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the safety problems in the United Kingdom. Those problems arose because in 1996 the Conservative Government made the biggest mistake it could have made during its term in office by privatising the rail network. I oppose the privatisation of our rail network. There is a lack of public confidence in the rail network in the United Kingdom because it has not been upgraded. The company which took over the management of the rail network milked it for all it was worth financially and allowed the network to collapse. We should ensure that does not happen here. The lack of investment by Railtrack in the maintenance of the rail network led to the litany of fatal accidents there. If the rail lines in this country were frequently maintained, we would be able to increase the speed on our rail network from 100 miles per hour to 125 miles per hour. If we want to encourage people to leave their cars at home and to use the rail network, we must improve its efficiency and maintenance.</P>
    <P>A major concern for passengers is the overcrowding on trains. I do not know if the Minister has had the opportunity yet, but he should go to Galway or Westport by train. He should take the Calcutta Express to Westport on a Friday evening. It is important for him to experience it. There is probably less overcrowding on the trains in India than there is on that train to Westport. The trains to Westport have been downgraded by Iarnród Éireann in the past couple of weeks. One <Col N="1094" /> train does not have automatic doors. If one of the doors is not properly closed, 20 people could fall on to the track on a Friday evening.</P>
    <P>One of the first things the commission must do is to move away from the current railway company policy of looking only at commercial considerations. It is supposed to provide a public service. They should ensure the safety of the passengers and their employees instead of compromising safety considerations for purely commercial reasons. In this regard, overcrowding on our rail network must be addressed immediately after the commission comes into force.</P>
    <P>I take issue with the Minister's assertion that our railways have been safe historically. While we have not had a significant number of accidents, the permanent way is so dangerous it is a miracle we have not had a serious incident.</P>
    <P>I now turn to several of the provisions of the Bill. Section 14 deals with the appointment of three inspectors. As the Minister is well aware, the inspectors have already been appointed with the sole function, to the best of my knowledge, of investigating the incident which took place in Kiltoom in February 2001. Now, 22 months later, we have still not received a report on the incident and the facts have yet to be placed in the public domain. Allowance must be made for additional inspectors to be appointed to carry out a thorough investigation into a litany of minor incidents, as well as several major incidents, which have taken place in the intervening period. Why are incidents which have occurred at level crossings not being followed up by the company? The commission needs to have additional inspectors available to it to carry out investigations.</P>
    <P>From the employees' point of view, Part 9, which deals with drug testing, is probably the most controversial feature of the legislation. The individuals who take and assess the samples from employees must be independent of Irish Rail. Employees are concerned at the lack of independence of the medical practitioners who will take or analyse the test samples. It is imperative that there is an element of independence in this regard. I will return to this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Health and Safety Authority while discussing the enforcement powers of the commission provided for in Part 7. Will these powers be exactly the same as those of the Health and Safety Authority in this area? There is no point having two bodies carrying out investigations or inspections of the rail network. One set of inspectors should be able to carry out both roles. If we had had a commission like this one in the past with powers to address these issues, we would not have had the Indaver dispute which went on for three months several years ago as this was one of the main concerns raised at that time.</P>
    <P>I raised the issue of criminal prosecutions. It is imperative that an example is made to ensure that <Col N="1095" /> the commission's powers are effective and it is not taken for granted by some organisations. I take issue with the definition of a medically qualified person. It is imperative that such persons are independent of the company which has appointed them.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposed the use of the alcohol limits as specified in the Road Traffic Acts. We need to consider zero tolerance for drivers. It is essential that freight trains and the heritage railways are covered by this measure and other restrictions envisaged for the passenger network. While the permanent way of the passenger network has been significantly improved in recent years, the permanent way of the freight network is atrocious. There is no reason to differentiate between a passenger train and a freight train. For example, if a freight train passed a signal and hit a bus on a level crossing, it would cause serious carnage. Similarly, many of the heritage railways carry a significant number of passengers. There needs to be the same level of policing regime for all trains. I presume the reason for the current position is related to the fact that if the matter was left to the companies, the staff of the heritage railways, many of which have only two or three employees, would have to police each other.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 33, I hope the Minister will accept an amendment on Committee Stage on the issue of accountability. I wish to flag my intention to oppose all sections of Bills related to accountability if they do not contain provisions to compel the Minister to answer questions in the House about any body under his authority. We made enough mistakes regarding the National Roads Authority. I will not allow anything similar to happen with regard to matters within the brief of his Department during the next five years.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>the number of convicted sex offenders receiving rehabilitative treatment in correctional facilities; and the number who are currently waiting for treatment.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18609/02]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell) Michael McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 29 September 2002 there were 348 prisoners in custody for sexual offences. As my predecessor has explained to this House on a number of occasions, there are currently four forms of direct therapeutic intervention available to sex offenders within the prison system. These are individual counselling from the Prison Service's psychology service and from the probation and welfare service; the multi-disciplinary thinking skills group work programme in Cork Prison, Arbour Hill Prison and the Curragh Place of Detention; the sex offender treatment programme, which has been in operation in Arbour Hill Prison since 1994 and was introduced in the Curragh Place of Detention in 2000; and the psychiatric service which provides extensive support to prisoners in this category.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made to assist sex offenders in custody who are willing to participate at some level in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention. While it is not possible to accurately quantify participation rates in all forms of rehabilitation, many of those in custody have availed of one or more of the forms of intervention to which I referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sixteen offenders are recruited to the sex offender programme annually, eight in Arbour Hill and eight in the Curragh Place of Detention. Eighty four prisoners have completed the programme to date. In addition, on average, 48 offenders are recruited annually to the thinking skills course, 16 in Arbour Hill, 16 in Cork Prison and 16 in the Curragh Place of Detention. Some <Col N="1097" /> 194 offenders have completed the thinking skills course to date.</P>
    <P>The number of offenders undergoing one-to-one counselling is difficult to define because of the varied nature of individual counselling provided to sex offenders in prison. This counselling can vary from one session addressing a particular problem to intensive ongoing counselling. One of the main aims of individual counselling of sex offenders is to motivate them to address their offending behaviour. In response to such counselling many offenders, who initially might deny responsibility for their crime or deny any need for treatment, are motivated towards some process of change.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>For some offenders this results in their undertaking the sex offender treatment programme at Arbour Hill Prison or the Curragh Place of Detention, for others it results in sustained individual therapy around their offending or engagement in some other programme available in the prison system, for example, the thinking skills course, group skills programme, etc.</P>
    <P>The sex offender treatment programme takes about nine months to complete. When pre-programme and post-programme assessment is included, the timeframe for completing the programme is about 11 months. On average, 10% to 20% of offenders eligible to apply for the sex offender programmes apply for them each year. Priority is given to those offenders who are closest to their release dates but who still have sufficient time left to complete the programme.</P>
    <P>As regards the number of sex offenders who are waiting to participate in the sex offender programme, the position in this regard is best illustrated by the following figures for 2002. There was a total of 45 applicants for the two sex offender programmes this year. Sixteen offenders have been offered places. The remaining 29 constitute a waiting list for the two programmes. Of these, the vast majority have sufficient time left in their sentence to complete the programme at a future date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply, which appears to indicate that not a great deal of therapeutic treatment is being provided. Does the Minister agree it is extremely worrying that a recent study commissioned by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, which was carried out by the Royal College of Surgeons, found that over 40% of women and 28% of men face the threat of sexual abuse during the course of their lifetime? Not a great number of sex offenders are being treated in prisons, which is disturbing because the recidivism rate among sex offenders, in some cases, is appalling.</P>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a higher rate of sexual abuse than other country in Europe or state in the US. People with this problem who have offended are not being treated in prisons. The scale of the problem will only get worse if this position does not change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the general thrust of what the Deputy said. It is essential that we move quickly to the position that all sex offenders are offered adequate counselling and therapy appropriate to their case. We cannot have a situation where people are compelled to take part in programmes against their will or in circumstances where they will not co-operate with the process. There is no doubt that the figures I outlined are indicative, to some extent, of the fact that not every offender is getting formalised sex offender therapy programme treatment at this stage.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be interested to know that the sex offender treatment programme takes nine months to complete. The timeframe for completing the programme, when account is taken of pre-programme and post-programme assessment, is 11 months. On average, 10% to 20% of offenders eligible to apply for the sex offender programme apply for it each year. Priority is given to those offenders who are closest to their release dates but who have sufficient time left to complete the programme.</P>
      <P>As regards the number of sex offenders who are waiting to participate in the programme, the position is best illustrated by pointing out that in 2002 there was a total of 45 applicants for the two sex offender programmes, but only 16 of them were offered places. The remaining 29 constitute a waiting list for those programmes and, of those the great majority have sufficient time left in their sentences to complete the programme at a future date.</P>
      <P>Those figures indicate that there is room for significant improvement. From my days as a barrister representing people who were before the courts for sentence for these types of offences, I recall that I was acutely aware of the deficiencies in the extent of the treatment available. Progress is being made, but I share the Deputy's view that greater progress must be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's acknowledgement of the problem that exists. He pinpointed the issue when he indicated that 45 applicants applied to participate in the programmes, but of those only 16 received treatment. These people have committed horrendous crimes, but even when they want treatment, they are not being allowed it. We need to address this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I already stated to the House on 9 October that the persons referred to by the Deputy have applied for leave of the High Court to seek judicial review of the decision in their case. In the circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment in relation to the case until the judicial review proceedings have been determined.</P>
      <P>I would, however, draw the Deputy's attention to the reply I gave on the Adjournment debate on 10 October 2002 regarding a separate case of a Nigerian mother and her five children who similarly are facing deportation. The making of a deportation order is a serious matter and is not a decision taken lightly. Deportation orders are made by me in accordance with the provisions of the Immigration Act, 1999. That Act requires that, before I make a deportation order in respect of a person, I must consider a range of 11 personal circumstances, including the age of the person, the duration of his or her residence in the State, the family and domestic situation, humanitarian considerations and any representations made by the person or on his or her behalf. In making a deportation order, I consider the case file of the person, including the decision made on any application for refugee status, the requirements of the Immigration Act, 1999, and the prohibition of <i>refoulement</i> as set out in section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister explain the delay of approximately three years for this woman's application to be processed during which time she has integrated herself into Irish society to the point where she has taken the leaving certificate? Can he justify this inordinate delay in terms of administering applications? Is he aware that at the 1995 UN Conference on Women we signed the Beijing Platform for Action, which is an agenda of women's human rights? Is he aware that female genital mutilation is widespread within Nigeria, that there is a great deal of disquiet about what might face this woman if she is returned there, that her sister underwent genital mutilation in Nigeria and that this woman is terrified of what might be the outcome of being repatriated? Can the Minister give a breakdown of the successful section 3 submissions based on nationality, as it is a matter of concern, particularly in the case of Nigeria, that the rate of success of these applications is particularly low?</P>

If I did otherwise I would be accused of attempting to influence the courts in the discharge of this <Col N="1100" /> case. The State is well aware of the problem to which the Deputy adverts. This practice is unlawful in Nigeria. It is contrary to the law. It is not condoned by the law of Nigeria or the law of any state in Nigeria. I want to make that point clear. I must consider every case on its merits and I do that. I take careful note of all the facts, those that are in the public domain and those that are not. This case is being dealt with thoroughly and properly.</P>

      <P>I can give the Deputy some figures. Non-nationals have been granted leave to remain in this State on the basis of Irish born children, marriages, family reunification or for other reasons under the 1999 Act. Since January 2001, approximately 2,500 Nigerians have been allowed to remain in this State for one or other of those reasons. Of that total, 2,266 have been granted leave to remain on the basis of Irish born children, which represents 90% of the total.</P>

Was he not aware of the conviction in the Garda when they said that it would take 11 years to recruit 2,000 gardaí at the present capacity of Templemore?

If one divides that one will find that it is in excess of 800 per annum. In order to meet the target the capacity of Templemore will have to be increased from 2003-07, inclusive, to 830-840 places.

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am looking at the question of retirement ages for all ranks in an Garda Síochána. All ranks within an Garda Síochána up to chief superintendent are eligible for a pension if they have a minimum 30 years service and have reached the age of 50 years. Ranks up to and including inspector must retire at 57 years of age, while superintendents and chief superintendents must retire at 60 years, as must those of commissioner rank appointed after 1996. Assistant commissioners and deputy commissioners appointed before 1996 must retire at 65 years of age. The age differential was established some time ago and recognises that there are greater physical demands on gardaí in front-line operational policing roles.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Public Service Pensions has recommended that the minimum retirement age for new entrants to an Garda Síochána should be raised from 50 to 55 and members should have the option of being retained to a maximum of 60 rather than 57, subject to meeting minimum health and fitness standards. Although retirement rates fluctuate, it does appear there will be an increase in the number of gardaí retiring in 2002. At this stage, the estimate is that 335 gardaí will retire in 2002 compared to 283 in 2001. The exposure to retirements from the Garda Síochána will be increasing over the next few years reflecting the expansion in the size of the force in the 1970s.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said a commitment was given on Garda numbers and then said it was a matter for the Estimates. Which is correct? I am very concerned about the rate of retirement within the Garda and I do not think that we will have 14,000 gardaí by 2007. There are 30 assaults daily in this country, many of them drink-related. The Government liberalised our licensing laws. Does the Minister think this should be given greater priority? The Minister told us that the increase in the number of gardaí between 1997 and 2001 was just 1,000. When one considers the level of violence on the streets it becomes apparent that the Government has not made much of a response.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister giving us a firm commitment of placing more gardaí on the streets? There was a public feud about six months ago between the Departments of Finance and Justice, Equality and Law Reform about the funding available for extra gardaí. Is the Minister saying there is still some ambiguity in that regard, or that the funding has been made available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is asking supplementary questions to Deputy Rabbitte's question rather than his own. There were 6,550 gardaí in 1970, 8,480 in 1975 and there is now just short of 12,000. There has been a gradual increase in the membership of an Garda Síochána over that period. In order to reach the target of an extra 2,000 gardaí, in addition to retirements and resignations, it will be necessary to increase the intake in Templemore from 550 to the low 800s. That is the implication of the commitment in the programme for Government. My instructions are to implement the programme for Government and I do that within the resources available to me.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will also be aware, in an entirely separate exercise &ndash; I do not wish to confuse the two &ndash; a strategic management initiative process is under way at present within the Garda Síochána with a view to deploying the resources of the force in the most efficient way. There are plans to civilianise many functions in order to remove more gardaí from behind counters and desks, get them away from duties which can be carried out by others and get them on to the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Operation Encounter, a major initiative during the past year, has contributed significantly to countering violence in the streets. I am also putting in place other measures. The House will be aware that I am piloting through &ndash; I hope to have the co-operation of the Opposition in <Col N="1104" /> facilitating its speedy passage &ndash; the Public Order Bill which deals with street violence and locations of trouble. On a multifaceted basis, across a number fronts, the serious scourge of street violence to which the Deputy correctly referred will be countered.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm that the report of the review group on investment based naturalisation in Ireland was brought by me before Government in July of this year. I arranged for its publication on 4 August and a number of copies were placed in the Oireachtas Library at that time. In addition, I issued a press statement which was widely reported in the media.</P>
      <P>Before proceeding, I want to make a brief comment about the investment based naturalisation scheme and the principle behind it. The scheme was introduced in 1988. It is on the record of the House that it was put in place on the initiative of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Bruton, who first suggested it in 1986. The basic idea behind it, as everybody knows, was that Irish citizenship could be conferred, through the naturalisation process, on non-nationals who were prepared to invest in Irish businesses for the purposes of creating or maintaining jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, I have always been opposed to the principle behind this scheme. I have no difficulty with the Irish state according rights of residence and, in due course, citizen<Col N="1105" /> ship on non-nationals who come here to establish businesses and employment and who intend in good faith to become full members of our community. However, I disagree with the privilege of Irish citizenship being bartered to investors who have little or no connection with Ireland and who have no plans to strengthen their connections.</P>
    <P>That said, however, it is the case that, like many Deputies on all sides of this House, I was approached on a number of occasions in an effort to secure all-party agreement on particular applications, which involved significant job saving and job creation investment and which had significant support from State agencies. In some such instances, following the significant changes to the scheme in 1994 in the wake of the Masri controversy, I indicated that I would not oppose such applications.</P>
    <P>The basic principle behind the scheme, which is the subject of this question, was not its only problem. A major flaw was that it was not statute based. The operating rules governing the scheme &ndash; such as they were &ndash; were essentially a set of administrative guidelines, which were flexible and were flexibly operated. They also depended on a very loose and, in my view, questionable interpretation of the 1956 Act. The report I published in August shows that this flexibility, or looseness of process, applied in many cases and was by no means confined to the case which is the subject of the Deputy Rabbitte's question.</P>
    <P>In the context of recent controversy concerning the appropriateness of the appointment of Ray Burke as a Minister in the previous Government, the Taoiseach asked me to examine the file relating to this case and I agreed to do so. The particular file is currently with the Moriarty tribunal. All the passport for investment files in respect of persons naturalised under the scheme prior to 1997 were sought by the tribunal and a copy of the file was left in my Department. I compared this to the one in the possession of the tribunal and have found that it is a correct and true copy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We have established from the Minister's reply that the file in the Minister's possession is a true copy of the one referred to the Moriarty tribunal. I trust he is not suggesting that it would ever be otherwise. In that context, may we get to what the question is really about? Having studied the file, is the Minister now satisfied that the Taoiseach was correct when he stated that he had no cause for alarm &ndash; the file having been referred to him by the then Minister, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn &ndash; in terms of the appointment of Ray Burke as a Cabinet Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>My examination of the file confirms that the 11 passports and naturalisations in question were granted in a manner which was, even by the lax standards that have frequently characterised the operation of the scheme in <Col N="1106" /> question, irregular and unusual. In short, it appears that the passports and naturalisations in question were effected in a manner which bypassed usual formalities and which ignored failure by the applicants to comply with elementary documentary requirements. It seems that the passports in question were prepared in advance of the completion of the applications for naturalisation and it has been reported that they were handed over to the applicants by the then Taoiseach at a lunch hosted by them in a Dublin hotel.</P>
      <P>As I have pointed out previously to the House, no departmental file is likely to carry any explicit evidence of gross impropriety or corruption on the part of a member of Government. Nonetheless, in light of what we now know from the proceedings and reports of intervening tribunals, it would be fair to say that serious questions concerning the role of the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, would be raised in the minds of anyone examining the file with the benefit of hindsight. I am not in a position to supply any explanation from the contents of the file, which I have examined, for the then Taoiseach's apparent interest in having the case processed with unusual haste. These may be matters on which the Moriarty tribunal may be able to cast useful light.</P>
      <P>The file shows that former Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, as Minister for Justice, in the context of ongoing controversy concerning the scheme and in the context of a parliamentary question concerning the 11 passports in question, was sufficiently concerned by its contents to commission a report by a senior departmental official. She subsequently drew her concerns about the file to the attention of the then Tánaiste and now Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in November 1994 and at his request furnished him with a memorandum summarising the basis for those concerns. Both she and the Taoiseach resigned their respective offices shortly thereafter, but that had nothing to do with this particular case. The inquiry ordered by Máire Geoghegan-Quinn proceeded under her successor as Minister, former Deputy Nora Owen. An interim report was completed during Mrs. Owen's term of office and a copy of it subsequently came into the possession of <i>The Irish Times</i> in September 1997, after she had left office.</P>
      <P>When Mr. Burke was initially appointed to the Cabinet in July 1997, nobody on any side of this House appears to have revisited the passports issue in the context of his suitability for office. Whether that is explained by an assumption that the substantial responsibility rested with Mr. Haughey rather than Mr. Burke or whether the file's contents only resumed importance in the context of the Gogarty allegations I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>The file in question is now back with the Moriarty tribunal and I assure the House that my <Col N="1107" /> Department will continue to co-operate fully with the tribunal in these and other related matters. I can also confirm that there are no circumstances in which I will recommend to the Government that we should return to a situation &ndash; either with or without statute &ndash; where Irish citizenship can be bartered for economic reasons. If there is an economic case for conferring benefit on investors, that benefit as far as I am concerned will have to take a form other than Irish citizenship.</P>

      <P>I accept that. Is it a fair summary to say that, having studied the file, the Minister has found that the practices applied were irregular and unusual? Is it correct to state that the procedures normally used were bypassed, that the documentary inquiries necessitated were ignored and that the hawking of 11 passports across St. Stephen's Green &ndash; the naturalisation orders being signed in Mr. Burke's home after the passports had issued &ndash; was so irregular that any reasonable person inspecting the file would have concluded that it was indeed a cause for alarm?</P>
      <P>There is little point referring to this side of the House not raising the issue in July 1997. It was the Government side of the House that ought to have been concerned about it. What does the Minister conclude about Deputy Ahern's reading of the file referred to him by Máire Geoghegan-Quinn? Was it not a cause for alarm that should have warranted Mr. Burke being excluded from Cabinet?</P>

      <P>A draft report on the investigation into the system of tyre purchases and fitting from Advance Pitstop has been prepared by the internal audit unit of my Department. However, it is awaiting the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions on the Garda investigation into this matter before finalising the report.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of overpayments and recovery of overpayments, Deputies may recall that on 9 November 2001 the Comptroller and Auditor General submitted his value for money report on the purchase of tyres by the Garda Síochána. In that report he estimated that overpayments to Advance Pitstop were to the value of £208,000, or &euro;264,106. This was on the basis that the proper notification of price increases had not been provided. When this matter was being discussed in detail before the Committee of Public Accounts on 8 January 2002, the Secretary General of the Department explained that there was a question mark over the issue of notification of price increases but that Advance Pitstop had agreed there were overpayments in some areas. However, the company claimed that there were underpayments in other areas and it offered a net credit note for £102,000, or &euro;129,513.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has not accepted that figure as being definitive and is pursuing the issue as to exactly what level of overpayments is properly recoverable. In the meantime, as an interim step, the value of the net credit note of £102,000, or &euro;129,513, has been deducted from payments to <Col N="1110" /> Advance Pitstop in respect of subsequent purchases.</P>

Is the Minister aware it has been reported that one of the main persons involved in this matter is now a stakeholder in a motor factors shop, no doubt bringing his expertise in purchasing to bear in his new employment? Has the Minister had any discussions with the Garda Commissioner about the practices that were revealed by the Comptroller and Auditor General?</P>

      <P>The investigation being carried out by the internal audit unit is continuing. Its work includes matters that were not the subject of examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General, particularly the role played by a named member of the Garda Síochána. The internal audit unit raised certain queries that may be of a criminal nature with the Garda authorities regarding the ongoing criminal investigation. These irregularities were also the subject of a separate criminal investigation by the Garda which has forwarded a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>The report of the internal audit unit will be furnished to me and the Secretary General, in his capacity as Accounting Officer, and I will keep the House fully informed of the outcome of the internal audit report. However, unlike the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, it is likely to focus on potentially criminal behaviour. The House will appreciate that care must be taken to respect the rights of individuals and to ensure nothing is done that might prejudice potential criminal or civil proceedings. It might not be possible, therefore, to publish the report of the internal audit unit in full at this point or in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy. It is incumbent upon everybody in public life, in any part of this island, to support fully the forces of law and order in both parts of the island. It is wrong for anybody in public life to hint, in any sense, to members of the public that they should not be entirely forthcoming with information which could be of use in detecting offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with the Deputy, I share a sense of disappointment that more of those involved &ndash; there must have been a number &ndash; have not yet been brought to justice in connection with this <Col N="1112" /> atrocity. The Garda Síochána is co-operating fully with the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Within the confines and subject to the requirements of the rule of law, every effort is being made to bring the perpetrators of that atrocity to justice. Anybody who thinks they can advance a cause by killing anyone, be they members of the Northern Ireland security services or civilians targeted by a similar bomb outrage, is deeply mistaken. As I indicated here in an earlier debate, if some people in this country are planning on &ldquo;getting lucky&rdquo;, to use the phrase that terrorists have used chillingly about their operations, I am telling them that as far as I can achieve it, they will find themselves extremely unlucky if they go any further down that road.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate my position on that matter, which is very clear. There is no historical or political basis for any person on this island to inflict an injury on another person in either part of the island. Whether such injury takes the form of what is euphemistically called punishment beatings, which I prefer to call mutilation torture, or whether it is done in the guise of blackmail or beatings with baseball bats, or goes all the way by killing people, the moral position of the Irish people as expressed through the ballot box is 100% clear. Therefore, anybody in public life who has any doubts in their own heart about whether it is appropriate to condone such behaviour or to urge people not to inform the police services about it in either part of this island, is gravely mistaken and will stand condemned by history.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy has been serving a life sentence for murder since January 1983. His case was considered by the interim parole board in July 2002. The board's recommendation in the case was subsequently received in my office on 13 August 2002.</P>
      <P>As acknowledged very fairly by the Deputy in his question, I have publicly expressed my wish to refer the interim parole board's recommendation in this case to another member of Government for consideration, arising from the fact that I had previous dealings in the matter. I recently sought the advice of the Attorney General on the practical arrangements to give effect to this. The advice of the Attorney General is now to hand and I hope to come to a decision on the most appropriate arrangements in the near future, following consultation with my colleagues in Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances surrounding the events of the demonstration in Dublin on 6 May 2002 are currently under investigation by the Garda Síochána. They have informed me that an investigation file containing certain recommendations in relation to the events of the May Day rally has been forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions for his directions.</P>
      <P>Quite separately, the Garda Síochána Complaints Board, following receipt of a number of complaints, has undertaken an investigation of the events of 6 May. In the circumstances, therefore, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I ought to have tabled a question to the Minister asking how many internal inquiries are going on in his Department and within the Garda Síochána. It seems that a large proportion of the resources of the Garda Síochána must now be tied up with undertaking internal inquiries into events affecting them. Is the Minister concerned about that?</P>
      <P>It is lamentable for no conclusion to have been brought before the House so many months after 6 May, given the scenes we saw which, if I may borrow a colourful phrase from Senator Mansergh, were reminiscent of what one would be likely to see in Mugabe's Zimbabwe. Having had the sense of mind to remove their identification numbers beforehand, these robocops waded into a fairly small-scale demonstration, beating up and brutalising innocent protesters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question, Sir. Is it not reprehensible that members of the Garda Síochána, having removed their identification numbers, brutalised citizens engaged in a peaceful protest on our streets? Over five months later, we have still had no report from the Garda Síochána as to what transpired, or how blame may be apportioned. Is the Minister concerned about this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has the luxury of being able to make those remarks but I am not in a position to comment upon them because, as the Deputy well appreciates, the matter is now with the Director of Public Prosecutions who will make an independent decision. If he decides that the matter should be subjected to the criminal justice process in the courts, my remarks could be seized upon by anybody seeking to claim that <Col N="1115" /> their capacity to receive due process had been prejudiced.</P>
      <P>However, the events to which the Deputy has referred do highlight the need for me to bring forward legislation for a Garda inspectorate which would have powers to carry out independent investigations of complaints against members of the Garda Síochána. I will answer a question later on that issue. It is my intention to publish legislation to that end in 2003.</P>
      <P>Regarding why it has taken so long, we must remember that the event occurred in circumstances that involved many people. Although the Deputy can draw his conclusions, one necessary element is to interview many people who were potential witnesses to the events under investigation. The fact that the Garda authorities recently forwarded an investigation file to the Director of Public Prosecutions with recommendations indicates the comprehensive nature of the investigation undertaken. As the investigation could potentially lead to criminal proceedings, it was important to establish the full facts and to take whatever time was necessary to do so, bearing in mind the serious nature of the complaints made.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána board has a separate statutory remit and this was the first time in which it undertook to commit an investigation under section 6(5) of its statute. The board's report may lead to references to the Director of Public Prosecutions or references to the tribunal system within the Garda Síochána or other steps. I do not want to prejudge the outcome of the board's deliberations, but I anticipate that it will complete its them in the relatively near future.</P>

Is he concerned about the alienation of the public from the Garda as a result of that kind of image being displayed on our television screens?</P>
      <P>Has he had any discussions with the Garda Commissioner about the events that transpired accidentally before the eyes of the nation &ndash; it was entirely an accident that this appeared on our television screens?

      <Quest>the progress made to date in regard to allegations of falsification of conviction rates in Garda records in Waterford; when the promised new system for the collation of crime figures will be in place; the way in which the new system will work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18494/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Commissioner is gravely concerned that any doubt should be cast on the accuracy of information which may form part of his Garda annual report arising from the allegations relating to the treatment of crime statistics in Waterford city Garda district as contained in <i>The Star.</i> As a consequence, the Garda Commissioner appointed, on 14 February, a chief superintendent from outside the region to review all aspects of the information received. Specifically, the chief superintendent will carry out a complete audit of all headline and applicable non-headline offences in the Garda district in question for 2001. The audit will examine all detected offences and the evidence pertaining to those offences being declared as detected. It will also examined compliance with the crime counting rules as they currently apply. Given the importance of the figures contained in the Garda Commissioner's annual report on crime, I assure the House that the report of the chief superintendent, when finalised, will be made public.</P>
      <P>At this point I want to put on the record of the House that I very much share the concern of the Deputy that these allegations have arisen. Although I have no role, and do not intervene, in the compilation of crime statistics, it should go without saying that public confidence must be upheld in the validity and legitimacy of crime statistics emanating from the organisations solely responsible for their completion, namely An Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>However, it must also be recognised that the crimes which are the subject of the controversy occurred in 2001 and the Commissioner's Annual Report of An Garda Síochána for that year has yet to be finalised. I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the process of validating crime figures for the year 2001 is, at present, under way in all Garda districts and will not be completed for some time. The Deputies will be aware that earlier this summer I brought to the public's attention the preliminary figures as soon as I got them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>This is yet another internal inquiry. Is the Minister concerned that while these inquiries are set up, the public has long forgotten the matters for which they were established by the time they report? When will we know the outcome? Why, apparently, was there a deliberate distortion of the crime figures in the Waterford area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a copy of the document sent to <i>The Star.</i> If it is founded in fact &ndash; we do not know yet if it is or not, but clearly there was an internal dispute in the Garda station &ndash; it is a matter of serious concern. Is the Minister satisfied that this revelation from an internal dispute in the Water<Col N="1118" /> ford region is not reflected in the general compilation of figures and can he give the House an idea of when we will have this report?</P>
    <P>Can he explain to me, an ordinary lay person, why is it taking so long to investigate what seems to be a fairly straightforward allegation that the actual crime incidence in the Waterford area and those recorded on computer are different? How could it take that long? How is it that when we have a controversy like this affecting the Garda, and affecting the good name of the many thousands of gardaí who diligently set about their daily work, it is quelled by the words &ldquo;There will be an inquiry&rdquo;? However, it takes months to get the inquiry and then it is done in a fashion which does not really relate to the original concern in the public mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the allegations in the newspaper are serious and serious allegations must be carefully investigated. I share the Deputy's concern that this afternoon we are talking a great deal in these proceedings about inquiries into this and that. I appreciate, and I am sensitive to, the overall effect that such focus on inquiries into various aspects of An Garda Síochána could have for the force's reputation and internal morale. The point, which I have also made to members of the representative associations, is that in a culture of openness, transparency and accountability when matters which deserve inquiry are brought to light, they will be inquired into. I do not want to create the impression that the Garda Síochána spends more time investigating itself than the commission of crimes.</P>
      <P>The non-investigation and concealment of matters such as these and turning a blind eye to them would yield a far more bitter harvest if that were allowed to go ahead. Some might consider that some of the controversies that have affected the Garda Síochána have arisen in the context of a culture of turning a blind eye or not fully and thoroughly investigating every possible misdemeanour when it comes to light. If we want a modern, effective and professional police force, we must accept that the highest standards must apply. That involves making it clear within the Garda Síochána that a culture of complicity can never be allowed to emerge.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons for the independent inspectorate, which will be the subject of proposed legislation next year, is to ensure the public has the highest confidence in the investigation of standards in the Garda Síochána generally and individual complaints. The members of the Garda Síochána who, almost to a man and woman, want to uphold high standards are not fools and know that the system reinforces and supports those who support high standards rather than those who deviate from them.</P>

While I have no doubt that the Garda authorities will take fully into account any lessons which may be learned from this tragic incident, the unfortunate reality is that the use of firearms carries with it inherent dangers and the incident in question is a sad, tragic and poignant reminder of the dangers which members of the Garda Síochána face in tackling crime on our behalf.</P>

I am informed by the Garda authorities that the unit is assisting local gardaí in investigating the robberies at Russborough House. One person stands charged before the courts in connection with the robbery which took place on 26 June 2001. I am further informed that the theft which took place on 29 September 2002 is the subject of a major ongoing investigation. In the circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to comment any further on ongoing Garda operational matters, as is the long-standing practice on the part of the holders of my office.</P>

Would the Minister not consider it a good idea if the unit took up residence in Russborough House? I do not know if it has spare capacity, but it seems the unit would be productively used if it was resident there. These thefts have almost become an exchange between certain criminal gangs and the Garda and it is surely time for a more radical assessment of what ought to be done in respect of the priceless paintings housed there and the frequency of incidents we have seen in recent years.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to know where to begin in relation to this matter. I know the Deputy is speaking tongue in cheek in making his suggestion, but to deploy Garda personnel on a permanent basis to mind collections in locations such as Russborough House is not practicable. Therefore, the owners and trustees of such collections must make such security arrangements as are appropriate to the degree of risk they encounter in relation to the collections for which they have responsibility.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to comment on the ongoing investigation in this case as that would not serve a useful purpose. However, I share the Deputy's view that there is something profoundly disturbing about an in-your-face deliberate ploy on the part of individuals who must be organised to some degree, whoever they are, to rub the noses of the public in their own criminality.</P>

Are there not two such dedicated units in the Garda, one to deal with organised crime and the other to deal with the theft of works of art and antiques?

The unit, through a range of activities, endeavours to heighten the awareness of the public and persons likely to come into contact with stolen or dishonestly handled property of this type and provides operational assistance and expertise for Garda personnel investigating specific crimes.</P>

    <P>Last year, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment issued 36,000 work permits to Irish firms in respect of non-EEA national employees. In addition, a special streamlined work visa and work authorisation scheme was put in place in April 2000 to cover persons with qualifications in special high skill areas. More than 3,500 work visas and work authorisations were issued in 2001. The range of professions covered by the this scheme was extended in May 2002 and <Col N="1122" /> it now covers construction professionals, information technology professionals, medical practitioners and a range of other healthcare professionals. In all of the foregoing cases, special simplified procedures are operated by the immigration authorities in relation to the issue of visas and in relation to permission to enter and remain in the State save in exceptional circumstances which may arise from time to time.</P>
    <P>It is not the case, however, that the response to the State's need for immigrant labour can be addressed by simply allowing any person who arrives in this jurisdiction at any time for any purpose to engage in employment as a matter of course. The migration of large numbers of workers from widely divergent social and economic backgrounds must be managed in a structured, transparent and legally sound manner to ensure fair treatment of the persons concerned and to ensure the social and economic welfare of the State and its citizens is protected. Neither is it the case that Garda operations which are designed to ensure the immigration laws of the State are complied with can simply be set aside because the State is in need of immigrant employees in particular sectors.</P>
    <P>Operation Hyphen, about which the Deputy asked, took place on the 16 July and 23 July of this year and was one such Garda operation. It was but one of a wide range of initiatives taken by the Garda authorities in their ongoing investigation to identify persons who are unlawfully present in this jurisdiction. I am informed by the Garda authorities that they consider Operation Hyphen a success in that 16 persons wanted for deportation were apprehended, a number were charged with offences before the District Court and a number who were here illegally are believed to have left the State voluntarily. As a result of the operation there has been a dramatic increase in the number of non-EEA nationals who are registering at the Garda National Immigration Bureau and at local Garda registration offices as they are required to do under the provisions of the Aliens Order, 1946.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should note that if the law is not enforced, it falls into disuse and disrepute. If it is enforced, people comply with it and we need people to comply with immigrations law because, without it, there will be chaos.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that all politicians, parties and Members of this House have a duty to work against racism in this country? Does the Minister find it strange to direct an operation such as Operation Hyphen, which saw the arrest of 16 people, and to use the Garda and the finances of the State in such a negative way considering the massive anti-social problems in the State? Does the Minister accept the valuable economic, social and cultural role immigrants <Col N="1123" /> play in Ireland? Will he highlight this positive side to immigration?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to furnish the House with the cost of Operation Hyphen. I agree with Deputy McGrath that immigrants have made and are making a valuable contribution to Irish society from the highest paid to the more modestly paid posts which they occupy. I do not detract in any way from that economic and social reality. However, it is not negative to enforce immigration law. I intend to increasingly enforce it and to make it more effective in the coming months. The law is to be complied with. Irish laws are not very onerous or exacting and anybody who comes to Ireland must comply with our immigration laws. I will not allow a free-for-all to develop.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McGrath's remarks about racism. I ask the Deputy to consider that one of the things that would contribute massively to the potential for the emergence of racism in our society would be the perception that those who have a responsibility for upholding the law on immigration had given up on the job and were allowing a free-for-all to develop for those who wished to come here in any circumstance, regardless of the state of our law. It is not a question of Operation Hyphen having overtones or undertones of racism; it is simply an exercise in indicating to people in this country, whether they come from America, Africa or elsewhere, that they must comply with our laws. The effect of Operation Hyphen has been to bring about a much more compliant attitude towards our immigration laws.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for giving me this opportunity to raise the issue of the dismantling of the community employment scheme by the Government. Without disrespect to the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, I regret that the Tánaiste is not here to answer the important questions that arise. She has been evading these questions in parliamentary replies since the Dáil resumed.</P>
      <P>There is widespread concern abroad about what is happening to community employment schemes and what it is believed will happen next year. The Government has resolved that community employment will be effectively dismantled after budget day. Agreement apparently has been reached between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Finance that numbers will be reduced to 15,500 next year.</P>
      <P>If cuts as savage as that are to be imposed on the most vulnerable sector of workers and the most disadvantaged communities in the State, it is a disgrace and amounts to an effective dismantling of the community employment scheme that has served these communities well and done much productive and meritorious work. That work has a valuable social dimension and these cuts will break the morale in those communities, not to mention disqualifying some people who expected to have their programmes extended. It is little short of disgraceful given the meritorious work being done in the community, including valuable heritage and restoration work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dishonesty of the official position is exacerbating the hurt in the community. The Minister is sheltering behind replies which abstractly talk about &ldquo;FÁS currently undertaking an internal review of CE,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the outcome will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future delivery of community services&rdquo;. What does that mean? It is deliberately misleading and deceitful nonsense. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment knows well that the CE scheme for 2003 will be savaged on budget day. Cuts have already been made, meritorious projects have been refused and the grossest deception is that FÁS is being reduced to communicating informally and unofficially with scheme sponsors. The CE scheme is being gutted in 2003 for budgetary reasons and Fianna Fáil backbenchers, whose revolt was easily <Col N="1125" /> quelled, ought to revert to revolt mode if they are to retain their seats and if the communities most seriously affected are to be looked after. Community morale is being destroyed in seriously disadvantaged areas. Sponsors cannot plan the future of their work, schemes are being continued by FÁS on a month-to-month basis and no new schemes are being allowed.</P>
    <P>The most successful community enterprise organisation in the country, Partas, formerly known as Get Tallaght Working Limited, is in my constituency. The chairman of the organisation, in response to a request by me for information, told me that although he was advised to recruit two additional people, the order has since been countermanded by FÁS. Furthermore, he has been told that the total participation in the Partas scheme will be reduced to nine participants by November and by a further five by April 2003. The chairman of the organisation told me that it would normally begin a new contract year in April, but he has been told that it is being closed down instead. Rather than supporting community employment and the job initiative scheme, the establishment of which I was involved in as Minister of State, this Government action cripples, in effect, the Partas scheme and many others. The problems faced by Partas will be encountered on a wide scale in disadvantaged communities in urban Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is disgraceful, particularly given the platform on which it was elected, that the Government has chosen to strangle the community employment scheme by making it the focus of cuts. When one considers that a great deal of work in communities could not be done without the CE scheme and that many people have been given a pathway back to employment as a result of it, it is wrong that it has been targeted for cuts of this scale. The Minister, Deputy Harney, refuses to come to the House to answer questions in an honest manner, as she seems to prefer to shelter behind a brand of officialese which contradicts the statements her officials make in telephone calls to FÁS. It is a disgrace. I ask Fianna Fáil backbenchers to have a word with the Minister before this goes any further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Rabbitte for raising this issue. I wish to clarify that I am responsible for community employment schemes, so it is unfair to suggest that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is afraid to come to the House to deal with this matter. I am working closely with the Minister on developments in respect of such schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of community employment is as a transitional programme to provide work experience and training to the long-term unemployed, with a view to reintegrating them <Col N="1126" /> into the open labour market. In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, participation levels are being reduced gradually, reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of the long-term unemployed, and the emphasis is being shifted away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. The National Employment Service assists participants, as they finish their term on CE, to source employment in the open labour market or to avail of further education or training opportunities available locally.</P>
    <P>The PPF contains a commitment to reduce numbers on CE from 37,500 in 1999 to 28,000 by 2003, by reallocating funding equivalent to 5,000 places to the social economy programme, as well as by reducing the numbers on CE schemes by 4,500 places, in accordance with the Government's 1999 decision. There were 30,809 participants on CE at the beginning of 2002 and it is anticipated that there will be between 24,000 and 25,000 participants at the end of the year, depending on the rate of inflows and outflows. Most of the CE reductions in 2002 will be due to restructuring, reflecting the drop in the numbers of long-term unemployed, budgetary constraints and the continuation of the mainstreaming of CE school services, amounting to about 1,400 places.</P>
    <P>It is important to view community employment participation levels in the context of the general labour market, a point the following statistics help to illustrate. There are currently 21,600 long-term unemployed persons, a reduction of 51,000, or 70%. The unemployment rate is currently 4.2%, which is a marginal increase on 2001, and the long-term unemployment rate is 1.2%. Total employment has increased by 230,000 and the number of work permits issued has increased from 6,000 in 1999 to over 36,000 in 2001. There are more CE places than there are long-term unemployed and many low-skilled jobs continue to be filled by people from the EU and further afield. In this regard, some 33,000 work permits have been issued to date this year.</P>
    <P>FÁS prioritises projects according to the types of services provided and levels of unemployment in the locality. Reductions in CE schemes are being co-ordinated to minimise negative effects on the groups and services most in need of CE. Priority groups that are ring-fenced include CE places that provide services under the national drugs strategy action plan, CE places that provide child care services as part of the process of assisting unemployed parents in accessing labour market services and CE schemes involved in the provision of school services and the possible mainstreaming of health related services. In addition to the above categories, CE schemes in RAPID programme areas are prioritised in terms of maintaining places. Reductions will only be <Col N="1127" /> made after reductions have been made in areas outside the RAPID programme.</P>
    <P>FÁS is currently undertaking an internal review of community employment, including an assessment of the role of the programme in regard to the provision of community services. The PPF-mandated review of active labour market programmes is being progressed under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, chaired by my Department. The Indecon International Economic Consultants group has been commissioned by my Department to facilitate a rigorous assessment of the overall effectiveness of existing programmes to help inform the deliberations of the standing committee. The assessment is near completion. In addition, a cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of CE and the provision of community services which may be affected by further reductions in CE places.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Rabbitte that no decision has <Col N="1128" /> been taken on the community employment funding level for 2003. The outcome of the various initiatives under way will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future delivery of community services and appropriate levels of CE for the future, in the context of current budgetary constraints. The points made by the Deputy have been well made by Members from all sides of the House, including one of his constituency colleagues. While nobody disputes that CE schemes provide good services, the community service being provided has become an issue. Deputy Rabbitte is well aware that CE was introduced as a labour market mechanism at a time of long-term unemployment. It would be wrong of the Government not to review the process in these changed times. I assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to ensure that an effective labour market programme can continue and that we address the important issues of service to local communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that the survey of public attitudes to the Garda was carried out early in 2002 and asked mainly about Garda services, policing priorities and fear of crime. The fieldwork for the survey was carried out by Research and Evaluation Services, RES, a Belfast-based company that won the contract after an EU-wide tender competition.</P>
      <P>This year's survey was substantially larger than previous surveys. All in all, 10,405 respondents took part, with a minimum representation of 400 in each Garda division. This allowed assessment of Garda performances in each Division under key headings. The survey was carried out by telephone &ndash; 66% &ndash; or by post &ndash; 34%. The same core questions were asked in each version. Some questions, where information was not required at the divisional level, were not asked in the telephone survey or were rotated between respondents.</P>
      <P>A pilot survey took place in December 2001. Telephone interviewing began on 12 January 2002 and was completed on 24 April 2002. The postal survey took place during the same period, starting and finishing slightly later.</P>
      <P>Respondents were selected from the electoral register in the first instance and then matched as far as possible with telephone listings. Where no telephone number was identified, a questionnaire was sent by post with an option of completion using a free-phone number. Letters of introduction were sent in all cases and reminder/thank you letters were issued to participants in the postal survey. The survey was given good media exposure following the release of a briefing by the Garda Public Relations and Press Office. Comparability with earlier surveys was maximised by retaining the exact wording in as many questions as possible. Comparison was not possible in all cases. Several new questions were added.</P>
      <P>The survey findings were re-weighted to take account of sampling procedures (e.g. over-representation of some rural divisions to ensure minimum divisional sample size of 400) and differing non-response rates. Reweighting factors for the national sample were population, age and housing tenure, and for the divisional weighting, age and gender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1130" />I am also advised by the Garda authorities that the findings in the report were presented as point estimates. The true values are likely to lie within a range of +/ 1% at national level &ndash; full sample &ndash; and +/ 5% at divisional level.</P>

      <Quest>the steps he intends to take to deal with the situation highlighted in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General which found that warrants issued for the arrest of 5,500 people who failed to turn up in court to face charges cannot be executed due to the fact that the warrants have gone missing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I take it that the situation referred to by the Deputy is the issue raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his annual report for 2001 in which he examines the administration of bail. As part of his examination, the issue of persons failing to appear before the court and the handling of the resulting bench warrants is dealt with. The procedure is that if a person on bail fails to attend the court at the appointed time the Gardaí are requested, by means of a bench warrant, to arrange for the arrest of the person. This request is on the direction of the presiding judge.</P>
      <P>An exercise which was carried out by the Garda Síochána themselves has identified 5,500 bench warrant cases as outstanding. I understand that these cases arose in the period between 1988 and 1998 before the introduction of a new centralised system in August 1998. I am informed by the Garda authorities that although some of the 5,500 cases may have been executed it is not possible to quantify these cases. While difficulties arise in pursuing these cases I am informed that the Garda is giving priority to dealing with cases of serious crime and in this connection have sought the assistance of the Courts Service which has provided the original court records to the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Comptroller recognises in his conclusions that &lsquo;the existence of 5,500 pre 1999 undischarged cases in the system reflects historical lapses in co-ordination between the two &ndash; courts and Garda &ndash; services'. The Garda introduced an interim system for the distribution and control of warrants in 1998 pending the introduction of a facility on the PULSE system which will interface with the courts and prisons systems. The Courts Service criminal case tracking system now deals with the issue of bench warrants and whether they have been executed or not. In addition, in response to the recognised need for more focused, specialised and visible management structures to deliver key criminal justice services, such as execution of bench warrants, my Department commenced a programme of organisation restructuring in the late 1990s. This programme <Col N="1131" /> aims to deliver improved results and better services by devolving responsibility for day to day administration and strengthening management and organisational structures, including IT systems such as PULSE and the criminal case tracking system, CCTS.</P>
    <P>Areas of integration identified for priority development under this programme included communication regarding warrants between the Courts Service, the Garda Síochána and the Irish Prisons Service. I am informed by the Garda authorities that close co-operation between the Courts Service and the Garda authorities has reduced the processing rate of warrants from 16 weeks in 1999 to two weeks in 2002. I am satisfied that these measures will ensure that difficulties such as these should not recur.</P>

      <P>It is important to distinguish between mental health problems, which include a range of problems such as psychiatric illnesses and personality disorders, and intellectual/learning disability. The specific report referred to in this question relates to learning disability and not mental health problems. The report, a copy of which I am arranging to have placed in the Oireachtas Library, is the subject of a separate Question, Ref. No. 18611/02, on today's Order Paper.</P>
      <P>As regards services for prisoners with mental health problems, prisoners have access to a range of health care services, including mental health services. Mental health services are provided either in prison or, if considered clinically appropriate, in the Central Mental Hospital. In view of concerns outlined to my predecessor that the provision of adequate facilities was becoming increasingly problematic, an expert group was established in 1999 to review these issues and make recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from the publication of the report of the group to review the structure and organisation of prison health care services in 2001, a working group was established involving representation by my Department, the Department of Health and Children, relevant health boards, and the Irish Prisons Service. This working group is currently exploring means of implementing the core recommendations of this report, including those referring to treatment structures relating to offenders with mental health problems. In particular, it is my intention that health care facilities <Col N="1132" /> for prisoners should broadly mirror public health facilities provided in the general community. The implementation of appropriate structures will, of course, require the active co-operation of a range of agencies .</P>
    <P>The Irish Prisons Service is currently facilitating a research project being undertaken by a team based at the Central Mental Hospital which is examining the prevalence of mental illness among the prison population. While well advanced there are no definitive results of this research yet available. While this study is not specifically considering the issue of learning disability, contact with the research team has not indicated any particular concern in relation to the general intellectual capacity of those examined.</P>

      <P>The current position is that the Road Traffic Act, 1961 prohibits the use of uninsured vehicles in public places. It is also an offence, subject to certain exceptions, not to display an insurance disc on motor vehicles. In addition, the Garda Síochána has the power to request the production of a certificate of insurance and to detain, remove and store uninsured vehicles. The Road Traffic Act, 2002 provides that a fine of up to &euro;2,500 may be imposed by the courts for the offence of using an uninsured vehicle. This offence will attract penalty <Col N="1133" /> points when the new system is fully operational resulting in automatic disqualification for persistent offenders. The courts also have powers of disqualification and imprisonment.</P>
      <P>It appears the Deputy is referring to a device which is used in some other jurisdictions to detect unlicensed vehicles. The use of such a device to detect the use of uninsured vehicles would require an amendment to the Road Traffic Acts. Therefore, I am referring the Deputy's proposal to my colleague, Deputy Seamus Brennan, Minister for Transport, who is responsible for this legislation.</P>

      <P>In July, 2002 the Law Reform Commission published a report on the Indexation of Fines: A Review of Developments, LRC 65 &ndash; 2002. I am at present examining that report in the context of two separate Bills dealing with fines which have been under preparation for some time in my Department, one a proposed Indexation of Fines Bill to provide for the updating and indexation of fines and the other an Enforcement of Fines Bill, the purpose of which is to end imprisonment where practicable for inability to pay fines and to provide for new ways of enforcing fines. Both of those Bills are due for publication next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of recent controversy concerning the appropriateness of the appointment of Ray Burke as a Minister in the last Government, the Taoiseach asked me to examine the file relating to this case and I agreed to do so. The particular file is currently with the Moriarty tribunal. All of the passport for investment files in respect of persons naturalised under the scheme prior to 1997 were sought by the Moriarty tribunal. There was a copy of the file in my Department. However, I also retrieved the original from the tribunal to satisfy myself that the copy file was complete and it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My examination confirms that the file discloses that the 11 passports and naturalisations in question were granted in a manner which was, even by the lax standards that have frequently charac<Col N="1134" /> terised the operation of the scheme in question, irregular and unusual. In short, it appears that the passports and naturalisations in question were effected in a manner which by-passed usual formalities and which ignored failure by the applicants to comply with elementary documentary requirements. It appears that the passports in question were prepared in advance of the completion of the applications for naturalisation and it has been reported that they were handed over to the applicants by the then Taoiseach at a lunch hosted by them in a Dublin hotel.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out in this House before, no departmental file is likely to carry any explicit evidence of gross impropriety or corruption on the part of a Member of Government. Nonetheless in the light of what we now know from the proceedings and reports of intervening tribunals, it would be fair to say that serious questions concerning the role of the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, would be raised in the minds of anyone examining the file with the benefit of hindsight. I am not in a position to supply any explanation from the contents of the file which I have examined for the then Taoiseachs apparent interest in having the case processed with unusual haste. These may be matters on which the Moriarty tribunal may be able to cast useful light.</P>
    <P>The file shows that Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn as Minister for Justice in the context of ongoing controversy concerning the scheme and in the context of a parliamentary question concerning the 11 passports in question was sufficiently concerned by its contents to commission a report by a senior departmental official. Minister Geoghegan-Quinn subsequently drew her concerns about the file to the attention of the then Tánaiste and now Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in November 1994 and at his request furnished him with a memorandum summarising the basis for those concerns. Both she and the Taoiseach resigned their respective offices shortly thereafter although this had nothing to do with this particular case. The inquiry ordered by Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn proceeded under her successor Mrs. Nora Owen. An interim report was completed during Mrs. Owen's term of office. A copy of the interim report subsequently came into the possession of the Irish Times in September 1997, after the Minister had left office.</P>
    <P>When Minister Burke was initially appointed in July 1997, nobody on any side of this House appears to have revisited the passports issue in the context of his suitability for office. Whether this is explained by an assumption that the substantial responsibility rested with Mr. Haughey rather than Mr. Burke or whether the file's contents only resumed importance in the context of the Gogarty allegations I do not know.</P>
    <P>The file in question is now back with the Moriarty tribunal and I can assure the House that my Department will continue to co-operate fully with the tribunal in these and other related matters. I can also confirm that there are no circumstances in which I will recommend to the Government <Col N="1135" /> that we should return to a situation either with or without statute where Irish citizenship can be bartered for economic reasons. If there is an economic case for conferring benefit on investors that benefit as far as I am concerned will have to take a form other than Irish citizenship.</P>

      <P>As my predecessor indicated to the Dáil in an answer to a parliamentary question on 26 March 2002, the commissioner had established a working group to evaluate the use of &ldquo;less than lethal&rdquo; weapons by the Garda Síochána. That group examined and tested various types of weapons. On the basis of their findings, a detailed implementation plan addressing such issues as logistics, procedures and training for specific weapons has been drawn up and the matter was submitted to my Department in July 2002. My Department has reviewed the proposals and I propose to go to Government with my recommendations in the very near future.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have responsibility for the general policy on intoxicating liquor legislation. In my view, I consider it an over-simplification of a complex issue to suggest that later closing times have led to an increase in street violence.</P>
      <P>The question of extended hours possibly leading to an increase in alcohol-related problems was discussed in the Dáil and Seanad debates leading up to enactment of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000. As the Deputy may be aware, a subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights completed a review of liquor licensing in 1998 and made a series of recommendations in relation to various aspects of the licensing code, including longer opening hours. In addition, extensive consultations took place with various interested parties prior to the passage of the 2000 Act at which the issue of extending opening hours was discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" />On the subject of street violence and crime, I should like to refer to the extensive powers of the gardaí under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, to deal with late night drinking and disturbances. In addition, as the Deputy is probably aware, in June last, I reintroduced the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 2002, now on Second Stage in the Dáil. This legislation will, when enacted, give the gardaí significant additional powers in dealing with drunkenness and public disorder. The Commission on Liquor Licensing, which has the task of reviewing the liquor licensing system, dealt with the general question of trading hours in its second interim report published in July last. Their overall conclusion was that since a major reform of licensing hours was introduced as recently as July 2000, it would not be appropriate to make any recommendations for further changes at this stage. Incidentally, the commission said that the issue of trading hours was mentioned in surprisingly few of the submissions which it received as part of its public consultation exercise. The commission said however, that it would return to the issue of trading hours in its final report. I will, of course, carefully consider any recommendations that the commission may make in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>A central focus of this report is on the barriers to reintegration and the need for targeted and coherent mechanisms to ensure that prisoners can be more effectively integrated back into the community. The report's overall conclusion is that what is required are key institutional mechanisms-models to spearhead and ensure effective follow-through on the report's recommendations.</P>
      <P>Priority is being given to developing these mechanisms. A high level co-ordination group on prisoner reintegration has been established, and is chaired by an Assistant Secretary from my Department. This group is composed of senior officials from the Departments and statutory agencies who are identified in the report as having a role to play in progressing its implementation. The group will also be drawing on the expertise of the many community and voluntary groups that have experience of dealing with the issues raised by the report. The group is currently examining the areas for action highlighted in the report and will oversee the implementation of the appropriate recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The elaboration of positive sentence management, as a mechanism for effective integration and co-ordination of all services and programmes <Col N="1137" /> designed to meet the complex and diverse needs of offenders, is a key task for the Prisons Service. Important aspects of this task are the building of alliances and partnerships with the wider community and the development of a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of drug treatment, education, multi-disciplinary programmes &ndash; including offender behaviour programmes &ndash; and a more widely available CONNECT project. The appointment of a director of regimes in the Prisons Service has been an important step in this process and will provide an administrative driver for this task. It is intended to establish, in the very near future, a working group on positive sentence management within the Prisons Service comprising all the relevant agencies and bodies. This working group will be mindful of and take heed of best practice in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>Inter-agency working, the multi-disciplinary team approach and the elaboration of positive sentence management are each concepts with which my Department, the Irish Prisons Service and the probation and welfare service are already fully familiar. The Prisons Services strategy statement 2001 to 2003, which was launched last October, sets forth in some detail the strategic work programme on which the service has already embarked to dovetail these concepts into the daily workings of the service and each individual institution. Indeed many of the actions highlighted by the NESF report had previously been identified by both the Irish Prisons Service and the probation and welfare service, and work on implementing them has been progressing.</P>
    <P>The most noteworthy of these is the homeless offenders strategy team, HOST, a multi-agency accommodation directorate, which has recently been established, with the probation and welfare service as the lead agency and an assistant principal probation and welfare officer as director of the unit. The team has a national remit in relation to both offenders under probation and welfare service supervision in the community as well as those in custody and provides a focus for identifying and redressing pathways into homelessness associated with offending and imprisonment. Dublin City Council has already seconded one staff member to work on a full-time basis with the team. Agreement has also been reached and preparations are at an advanced stage for the secondment of a member of staff from the Irish Prisons Service to work on the initiative. Since its establishment, the strategy team has set about enhancing existing contact and liaison with the voluntary and community sector, in particular with organisations concerned with the provision of accommodation and related supports and services to prisoners and ex-prisoners.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the probation and welfare service already works closely with and provides funding and management assistance to a wide range of voluntary and community organisations in developing and arranging projects and initiatives in the community to address offending and related issues. In the prisons and custodial <Col N="1138" /> institutions, many voluntary and community organisations are facilitated in their ongoing work with offenders through the probation and welfare service and the Irish Prisons Service.</P>
    <P>The report also recommends the increased use of non custodial options, including the expansion of restorative justice projects, subject to evaluation. Restorative justice principles are central to the work of the probation and welfare service and are affirmed in the Children Act, 2001. Planning is under way to implement the Children Act, 2001, and the extended range of non-custodial options to be delivered by the probation and welfare service contained in it. I have also been informed by the probation and welfare service that evaluations have been completed in respect of the victim-offender mediation service in Tallaght and the Nenagh Community Reparation Project. The evaluation reports are presently being considered by the Service.</P>
    <P>In relation to the recommendation on the provision of half way hostels, I would like to advise that Priorswood House has been redeveloped by PACE to provide additional capacity and an improved range of facilities for male ex-prisoners and offenders on supervision by the probation and welfare service. PACE was established in 1969 and works in partnership with the probation and welfare service and their agencies to provide a high quality resettlement service for offenders. In addition to supported accommodation at Priorswood House and training facilities at Santry, PACE, in association with the probation and welfare service, is currently endeavouring to develop a range of accommodation facilities for homeless female ex-prisoners in Dublin city. The probation and welfare service and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul have also put in place a six bed accommodation unit for homeless women leaving prison with an opening date before end of 2002.</P>
    <P>Approval has also been given and funding allocated for research into aspects of homelessness among offenders to be commissioned by the probation and welfare service. It is an overall aim of my Department to provide and maintain a secure, efficient, and progressive system of containment and rehabilitation for offenders. The National Economic and Social Forum report provides a timely and well-researched contribution to the development of this policy aim.</P>

      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998 prohibits discrimination in relation to employment on nine grounds, namely, gender, <Col N="1139" /> marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community. The Act is comprehensive and deals with all areas relevant to employment including access to employment, conditions of employment, remuneration, promotion and vocational training. At present, the Act outlaws discrimination, under the age ground, between employees or prospective employees in the age range 18 to 65, except in the case of vocational training, where the Act applies to persons over the minimum school leaving age and under 65. Sixty-five is the upper age limit under the age ground as it is deemed to be the usual retirement age in Ireland. However, while 65 is the upper age limit under the age ground, there is no age limit under the other eight grounds.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, including the provisions under the age ground, is currently being examined in the context of the implementation of Directive 2000/43/EC (Race Directive) and Directive 2000/78/EC (Framework Employment Directive) which were adopted under Article 13 of the EC Treaty in 2000. The purpose of the framework employment directive is to provide a general framework for the prohibition of discrimination in relation to employment and occupation on grounds of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. The directive allows for differences of treatment on grounds of age where the treatment can be objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim and if the means of achieving the aim are appropriate and necessary.</P>
      <P>The directive must be implemented by 2 December 2003. However, in order to take account of particular conditions, member states may, if necessary, have an additional three years from 2 December 2003, i.e. to 2 December 2006, to implement the provisions of the directive on age and disability discrimination.</P>

    <P>Some public service bodies have exceeded the target. However, it is recognised that there are other bodies that have performed poorly. Under a Government commitment in the PPF, every Department is required to take appropriate action to ensure that agencies under its aegis achieve the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities in the public service at an early date.</P>
    <P>A monitoring committee established and chaired by my Department, continues to monitor and guide progress. It has supported a number of initiatives over the last two years including: approval of a draft code of practice for use <Col N="1142" /> in the public service and exploration of the options for common selection procedures for people with disabilities; raising awareness of the 3% target among, and giving information to, chief executives, personnel officers and disability equality officers in the public service through a series of eight regional seminars, and publication of an information brochure; publication of a brochure designed to encourage people with disabilities to consider a career in the public service and promotion of this at the public sector careers expo in April 2001; commissioned research on the issues and barriers relating to achievement of the target in six public service organisations. This report provides an insight into some of the issues which hinder progress and includes recommendations to assist future progress.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, is responsible for the 3% target of employment of people with disabilities within the Civil Service. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness included a commitment to a review of the employment of people with a disability in the Civil Service to ascertain ongoing adherence to the 3% employment quota. As at December 2001, the percentage of people with a disability in the Civil Service was 2.78%. A table setting out the percentage of people with a disability in each Government Department and office as at December 2001 is attached. The overall percentage has increased slightly since December 2000, when it stood at 2.58%, but the fact that the percentage has dropped below 3% is a cause for concern. The Department of Finance has written to all the heads of Departments and offices to ensure that they are aware of their legal obligations and of the importance of reaching and maintaining the 3% target.</P>
    <P>In light of the commitment in the PPF and in order to establish how to improve adherence to the quota, the Department of Finance, in partnership with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Civil Service Commission, commissioned a study on the career progression of people with a disability in the Irish Civil Service. The research is completed and will be published by December 2002. The research will map out the current arrangements in respect of career progression for people with disabilities, highlight the challenges they face when seeking to progress their careers and make detailed recommendations for a model of best practice in this area for the future.</P>
    <P>All Departments are required to appoint a disability liaison officer to act on behalf of people with disabilities within Departments. In 2001, the Department of Finance established a network of disability liaison officers which meets regularly. A programme of special training for all disability liaison officers and human resource managers in Departments was held in March and April 2002.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are currently aware of a number of premises where lap-dancing takes place. These premises are subjected to ongoing Garda attention to ensure compliance with existing legislation and the Garda authorities have assured me that any allegation of specific criminal activity will be fully investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" />I am further informed by the Garda authorities that existing legislation does not specifically cover lap-dancing clubs. However, the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor in these clubs is controlled by the Licensing Acts, 1833 to 2000 and by the Registration of Clubs Acts, 1904 to 2000. Accordingly, such clubs may apply for a licence to the courts. It is therefore open to the Garda Síochána to enter any licensed premises for the purposes of preventing and detecting the violation of any of the provisions of the licensing laws.</P>
    <P>The EU recently adopted a framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings for the purposes of sexual and labour exploitation. I am at present examining the framework decision in order to identify what legislation will be necessary to enable Ireland to comply with it. I can inform the Deputy that any future proposals I may have in relation to the regulation of such activity will be brought before Government and announced in the usual way.</P>

      <P>Work is proceeding on implementing the Government's decision that the Irish Prisons Service should provide up to 20 places in St. Patrick's Institution for male children under 16 years of age, to address, strictly in the short term, any lack of capacity in special schools for young children under the age of 16 years which are run by the Department of Education and Science. Construction works on the site are ongoing. It is envisaged that the necessary building site and subsequent fit-out works, including lockings, commissioning of safety and monitoring equipment, furniture installation etc. will now be completed by end-January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has accepted from the start that this solution is not ideal, but it is considered necessary as a contingency measure to cover for any shortage in the capacity of special schools run by the Department of Education and Science, which is currently reviewing the adequacy of that capacity. To the extent that the new facility in St. Patrick's is needed, it will operate in accordance with the appropriate national and international standards for residential and custodial care and will comply with the relevant provisions of the Children Act, 2001. Under that Act, detention is to be a measure of last resort. Finally, and contrary to the Deputy's suggestion, the interim board has not submitted advice to me to the effect that the operation of the centre in St. <Col N="1146" /> Patrick's might contravene the Children Act or other legislation.</P>

      <P>The report of the working group on the review and improvement of maternity protection legislation was presented to the social partners on 25 January 2001 and was published on 28 February 2001. The working group's recommendation to extend the periods of maternity leave and additional maternity leave which was announced in budget 2001, has been implemented. The Maternity Protection Act, 1994 was amended by way of order on 8 February 2001.</P>
      <P>The other recommendations of the group will require the drafting of primary legislation and regulations. In this regard, Government approval was obtained on 17 July 2002 for the drafting of a Bill to give effect to the remaining recommendations of the working group. I hope to be in a position to publish the Bill later this year with a view to enactment in 2003.</P>

      <P>A review of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989 which prohibits both actions intended to stir up hatred and actions likely to stir up hatred is currently under way in my Department. This review is being carried out in co-operation with the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism. While progress has been made on the review two developments will have to be taken into account before the review is concluded. On 28 November 2001, the European Commission presented a proposal for a Council framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia. It is intended that the framework decision will replace an existing joint action concerning action to combat racism and xenophobia. Negotiations on the framework decision are progressing. I con<Col N="1147" /> sider it appropriate to await the outcome of these negotiations before finalising the review of our existing legislation. In addition, the Council of Europe established a committee on criminalising acts of a racist or xenophobic nature committed through computer networks. Ireland participated in this committee, which has draw up a draft Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime on this issue.</P>
      <P>The Government has introduced comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation and other measures to combat racism and discrimination and has a number of ongoing measures dealing with racism and racial discrimination, including the national anti-racism awareness programme, the national action plan against racism, the establishment of the Equality Authority and the Director of Equality Investigations, and the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism. In addition, the Garda racial and intercultural office has been set up. Our legislation in this area is one of the most comprehensive anti-discrimination codes in Europe.</P>

The committee had already produced an interim report on the Special Criminal Court in August 2001. As I stated when publishing the report, it is extensive, deals with complex issues of law and policy and involves important considerations concerning the balance to be struck between national and international security on the one hand and civil liberties and individual rights on the other. I am considering the report and will bring proposals to the Government in due course.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputies is set out in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>The current statistics clearly indicate that significant progress continues to be made in relation to the processing of asylum applications and that the increase in processing capacity which has been put in place as part of the Government's asylum strategy is making a real impact on the backlog of cases on hands. This is evidenced by the fact that the number of backlog cases, i.e. cases which are over six months old, on hand in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal as at 30 September 2002 is now down to approximately 1,760 from a figure of approximately 6,500 at the end of September 2001, the vast majority of which are in the final stages of processing. The ORAC is currently scheduling asylum applicants who applied in August 2002 for interview. At the end of September 2002 there were 7,773 cases on hand in the ORAC and RAT, the vast majority of which were received in 2002.</P>

      <P>One of the most reliable indicators of the efficiency and effectiveness of any organisation is its performance in the implementation of strategies for the management of the organisation and its resources. My Department is implementing a range of modernisation strategies aimed at supporting the achievement of the Department's objectives in its policy and operational areas.</P>
      <P>Substantial progress was recorded over the past 18 months in particular in the implementation of strategic planning, performance management and development, a staff training and development programme, financial management, information technology and customer service initiatives. This progress was independently validated under the quality assurance arrangements provided for by the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, leading to qualification by my Department for the 4% final phase, paid earlier this month, under the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am satisfied that my Department is operating efficiently and effectively in line with <Col N="1150" /> the public service as a whole, I recognise the need for continuous improvement in the implementation of strategies for further modernisation of the organisation and the services it provides. Guided by developments at central level, my Department is currently planning the direction and substance of the next phase of modernisation which will be encompassed within the Department's strategy statement for the period 2003-05.</P>
    <P>The new strategy statement is to be prepared by 6 December 2002 under the terms of the Public Service Management Act, 1997. This statement will incorporate the commitments set out in the Agreed Programme for Government which fall due for implementation by my Department. Implementation of the strategies contained in the new statement will be the subject of a twice-yearly formal review of progress which I will be leading. I should add that my Department expects to be in a position early next year to report in respect of 2002 on achievements under the Department's strategy statement for 2001-04.</P>
    <P>In terms of the services provided by my Department, the emphasis has been, and continues to be, firmly on delivering greater efficiency and effectiveness as the Department has rolled out a comprehensive programme of organisation restructuring across the justice and equality sector. In the past three years or so, the Courts Service, the Irish Prisons Service, the new equality/disability and refugee service infrastructures and other bodies have been established with devolved authority and strengthened management structures leading to enhanced service provision.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable expansion over recent years in the area of staff resources and related costs, particularly, though not exclusively, in the asylum and immigration area. The level of these resources is kept under continuous review and, at present my Department is in consultation with the Department of Finance with a view to ensuring that adequate resources are in place to cater for Ireland's 2004 Presidency of the EU in the justice and home affairs and equality areas.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that Garda policy is to put the health and safety of its members as top priority when purchasing vehicles. I am also advised that there are no plans to purchase patrol cars which are in any way modified from the vehicles supplied by the manufacturer as this could further endanger the vehicles' occupants as well as nullifying the vehicles' warranties. Interference with a vehicle's structure or design is not recommended and may cause serious problems with integral structural safety which has been designed into the vehicle to meet certain safety standards.</P>
      <P>The Euro New Car Assessment Programme provides consumers with a realistic and independent assessment of the safety of some of the most popular cars sold in Europe. ENCAP was established in 1997 and is now backed by five European Governments, the EU Commission and motoring and consumer organisations in every EU country. ENCAP has rapidly become a catalyst for encouraging significant safety improvements to new car design. Cars are tested for frontal impact, side impact, pedestrian impact and head protection. Cars are rated and awarded scores for each test. Their overall rating is assessed from the scores &ndash; with cars being awarded a rating of from one to five stars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four vehicles, which have a five star ENCAP rating, have been purchased for use by the Garda Síochána this year for evaluation purposes. Research by the Garda authorities is also continuing into the safety features that are claimed by some manufacturers. The Garda authorities currently operate a fleet of some 89 four-wheel <Col N="1152" /> drive vehicles that are substantially stronger vehicles but are limited in operational situations particularly with regard to manoeuvrability.</P>
    <P>I am further advised by the Garda authorities that the policy of the Garda Síochána is one of continuous research in its assessment of new vehicle purchases, especially having regard to the safety of its members. New vehicles are constantly assessed and all technical staff are familiar with the latest developments in motor vehicle technology, particularly those developments which will enhance the vehicles' safety.</P>

      <P>Operation Hyphen was part of the Garda Síochána's ongoing investigation of illegal immigration into the State as well as the tracing of evaders of deportation orders. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the operation took place in the Dublin metropolitan region on 16 July 2002 and elsewhere in the State on 23 July 2002.</P>
      <P>Some 200 gardaí were involved in the operation in the Dublin metropolitan region and approximately 400 outside the Dublin region for a number of hours. Approximately 294 premises were visited in all. A total of 140 persons were detained. Some 16 were detained for evasion of deportation orders, of which 15 were deported and one was released for medical reasons and will be deported when that is resolved. A total of 74 others were charged with immigration related offences and one sought asylum. The remainder were released without charge on proof of satisfactory identity.</P>
      <P>The persons arrested were treated in the same way as irregular migrants arrested at any other time. It is not possible to report on what exact offence under the immigration laws each person was charged with or what has happened to each since their arrest without the deployment of disproportionate time and resources. However, a substantial number are believed to have left the State voluntarily. Certain others regularised their immigration status in the State.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 155 together. I can inform the Deputy that the grant-in-aid made available to the Legal Aid Board has increased significantly in recent years, up from &euro;7.87 million in 1996 to &euro;17.636 million this year. Sanction for an increase in staff numbers has also been obtained and the staff have been recruited. These additional resources have enabled the board to provide legal services to a greater number of people and also to significantly reduce waiting times for such services. Between December 2000 and September 2002 the number of persons awaiting legal services has reduced by approximately 16% and the waiting time for a first appointment with a solicitor has reduced to three months or less in 17 of the board's 30 law centres.  </P>
      <P>I can also inform the Deputy that over 20% of applications received by the board are treated as priority cases and the people concerned receive an immediate appointment with a solicitor and are not placed on a waiting list. Priority is afforded to cases involving domestic violence, child care cases and cases where there are time limits. I can advise the Deputy that the board continues to closely monitor the operation of its law centre network, including waiting times, with a view to providing an efficient and professional legal service to all of its clients.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 159 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Organised crime is a relatively recent phenomenon in Ireland. Its development has been influenced to a considerable extent by the creation of, and consequent need to supply, an illegal drugs <Col N="1154" /> market. Measures taken by the Government in recent years, such as the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, the Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Act, 1996, the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996 and the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 provide for a modern criminal justice system geared to cope with the challenges posed by organised criminal groups.</P>
    <P>In addition, the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau and other specialised Garda support units such as the national drugs unit, the national immigration unit, the Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation has had a major impact with significant drug seizures, seizures of assets, dismantling of major criminal groups and the imprisonment or departure abroad of a number of major criminals.</P>
    <P>The specialised Garda support units, which operate under the direction of a dedicated assistant commissioner, work closely with and act as an expert resource centre for all sections of the Garda Síochána. These units respond to all aspects of serious and organised crime, including trafficking in illicit drugs and human beings, armed robberies, financial crime, counterfeiting and high-tech crime, including child pornography.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that changes in crime levels, developments in organised crime and public concerns in this regard are monitored on a regular basis. The deployment of Garda resources is also kept under constant review to ensure that an appropriate response is available to meet needs in these areas. The Garda authorities have also informed me, in this regard, that the current Garda strength is adequate to meet these needs.</P>
    <P>I might mention that the total personnel strength of An Garda Síochána (all ranks) for the years ending 31 December 1997 to 31 December 2002 and the personnel strength at present is set out hereunder:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been very significant developments in relation to the provision of child care over the last number of years. In 1997, the Government established the Partnership 2000 Expert Working Group on Child Care, chaired by my Department, with the responsibility to develop a national strategy for the child care sector to meet the needs of society in general. The expert working group made a series of recommendations to Government in February 1999 in relation to the development of quality child care services to meet the increasing demand by parents for child care places. This report forms the basis of the Government's current child care programme in relation to the development of the supply side of child care.</P>
      <P>Child care was identified as a priority area for investment in the National Development Plan 2000 to 2006 and my Department has been given responsibility for the co-ordination of child care service delivery during the period. The equal opportunities child care programme was established by my Department in April 2000 as a seven year programme to increase the number of child care facilities and places, to improve the quality of child care services and to improve the structures for child care. The total funding allocated to my Department for these purposes during the seven year period of the programme is &euro;437 million, including &euro;317.4 million provided under the national development plan, co-funded by the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The equal opportunities child care programme has an equal opportunities and social inclusion perspective and facilitates the further development and expansion of child care facilities to address the needs of men and women in reconciling their child care needs with their participation in employment, training and education. The programme provides capital grant assistance to community and not for profit organisations and to private child care providers to increase the supply <Col N="1156" /> of child care places or enhance the quality of existing places. It offers staffing grants to community based and not for profit organisations which have a focus on disadvantage and offers supports to the national voluntary child care organisations and to other groups which are working to improve the quality of child care.</P>
    <P>Since the availability of funding was formally announced in April 2000, funding of over &euro;132.6 million has been committed to over 1,300 child care projects on the ground, both in the community and private sectors. It is estimated that over 38,900 child care places will be supported by this funding including the creation of over 18,350 new child care places. The funding will also enable many of the services extend their hours of operation and enhance the quality of the child care provided. In addition, funding of over &euro;20 million has been approved for quality improvement projects such as the county child care committees, the national voluntary child care organisations and innovative projects. This brings the total amount allocated under the equal opportunities child care programme to &euro;153.2 million to date.</P>
    <P>In addition, my colleague, the Minister for Finance makes available a number of incentives in relation to child care, such as capital allowances for capital expenditure on the construction, extension and refurbishment of a building, or part of a building &ndash; or the conversion of an existing building &ndash; which is used for the purpose of providing a pre-school service, day care or other child care facility. With regard to the Deputy's comments on the findings of a recent study regarding the use of annual leave by mothers to care for their children when their child care arrangements breakdown, I draw the Deputy's attention to the Parental Leave Act, 1998 which provides an individual and non-transferable entitlement to both parents to 14 weeks unpaid leave to take care of young children, i.e. under five years old, except in some cases of adoption where an older age applies. This leave can be taken as a continuous block, or with the agreement of the employer, broken up over a period. A review of the Act was conducted, in consultation with the social partners, in 2001 and the report of the working group on the review of the Parental Leave Act, 1998 was published in April 2002. In our programme for Government, we have committed to strengthen the parental leave scheme in line with the recommendations of the social partners.</P>
    <P>The Parental Leave Act also provides for limited paid leave &ndash;<i>force majeure</i> leave &ndash; to allow employees, both male and female, deal with family emergencies resulting from illness or injury of an immediate family member. This leave cannot be more than three days in any 12 consecutive months, or five days in any consecutive 36 months.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Parental Leave Act assist working mothers and fathers to combine their work and family responsibilities. The programme <Col N="1157" /> for Government and the progress of my Department's equal opportunities child care programme are confirmation of the Government's commitment to developing and reviewing child care services and to keeping child care at the forefront of its social agenda.  </P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 154, 157 and 163 together.</P>
      <P>The statistics furnished by the Garda Commissioner in relation to headline or serious offences for 2001 are indeed disappointing. Although in the period 1996 to 2000, the figures for recorded indictable crime showed a decrease of approximately 27%, the trend has regrettably altered in 2001 when Garda statistics indicated an overall increase of 18% over the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While these figures, especially in relation to violent assaults, are obviously a cause for concern, they also reflect the targeting of resources and the resultant increased activity on the part of the Garda in addressing this problem. This is confirmed by the detection rate of 75% in the assault category and 87% in the homicide category. I am convinced that this increase underlines the continued need for robust responses to offending behaviour and the need to readily adapt to changing levels and patterns of crime. In addition to the current Garda powers in relation to public order, the Criminal Justice Public Order Bill, 2002 currently before the House will give gardaí significant additional powers to assist them in dealing with drunkenness and disorderly conduct which I think most of us accept are contributing to street crime and violent assaults. The purpose of the Bill is to augment the law so as to <Col N="1158" /> tackle the problem of drink-related late night disturbance and the growing problem of late night street violence which has its origins in or outside licensed premises and fast food outlets. It applies to pubs, off-licences, discos, night clubs, dance venues of all types, amusement arcades, chip shops, take-aways and mobile food vehicles.</P>
    <P>In addition, Garda operations which target such behaviour play a vital role in combating this type of crime. Operation Encounter is focused on all issues of public order occurring in the community. Particular attention is paid to night-clubs, fast food outlets and other venues at which large numbers of people congregate and where there is potential for disorder. The target hours of the operation are determined locally, based on the specific circumstances prevailing at each location. Particular attention is being paid to ensuring that the owners and managers of such premises are fully aware of their responsibilities and of the duty of care they owe to their patrons and other members of the public. Additional resources were made available and each regional commander was asked to draw up their own plans to prioritise the deployment of resources.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to focus on youth crime by supporting and developing evidence-based preventative measures and interventions aimed at young offenders and those most at risk of offending by implementing the outstanding relevant provisions of the Children Act, 2001. I am also committed to continuing to support and strengthen the network of Garda youth diversion projects which increased in number from 12 in 1997 to 64 currently. The continued enforcement of the provisions of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000 relating to the mandatory temporary closure of pubs and off-licences where convictions for allowing under-age drinking have been obtained is also a useful weapon in this issue. This has resulted in 118 closure orders against licence holders up to the end September 2002.</P>
    <P>A major expansion of Garda CCTV systems is currently under way with systems to be installed in the following 17 areas &ndash; Athlone, Ballyfermot, Bray, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Dundalk, Dun Laoghaire, Ennis, Finglas, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Waterford, Sligo and Tallaght. The programme for Government also undertakes to grant aid local communities to provide CCTV systems. A grant aid scheme has already been introduced and grant assistance of up to &euro;100,000 is available from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Agreed Programme for Government provides for a further increase in the strength of the force of 2,000 to be targeted to benefit those areas of greatest need.</P>

      <P>The Government approved the purchase of a second Garda helicopter in November 1998. A tender competition was held and an EC135 was ordered. The EC135 represented a new generation of helicopter technology. It is built to order and delivery time depends on the production line and demand from other customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following construction, the craft was delivered to the UK for the fitting out of specialised police equipment. The fitting out of most of the specialised equipment on the EC135 was subsequently completed and the necessary trials carried out allowing acceptance by the Garda authorities of the craft late last year. In November 2001, the Government approved my predecessor's proposal to contract out the piloting and maintenance of the EC135 for a trial period. The Air Corps had indicated that they would have to contract out the maintenance of this aircraft and it was decided to avail of the opportunity to explore other piloting <Col N="1160" /> and maintenance arrangements with a view to assessing alternatives in terms of such factors as efficiency and cost-effectiveness. An interdepartmental committee was established to oversee and facilitate this task.</P>
    <P>This committee, having considered the various issues, submitted an interim report to my predecessor in which they recommended, for legal reasons, that the EC135 be introduced into service on an interim basis on the State military register while the longer term options were explored. The matter was submitted to Government which approved in April 2002 the placement on an interim basis of the EC135 on the State military register with the Air Corps responsible for the piloting of the craft. The maintenance of the EC135 was again to be outsourced.</P>
    <P>I understand that the placement process which involves the manufacturer providing an audited document trail to the Air Corps is currently at an advanced stage and upon receipt of responses to a small number of outstanding issues, will be finalised shortly. At this stage, the EC135 will be delivered to the State. It is intended that the EC135 will become operational shortly afterwards when all pilot and Garda observer training programmes have been completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The prison service has for a number of years been operating with an ever growing dependence on overtime. In 2001 the cost of overtime was nearly 30% of the overall pay costs for the service. This overtime requirement arises because the level of staff serving is inadequate to meet the 24 hour seven day week needs of the service, based on existing agreed staffing arrangements. In particular it has been necessary to resort to overtime working to cover prisoner escorts, staff leave, staff training, sick absence and staff shortfalls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it has been my stated aim to address the high overtime costs in the prison service. In meetings which I have had with both the management of the Irish Prison Service and with the national officers of the Prison Officers Association, the union which represents the majority of prison staff, I have made it clear that I consider this issue to be a priority for my Department and that I am determined to see it addressed in the short term rather than the long term. At my request, officials of the Irish Prison Service, who have been engaged in a detailed exploration of alternative working arrangements for the management of prisons and places of detention, are putting together a package of pro<Col N="1161" /> posals on a new more efficient staffing system on which to consult the staff side.</P>
    <P>This work is well advanced and has been greatly facilitated by detailed prison by prison recommendations on more efficient prison staffing by an expert management staffing organisation review team, which completed its work last year. Since then, management has engaged in a consultative process with staff representatives with a view to progressing how the SORT recommendations could be implemented. These consultations have reached the stage where management is now in a position to draw together a new staffing framework to implement SORT recommendations and at the same time reverse the service's dependency on overtime working.</P>
    <P>This process is both lengthy and complex but is being afforded a high level of priority by the management of the Irish Prison Service so that realistic proposals for change in the short term can be discussed with staff representatives with a view to significant advances being made early in the new year in reducing and eliminating overtime dependence.</P>

      <P>First of all I can inform the Deputy that I welcome this survey as it adds to our sources of crime data and this, in conjunction with reported crime statistics, gives us a clearer picture of the nature and incidence of crime which concerns members of the public. I am satisfied the findings of the survey in relation to what the general public believe the response to crime reflects the Government's approach in this matter. While I accept that the increase in recorded crime in 2001 as shown in the recent Garda figures is disappointing, I am committed to putting a comprehensive series of measures in place to address the situation. I have outlined these measures in some detail in my response to Question No. 44 of today's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to enhance our knowledge of crime and victimisation, and to inform policy on this matter, the Deputy may be aware that I have obtained Government approval to have a national crime victimisation survey conducted independently at regular intervals from 2004 onwards. I should point out, however, that direct comparisons are not possible between crime surveys and actual recorded crime statistics for a number of reasons, one being that crime surveys may take account of both reported and unre<Col N="1162" /> ported crime, and another that perceptions of safety in such surveys may be influenced by a number of other factors as well as the fear of crime. Another major consideration is that, unlike Garda recorded crime statistics where it is possible to monitor trends over time, crime surveys are a relatively new phenomena in an Irish context which makes comparisons with previous years problematic. Despite the particular statistics which the Deputy quotes from the survey there are a number of more positive findings in the survey: for example, seven out of ten respondents said that they feel safe out walking in their neighbourhood after dark and the vast majority feel secure alone in their homes at night.</P>

      <P>I would like to advise the Deputy that unfortunately some aspects of my address at the Garda graduation ceremony on 4 July 2002, to which he refers, were incorrectly <Col N="1163" /> represented in one of the national newspapers at that time. An official from my Department was subsequently in contact with the relevant newspaper to point out this error. A copy of my address has been lodged in the Oireachtas Library for the information of the House.</P>
      <P>Rather than making any reference to the increasing numbers charged with drug offences, what I actually did was refer to key aims and performance indicators in the national drugs strategy which are indeed to cut off significantly the supply of illegal drugs by increasing the number of drug seizures by 25% by 2004 and by 50% by 2008, using the seizures recorded in 2000 as a base figure. I also said that significant progress was being made in relation to achieving this target in that the estimated street value of drugs seized in 2001 was over &euro;50 million compared to a value of &euro;20 million for the previous year.</P>
      <P>In relation to the principal objectives of public policy on tackling the drugs problem, while such supply reduction actions obviously play a key role, they will to continue to form just one element of the Government's overall strategic approach in addressing this issue. A multi-agency approach has been recognised by Government as providing the best possible framework to deal with the drugs problem. This approach has developed around the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention and education, treatment and rehabilitation and research and information. Central to this approach has been the bringing together of key agencies in a planned and co-ordinated manner to develop a range of appropriate responses to tackle drug misuse.</P>
      <P>The national drugs strategy 2001-08 brings together all elements of this drugs policy into a single framework. It is the result of the most comprehensive analysis and assessment of the drugs problem ever conducted in Ireland. Responsibilities are clearly assigned across Departments and agencies who will implement a series of 100 individual actions across the four pillars.</P>

      <P>Under the national development plan IDA Ireland is fully committed to achieving a target of 50% of all new jobs from greenfield projects over the 2000-06 period, to be located in the Objective One region. IDA Ireland has further committed itself to the task of achieving 50% of all new greenfield jobs in the Objective One region over the 2000-03 period.</P>
      <P>The underlying process of creating new greenfield jobs in the Objective One Region is initiated with first time site visits by overseas investors to the Objective One region. Commencing in 2000, 50% of all first time site visits handled by IDA Ireland have been directed to the Objective One region. Following on from this, the expectation is that 50% of all new greenfield jobs created will be achieved in the Objective One region. Typically, new jobs on the ground come on stream within three to five years of approval. It is understood that the figures of 36,672 and 7,299 referred to in the question are derived from the Forfás employment survey on new job gains, which include, but are not restricted to, new greenfield jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1165" />Substantial progress towards the IDA target has been achieved to date. In 1999, prior to the start of the current NDP, about 25% of all new greenfield jobs were locating in the Objective One region. In 2000 and 2001, this rose to 45% and 42% respectively. Preliminary data for the first half of 2002 indicates that a similar outturn for the year is a good possibility.</P>
    <P>Achievement of this target over the period of the NDP is heavily dependent on a number of factors, which are outside IDA Ireland's control, including the following, the speed of the roll out of infrastructure development in the Objective One region relative to the time scale set out in the new NDP, short to medium-term developments in the world economy which can heavily influence overall international flows of mobile investment.</P>
    <P>Obviously in this context the current poor economic conditions and relatively slow progress on the infrastructure front makes achieving the target particularly difficult. However, despite these difficult conditions on both the global economic and infrastructure fronts, strong progress towards the 50% target is being made, and the share of new greenfield projects going to the Objective One region is substantially higher than was the case prior to the current NDP.</P>

      <i>Note: </i>It is important to recognise the limitations of the figures quoted of notified redundancies. They relate to proposed redundancies not to actual redundancies. Redundancies notified during a month may relate to cases which on examination by the Department are found not to be qualified redundancies. The notifications may not include redundancies arising from lay-off and short-time working and redundancies which are in dispute between employer and employee and which require to be resolved by reference to the Employment Appeals Tribunal. They do not include the following categories of employees &ndash; employees with less than two years eligible service with an employer, employees who are under 16 years of age or employees who have reached the qualifying age for old age pension.</P>
    <P>These monthly figures are normally published on the third or fourth working day of the subsequent month. The figures are made widely available to the media, the social partners, researchers and the Central Statistics Office who publish them in their Statistical Bulletin and post them on their website.

      <P>The agencies under the aegis of my Department are statutorily independent in the exercise of their day to day functions. With the exception of charges applied by the Legal Metrology Service, which are determined with ministerial consent, establishment of charge levels for services provided by the agencies is a matter for the agencies themselves and my Department has no function in the matter. Income for services provided by the agencies is detailed in the published annual reports and accounts of the agencies. In addition, it is reflected in the operating statements of Forfás, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and the National Standards Authority of Ireland as published in the Book of Estimates annually. The revenue from charges related to the Legal Metrology Service of the National Standards Authority of Ireland for the years in question is as follows:<Col N="1168" /></P>

      <P>My Department has arrangements in place at main ports and airports to check compliance with the relevant import requirements as specified under EU and national legislation. These measures constitute an essential control on the importation of animal products from third countries. Products of animal origin may, in the first instance, only be imported into the European Union from countries and from premises which have been approved by the European Commission. The veterinary services in these countries &ndash; and the hygiene and health arrangements in such premises &ndash; are subject to inspection by the EU food and veterinary office. Countries and premises may be removed from the EU approved list by Commission decision in cases where the food and veterinary office is not satisfied that the country or premises is adhering to EU veterinary and public health requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, EU law requires animal based products imported from third countries to be processed through a border inspection post in the first EU member state into which it is introduced and, following clearance, they enter into free circulation within the EU. Such products must be accompanied by appropriate veterinary health certification issued by the authorities in the country from which it is being exported and are subject to identity and documentary checks. A proportion is subjected to physical checks, which may include sampling and analysis for residues of illegal substances etc. In addition, the EU Commission may, from time to time, require <Col N="1172" /> additional checks on particular products from particular countries of origin, where there is any specific cause for concern.</P>
    <P>In so far as labelling is concerned, the products must be marked with a health mark containing the initials of the exporting country and the approval number of the consigning establishment within an oval surround. Additional labelling requirements apply in respect of bovine meat products. Such products must be labelled with a reference number or code identifying the animal or group of animals from which the beef was derived, the name of the third country and the approval number of the slaughterhouse at which the animal or group of animals was slaughtered, the name of the third country and the approval number of the cutting hall at which the carcass or group of carcasses was cut and the name of the third country where the animal was born, reared and slaughtered.</P>
    <P>In response to growing concern relating to food labelling, I have established a group to examine the current labelling framework in the context of consumers' expectations and, in particular, to identify whatever gaps there are either in existing legislation or the manner in which it is implemented.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Clare has been fined 100% penalty on a REP scheme; and if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the likely cause of the 100% fine penalty was that the applicant filled an open drain with stone and pipe in the interest of good farming practice.</Quest>

      <P>In the course of inspections carried out by my Department in October 2000 and January 2001, it was noted that a field boundary on the holding of the person named had been removed. This was a breach of the conditions of REPS and accordingly the specified penalty of 100% was imposed. To offset the penalty, my Department withheld his fourth year REPS payment. The person named appealed the penalty unsuccessfully to my Department's local office and he then appealed it to the national REPS appeals committee. The appeals committee examined the matter and decided that the penalty had been correctly applied and that it should remain in place. The scheme conditions state that any field boundary is a habitat and removal is not permitted. During its deliberations the appeals committee was aware of the specific facts of the case, namely that an open drain forming a boundary between two plots on the holding had been piped and filled. The REPS appeals committee is independent and its decisions represent my Department's final position on any penalty case.</P>

      <P>The Public Service Benchmarking Body was established as an independent body in July 2000 under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness (PPF). It was to examine public service pay and jobs, by comparison with the private sector, and make recommendations thereon. The membership and terms of reference of the body was agreed between the public service employers and the public service unions. The body was asked to have regard to a number of factors in its terms of reference, including recruitment and retention and private sector pay rates. Specifically, it was asked to arrange in-depth and comprehensive research, examination and analysis of pay levels across the private sector. To complete its task, it surveyed widely in both the public and private sector. It collected extensive data on jobs in the public service grades being examined and on jobs in the private sector. It held oral hearings and received written submissions. Based on its consideration of all the factors involved, it issued its report. I am satisfied, given the high quality of the membership of the body and the way it approached its work that the body completed its task in accordance with its term of reference and the findings are soundly based.</P>

      <P>When discussing the Central Bank's reserves, it is important to specify the reserves in question. The official external reserves are principally composed of the foreign currency assets of the Central Bank. The management of these foreign currency assets is subject to any guidelines issued by the ECB under Article 31(3) of the statute of the European system of central banks and of the <Col N="1180" /> European Central Bank to ensure that these operations will not interfere with the monetary and exchange rate policies of the euro area. In the Central Bank's balance sheet, the bank's total assets, including its external reserves, have a counterpart in liabilities. These liabilities include banknotes in circulation, credit institution and Government deposits. However, the bank does have accounting reserves which have been accumulated over the years from income earned by its operations. As of end July 2002, they stood at &euro;1,283 million. The bank also has a revaluation account which reflects unrealised gains from valuation changes. This acts as a contingency provision against currency and other market fluctuations. As of end July 2002, the value of the revaluation account was &euro;825 million.</P>
      <P>The bank's annual profits and retained earnings which were appropriated to reserves for the years 1997 to 2001 are set out below:</P>

    <P>Subject to legal provisions on the distribution of Central Bank profits, the appropriate level of retained earnings and the level of the accounting reserves is a prudential matter for the Central Bank board. Of course, an event such as the changeover to the euro which has a large effect on the financial system gives rise to some consideration of the role and purpose of the accounting reserves. As the Deputy is aware, I took the opportunity late last year to invite the board of the Central Bank to consider whether a portion of its accounting reserves might be made available to the State. In its reply, the board indicated that, when the changeover to the euro was completed, it would conduct a review of the level of accounting reserves. I will examine the results of this review when they become available.</P>

      <P>The Public Service Benchmarking Body was established in July 2000 and reported on 1 July 2002. The main concept underlying the benchmarking exercise was to allow for an orderly, comprehen<Col N="1181" /> sive and independent evaluation of public service pay. The body linked the implementation of the report's recommendations to modernisation in the public service. The public service employers and the public service unions agreed, under the adjustment to the PPF in December 2000, that one quarter of any recommended increases would be paid with effect from 1 December 2001. The body has recommended that the payment of the balance of the increases recommended should be dependent on real outputs from modernisation, change, adaptability and flexibility. In addition, the outputs must be capable of verification. Discussions between the public service employers and the public service unions on the implementation of the recommendations with particular emphasis on the issues of change, modernisation and verification are ongoing on a weekly basis. Given the current negotiations, the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot elaborate further at this stage.</P>

      <P>I understand the question relates to the issue of pensions for women who had to retire from the Civil Service on marriage. The position is that, prior to 31 July 1973, the law required that female employees in the Civil Service had to resign on marriage. In such cases, employees under pension age qualified for marriage gratuities of 1/12th of salary per year of service, subject to a maximum of one year's salary.</P>
      <P>I would point out that, where a person who resigns before pension age subsequently becomes a civil servant, the break in service does not debar the reckoning of the prior service for purposes of any pension benefits for which they subsequently become eligible in respect of the later service. In order to aggregate the periods of service, an appropriate refund must be made in respect of any payment made to them on the occasion of the initial resignation. This would be of benefit to any of the employees affected by the marriage bar who re-entered the Civil Service after 1973.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to change the superannuation Acts to provide pensions for officers who resigned on marriage before 1973. I would point out that any such change would, <i>inter alia</i>, have wide ramifications in relation to employees who left the public service before the introduction of preserved pension entitlements.</P>

      <P>There is a provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling &euro;120 million over the period 2000 to 2006 to tackle disadvantage at third level. In line with a commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, my predecessor, Dr. Michael Woods established the action group on access to third level education to advise on the development of a co-ordinated strategy to increase participation of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability at third level. The action group's report was published in July 2001. To date a number of measures have been taken in response to some of the main recommendations in the report.</P>
      <P>Special rates of maintenance grant &ndash; usually referred to as &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grants &ndash; payable to disadvantaged grant holders were introduced with effect from the 2000-01 academic year. Following a recent review, I increased the annual income threshold for the special rates by 32%, a significant increase. For 2002-03, I also increased the special rate of grant to &euro;4,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and &euro;1,600 for students resident within 15 miles of college. This is equivalent to a &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; of &euro;1,490 and &euro;596, respectively, for eligible students on the ordinary maintenance grant. As a result of the review, it is expected that the number of students qualifying for the &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grant in 2002-03 will double to 7,000 students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was introduced with effect from 2001. The fund provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families. Area Development Management (ADM) Ltd, under whose aegis the partnerships operate, accepted my Department's request that it would administer the fund for the 2001-02 academic year. The total allocation for the 2001-02 academic year was &euro;1.2 million, with 37 partnerships and community groups receiving allocations from the fund. For 2002-03, I have <Col N="1187" /> increased the provision for the fund to &euro;2 million. ADM Ltd, which is continuing to administer the fund, has notified 50 area partnerships and community groups of their allocations in respect of the 2002-03 academic year. Financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund. The objective of the fund is to assist students who might, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered on a discretionary basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Breaking the Cycle pilot project was launched in 1996 and seeks to discriminate positively in favour of primary schools in selected urban and rural areas which have high concentrations of children who are at risk of not reaching their potential in the education system because of their socio-economic backgrounds. A total of 32 designated disadvantaged schools are included in the urban dimension with a targeted programme of teacher and funding supports <Col N="1188" /> being made available. For 120 small-rural schools, shared teacher-co-ordinator supports and funding supports are also made available. It has been found however that Breaking the Cycle, like the disadvantaged areas scheme, does not take account of different levels of need. On this basis, a comprehensive survey of all primary schools was carried out by the Educational Research Centre in 2000, at the request of my Department. The purpose of the survey was to identify the level of concentration in each primary school of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. The survey is the most comprehensive ever of the incidence of educational disadvantage in primary schools in Ireland and it provides a valuable basis for directing resources to the areas of greatest need.</P>
      <P>The survey outcome forms the basis of the new disadvantage programme, Giving Children an Even Break, a major initiative which was launched in January 2001 to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level over a three year period. Under Giving Children an Even Break, my Department's approach is refined to ensure that the individual at risk pupils are targeted. Giving Children an Even Break subsumes the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage. In total, over 2,300 schools are now participating in Giving Children An Even Break, which is a key component of my Department's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children who are at risk of school failure or who are experiencing educational disadvantage. Schools in the programme are in receipt of a range of additional supports including teacher posts and other non-teaching supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>All schools included in the Breaking the Cycle pilot project and those that were previously designated as disadvantaged will retain the resources allocated to them under those programmes and may also qualify for additional resources under Giving Children An Even Break, based on the level of concentration of pupils at risk. Both Breaking the Cycle and Giving Children An Even Break are or will be monitored and subject to independent evaluation to ensure they are addressing the needs of the educationally disadvantaged pupils being targeted and, where modifications are required, the necessary changes will be made to incorporate these.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that I recently established an independent appeals board to adjudicate on appeals from boards of management on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. The appeals board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final. A circular outlining these new procedures has recently been issued to all primary schools and is also available on my Department's website, www.education.ie. The staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the 2002-03 school year was considered recently by the appeals board. I understand that the board of management of the school was notified of the decision of the independent appeals board on 20 September 2002 and my Department has acted in accordance with its recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, under the terms of my Department's higher education grants schemes, vocational education committees' scholarships scheme and free fees initiative a student will not receive grant aid or free fees for a second period of study at the same level, except in the case of second chance students returning after a break of at least five years or in exceptional circumstances such as certified serious illness. Grant aid and free fees may, however, be continued once the equivalent period of time spent on the original course has elapsed.</P>
      <P>However, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees, which applies to approved national certificate and national diploma courses in the institutes of technology, provides that, subject to a maximum duration of four years in all, where students have passed, failed or not completed the first year of a course, they may transfer to a different course and receive a grant for the normal duration of the new course. Equally, the regulations governing the courses to which the grants scheme for trainees applies, extends the free tuition provision to cases where a student has passed, failed or not completed the first year of a course and transfers to a different course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue in question will be considered in the context of the review of student support pro<Col N="1191" /> visions, which my Department is at present carrying out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The release scheme to which the Deputy refers was introduced in the 2000-01 school year to allow release time for principals in primary schools with six or less mainstream class teachers. The release time enables the teaching principal to be released for a specified number of days annually to undertake administrative, leadership and management functions within the school. Substitution cover is paid by my Department in respect of these release days. The employment of the substitute teacher is a matter for the relevant school board of management. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, for the current school year, I have increased by two days the total number of release days available to principals in the different categories of schools. The total number of days now allowable per school year are as follows: School with principal plus five/six teachers &ndash; 22 days; principal plus three/four teachers &ndash; 18 days; principal plus zero/one/two teachers &ndash; 14 days. A circular outlining the details can be viewed on the website of my Department and will be issued to all boards of management in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following list sets out the revenue categories generated by the non-commercial state bodies &ndash; which might fall within the definition of agencies &ndash; under my aegis in situations where the moneys are not included in my Department's appropriations in aid. Revenue categories where Departmental and-or ministerial approval for increases is required are identified in the table, but in these cases the revenue is not earned from charges related to public services, but in most cases arise from fees, permits, licences and industry levies. I also include for information a table listing the subhead items under appropriations in aid, from 2000 to 2002 inclusive, for the Deputy's information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further revenue category, which might be of interest to the Deputy in this context. <Col N="1194" /> Charges at the fishery harbour centres are subject to ministerial approval and, while they are not included in my Department's appropriations-in-aid, the receipts are credited against expenditure under the fishery harbour centres fund. For this reason, while these receipts do fall within the category of charges related to public services, they are not raised by an agency under my aegis.</P>
    <P>Apart from the agencies under my aegis, there are cases in the Departmental commercial state sector where revenue is generated from charges related to public services and included in the relevant company's accounts and therefore not included in my Department's appropriations-in-aid, viz. electricity and gas charges. However, the Commissioner for Energy Regulation, approves any increases in electricity and gas charges. Also in the case of RTE, receipts from TV licences are included in my Department's appropriations in aid and Departmental and-or ministerial approval for increases is required.</P>
    <P>Revenue categories of non-commercial State bodies under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources: BIM &ndash; sales of ice, interest on loans, training fees, trade show charges, laboratory fees, aquaculture grant administration; central and regional fisheries boards &ndash; contracts, including FÁS, <Col N="1195" /> licence fees*, permit fees, fish and gear sales, fishery rates*, dealers licences*; the Loughs Agency (North South Implementation Body FCILC) &ndash; licence and permit fees**, fines and costs recovered; Marine Institute &ndash; research vessel and other contracts; Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board &ndash; fees for licence appeals*; National Council for Forest Research and Development (COFORD) &ndash; publication sales; Commission for Energy Regulation &ndash; levy on electricity industry; Director of Telecommunications Regulation &ndash; telecommunications administration levy, postal administration levy, cable and MMDS and radio communications licensing; National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) &ndash; NORA levy on sales of certain oil products.* The National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) acts as the agent of the Minister in maintaining national emergency oil stocks in accordance with Ireland's international obligations in relation to security of supply. Its activities are funded by a levy on sales of certain oil products which has been held at 0.476 cent (0.375p) per litre since the agency's establishment in 1995.</P>
    <P>*Requires ministerial approval.</P>
    <P>**Require joint approval of Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland.</P>

However, should the Irish Underwater Council, as a national governing body of sport, be in a position to establish and quantify an appropriate level of usage of the chamber specific to sport, it would be open to them to apply for assistance under my Department's sports capital programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of health related support services, including occupational therapy, is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Funding is provided to the health boards to address the waiting lists on a priority basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commitments that the Deputy refers to in the programme for government, which reflect timings set out in the health strategy Quality &amp; Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, relate to the reform of the in-patient and out-patient acute hospital services. It is acknowledged that there are difficulties also with regard to the recruitment and retention of staff in the various therapy grades and consequently this reflects on the length of the waiting list for a range of community based services. In this regard, the health strategy sets out the need to recruit the required staff, including additional staff in the occupational therapy grades. My Department commissioned a report &ndash; Current and Future Supply <Col N="1198" /> and Demand in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates.</P>
    <P>The Bacon Report, which was published in July 2001, concluded that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of therapy professionals over the next 15 years including an increase of more than 150% in occupational therapists. This will require a significant increase in training places with a recommended annual increase of 75 places for occupational therapy.</P>
    <P>To advance this core recommendation of the report, an interagency working group, comprising officials from the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, was established to seek proposals from third level institutions to ensure the rapid provision of the additional therapy training places. On 29 May 2002, the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Michael Woods, announced the provision of 175 extra professional therapy training places for students to tackle the acute shortage of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists in the health service. This initiative almost doubles the number of therapy places available at present and it is expected that the first intake to the extra places for speech and language therapy will commence in the 2003-2004 academic year.</P>
    <P>Other key recommendations of the report include: provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators; the need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; concerted recruitment from overseas; establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a patient-centred health service; career structure, workload, working practices and skills-mix issues encompassed in the context of the report of the expert group on various health professions published in April 2000.</P>
    <P>I understand the Deputy has received correspondence from the Eastern Regional Health Authority in relation to the recruitment of additional therapy staff.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the South-Eastern Health Board is responsible in the first instance <Col N="1199" /> for the provision of child care services in the Waterford area.</P>
      <P>The Children First guidelines and structures as proposed therein have been in place within the Waterford community care area since September 2000. These include regular strategy meetings with the Garda and a local child protection committee made up of representatives of the Garda, education and voluntary sectors. Children First facilitates and encourages other professionals to make direct contact with the health board and social work department in order to follow up on the interests of children presenting with &ldquo;chronic anti-social behaviour and associated parental neglect&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am also aware that Waterford community care is linked with a number of fora within Waterford and is working in a co-operative way with a number of Departments and public authorities within Waterford. These structures include Waterford area partnership social inclusion measure committee, the rapid structure, Waterford City Child Care Committee, Waterford City Development Board, Waterford County Child Care Committee and Waterford County Development Board. A springboard family support project has also been developed within the Ballybeg area, in partnership with the health board, local authorities and voluntary agencies.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the National Children's Office has been tasked by the Cabinet committee on children with co-ordinating the implementation of the Children Act, 2001. A working group, chaired by the National Children's Office and comprising high level representation from my Department and the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science and their respective local level agencies, has been established for this purpose. The question of local level co-ordination and implementation will be addressed by the working group in the context of the national implementation planning process.</P>

      <P>I met representatives of Parents for Justice last night and listened carefully to their concerns about the investigatory process. While they acknowledged that the inquiry chaired by Ms Anne Dunne, SC has dealt sensitively and thoroughly with parents and next of kin who have been called for interview, they expressed concerns about the length of time it is taking for the inquiry to carry out its work. They also believe, based on legal advice that they have received, that the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children may not be able to conduct hearings into the report of the inquiry when it becomes available, as had been envisaged when the inquiry was established.</P>
      <P>I informed the group that I share its concerns in relation to the timeframe for the inquiry; it was expected to conclude in September but it is now clear that the completion of the inquiry is some considerable time off. I indicated to the group that I was prepared to explore possible options for expediting the completion of the report of the inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the referral of the report of the inquiry to the Oireachtas committee, I reiterated <Col N="1203" /> that it has been and remains my intention that the investigation into organ retention issues will have a statutory phase. If it transpires that it is not possible to do so through an Oireachtas committee, I gave a commitment to the group that it would be done through another forum.</P>
    <P>I regret the decision by Parents for Justice to withdraw from the inquiry process at this stage. I am of course available for further discussions with Parents for Justice in relation to this matter.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the manufacture and circulation of Irish coins rests with the Central Bank of Ireland. However, the Central Bank has informed me that as a result of the introduction of the euro, there is now far less nickel in coins in circulation than was the case before the euro entered circulation. Nickel is used in only two of the euro coins &ndash; the &euro;1 and &euro;2 coins. By contrast, nickel was used in the 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, and £1 coins of the Irish currency. This pattern is replicated throughout the euro area. As a result, 92% of euro coins &ndash; in terms of the number of coins in circulation &ndash; are nickel-free as opposed to 25% of the national coins that were in circulation.</P>
      <P>The nickel used in the &euro;1 and &euro;2 coins is essentially contained inside the alloy and not on the surface of the coin, thus limiting skin contact. The Central Bank has also informed me that since the introduction of euro coins into circulation, they have received no reports of nickel-allergy problems arising from the coins.</P>

    <P>Annual costs are estimated to be &euro;2 million in total.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>The development of services at Ennis General Hospital is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board in the first instance. The Mid-Western Health Board has been in touch with my Department in relation to the replacement of these items of equipment. An official from my Department visited the hospital and examined the radiology equipment in the hospital. The replacement of the equipment is under consideration.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
      <Quest>if he will adjust by-laws to allow motorbike users access to bus lanes which would bring Ireland in line with other European countries where bus lanes are open to more environmentally friendly and efficient modes of transport such as motorcycles.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan) Seamus Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of bus lanes in this country is provided for in the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997, the primary purpose of which is to facilitate and promote bus based public transport. These regulations generally limit the use of bus lanes to buses and, in the case of with-flow bus lanes, to cyclists. Having regard to the role of taxis in providing on-street immediate hire services, an exemption to that limitation is allowed in respect of taxis when they are being used in the course of business. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government previously held responsibility in this area and following representations from hackney, limousine and motorcycle interests on the issue of bus lane access, a review of the regulations was undertaken last year by his Department in consultation with An Garda Síochána, the Dublin Transportation Office and Dublin City Council.</P>
      <P>An overriding concern is the carrying capacity of bus lanes and the potential that their primary role to provide bus priority could be undermined if other vehicles are allowed access. Having regard to these circumstances, and having considered the various views expressed on this issue, it was decided on completion of the review that there should be no change in the existing bus lane access provisions.</P>
      <P>I understand that the position in relation to access to bus lanes in the United Kingdom generally reflects the position here and have no proposals at present to amend the existing provisions.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to downgrade or close any part of the railway system nor have I received any recommendation from Iarnród Éireann to do so. My Department is currently overseeing a major strategic review of the Irish railways the primary purpose of which is to provide the Government with a basis for establishing a strategic policy framework for the future development of the rail passenger and rail freight sector in Ireland. Following an extensive nationwide consultation exercise on the terms of reference for the review, my Department received over 150 submissions on rail issues in Ireland. The submissions were the subject of further discussion at public consultation workshops held in Limerick, Dublin and Sligo. I understand that the submissions include proposals relating to the development of a western rail corridor to link Sligo with Galway, Limerick, Cork, Waterford and Rosslare. These, and all the other rail proposals received, are currently being examined as part of the rail review. I expect that the review will be completed by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>A certificate of suitability is required before a small public service licence can be issued for a vehicle irrespective of whether it is a new or used vehicle. The inspection for such a certificate is intended to establish that the vehicle is suitable for use as a small public service vehicle by reference to the requirements of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 2002 in addition to a standard NCT roadworthiness test. The renewal of the small public <Col N="1211" /> service licence in respect of a particular vehicle does not require a further certificate of suitability, however, a standard NCT roadworthiness test is necessary at each renewal date.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of its contract, NCTS is required to carry out a test within 28 days of the date of the making of a request for a test. The company consistently offers test appointments in a shorter timeframe than this. However, in order to provide a responsive service to applicants for suitability inspections, the company provides an appointment for a suitability inspection within two weeks of the making of the request. In urgent cases, such as where a vehicle has been replaced, the company will try to facilitate an inspection in a shorter timeframe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national steering group on deaths in custody agreed to postpone the forum, initially scheduled for later this year, until next spring at the request of the Irish Prisons Service and as part of a course of action by that service to ensure that their expenditure for the year remains within the agreed allocation for 2002, which included an additional &euro;20 million for overtime. The Irish Prisons Service, like all organisations, must operate within its budget and manage its operations accordingly. The national steering group was satisfied that the postponement of the forum would not have any implications for the safety of prisoners with regard to prevention of self-harm.</P>
      <P>Each prison and place of detention operates a local suicide awareness group, which is composed of representatives of the various disciplines in the prison, e.g. management, prison psychology service, probation and welfare service, chaplaincy and staff. These groups meet on a regular basis to review incidents of self harm, including deaths in custody. The groups may make recommendations to the national steering group on deaths in custody who may then disseminate the information to the other suicide awareness groups throughout the prison system.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should be assured that all of the suicide awareness groups in the prison system continue to function as normal and that, quite separate from the annual forum, the national steering group continue to meet as often as is deemed necessary in order to fulfil its role.</P>

      <P>An order entitled the Firearms (Temporary Custody ) Order, 1972 was made by the Minister for Justice on 2 August 1972. The order required all persons residing in the State to surrender to the Garda Síochána all pistols, revolvers and rifles of a calibre in excess of .22 calibre and ammunition for same.</P>
      <P>It was considered necessary in the public interest that the surrendered weapons should continue to remain in Garda custody having regard to the prevailing circumstances.</P>
      <P>The practice that only shotguns, crossbows, unrifled airguns and rifles up to .22 calibre could be licensed, was continued up to 1993. Following a review in that year, the practice was revised so as to allow the licensing of bolt-action rifles up to .270 calibre for deer hunting, culling and competitive target shooting. This remains the position.</P>
      <P>I would also advise the Deputy that in the context of an ongoing review of firearms policy, I have received representations from the National Rifle and Pistol Association of Ireland and that the association has also met with my officials in this regard. The views expressed by the association on the firearms in question and on other matters will be considered in the course of the review.</P>

      <Quest>the representations he has received from a family (details supplied) in County Donegal regarding its con cerns about the inadequacy of the terms of reference of the Morris tribunal; if he will consider asking the Attorney General to discuss with Mr. Justice Morris whether or not he would be willing to agree to a change in the terms of reference along the lines sought; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell) Michael McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations have been received from the family concerned and also from legal representatives acting on their behalf and on behalf of others. A response to their principal concerns was issued by my Department in May and, in addition, I recently met with a member of the family when matters of concern, including the terms of reference, were discussed.</P>
      <P>As regards the terms of reference, it is my view that the terms of reference as adopted by the Houses of the Oireachtas are definite, as required by the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, and comprehensive and are based on the terms of reference recommended by Mr Shane Murphy, S.C. They provide scope for the tribunal to investigate and make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit.</P>
      <P>It is, however, a matter for the tribunal to pursue its inquiries as it sees fit. If, for any reason, the tribunal believes that the existing terms of reference in some way constrain it from inquiring into a related definite matter of public importance, or from making related findings or recommendations, it is open to the tribunal to seek an extension of the terms of reference. In this regard I would refer the Deputy to the judgment of the chairman of the tribunal, the Honourable Mr. Justice Frederick Morris, of 22 July where he indicated that if arguments to extend the terms of reference, based on evidence, are made to the tribunal, it will consider the matter, bearing in mind its responsibilities under the Tribunals of Inquiry Acts. Any request from the tribunal for alteration of the terms of reference would be dealt with in accordance with the terms of the Acts.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 151 together.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Human Rights Commission Acts, 2000 and 2001, appointments to the Human Rights Commission are a matter for the Government. In making appointments to the commission, the Government must have regard to certain statutory criteria relating to the qualifications of potential candidates as well as the need to ensure that the members of the commission broadly reflect the nature of Irish society. These provisions are based on the 1993 Paris Principles and the 1995 UN guidelines relating to national human rights institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1224" />The Human Rights Commission was formally established by Ministerial Order on 25 July 2001. However, the former president of the commission, Mr. Justice Donal Barrington, who was appointed a year before, and the other members of the commission, having accepted offers of appointment in early 2001, had been meeting in an <i>ad hoc</i> capacity to begin their preliminary work. Since its establishment, the commission's principal tasks have been to select a suitable permanent premises, to draw up a work programme, to develop its corporate plan, to recruit its chief executive and to determine its optimum staffing requirements. In that period, the commission has also prepared and published views and submissions on important matters concerning human rights; put in place a system for dealing with complaints as soon as its administrative staff is in place; and, most importantly, it has established a joint committee of representatives with its counterpart in Northern Ireland, as provided for in paragraph 10 of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and in the legislation. That committee is currently considering all aspects related to a charter of rights for the island of Ireland, including the matter of ensuring full public consultation on the content and status of such a charter.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that no impediments have ever existed to the full operation of the commission. The process of establishment has been somewhat slower than expected, but that is due to the amount of preparatory work that had to be done by the commission.</P>

      <P>The 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees and section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, defines a refugee, <i>inter alia</i>, as a person who, owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his or her former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.</P>
      <P>In relation to the issue of gender specific persecution, section 1 of the Refugee Act, as amended, defines &ldquo;membership of a particular social group&rdquo; as including &ldquo;membership of a trade union and also includes membership of a group of persons whose defining characteristic is their belonging to the female or the male sex or having a particular sexual orientation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" />Consideration of individual applications for refugee status based on gender grounds or otherwise is a matter for two independent statutory offices, namely, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner which considers asylum applications at first instance and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which considers applications at appeals stage.</P>

      <P>As a result of the additional prison spaces provided over the last number of years, the Prison Service is now in a position to accommodate almost all those sentenced by the courts for the full duration of their sentences. The overall percentage of sentenced prisoners on temporary release has been reduced from a figure of 19% in 1997 to a current figure of about 9% of the total prison population. It is important to bear in mind that these prisoners on temporary release are either on structured programmes, in many cases under the direct supervision of the probation and welfare service, on compassionate release because of ill health or family related circumstances, or are nearing the end of their sentence.</P>
      <P>Prisoners are not granted early release as a matter of course and I must stress that the overriding concern in considering applications for temporary release from prisoners is the safety of the public. It is also important to note that all releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a regular basis to his or her local Garda station, and that any offender who breaks these conditions may be arrested and returned immediately to prison by the Garda.</P>

      <P>Under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, l962 and the regulations made <Col N="1226" /> under it, free legal aid may be granted, in certain circumstances, for the defence of any person of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court judgment in the 1976 case, State (Healy) v. Donoghue established that an accused person has, in certain circumstances, which are quite wide in practice, a constitutional right to legal aid and is entitled to be informed by the court in which he or she is appearing of his or her possible right to legal aid. In addition, once legal aid has been granted the case cannot proceed unless the accused is legally represented.</P>
      <P>Under the Act, the courts are responsible for the granting of legal aid. An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his or her means are insufficient to enable him or her to pay for legal aid. This is purely a discretionary matter for each court and is not governed by any prescribed financial eligibility guidelines. However, an applicant may be required by the court to complete a statement of means.</P>
      <P>When granting legal aid the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &ldquo;gravity of the charge&rdquo; or &ldquo;exceptional circumstances,&rdquo; it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid. Accordingly, legal aid would not usually be granted for relatively trivial offences. However, it is almost invariably granted to any person charged with an indictable offence whose means are considered by the courts to be insufficient. Where the charge is one of murder or where an appeal is one from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court, legal aid is granted once the court is satisfied that the applicant is a person of insufficient means.</P>
      <P>It is generally recognised the criminal legal aid scheme has served accused persons well who would otherwise have been unable to retain their own legal representation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 158 and 161 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am committed to providing the Garda with the necessary resources to assist it in the fight against crime. In the area of technology, the <Col N="1227" /> resources available to the Garda have been significantly enhanced in recent years and a number of projects are ongoing which will further add to the effectiveness of the force.</P>
    <P>Specifically, the PULSE system is available at 181 locations which include divisional and district headquarters and all major city stations. Under this level of coverage, 85% of all incidents are directly captured and over 75% of Garda personnel have direct access to PULSE systems in their own stations. At the same time, training for the system has been undertaken for members in other stations who also have the means to link up with the PULSE network indirectly. It is generally accepted that major computer systems are extremely expensive. It is considered that the correct balance between cost and availability has been achieved with this level of coverage. However, this is a situation that will be kept under review in the light of advancements in technology, the availability of resources and the overall development of the system.</P>
    <P>The deployment of state of the art technology in An Garda Síochána is a continuous process and there are a number of projects currently under way or recently completed which will add further to Garda resources. For example, work has recently commenced on the development of a fixed charge processing system. From a Garda Síochána perspective, this system will facilitate the full implementation of the provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 2002, and facilitate the introduction of the penalty points systems in the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>In the area of communications systems, Government approval has been obtained for the replacement of the existing Garda radio network with a digital trunked radio system. In that context, a pilot project in currently under way in the Dublin area. The results of this pilot will be used in determining the overall approach to the introduction of a nationwide system.</P>
    <P>Garda closed circuit television schemes, CCTV, as aids to policing, have been introduced in Dublin North Central, Dublin South Central, Tralee and Cork city. Subject to the availability of funds, 17 locations are also set to receive new Garda CCTV systems over the next two years.

    <P>An air support unit, including a fixed wing aircraft and helicopter equipped with the most modern technology, has been introduced. A second helicopter is also being provided and should become operational shortly. This will greatly expand the area of operations of the air support unit. A high speed patrol boat for use by the Garda water unit in policing inland waterways has also been purchased. The boat is equipped <Col N="1228" /> with sophisticated navigational, tactical and communications equipment.</P>
    <P>It is not uncommon that consultants or overseas suppliers are deployed in the development or supply of systems and equipment. The availability of the requisite expertise and the outcome of the public procurement process are determining factors in this regard. In addition, the ever increasing co-operation of An Garda Síochána with police and other agencies overseas is a reflection of the growing international dimension of crime. For example, extradition and mutual assistance functions are used to investigate crimes such as fraud, money laundering and drugs. An Garda Síochána has a number of international liaison officers at Europol, Interpol and other locations throughout the European Union to maximise the assistance provided by overseas agencies. Co-operation with overseas agencies will continue to be an important feature in the investigation of crime and location of missing persons in the future.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that where a person is suspected of driving or being in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant, including a drug, the Garda arranges for a sample of breath, blood or urine to be taken. The local Garda superintendent may then make a request to have the blood or urine sample analysed for drugs by the medical bureau of road safety which has responsibility for the analysis and certification of samples, as this is not capable of being performed at Garda Síochána stations. The bureau is also responsible for advancing research in this area.</P>
      <P>Statistics in relation to prosecutions and convictions are not disaggregated according to the type(s) of intoxicant involved. However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the numbers of samples sent to the medical bureau of road safety for drug analysis during the years 1996 to 2000 are as follows:</P>

    <P>40,000-50,000 miles for bikes up to 550cc</P>

    <P>80,000-100,000 miles for bikes of 1100cc</P>
    <P>The policy of the Garda Síochána &ndash; as laid down by the Garda Commissioner &ndash; is, as far as is possible, to adhere to these limits when replacing the fleet. Average yearly mileage for Garda vehicles is approximately 25,000 miles per annum. This is an overall average and will be lower than this figure for vehicles other than cars.</P>

      <P>No information is available regarding the circumstances of such persons after their deportation. However careful consideration is given beforehand to each individual case in accordance with the provisions of the Immigration Act, 1999. That Act requires that before I make a deportation order in respect of a person I must consider a range of 11 personal circumstances, including the age of the person, the duration of their residence in the State, the family and domestic situation, humanitarian considerations and any representations made by the person or on their behalf. Furthermore, section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 must be considered in every case. This provides for a prohibition of refoulement where it is considered unsafe to return persons.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that the effectiveness of the working methods and procedures employed in missing persons cases are continually reviewed. As a result, substantial changes were made in 1998, such as the introduction of new guidelines and procedures which place a particular emphasis on keeping the families of missing persons informed by a Garda liaison officer who deals with a designated family member.</P>

      <P>My Department and the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children are currently involved in a multi-agency approach to developing responses, including the provision of custodial places, for troubled and troublesome young persons. This work is taking place in the context of the ongoing implementation of the Children Act, 2001.</P>
      <P>The National Children's Office has taken the lead role in relation to co-ordinating the implementation of the Act and has established a working group for this purpose. The group, which includes high level representation from my Department and the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children, meets on a regular basis to review progress in implementing the Act and to bring forward further proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is significant emphasis in the legislation on custodial care being a last resort, the provision of appropriate custodial facilities will continue to be a priority. I have responsibility for the provision of accommodation for young offenders aged between 16 and 21 years. Both St. Patrick's Institution and Shanganagh Castle are specifically designated to cater for this age group <Col N="1233" /> and the majority of inmates under the 18 years of age are detained in these two institutions as well as in Fort Mitchel and Wheatfield Prison. On average, there are generally 90-100 inmates under the age of 18 years detained in the various prisons and places of detention under the administration of the Irish Prison Service.</P>
    <P>Under the Children Act, 2001, however, I will be obliged to provide separate detention facilities for 16 and 17 year old boys and girls who are committed to custody by the courts either on remand or under sentence. I plan to provide a 38 bed unit for male juveniles with full support facilities on a dedicated site adjacent to Cork Prison. At present, a tender competition is being prepared for this facility. I also plan to provide a facility in the Dublin area for 110 juveniles &ndash; 90 male and 20 female. My Department is actively investigating the suitability of several sites in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The Government approved on 17 April 2002 the making available by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of up to 20 places in St. Patrick's Institution for the reception of offenders under 16 years of age. This is a strictly short-term contingency measure to cover for any shortage in the capacity of special schools run by the Department of Education and Science, which is currently reviewing the adequacy of that capacity.</P>
    <P>Construction works on this site are ongoing. It is envisaged that the necessary building site and subsequent fit-out works, including lockings, commissioning of safety and monitoring equipment, furniture installation etc. will now be completed by the end of January.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Contrary to the suggestion contained in the question, I have not ignored this research report. The report was brought to my attention shortly after my recent appointment as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when its principal findings were reported in the media.</P>
      <P>The report was commissioned by my Department in December 1998 following a public tender competition. The successful tenderers were a consortium of three suitably qualified persons with experience in the area of learning disability. They undertook the study in 1999 across 14 prisons with a total survey sample of 264 prisoners. The purpose of the study was to assess the extent of learning disability among the prisoner population. For this purpose, learning disability was defined as being characterised by significantly sub-average intellectual functioning, existing concurrently with related limitations in two or more applicable skill areas i.e. communication, self-care, home living, social skills, community use, self-direction, health and safety, functional academics, leisure and work. This equates broadly with a World Health Organisation definition of mental handicap.</P>
      <P>The first draft of the study report was submitted in August 1999. The main finding of the report was that 28.8% of the sample survey scored &ldquo;in a range suggestive of a learning disability&rdquo;. The draft was the subject of a number of queries by my Department, arising mainly from concerns that the main finding was far out of line with the findings of other prison-based studies and that this divergence was not sufficiently explained in the report. A revised draft of the report was submitted in August 2000 but this did not provide supporting evidence sufficient to dispel continuing reservations about the main finding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say here that my Department's reservations did not in any way question the validity of any test undertaken as part of the research. What was at issue was whether the main finding was solely a measure of learning disability-mental handicap in the prisoner population or whether it measured both learning disability and the prevalence of other conditions, such as educational deficit arising from truancy, lack of educational experience and conduct disorders, as well as specific learning difficulties such as dyslexia. The vocabulary, reading, spelling and arithmetic tests which predominated in the study would have been sensitive to those conditions and there is no evidence that the methodology employed was sufficiently robust to exclude them, such as to measure learning disability only. The authors themselves acknowledge that only a qualified psychologist can ascertain the diagnosis of a learning disability following a full psychological assessment. Accordingly, it would be unwise to extrapolate from this report that more than 28% of the Irish prisoner population are mentally handicapped. Anecdotal evidence of those with <Col N="1235" /> professional experience of working with prisoners would strongly dispute any such suggestion.</P>
    <P>As regards release of the report, as a general principle, I am in favour of publication of all research reports. I am therefore arranging for copies of this report to be placed in the Oireachtas Library and I am assured by the Irish Prison Service that the report will be published on the service's website in the near future. It is open to the authors of the report to pursue independent publication in the professional journals which publish such research.</P>

      <P>The Planning and Development Regulations 2001 introduced a number of changes to provisions governing public notice of planning applications and decisions. In addition, the regulations provide that where a planning authority receives further information and it considers that the information contains significant additional data, the applicant is required to place a notice in an approved newspaper stating that significant further information has been received in relation to the application and that submissions or observations in relation to the further information can be made in writing to the planning authority on payment of the prescribed fee. The planning authority also must give notice to any relevant prescribed bodies and to any other persons or bodies who have already made submissions or observations on the application that such further information has been received.</P>
      <P>As regards decisions on planning applications, the regulations require that the planning authority must also give notice to relevant prescribed bodies and to any other person or body who made a submission or observation on the application. In addition, each planning authority is required to publish a weekly list of planning decisions and to make copies of this list available at the offices of the planning authority. I consider these recent provisions about public notice to be appropriate and I have no proposals, at this stage, to amend or add to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Housing capital allocations to local authorities, including Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, consist of Exchequer capital grants combined with the use of internal capital receipts. These allocations relate to the main local authority housing construction-acquisition programme, the provision of extensions to local authority houses, the undertaking of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing, the undertaking of remedial works to existing local authority housing and the provision of traveller accommodation.</P>
      <P>In 2001 the housing capital allocation to Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council amounted to &euro;20.189 million. Actual expenditure was &euro;15.202 million, or 75.3% of allocation of which Exchequer grants amounted to &euro;10.674 million and the remainder was funded from internal capital receipts. In 2002 the housing capital allocation is &euro;26.6 million of which &euro;21.1 million is to be funded by way of Exchequer grants and &euro;5.5 million from internal capital receipts. Generally, local authorities utilise available capital receipts before drawing on Exchequer funding later in the year. At the end of June, the sum of &euro;3.237 million in Exchequer grants or 12.2% of the Exchequer allocation had been recouped to the council by the Department. Further Exchequer grant payments of &euro;3.460 million and &euro;6.959 million were recouped to the council in July and September respectively.</P>

      <P>The Quilty sewerage scheme which includes Mullagh has been included in my Department's water services investment programme 2002-2004, at an estimated cost of &euro;4.4 million, to commence construction in 2003. In April 2002 my Department approved the briefs received from Clare County Council for the appointment of consultants to prepare contract documents for the collection systems and of a client's representative to produce tender documents for the treatment works for this and a number of other schemes in the county being advanced as a grouped project.</P>

      <P>The management and maintenance of their rented dwellings, including the control of vacant dwellings, is the responsibility of the housing authority concerned. The most recent figures available to my Department from the Clare authorities indicate that at the end of December 2001 there were 36 local authority dwellings vacant in Clare: 25 for less than three months; five for between three and six months and six for more than six months. My Department does not have details of the reasons for the dwellings being vacant. However, I would encourage local authorities to ensure that once a dwelling becomes vacant it is relet as quickly as possible to a household on the waiting list.</P>

      <P>The changes in my Department's responsibilities have not resulted in any significant additional costs being incurred to date. As the Department's name remains the same, the issue of changing stationery or discarding old stationery does not arise. Some ICT costs are likely to arise in the future with the consolidation of payroll, HR and financial systems. Some work will also be undertaken establishing electronic links between the various new locations within my Department. A review of the requirements in these areas is ongoing and accordingly cost estimates in relation to these items are not yet available.</P>

      <Quest>the reason local authority housing applicants whose income is somewhat above the qualification guidelines for shared ownership loans, but below the requirement to purchase a home through a bank or building society, are currently being deleted from the local authority housing lists on income grounds, when it is quite clear that such persons have no hope of housing themselves otherwise and that they are eminently eligible for rehousing under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2002; if he has advice to offer such persons, who in many cases are living in rented accommodation costing more than double normal mortgage repayments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Local authorities are responsible under the Housing Act, 1988, for assessing housing needs in accordance with their scheme of letting priorities. In making this assessment, housing need local authorities have regard, <i>inter alia</i>, to the income and family circumstances of the applicant. Persons who are, in the opinion of the local authority, unable to provide housing from their own resources are eligible for local authority housing.</P>
      <P>The income eligibility criteria and loan limits which apply to the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes have been significantly improved in recent years. While there is no proposal to revise these limits at present, my Department will keep the terms of the schemes under review.</P>

    <P>I have commissioned the National Institute for Regional and Spatial Analysis at NUI, Maynooth to analyse the 2002 population census data to assist me in reviewing the CLÁR areas. The agreed programme for Government contains a commitment to review the census data and con<Col N="1242" /> sider additional areas for inclusion. I expect that the review will be completed by the end of 2002 and the outcome will be made available to Dáil Éireann. The amount of CLÁR direct funding committed to date by my Department to the CLÁR areas in County Kerry is &euro;1.27 million. This has attracted additional expenditure through matching funding from various sources.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department funds the work of the fourteen local drugs task forces, LDTF, including Tallaght local drugs task force. These task forces, which were established in 1997, operate in the areas experiencing the highest levels of opiate misuse in Dublin, Cork and Bray. Each LDTF comprises a partnership between the statutory, voluntary and community sectors. In this way, the community and voluntary sectors input directly into shaping drug service provision in their local areas. The task forces draft local action plans for their areas and most, including Tallaght, are currently implementing their second round of plans.</P>
      <P>To date, the Government has allocated more than &euro;51 million to implement the plans of all of the local drugs task forces. In addition, more than &euro;11 million has been allocated through the special premises initiative to meet the accommodation needs of community-based drugs projects. The plans fund a range of projects run by community and voluntary organisations in areas such as treatment, rehabilitation, awareness, prevention and education. In this regard, Tallaght local drugs task force has been allocated more than &euro;5.2 million, in respect of both of their action plans and funding under the premises initiative.</P>
      <P>In addition, funding of just under &euro;2.8 million has been allocated to projects in the Tallaght LDTF area under the young peoples facilities and services fund. This fund assists in the development of preventative strategies through the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities and services, in areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.</P>
      <P>All of these allocations are taking place in the context of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008. The strategy, which my Department co-ordinates, is an eight-year policy framework that brings together all the elements of drugs policy in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The funding scheme to support federations and networks in development of the community and voluntary sector is one of a number of measures introduced by the White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity.</P>
      <P>The scheme attracted 152 applications which required detailed examination and assessment which was carried out with the assistance of the White Paper's implementation and advisory group. The group which consists of both statutory and voluntary representatives is tasked with advising on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the White Paper. The assessment stage of the process is largely complete; however, a small number of administrative matters remain which must be addressed before my Department can bring the scheme to a conclusion. Every effort is being made to ensure that these matters will be finalised shortly.</P>

Thus the projected total of &euro;64,482,000 for 2002 does not bear comparison with the previous two years, given the impact of the charges in departmental functions on the appropriation-in-aid.</P>

      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards. The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. Certain people on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance. The scheme operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year.</P>
      <P>Under this year's scheme an allowance of &euro;80 is payable in respect of qualified children from two to 11 years and an allowance of &euro;120 is payable in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years. I am aware of the issues which arise for low income households faced with providing clothing and footwear for children at back-to-school time in September each year.</P>
      <P>In that regard, in Budget 2002 the income limit disregard for the back-to-school allowance was increased from £5 (&euro;6.35) to &euro;50 to the benefit of an estimated 8,000 children this year. In addition the rate of the allowance payable in respect of qualified children of 12 years and more was increased from &euro;99.04 to &euro;120. These improvements came into effect in June 2002 in time for this year's scheme.</P>
      <P>A working group is in the process of finalising a review of the back to school clothing and footwear scheme as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review examined all aspects of the scheme including the rates of payment as well the income limits, the means test, time of payment, the eligibility criteria and other issues. The report will be published in the new year.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy is a clerical officer who is currently on a career break from the Sligo offices of my Department. He has indicated that he wishes to return to work now that his 12 month career break finished at the beginning of October 2002.</P>
      <P>The conditions under which civil servants avail of career breaks stipulate that a person wishing to return to work at the end of their career break can only be facilitated where there is a fillable vacancy in their location. However, the conditions do provide a guarantee of re-employment within twelve months of the expiry of the career break.</P>
      <P>In this instance, there are currently no fillable vacancies in the Sligo offices of my Department to which the person concerned can be assigned. As an interim measure, he has been offered an alternative assignment to Dublin while awaiting placement in Sligo but has declined this offer.</P>
      <P>A person whose career break has expired, may be entitled to unemployment payments for the period from the date of the expiry of the career break to the date on which they are requested to report for duty, provided they have indicated that they are available and willing to return to work. The overall position is that while some delay in returning to duty following career break may be expected in all cases where officers wish to resume duty, the Department tries to minimise the waiting period to the greatest degree possible.</P>

      <P>In order to avoid incurring additional costs, the steps necessary to give effect to the change of name of the Department are being taken on a progressive basis. Accordingly, as existing stocks of forms, etc. are depleted, they are being replaced by stocks bearing the new name. Similarly, other aspects of the change of name &ndash; such as change of signage &ndash; will be implemented as opportunities arise. Therefore, it is not anticipated that the name change will result in additional costs arising for the Department.</P>
