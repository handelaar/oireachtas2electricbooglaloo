    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a matter that affects the responsibilities of every Member of the House because we can all to some extent share in the blame for the death of a mother of six young children. Susan Maher, God rest her soul, was killed last Monday while travelling home to Kilkenny. I extend my sympathies to her family.</P>
      <P>Susan Maher rose every morning at 4.30 to drive to Dublin, returning home at 9.30 p.m. She had to do so because of the lack of speech therapy facilities for her child. The failure to deliver such a service shames us all. The Minister for Finance is today in a position to do something about this. Last year the former Minister for Education and Science waved a blank cheque, yet health boards are refusing to hire private therapists. It means that parents of children like Bobby Maher are being forced to drive huge distances to have their rights vindicated and to avail of facilities. In the context of the Constitution, under which we all operate, this failure diminishes the responsibility and the capacity of the House to do its job.</P>
      <P>The budget is to be announced today and the Government is in a position to narrow the gap between the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and the &ldquo;have nots&rdquo;. In view of this, I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to ensure that an attempt is made to vindicate these rights and to provide the necessary facilities to those concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Kenny in extending our sympathy to the family and extended family in Kilkenny of Susan Maher following her tragic death. It took several hours to cut her son Bobby from the wreckage of the car after it went into a drain late at night on a dark road in Kilkenny. We all hope he will recover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from reports that Susan Maher left home between 4.30 a.m. and 5 a.m. to drive to Dublin. In addition to looking after her other children she was anxious that Bobby would be able to avail of speech therapy. She was killed near home on a road she knew well. After a long day it is suggested that she fell asleep at the wheel. That is understandable for a woman who <Col N="1182" /> pushed herself to the limit. I understand she was travelling to a party of one of her children and was then to have collected her husband. All in the House extend our sympathy to her family.</P>
    <P>The shortage of paramedical staff is not confined to the Carlow-Kilkenny region. Many people throughout the country drive long distances on a daily basis to the national service centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway. It is a hard task and it is why, over the past five years, we have provided big increases in funding to hospitals and services throughout the country. Many hospitals are under construction.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, announced the provision of extra therapy training places for students in Cork, Galway and Limerick to tackle what has been an acute shortage of speech and occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The Estimates for this year provide more than &euro;650 million extra for health services, but unfortunately, in this case a speech and language therapy service was not available.</P>
    <P>The Government has identified the shortages and has created additional places in the colleges in an attempt to provide more services on a regional basis. I hope those students attending courses in speech and language therapy at University College Cork, the National University of Ireland Galway and the University of Limerick will improve the services available. That does not detract from the tragic death of Susan Maher.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This tragedy highlights and underlines the difficulty to which the Taoiseach alluded. Prior to June of this year, 75 places were promised to start in September. Twenty five of those places were between UCC and NUI, Galway, and 50 postgraduate places for speech therapy and special language teachers in the University of Limerick. These courses have not yet commenced and this makes a mockery of Government commitments. Arising from the tragic and unfortunate case of Susan Maher, will the Taoiseach and, in particular, the Minister for Education and Science, give an assurance that this commitment will be honoured and that these places will be available as soon as possible? In so far as is attainable will the Minister for Finance, even at this late hour, adjust his statement to make some effort to deal with the rights of parents of disabled children and those with special needs? These difficulties are of grievous concern to parents. Yesterday was the international day of the disabled and I ask the Taoiseach to recognise that and the difficulties faced by parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The shortage of speech and language therapy services has been a difficulty for some time. The Mater Hospital is my local hospital and until recently there was only one speech therapist for its enormous catchment area. That situation has changed because the health boards and the Department of Health and Chil<Col N="1183" /> dren have been involved in a number of recruitment initiatives including sponsorship of an overseas recruitment policy. For the past five years overseas recruitment has been filling these posts.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny is correct. Our initiative introduced earlier this year doubled the number of therapy places available. It was expected that the intake for language therapy studies would have commenced in September or October at the start of the academic year. For whatever reason and it was not because of a lack of resources, that did not happen. I do not wish to participate in a blame game but it has not proved possible and it is now expected that the courses in Cork, Galway and Limerick will start in the academic year of 2003-04. My information is that the Galway and Cork courses will commence then and the Limerick course may have already started. This area has been recognised by the Government, the resources are available and we have put an action plan in place. There will be more students and we have also recruited significant numbers from abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach explain the emergence yesterday of a list of 400 primary schools that are awaiting refurbishment which have been put on the back burner as a result of the Government cuts? Does the Taoiseach recall that last April a list was published after considerable pressure and controversy in the House about the run-down condition of many schools? The list was published on the website of the Department of Education and Science. The impression that these schools would be dealt with was added to by the hawking around constituencies by Government candidates, Fianna Fáil Deputies and Ministers on many occasions, of letters which promised that local schools were on the list and that it would be all right on the night. Several Ministers were quoted as saying that the cheque was in the post. Now it emerges that there is no truth in this, that only a small number of schools have been progressed, that several schools on the INTO black list are not being attended to&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that several schools that are deemed unfit by the teachers' unions are not on the list? Is this not a blatant departure by the Government from the impression given inside and outside this House? Schools, some deemed unsafe by the Health and Safety Authority, which are run down and generally neglected for years, were used as a blatant political issue. In my constituency, Fianna Fáil party candidates put letters into every house saying that X and Y schools had been approved. It was a lie because they were not approved but that was the impression given.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1186" />Is it not the case that there is blatant queue-jumping going on? The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday as saying some of the schools are on the list only as a result of political pressure. Why is there not a plan for the renovation of primary schools? Why can a school principal or a board of management not find out when they will be on the list if they are not on it this year, as they manifestly are not? Why is there not a five year plan to refurbish primary schools some of which are in poor condition while others are advantaged because there is a Minister in the constituency? I see the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is laughing again this morning. This is the first Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who has put the Belvedere boys off the streets. It is not safe to go on to the streets to collect money because of conditions on the streets.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Serious efforts are being made to try to deal with the problem. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is setting out a five year plan, which fully complies with what Deputy Rabbitte asked, where all projects at all levels and at whatever stage will be set out in detail on the Department's website. People will be able to see exactly at what stage a project is and then perhaps Deputies will stop raising the issue on the Adjournment and tabling parliamentary questions because it will be clear.</P>

      <P>That is what the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is trying to do. It will mean Deputies opposite will have to stop saying they convinced the Minister to do something and stop circulating his replies. That is what they have been doing for the past five years. We have spent &euro;175 million and Deputies opposite have been trying to claim the credit for it but they spent nothing when in Government. Let us be honest, that is what they are upset about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On this, budget day, when there will be much talk of prudent management of resources, does the Taoiseach agree the biggest potential for generating wealth in terms of food and power, both wind and wave power, is the marine environment? In that regard and in light of the heart-rending photographs of death and despair in Galicia, has the Taoiseach had time to reflect on the potential for catastrophe if one of the many substandard bulk oil or chemical carriers, like the <i>Prestige,</i> were to break up off the Irish coast? Does he agree the Government is playing fast and loose with maritime safety as highlighted in a report in today's newspapers exposing our failure to inspect even the required 25% of non-Irish registered ships coming into Irish ports? Will the Taoiseach express a view on whether the Irish Government should be before the European Court of Justice on this matter, as is the case? </P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree it is criminally negligent of the Government to fail to implement its own report, the emergency towing vessels study of 1999, which has some basic recommendations such as the purchase of ocean going tug boats to deal with a ship in distress as the <i>Prestige </i>was? Will he act decisively? If we are serious about prudent management of our resources we must do that much, which is minimal in the context of the overall budget, and put in place the necessary safeguards to protect the marine environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Under European Union rules we are obliged to inspect 25% of boats or ships in the fleet in Irish ports. This year we recruited ten additional marine surveyors and professionals who are registered to do this work. So far, we have inspected 364 ships and boats which is well over our target. We hope to inspect 400 ships in the coming year which is well in excess of our target. We are supportive of any moves at EU level to help to improve safety at sea and standards for shipping.</P>
      <P>Our new marine vessel, which has been adapted for towing capacity, will be with us before Christmas, according to the Minister. Our record in this area is good. With our new marine surveyors and professionals, who are registered to do this work, and with our marine vessel and its capabilities, we should be able to substantially improve our position. It is an area in which we must continue to maximise the effort and that is the intention of both the Minister and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I could believe the Taoiseach when he said trying to maximise the effort. The maritime vessel to which he refers is not designed to pull the tankers about which I am talking. I am talking about the recommendations in the Government's report, the towing vessels study, and about implementing those recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" />Is the Taoiseach missing the wider point in relation to the potential of the marine environment in terms of the resources of this country? For example, will he take on board the plea from the renewal energy sector for the provision of transmission lines for off-shore wind farms which have been provided to the petroleum and gas companies which are able to get lines, subsidised by the taxpayers, to various parts of the country? The wind energy sector is not able to get that type of subsidy. Will the Taoiseach redress the balance and start to look at our resources and reduce the dependence on these accident prone oil tankers by using our own resources?</P>

      <P>It is obvious that Deputy Gormley knows as little about this area as he does about most others. The vessel has been adapted and can hold vessels in place. As regards wind farm initiatives, as I said last week to <Col N="1189" /> Deputy Sargent, the Department is supportive of wind energy issues. Some understanding of infrastructural costs is required and, as the Deputy said, lines cannot be placed unless there is a subsidy. This year the Danes decreased their figures, which were the highest in Europe, because of costs. I agree with the Deputy's general view on this and I think he agrees with mine that if we are to increase our figures substantially, which we should, it should be off-shore. To do that would require a cost base and giving incentives to the private sector could help in that regard. The advantage of an interconnector, ultimately, would be that it would not only be used for its capacity in this country but also for storage, which is crucial. I support the recent report published in this area, as does the Minister, and his staff are trying to find a solution to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 26, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that roundtable talks, co-chaired by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Cowen, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Paul Murphy, were convened in Stormont on Thursday, 21 November. Both Governments felt it was important to get all of those who subscribed to the Agreement around the table in order to address the key issues of confidence and trust in an open, constructive and collective way. An encouraging start was made at the talks. There was complete agreement that the Good Friday Agreement remained the template for political progress. It was also agreed that we needed to fast-forward progress in all the outstanding areas.</P>
      <P>At the round table meeting which took place on Thursday, 28 November in Belfast there were further discussions on identifying those issues which the parties believed were most important in order to restore the institutions. The agenda is the full implementation of the Agreement. Over the coming weeks, the parties and the two Governments will be having a series of meetings, in different formats, and following these meetings we will have a further round table meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to focus on the big prize &ndash; a normal society in Northern Ireland free of all paramilitary activity with stable political institutions in which everyone has the opportunity to participate. We need to ensure that everyone has the confidence that this can be achieved and we need to create the collective will in the talks to ensure that it is achieved. While the approach to addressing the outstanding issues should be both collective and comprehensive, it need not be lengthy. I believe that it should be possible to make suf<Col N="1192" /> ficient progress to resolve the current difficulties and restore the Northern Ireland institutions in sufficient time for the scheduled assembly elections on 1 May 2003. That is the goal but obviously it requires a sustained effort by everybody to ensure that we bring this about.</P>
    <P>I met Prime Minister Blair on Saturday, 30 November. We had a general stocktake of the current situation, following the recent round of meetings with the parties. We need to maintain the momentum in the process in order to ensure that we can make sufficient progress to allow for the return of devolved Government as soon as possible in the new year. The two Governments will be maintaining the closest possible contact and be continuing our joint efforts in the period ahead. I have arranged for a copy of my address to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation to be placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The fourth summit meeting of the British-Irish Council was held in New Lanark, Scotland on Friday, 22 November. The meeting was chaired by the First Minister of Scotland, Jack McConnell. I was accompanied at the meeting by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Coughlan, and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Tom Parlon. The council noted with regret the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive and looked forward to the restoration of the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland as soon as possible in advance of the scheduled elections.</P>
    <P>The main focus of the meeting was the issue of social inclusion and, in particular, financial inclusion, on which the Scottish Executive and the Welsh Assembly Government take the lead within the British-Irish Council. The council recognised that the problems of social and financial exclusion affect communities throughout all British-Irish Council administrations and the meeting highlighted the range of strategies that members are working on to combat these problems. Members reiterated their commitment to promoting social inclusion across the member administrations of the council and the council agreed a framework for taking forward work in this important area.</P>
    <P>Following the discussion on social inclusion, the council was updated on work being undertaken in other British-Irish Council areas by relevant administrations. I met with Ambassador Haass on Thursday 21 November, when we reviewed recent developments. Ambassador Haass reiterated his commitment and the commitment of President Bush to the process. I welcome the ambassador's continuing interest and engagement with all the relevant parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The British Prime Minister has described his involvement in the Good Friday Agreement as the most important milestone in his political career, and I am sure we can all share that sentiment in seeking to have the Agreement implemented in full. The Taoiseach met with Prime Minister Blair in private for two hours last <Col N="1193" /> week. Did the Taoiseach discuss with the Prime Minister the outstanding issues that were raised by many speakers at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, namely demilitarisation, decommissioning and policing? Is the Taoiseach confident that these strands can be drawn together in time for the assembly to be reconstituted and the elections to be held? What does the Taoiseach think of the suggestion of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland's suggestion that former paramilitary prisoners might be allowed to serve on local policing boards? Does the Taoiseach agree with that? Does he believe this should help Sinn Féin in particular to participate in the policing boards? Has he discussed the possible consequence of a boycott from some members of the Unionist political parties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the two round table sessions which the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, co-chaired on our behalf, as well as the meeting of the British-Irish Council and the first meeting for some time of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, I was able last Saturday to update Prime Minister on what we had been doing. He did likewise from his perspective. I was able to give him a good flavour of what had happened and what was stated by all the party leaders. I appreciate the constructive things that were said last week at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
      <P>Making progress on policing has never been more important. We need to have representation from all communities on the policing board. Participation by Sinn Féin on the policing board would be significant in marking the transition of the republican movement to peaceful and democratic means. We have stated that since Weston Park. We tried long and hard on this issue at Weston Park, particularly the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, who chaired the meetings on that occasion. He did all he could to convince everybody to join the policing board. We were successful to a certain extent and made progress but we are continuing to try to complete that job. That is what we are engaged in now.</P>
      <P>The aim of the Irish Government is to have a policing service that is inclusive and fully representative. The coming months are absolutely vital in this respect. We hope that through the new legislation, which we welcome, and the evolution of policing in general in Northern Ireland, that the circumstances will come about that will allow Sinn Féin to take its place on the policing board and to support the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft policing clauses published on 25 November are an important element in moving forward on the outstanding issues. They form a basis for discussion, following which the British Government intends to publish a draft Bill. I have no doubt that the discussions will continue over that. There are certainly still over 20, and perhaps 30, outstanding issues of all kinds that focus upon policing. Many of them are important and many <Col N="1194" /> of them are ones on which we can still find ways of making progress. We will endeavour to do all we can to achieve success on the policing issue because it is so important.</P>
    <P>It will affect how we deal with the problems of interface violence. Even in the past week or two we have had a considerable amount of rioting in interface areas. One such problem the Sunday before last went on for five or six hours. It was perhaps not that serious but the fact that this is happening in November is serious as far as I am concerned. If we are ever to get to the end of all these difficulties we have to have a policing service that is representative of all communities and ensure there is trust and confidence and that the police service can do its job. We are hopefully on the way to achieving that but we are not there yet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask a question on a slightly different vein. The Taoiseach will understand that I have to leave shortly. The Taoiseach met with the First Minister of Scotland, Mr. McConnell, to discuss the Scottish-Irish bid for the European Championships in 2008. Did the Taoiseach inform the First Minister that the GAA will not be in a position to make a decision about the availability of Croke Park until next year? How is that problem going to be resolved if the decision is to be made in respect of the championships before then? Given that the Gaelic Athletic Association has always been an organisation that does not like to be shoved in a particular direction but likes to make its own decisions in its own way, did the Taoiseach inform the First Minister of that issue? Is he aware of the implications of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is clear, if not totally satisfactory. In fairness, it was clear when the UEFA representatives were here many months ago. The GAA has its rules and procedures and it is going to follow them. I accept that. That is its right. The current president and the incoming president have also made their positions clear in terms of their work towards a certain resolution under their rules. That is helpful. UEFA and our Scottish colleagues understand that, as do we. It would be good if it was ready, but it will not be. UEFA, the Irish representatives and the Scottish representatives dealing with this are clear about that. We have answered on this.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny and other Members will appreciate that as we approach the meeting to be held on 12 December there are many issues to clarify in respect of where the grounds will be. I am confident that the Irish bid will be successful. If it is, I have no doubt that in 2008 some of the games will be played in Croke Park. I have no doubt that will be the ultimate position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of completing the written questionnaire, we cannot include Croke Park. Everyone understands the rules. Representatives of UEFA have seen all the stadiums &ndash; I have seen a good <Col N="1195" /> few in my day &ndash; and they believe Croke Park is the finest one they have seen on their travels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach see the stories that appeared in a number of British newspapers at the weekend, on Saturday in particular, to the effect that the Provisional IRA is contemplating a real, total and permanent renunciation of violence and that it is likely there will be an announcement accompanied by a definite act of decommissioning? Does the Taoiseach consider those stories are accurate? Can I take it he is the source of the stories in question, that they arise from a briefing he gave to the lobby correspondents in London?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the intentions of the IRA. For devolved government to be restored, everyone knows it must be clear that the transition from violence to exclusively peaceful means is unambiguous and definite. The two Governments reiterated this in our joint statement of 14 October. I have outlined that at great length in my reply today, in reply to questions on 20 November and in several interviews since then. We need to restore confidence on all sides. We want the institutions restored as soon as possible, certainly in advance of the scheduled elections.</P>
      <P>I talked to British journalists last week, as I normally do in such instances. I am not the only source of their information and they speculate on different issues. I said that I believed the Sinn Féin leadership is committed to the process. As always with the British senior press, I have to argue that case. I find myself in the position of arguing the credibility of the Sinn Féin leadership because in these discussions its bona fides are usually questioned. That is probably done to test where I stand as much as anything else. I stated strongly that I believe it is committed to the process of ensuring that devolved government is restored as soon as possible. I have no doubt Sinn Féin also understands that action must be taken to ensure the republican movement completes its transition to democracy. It is not an easy job to bring that about, and I understand that too. The Irish Government's position is to help Sinn Féin to do that. We have been helping it for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasised last week, as I always do, that the process must be brought on track to ensure the Agreement is implemented fully. I quoted to the media many examples where Mr. Adams, the president of Sinn Féin, and Mr. Martin McGuinness, chief negotiator of Sinn Féin, have spoken recently on public record of the efforts they are making to try to bring around devolved government and to restore the institutions while being highly critical of the fact that they were dissolved in the first place. I am not responsible for any further interpretations. I support the efforts of Gerry Adams and others &ndash; I think Deputy Rabbitte last week gave them credit for their con<Col N="1196" /> siderable effort &ndash; and we in the Irish Government, particularly the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and I, will do all we can, as the two people directly responsible, to assist them in what is not an easy task for them.</P>

      <P>I can appreciate that there may be a number of different considerations in the mind of the Taoiseach relating to this delicate matter. I can also appreciate that he would feel it necessary to convince British journalists of certain developments at the moment in the process. How does he react to the denial by Martin McGuinness of any validity in the matters reported? The Taoiseach said that he felt it incumbent on him to advocate the credibility of Sinn Féin's sincerity in these matters, but within hours Martin McGuinness had made a refutation. What does the Taoiseach say to that?  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear what Mr. Martin McGuinness said, but I saw some quotations. I think he was responding to at least one of the headlines, which I also saw, that an IRA announcement was imminent, that the IRA was going to close its dumps, give up its arms and make some other gestures. That is sheer speculation. I do not think any of those things would be known to me or to Martin McGuinness. I would like to think that ultimately some of these things might be true, but they are mere speculation.</P>
      <P>Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Féin, in an address to the Presbyterian congregation the other night made it clear, as I read and interpreted it, that they are committed to working with others to try to bring an end to paramilitarism. They are on the record as saying several times that they see that also as bringing an end to the IRA, its activities, that they will work to bring a peaceful resolution to all these matters and that the Sinn Féin organisation will continue to develop and expand. That is their political agenda. I have been dealing with this process long enough to know the difficulties in trying to do all these things, to bring an end to paramilitarism. We are not only talking about the IRA, we are talking about all the parmilitaries. As we approach the end of this year, the figures show that most of the violence this year had nothing to do with the IRA; it was overwhelmingly Loyalist.</P>
      <P>If we are to get to where we want to go &ndash; there is no dodging this &ndash; if we want to get devolved government restored and move from violence to exclusively political means, there must be an unambiguous and definitive conclusion in that regard. We must get an end to paramilitarism, paramilitary activities and all that is centred around them. That is the challenge for us. I cannot see us being able to achieve the goal facing us over the coming months if we do not secure that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having discussed the matter with the Prime Minister Mr. Blair last week, even if I was to <Col N="1197" /> agree, I do not think I would get him to agree or get the British Government to move. That is the reality. All the issues on all sides &ndash; not only the one or two I mentioned this morning &ndash; must be concluded. At my level, at the level of the Minister, Deputy Cowen, both of us working together, working with the Prime Minister, with the Secretary of State and with the help of Ambassador Haass and his colleagues, we will make every effort we can in this regard. However, we need to restore confidence and we want to see the institutions restored as soon as possible. We also want the elections to be held. I made it clear in my recent interviews that the Irish Government does not countenance any circumstances where the elections would be postponed. We can see the difficulties in that area but we do not accept or agree with them. We want the elections to be scheduled as intended. That means there are only a few months to deal with many difficult issues but it is possible to do that. It does not have to be drawn out and we are ready to play our part and to do so as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's stated confidence in the leadership of Sinn Féin and his acknowledgement that acts of violence in the North of Ireland are primarily the work of the loyalist paramilitaries. What is the Taoiseach's view of the proposals on policing published recently by the British Government? Does he agree that they do not meet the requirements of the Patten report? Does the Taoiseach also agree that the Patten report envisaged a much stronger role for the policing board than the role which was watered down and which gave the Chief Constable the power to refuse the board the wherewithal to properly carry out its investigative role of the police in the North of Ireland?</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the proposals published last week go even further? By extension, the same restriction now applies to the police ombudsman and will undermine the ombudsman's ability to scrutinise and investigate properly the PSNI. Has the Taoiseach raised these matters with the British Prime Minister? Has he pressed, as he must do on an ongoing basis, for the full implementation of the Patten report, which everybody acknowledges was a compromise in itself? Has the Taoiseach also pressed for the immediate publication of the Stevens report, which has again been delayed? This is a critical report into collusion between British Crown forces and loyalist paramilitarism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked a number of questions. With regard to the legislation, it is an important element in moving forward on the outstanding issues of policing. A number of substantive legislative amendments to the Police (Northern Ireland) Act, 2000, were agreed at Weston Park. It is the threshold from where we want to move what we have agreed on, and we want to move on it now. There are ongoing dis<Col N="1198" /> cussions. There has been concern about some of the issues but we agreed these at Weston Park and the Act reflects that, and we are pleased with that. Other issues are being raised before the Bill is released this month. I mentioned earlier that 20 or 30 issues have been raised.</P>
      <P>With regard to the ombudsman, there are ongoing discussions between the ombudsman and the Secretary of State to clarify the issues. Those matters will be resolved. We have long called for the publication of the Stevens report and have been critical that it has not been published. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and his officials have raised this matter time and again and continue to do so.</P>

      <P>Do I take it from the Taoiseach's reply that he does not share the concerns of others about the recently published legislation on policing from the British Government? It must be acknowledged that people have sincerely expressed their concern at the failure of the new legislation to meet all the requirements of the Patten report. I instanced one example. If the Taoiseach's response is as it appears, which is why I seek clarification, it would have an echo of concern beyond this Chamber. Does the Taoiseach agree that the proposed legislation does not address the requirement of meeting the compromise in the Patten report and, therefore, will not relieve the current impasse on this important issue? I seek the Taoiseach's clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not read from my remarks that I am totally happy with the proposals and that I do not accept any of the arguments. That is not what I said. I indicated in my earlier reply to Deputy Rabbitte that there were 20 or 30 areas still outstanding where we are involved in discussions. Over the next number of weeks we will continue dealing with these outstanding issues. We hope that on examination and reflection, many of the issues of concern to the SDLP and Sinn Féin will be dealt with in the new legislation. Some others might be more suitable for resolution by non-legislative means. The Deputy will be aware that many of them are non-legislative issues and can be dealt with in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sinn Féin, the SDLP or the Irish Government will be unlikely to have all their demands fulfilled in legislation at Westminster. We will put forward our case and our submissions and we have a special input into that debate but it does not mean we always get everything we want. However, at Weston Park we achieved, from our perspective, an enormous amount of what was in the Patten report. There are areas that can still be examined. There are many sensitive issues and we know where they arise. As time goes by and when everybody is represented on the policing board, the systems and means of operating these issues will work. We have seen the success of the policing board. Regardless of what people say or do not say about the board, we must accept the <Col N="1199" /> great success it has had over the last 16 months. It has achieved an enormous amount.</P>
    <P>We also hope the new legislation will be additional to other factors. One of the important other factors is the possible devolution of policing and justice. That would create the context and conditions for a move on other issues to take place. We will closely engage, as we have done since the Patten report was first produced, on this issue. It is our intention to try to come to a resolution. We will not ignore any deeply held points of view that either the SDLP or Sinn Féin has on these issues.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach met the US special envoy on 21 November. Did the special envoy brief the Taoiseach on the intentions of the United States towards Iraq? Did Mr. Haass give any inkling that the United States Administration would set out, calculatedly, as it has done in the last two days, to undermine the role of the United Nations inspectors in Iraq and continue to set the scene for an attack on Iraq? What discussions took place between the special envoy and the Taoiseach? Did the Taoiseach, as usual, guarantee unqualified support or did he say that the lust for oil and domination of the region among hawks in the US Administration is not a justifiable reason to launch an attack that would create tens of thousands of innocent casualties? What is the Taoiseach's assessment of the situation at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did tell the special envoy, Mr. Haass, that there are a few Members of the House who are opposed to the American Administration and that even though it had followed the process we had set out, that is, the UN process, and followed it successfully over the past six months, some people are still not happy. I will try to arrange on a future visit for the Deputy to meet Mr. Haass because he is a good envoy.</P>
      <P>Most of the meeting related to Northern Ireland but, as always, he gave me an update on key American issues. Unlike what the Deputy said, I did not accept the American position and reiterated what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said in the House, at the UN and elsewhere and has successfully followed in recent months, namely, that the UN and the policies of Kofi Annan should remain centre-stage. The envoy, Mr. Haass, and his superior, Secretary of State, Colin Powell, have listened to this position and have been helpful in regard to what the Minister, Deputy Cowen, has said on behalf of the Irish Government and what our colleagues in the European Union have said. That is clear to see in the manner in which the Security Council has been centre-stage until now. Speculating on what will happen in future is another matter and something I cannot do.</P>

      <P>David Trimble said yesterday that the key to progress in Northern Ireland was <Col N="1200" /> an end to arms. Does the Taoiseach consider it important from the point of view of the renunciation of violence and the decommissioning of arms that we make it clear that it is not just David Trimble and the Unionists who want to see arms decommissioned and that there is a united voice on all sides of the Dáil that there must be an end to arms and decommissioning of all paramilitaries, especially the IRA?</P>
      <P>Regarding the Northern Ireland Assembly elections, can we make it clear that, irrespective of the outcome of discussions, as far as we are concerned the elections must proceed next May in Northern Ireland?</P>
      <P>On policing, whatever about points legitimately raised about the current proposals which I understand are to be debated in Westminster before the end of the month, can we make it clear that we want to see full support for the Police Service of Northern Ireland from both communities and that the message from the Dáil is that, while we appreciate the progress made by the PSNI, we want to see full support from both communities in Northern Ireland for the new police service from now on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy O'Keeffe said. I said in my statement last week to the forum that it was not a question of one person wanting this type of programme, that we all wanted it. We have made significant progress and we can take collective credit for it. The Government has put a great deal of time, effort and commitment into it. We want to proceed in that vein and to see an end to paramilitary activity, violence and coercion and an end to issues concerning militarisation. That is a shared objective and is not just the aim of one person.</P>
      <P>I have been in correspondence with Deputy Rabbitte and we have endeavoured to try to come to an agreement that addresses his point that the House should be able to deal collectively with these issues in a satisfactory way. We are not yet at that stage but at least we are endeavouring to get there.</P>
      <P>I accept the last point the Deputy made regarding the Police Service of Northern Ireland. We made an enormous effort 18 months ago in Weston Park to reach a certain point and the legislation published reflects that. Other issues remain outstanding. Some argue that they should be dealt with by legislation but we believe there are also non-legislative means to deal with them. Some of the issues could be left to the policing committees to deal with because they have proved that they can make more progress. If we had tried to deal through legislation with some of the issues they have resolved over the past 16 months, we would not have been able to resolve them. The committees were able to resolve difficult issues without much fuss and to the satisfaction of all. This has been beneficial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rather than trying to tease out everything in legislation, we must look to the people who must live by and under the law and direct these things <Col N="1201" /> into the future. Some of these outstanding issues can be dealt with on a non-legislative basis. We are engaged in discussions and are prepared to fulfil our role as best we can.</P>

      <P>In respect of the package of measures under consideration, will the Taoiseach confirm that, effectively, an amnesty will be considered for those still wanted for criminal offences so that they may return to Northern Ireland? Will he insist that the same paramilitary groups who will benefit from this lift their exclusion orders on those exiled from Northern Ireland, estimated by one human rights organisation last year to be 700?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to this. One is the OTRs &ndash; the &ldquo;on the runs&rdquo;, as they are known. There are considerable legal difficulties within the British system in this regard and these have been dealt with by their Attorney General on and off for the past two years. This is an outstanding issue to which we are endeavouring to find a conclusion.</P>
      <P>I agree with the second part of the Deputy's question. I have stated repeatedly in the House that it is consistent if one argues that people on the run should be allowed back, that those who were arbitrarily forced out of their communities, some many years ago, and who are detached from their families, representative groups of whom I have met over the years, should also benefit from any moral pressure brought to bear on the paramilitaries. There is no legal basis for their exclusion other than paramilitary threats. It has happened in both communities.</P>
      <P>There is also the case of those people who were threatened to such an extent that they had to leave their homes because they were of a different religion or from a different community. That is an issue which must also be dealt with. There are some proposals in this regard which one of the Ministers in Northern Ireland, Mr. Brown, has brought forward which we welcome as a start in trying to deal with this issue.</P>

      <P>The Barron inquiry has been delayed and the date of its conclusion is directly related to the degree of co-operation that Mr. Justice Barron is receiving not only from the British authorities but from the authorities here. In case my question is tripped up again, is the Taoiseach satisfied there has been full Garda co-operation with Mr. Justice Barron in relation to his inquiry? How will the cases, other than the May 1974 bombings, be dealt with by Mr. Justice Barron in the compilation and delivery of his report? Will they also go before the Dáil committee and will that committee be able to examine issues other than those brought to Mr. Justice Barron at the appropriate time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three or four questions there and I will try to answer them together. <Col N="1203" /> Deputies will be aware that I raised the matter of the co-operation of the British authorities with Mr. Justice Barron's inquiry at my recent meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. He assured me further material would be forthcoming. That material is still awaited. The Prime Minister is fully aware that we want to see the maximum co-operation from the British authorities and the matter has been raised through the British-Irish Secretariat and at the recent meeting of the British-Irish intergovernmental conference.</P>
      <P>I have no information that there were any difficulties at any level in Garda dealings with Mr. Justice Barron or the late Mr. Justice Hamilton. I know they both dealt extensively with the Garda, but I received complaint or reports other than that full co-operation was given, so I can make no other comment on that.</P>
      <P>On the third question raised by the Deputy, he will be aware that earlier this year, Mr. Justice Barron agreed to report on other cases, including the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the Castleblaney bombing of 1976, and the murders of John Francis Green and Bríd Carr. Mr. Justice Barron had already examined papers in these cases in the context of his examination of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and therefore a formal extension of his terms of reference was not required. I assume these will all be in his report in the springtime. On that basis, they will all be able to go before the committee and how the committee proceeds after that will be a matter for it.</P>

Why was there a lack of co-operation? Was it purely that there was such huge bureaucracy involved or was there a lack of will? Is the Taoiseach now satisfied that all the documentation and information sought by Mr. Justice Barron from the UK authorities has been made available? In other words has there been full discovery in the light of the fact that it will be very difficult for him to finalise his report until there has been such full discovery? </P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As we get closer to the time of the report, I am sure I will find some of that information. I am working on the basis that there has not been a difficulty with the Garda. I do not dictate how Mr. Justice Barron does his work. If he is not getting co-operation, I get that information so that I can assist him. I have not heard of any difficulty from him or previously from the late Mr. Justice Hamilton and I know they were extensively involved. If there is anything else I will make the House aware.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy O'Keeffe, I would love to be able to reply in the affirmative and say that every single thing is there. There has been some pull and chug for a long time to try to get the information. Mr. Justice Barron had a meeting at a very senior level in Northern Ireland to try to get the information. Some of the information may no longer exist and there was difficulty finding other information because of the passage of time, but that has now been found. That is very important. Other information might not have been in the NIO, but in some sectors of the security infrastructure of the time and that has been more difficult.</P>
      <P>The difficulty has been with its system. It is very hard to track what has been in the security infrastructure, but not in the NIO or the normal establishment. People feel it is there but we cannot be sure. I cannot say it does not exist or it never existed. I have my own view about how they operate their system but that may not be a very informed view either. It is difficult to get anyone who has an informed view about some of these structures. The former Secretary of State, Dr. John Reid, put in an enormous effort to find the information that we believed was in the system and it has now been found. This was information we believed must have existed because of references that people had come across.</P>

      <P>I intend to share time with a number of colleagues. I wish to associate myself with the expressions of sympathy on the sad death of Jim Mitchell. His brother Peter, who died at Christmas 14 years ago, was a friend and constituent of mine. I also extend my sympathy to the Fine Gael Members.</P>
      <P>I represent the constituency of Dublin South West where there are a considerable number of busy and active community employment schemes. I am not going to say one thing and do another. I am very supportive of community employment schemes and I have had much contact with the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, in that regard. I compliment the Minister of State on the open ear approach he has taken. He has listened to us and I hope he will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>I represent a constituency where there was a huge unemployment problem. Over the past ten years we have made great progress in regard to unemployment figures. Community employment schemes have made a significant contribution in that regard. Different clubs and projects have succeeded in surviving by the effective use of community employment schemes. I am sure other colleagues would concur on this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1209" />Recently, I had the opportunity of meeting the Minister of State with a delegation from Partas, the Get Tallaght Working Co-operative. It was founded in 1984 as a direct response to the unemployment problems then being experienced in Tallaght. Partas is a good example of a community employment scheme that works well. It was a positive meeting in the sense that not only did the delegation take the opportunity of expressing its concerns to the Minister of State but it also gave him some innovative ideas on how it saw the community employment scheme projects developing.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies will be able to tell of the work done by schemes in their areas. I highlight Partas because over the past number of years it has been able to create definite and sustainable employment through the recruitment of people for community employment schemes. The long-term unemployed were given an opportunity to get on a scheme, thereby assisting the community through their work on different projects. Many of them moved into full-time jobs. We must continue to allow this to happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, stated in Tallaght last week, in regard to the review of the scheme that we must continue to cater for the disadvantaged communities throughout the country. As far as Dublin South West and Tallaght is concerned, I will be making that point to the Minister of State. He must continue to look at innovative ways of developing the schemes.</P>
    <P>There are other agencies and groups, including the employer groups, who have a definite role to play as far as re-training is concerned. They must continue to make a contribution in that regard. Over the past 20 years community employment schemes have made a big impact. They have become an indispensable part of community services and we must continue to maintain that.</P>
    <P>The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has a key role to play at a time that there are pressures on the schemes. Community groups are struggling to keep their services going and to keep community centres open. We must create a situation where they could seek grants either directly from the Department or through local authorities. The Minister should apply himself to looking at such areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment also has a role to play in this regard. Her Department could put a great deal of pressure on employers to be flexible in taking on workers and to create conditions where, for example, working hours would be more flexible to cover those coming off schemes and maintain jobs. This is important business and the Minister of State should understand that Government backbenchers have concerns. We want him to reply to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this issue is welcome as it is important. CE schemes contribute significantly to communities everywhere but <Col N="1210" /> there is no doubt a number of issues need to be addressed in regard to them. There are opportunities available to make better use of the schemes and I welcome the overall review of the scheme.</P>
      <P>As people who are on the schemes are mainstreamed into regular jobs or there is a reduction in places, as the Opposition puts it, supervisors are also affected. I ask the Minister of State to examine the role of supervisors in the review because when the number of places on schemes reduces, it will impact on them and they should be involved in the decision making.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of my political career, people were trying to get off CE scheme whereas nowadays they want to stay on the schemes permanently. However, the rules governing schemes are changing and people cannot stay on them forever as they are supposed to allow people to progress to permanent employment. In the past, individuals would not show up for interviews for a place on a scheme whereas now there are more people than places. However, a follow-up mechanism should be put in place to deal with people who do not appear for interviews.</P>
      <P>There is a need to deal with people aged 45 and over separately because the participation of females in this age category in the workforce has increased but in rural areas there is not much alternative employment available. Whether it is still called community employment is another issue. If a group of people aged 45 and over who are on a scheme do not move on because jobs are not available or the skills they have acquired are not needed and so on, we must examine what can be done in real terms to assist them.</P>
      <P>I welcome the mainstreaming of health and education services, which were covered by CE, because many people participating in the schemes had qualifications in child care, for example, but could not get a job in the field. As a result they went on the dole so that they could take up a CE scheme and then progressed to permanent employment. They were following their career paths the wrong way round. The mainstreaming of these schemes is welcome as long as they are properly pursued and funded. There are people with good qualifications who deserve full-time jobs.</P>
      <P>The national minimum wage has helped people to take up proper employment and I hope the budget will encourage more people to enter the workforce. While there will be a reduction in the number of places on schemes, many of which will be subsumed by the mainstreaming of services, the remaining places should be spread among areas of high unemployment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to make a brief contribution on community employment. The scheme was originally introduced at a time of high unemployment and labour market intervention was the concept adopted to ensure people were given an opportunity to be trained and participate in the workforce. CE has <Col N="1211" /> been successful in many areas, particularly as it complemented the great voluntary effort put in by individuals in local communities. Many people who were involved in their communities were not remunerated but CE has allowed communities to extend their range of services, whether it is in the delivery of meals on wheels, assisting people in their homes, supervising youth clubs or providing caretakers for community centres. CE has enabled communities to develop and provide a wider range of services than had previously been the case.</P>
      <P>I welcome the review of CE schemes but I also caution the Minister of State to ensure FÁS consults local communities and takes their views into consideration when carrying out this exercise. I pay tribute to the Minister of State following his recent visit to Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>He met many community organisations, such as Cork Community Development, and representatives of the unemployed and CE schemes to listen to what they had to say and he took their concerns on board. He outlined the direction which he felt community employment should take and he agreed to return to speak to them again, which I welcome.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise that many people who take up places on CE schemes to be retrained and so on will not find alternative employment because of their age and so on. However, FÁS and departmental officials have recognised this and they have put a structure in place to ensure these people will continue to provide a service in their communities. These schemes give many of them a reason to get up in the morning to play their part in their communities and that is important. The social economy element of the scheme is also important because people are provided with opportunities.</P>
      <P>I am glad schemes relating to drug rehabilitation, child care services and so on have been ring fenced. I accept the forthcoming changes but I ask the Minister of State to ensure there is contact with the people on the ground who are willing to work with him to make sure vital services will be maintained in the communities concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Such groups have done great work in the west, especially in small villages, and almost every community there has a FÁS scheme. It is important that these schemes should continue. Many people have returned to the workforce having taken up a place on a CE scheme <Col N="1212" /> and learned a trade. CE has been a great success but the limit on participation in a scheme to three years is a major problem, particularly for people aged over 55. I ask the Minister to take cognisance of this in his review and ensure the people concerned are kept on after three years. I do not say people are completely unemployable at 55 years, but it is difficult for someone of that age to find employment in a rural area. Such people should be retained on community employment schemes until the age of 65 years. They are good workers who have developed trades during the years, but who would otherwise find it hard to find work. I ask the Minister to ensure people over the age of 55 years are kept on community employment schemes.</P>
      <P>Good schemes have been developed in many towns and villages. In Ballinasloe, for example, coaching facilities have been provided for several organisations. These schemes should be retained. I salute the community employment schemes which have been a great success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Private Members' Bill. During the years community employment schemes have made a contribution to reducing the long-term unemployment levels. They have also afforded an opportunity to the workforce to retrain and acquire new skills. More importantly, they have made a contribution to the upkeep and improvement of many towns and villages. Every Member of the Oireachtas has seen the contribution the schemes have made to local communities and sports organisations. I know of the Minister's ongoing interest in sport and his commitment to it. I am sure he will do anything he can to ensure the involvement of community employment schemes in the provision of sports facilities is maintained.</P>
      <P>Community employment schemes have afforded many individuals, particularly those in their middle years who do not have a trade or skill, an opportunity to come back into the workforce. The schemes have given these workers experience which they would not have received in times past. Sports and other voluntary organisations have given a second opportunity to people &ndash; middle aged men in particular &ndash; who have worked for 20 or 30 years and through no fault of their own been made redundant or let go from their employment.</P>
      <P>The invaluable work of community employment schemes, particularly with the co-operation and assistance of local authorities, should not be lost. We should build on the experience gained. We cannot simply walk away from what has been achieved to date. To do so would not merely let down the workers who have benefited from their participation in schemes, but also the communities which have seen huge improvements as a result of the schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a strategic policy shift in favour of greater investment in training since the days when unemployment levels were much higher. I <Col N="1213" /> would like to see this continue. It is also important to note that the number on community employment schemes is now far greater than the number of long-term unemployed. I encourage the Minister to continue with the schemes and, where possible, refocus them. They have been an outstanding success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. S. Power Mr. S. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>When community employment was established, it was seen as a transitional programme to provide work experience and training for the long-term unemployed and assist them in getting back into the workforce. Using these criteria, community employment has been very successful. In 1997 the long-term unemployed numbered 90,000. This year the figure will have fallen to 22,000. There has been a reduction in demand for places for the long-term unemployed. In 1998 we saw 40,000 participate in community employment schemes while this year it is expected that approximately 25,000 will participate.</P>
      <P>While the programme is not perfect, we have all witnessed the tremendous benefits that community employment has brought to communities. There is hardly a village in Ireland which has not benefited from a community employment scheme. More important is the confidence the schemes have given to the individuals who have participated in them. Unemployed persons often feel they have lost much of their dignity. By creating employment the schemes have given them a reason to get up in the morning. This is very important. It is difficult to measure the help this gives, but we should not underestimate it.</P>
      <P>I understand FÁS is undertaking a review of community employment. While this is welcome, a much more important question must be asked. Is it right to pay healthy people for not working? I say it is not.</P>

      <P>It is madness to pay people who could work to remain idle when so much work needs to be done. We have seen the success of the tremendous work of community employment schemes and the huge reduction in the number of the long-term unemployed. We have also seen the changes in school services which mean a further reduction in the demand for the schemes as they exist today.</P>
      <P>We must build on the success of community employment. I suggest the creation of a new scheme that would allow all unemployed persons to participate in a similar type of activity. The new scheme would need a new name. In any sort of employment scheme it is to the benefit of the country and the employees that they be rewarded for their effort. It is important that we encourage people to use their talent. Whether we have a recognised trade, we all have skills and it is important that these skills be used in a productive fashion. I hope the FÁS review will give serious consideration to my suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1214" />The tremendous success of community employment is obvious. We must build on this success and provide employment for everyone. There is no shortage of work. It costs very little more to pay people to participate in community employment or similar schemes than to pay them to remain idle. I ask the Minister to consider this fact.</P>
    <P>I look forward to reading the FÁS report. When it becomes available, I hope the House will have an opportunity to discuss the matter further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBreen" hpid="Mr. J. Breen Mr. J. Breen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>With the agreement of the House, I propose to share my time with Deputy Morgan.</P>
      <P>The Minister's proposal to reduce the numbers employed on community employment schemes is an attack by the Government on the most vulnerable in society. The people concerned, who had been long-term unemployed, have been given some pride and dignity by doing a day's work and being paid for it. They have done valuable work for the community such as building community centres, planting flowers and cleaning streets. The Minister knows the counties of Mayo, Galway and Clare. In Loop Head, County Clare, participants in a community employment scheme were told this week there was no more work for them and they must go back on the dole. The same has happened in Achill Island, County Mayo, and west Galway. In places where there is no public transport and the Government has failed to provide a transport infrastructure people are being taken off community employment schemes. Where is the economic sense in taking a person off a community employment scheme and putting him back on the dole? That is not a saving, it is false economy.</P>
      <P>Under the long-term integration scheme and the part-time jobs option, people got up and went to work. People with disabilities, who find it hard to get employment on the open market, were employed under the community employment schemes. Discontinuing the schemes is an attack by the Government on the most vulnerable in our society. Will the Minister reconsider her position and not reduce the numbers employed in community employment schemes? Fianna Fáil backbenchers who have spoken here today, my former party colleagues, will have the option tomorrow night of voting with us and making the Minister maintain the numbers currently employed in community employment schemes.</P>
      <P>In my parish of Kilnamona, which consists of 500 people, we built a first-class community centre at a cost of £220,000 with the aid of the community employment scheme. Without the scheme this would have been impossible, and it is a credit to the people who worked on FÁS schemes. Those people, who have done marvellous work in our towns and villages, are now being told there is no more work for them, which is not right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is too late because today's budget will hit hardest the most vulnerable in our society. In today's newspaper it states that the monthly <Col N="1215" /> drugs payment scheme threshold is to increase for the second time in six months. What is that but another attack on the most vulnerable in society? During the election, the Government promised there would be no cutbacks, secret or otherwise. It was said in this Chamber today that it was telling lies. I do not think so, but it was very economical with the truth. It did not tell people about the increases in the drugs payment scheme, nor did it tell those on community employment schemes that they would lose their positions.</P>
    <P>They promised to renovate schools but what is happening to them? They are rat-infested, the wind is blowing in and out of them and pupils fear they will get pneumonia. What has the Government done? It has let down the most vulnerable in society. I appeal to the Minister of State, a man from the west of Ireland for whom I have great admiration and who has done tremendous work through the years, to impress upon the Minister and the Taoiseach not to reduce the numbers in the community employment schemes but to maintain them as they are. If he does that he will be doing a service to the people in the west, whom he represents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Government lied through its teeth or actually believed what it said before the election. It believes it was responsible for all the good that happened in Irish society and that it single-handedly steered the ship into the blue waters of the Celtic tiger boom. It was not in any way responsible for that boom. Its arrogance blinded it.</P>
      <P>The changes with regard to the community employment schemes are occurring on the back of the arrogant contention that all is well, that the Irish economy is booming and that unemployment is a thing of the past. In fact, the Government has steered the ship of State into a storm. Unemployment is rising and we will need community employment schemes. I have the experience of having been on a scheme and ran one back in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Much of the boom was born out of some of the schemes that were started at that time.</P>
      <P>In my case, a small community employment scheme took me off the dole, which can be very depressing for anyone on it. I was almost unable to work after a year and a half of not being able to get work, but what saved me was the ability to start in a small way in a community employment scheme and develop a business idea I had. Within that safe nurturing environment I was able to go back to work, start working for myself, start a business and bring money into the country.</P>
      <P>That was replicated in the late 1980s and 1990s. People coming home from abroad joined a FÁS or AnCO scheme, as it was called then, which built up their confidence and allowed them to be enterprising. Those schemes were largely responsible for the new business and enterprise of the late 1990s and now this Government wants to kill them off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" />I do not have a problem with regulating or changing community employment schemes. If a person is working in a hospital or a school in what is, in effect, a full-time position, that should be recognised. I have no problem if the Minister says it is a proper full-time job that should be paid for by the Department of Education and Science or the Department of Health and Children. However, that is not what is happening. The Minister is cutting into the very heart of the community employment scheme. Not only is she attacking the area I just mentioned but she is also attacking areas where there is genuine community benefit, where the voluntary sector is at work and where people have a chance to develop their skills and the assets of their community.</P>
    <P>The Minister tries to relate everything to the market and have a market price, analysis and assessment. She sees the community employment scheme as a labour market initiative, but it is not. It is a community development initiative. Not only does it help people grow and gain work experience if they have been out of work for a while but it also brings benefits to communities that no other scheme or facility can deliver. The Minister is blinded by free-market ideology. I agree with the backbencher on the other side of the House who called this Government the most right-wing Government we have seen since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Government believes in the concept of community. If one kills a sense of community, one kills the life-force from which proper enterprise comes. That is what this Minister is doing and we will pay for it as her colleague, the Minister for Finance, drags us into deeper, more dangerous and stormy waters. She should review the cutbacks in the community employment scheme because we will need it more than ever as unemployment rises. It will allow people to refocus, regain their confidence and set up new enterprises. The Government should turn back but it does not listen or want to review its incredibly strong ideological orthodoxy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with considerable interest to Government backbenchers calling for the retention of the CE schemes but, the week before last, they all filed through to vote the schemes down by voting for the Estimates. CE workers are at the front line in tackling poverty and disadvantage and empowering communities. Although I accept that the schemes are imperfect, in many cases they are the only positive provisions in impoverished and deprived communities. I have no doubt that when they were first introduced by the coalition Government of the early 1990s, they were intended as a stopgap measure aimed primarily at reducing numbers on the live register. However, ingenious, inventive and, in truth, desperate communities made the CE idea work. Now that inventiveness and tenacity is being thwarted and lack of thought by the Government is not just cutting back old branches but felling the entire tree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1217" />Since April last we have seen an underhand policy of phasing out community employment schemes. The loss of these schemes will not only put thousands of workers back on the dole but it will have a devastating effect on local communities across the State. Not only is it a breach of good faith and another broken election promise but it is a direct contradiction of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness because there was not any consultation with organisations running these schemes or with the communities which depend on them.</P>
    <P>We need an open debate about the value and purpose of community employment schemes. The Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed has called for reform of CE schemes and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment tabled an amendment which referred to restructuring the schemes. It is now seven months since the Minister announced the most recent cuts in the schemes and we still do not have a clear picture of what she means by &ldquo;restructuring&rdquo;. If the current level of cutbacks continues, there will be nothing left to restructure.</P>
    <P>The effects of the cuts in these schemes will be felt across the Twenty-six Counties. The cost of these cuts in real terms is an average &euro;24.40 reduction because those who lose places on the schemes will end up, in all probability, dependent on social welfare payments because this Government, and previous Governments, have done nothing to eliminate the educational problems that lead to long-term unemployment in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Let us contrast the closure of a multinational company and the loss of, say, 4,000 jobs to the deliberate slashing of between 4,000 and 5,000 jobs on CE schemes by the very Minister responsible for that task. Imagine the outcry and the calls for task forces to be established in such a situation. It is worthy to note that those same task forces never have to account for their spending or the number of jobs, if any, they create. Even their sponsoring Department has never attempted to measure their usefulness or effectiveness. Not only is the Government cutting jobs, it is taking them from those who are already overlooked by the mainstream labour market and it is taking away the services these workers provide for communities who have been systematically neglected over the years. We should not have to defend functioning, albeit imperfect, schemes. We should be planning better schemes with wider provision, a better safety net and real roots to long-term career options for the people involved in the communities about which we are talking.</P>
    <P>We are talking about real services providing front line projects like drug treatment programmes, school meals services, child care facilities, after school crèches, estate management and maintenance projects, and local history and folklore projects. The State was never prepared to supply these services, certainly the market economy would never have provided them. We are talking about a real safety net in which this <Col N="1218" /> Government is cutting huge holes by implementing this strategy. The cost difference involved, &euro;24.40 per week, is the difference between a person sitting at home idling away his or her time or, worse still, falling into some of the vices that prevail in the communities where these schemes are most effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>The uncertainty in relation to community employment schemes is very unfair to community employment participants and to the sponsors throughout the country. Any situation in which a person's future, however limited, is uncertain is totally unacceptable, particularly when the uncertainty can be eliminated by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I support the proposition because certain areas and categories of people should be protected in any changes that may take place, for example, participants in small rural communities where there is low income from farming and limited possibilities of alternative employment. I heard Deputy Callanan speak about people over 55 and I suspect there is something coming down the tracks in regard to that category of people but I am talking about people over 50. Any employment agency will say that people over 50 have a poor chance of getting a job because of age. Special consideration should be given also to the RAPID areas.</P>
      <P>I also support the notion that in assessing applicants for schemes, consideration would be given to projects that provide good quality work experience and training for the individual participants while taking into account the types of services provided and the levels of employment in the locality. The reality is that there are some areas of rural Ireland where there is no alternative employment of any nature. Participation in FÁS schemes has given a new life to participants. It has given them a new sense of personal dignity, facilitated their personal development and provided the participants with an opportunity to acquire new skills while carrying out valuable work in communities which otherwise would not have had such work carried out.</P>
      <P>When one is sitting in an office in Dublin, it is difficult to appreciate the realities of rural Ireland, as in my own constituency of Galway East. I know my constituency and my constituents and what I say is true. Community employment schemes are a must for Galway East because that is all we have in many parts of the constituency.</P>
      <P>There are people who, for various reasons, will not be able to get employment in mainstream industries but with training, encouragement and understanding they can contribute enormously to their communities by working on community employment schemes while improving their own self-worth. That is an enormous benefit from involvement in these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister and his Department accept what I have said, what is the problem? Is it financial? I do not believe that is the case because the vast majority of people on community employment <Col N="1219" /> schemes will be on social welfare if their participation on CE schemes is ended. The Exchequer, therefore, would still make a contribution to their livelihood.</P>
    <P>I will not detail the figures in relation to social welfare versus community employment payments, and I do not intend to refer to any potential cost benefit analysis that might be carried out of the developments community employment schemes provide throughout the country, but taking into account the fact that the difference between social welfare payments and community employment pay is minimal, the further assessment that needs to be factored in for a complete assessment is a cost benefit to a community in terms of the work carried out under these schemes.</P>
    <P>Valuable work now being done by community councils, GAA clubs and other clubs and organisations is under threat, and the threat is not only to those organisations. There is a severe threat to rural Ireland. I implore the Minister not to take any action that would represent a further attack on rural Ireland because the cutback of 27% in funding for the CLÁR programme, which is taking place this year, is enough of an attack on rural Ireland in one year. It is indicative of the poor standing in which rural Ireland is held by this Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. The Government is deliberately setting out to dismantle the community employment schemes on ideological grounds and to balance the books. After five of the most prosperous years in the history of the State, it has identified the most needy and disadvantaged to foot the bill for its mismanagement and incompetence in office. They are to be deprived of the opportunity to work.</P>
      <P>How many on the Government benches know what it is like to be out of work or to be long-term unemployed, including the loss of dignity and confidence that go with it? By its deliberate decision the Government is depriving the long-term unemployed, the unemployable, the men and especially the women the opportunity to get a foot on the employment ladder. Many of the women affected stayed at home to rear their families, a laudable objective. I am reliably informed that the Government intended to reduce the number of participants on community employment schemes by 10,000 in 2003. However, following campaigns and pressure from the Opposition, community and voluntary groups the Minister has had a rethink, but it is of cold comfort for the 5,000 who will be unable to access schemes next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This disgraceful decision will have a disastrous effect on confidence and morale within the voluntary sector. It will also dismantle many community based projects. For example, in County Fingal the ongoing historical restoration schemes at Braemor Castle, Skerries Mills and Swords Castle may be terminated. As a nation we cannot <Col N="1220" /> stand by and see this invaluable work interfered with.</P>
    <P>The changing patterns of life have affected the numbers of volunteers and the amount of time available to them to help community based projects, such as community centres, sports clubs, tidy town committees, youth club services and senior citizen projects. The community employment schemes have been used to complement this voluntary work.</P>
    <P>Most importantly, the schemes have enabled men and women to return to the workforce. This disastrous decision will have ongoing implications for communities. It will also mean that people may end up unemployable and in prisons, at great cost to the economy. The Government should take on board the views of the Opposition because the people are disgusted with what it has done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision taken by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to agree to a reduction by a further 5,000 places in the community employment schemes is heartless and unsympathetic, especially in view of the deteriorating economic situation. When Fine Gael left office in 1997 we were creating 1,000 jobs per week whereas at present the Government is losing 500 jobs per week.</P>
      <P>The community employment schemes have made an enormous contribution to the self esteem of participants. They have succeeded in returning many people to the workforce and provided them with a skill, sometimes for the first time, and self worth. The Minister's decision will impact directly on many communities. Tidy town organisations, parish halls, village renewal schemes and sporting organisations, including the running of facilities and the training of young people in soccer, rugby and Gaelic football, will be affected. The schemes were concerned with taking young people off the streets and getting them involved in sport and other activities. The Government has ignored the social costs of its decisions.</P>
      <P>The community employment schemes have played a crucial role in the health services by providing personal assistants, giving independence to the disabled for the first time, while running and supporting nursing facilities, care of the elderly and services such as meals on wheels. The education services will also be affected. For example, in special schools the services provided by schemes subvent the lack of State funding. Similarly, the lack of Government resources in health and sport have also been subvented by the schemes, yet the Minister intends to reduce their scope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1221" />The Minister is reducing the budget for community employment schemes to balance the books. She is not considering the impact of her decision, which attacks the most vulnerable groups in communities. They are soft targets on which soft savings can be made.</P>
    <P>At present, a single person on a community employment scheme earns an extra &euro;24.40 per week above the social welfare rate. It is an extra cost of &euro;1.25 per hour. The worthwhile community work provided by these participants subvents the lack of funding by the Government to the care of the most vulnerable. It is value for money and the Minister's decision contradicts the determination by the Minister for Finance to seek value for money for Government spending.</P>
    <P>The viability of many projects and activities in every community group is dependent on the commitment, or lack of it, by the Government to community employment schemes. Between January and October of this year, 19,000 people left these schemes, of which almost 4,000 were over the age of 50 years, 3,000 had a disability, almost 6,000 were lone parents and 600 were widowed. The Government is specifically targeting lone parents and curtailing the funds available to them for rent allowances and other supports to ensure that they get out of the house. It means that young women, who for the first time had the opportunity to take up training or education, have been used as a soft target by the Minister. It is not the first time she has targeted lone parents, who are the most vulnerable in society.</P>
    <P>Rural communities will be severely damaged by this decision. Despite the limited opportunities available to many people in these communities, the Government is cutting back on their only outlet for returning to mainstream employment or training. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. Many Fianna Fáil backbenchers have also supported it, yet they will vote against it, which is a joke. The Minister probably told them to keep quiet and not to speak until spoken to. I often wonder how she sleeps at night after what she has done to FÁS schemes. The Taoiseach is on a week on, week off basis as my colleague, Deputy Ring, has often said.</P>
      <P>I wish to tell the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister of State about Bree, the little community from where I come. It has a GAA club, a community centre, a senior citizens' group, the school and the church, all looked after by the hard-working people in the FÁS groups. There are 17 FÁS groups altogether and I wonder how many we will have this time next year; it will probably be less than half that number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the FÁS workers in the past went on to third level education, training and development and many went back into employment. The FÁS schemes are important for the long-term unemployed, people with disabilities and other vulnerable groups who otherwise would not have <Col N="1222" /> access to employment opportunities. I call on the Minister to restore the expenditure in respect of the community voluntary and local development schemes. She is totally out of touch with what is happening on the ground by agreeing to a reduction of a further 5,000 places in these schemes. I ask if she has a heart because this is a heartless act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton said last night in his contribution that if ten firms closed down with a loss of 500 jobs between now and Christmas, there would be a hue and cry in this House. In one slap, the Minister has cut 5,000 places from FÁS schemes. FÁS deals with vulnerable people who are at the lower end of the social scale and it seems to be regarded as all right to send them back to the dole queues.</P>
    <P>It will mean the end of the great work carried out in parishes all over the country. I ask the Minister to say who will carry on the work of the schemes. It will not be the health boards or the county councils because they have not got the money. I went to the health board last week asking for a bath rail to be installed for an elderly person. The money is not available for the work to be carried out now and the person will have to wait until next year.</P>
    <P>I know of a lady in my parish who is deaf. The CE scheme is the only place where she can find employment. She will probably finish up early next week and I do not know where she will find other employment because there is no where else that will take her. People with disabilities on FÁS schemes will find it difficult to find other employment.</P>
    <P>Historical sites across the country have been transformed by the great work of FÁS workers. I received a letter last week from a person who was working on a scheme. As a result of the experience gained on the scheme he secured work as a cabinet maker. When I left secondary school I joined a FÁS horticultural course in Clonroche. I furthered my education and went on to third level agricultural college. There are people who will never have that opportunity.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to look into their hearts and re-think this decision. The FÁS schemes should be restored. It looks like 5,000 places will go this year and another 5,000 next year and the FÁS schemes will be at an end in about three or four years time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this is the biggest political mistake the Government has made. We listened for 20 years to employed people asking why those on social welfare were not asked to do work for the community. The FÁS community employment scheme was probably the greatest invention of any government in Europe. It was the one thing that worked and because it works now the Government wants to stop it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A man in my constituency spent many years in England. He came home but he was unemployed for 15 years. He was not well but he was on unemployment assistance. He was pressurised by <Col N="1223" /> social welfare to look for work. I advised him to go on a FÁS scheme. He began work in a local community and it was then discovered that he was the finest stonemason in the county. He had not worked for 15 years but he now employs two people full time. He has enough work for six months in advance. He is proof of the success of the FÁS schemes. Only for the scheme he would never have gone looking for work because he had lost his self-confidence and thought he would never work again. This is proof that the schemes work and they should not be interfered with.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the Government always goes for a soft target. These people should be given a break. The Minister and the Government should look at the top end of society if they are short of money. I am aware that people do not like me raising this matter but Alex Ferguson is probably earning £2 million a year from Manchester United. He owns a wonderful horse called Rock of Gibraltar who is put to stud in this country. That horse earns £100,000 a time and Mr. Ferguson will not have to pay one penny tax on that sum in this country. He does not live here and makes no contribution to this country and yet poor people on social welfare who are on FÁS schemes are going to lose their jobs. The Acting Chairman is aware of the good work done by FÁS and the operation he has set up would not take place without the FÁS schemes.</P>
    <P>Many other projects throughout the west would not be operating without FÁS workers. People with special needs require assistance and it all started with FÁS. People were given health training. The health boards have now taken over responsibility. I do not understand why central government wants to abolish the FÁS schemes. These schemes have done more work than the local authorities because all they are good for is collecting money. There is a sign outside every town and village in the country which says that FÁS workers have contributed to local projects.</P>
    <P>The voluntary sector runs the tidy towns competitions with the assistance of FÁS and does good work for communities. The Minister of State is from the west of Ireland and he was recently invited to attend a meeting in Galway where a lot of people were angry about the future of the FÁS schemes. Is it not better to pay people the &euro;24 a week more than having them drawing down social welfare payments and making no contribution to the State? They are not doing themselves any good but if they are on a FÁS scheme they are doing some good for the community and the country. They are being re-trained and discover skills they never knew they had. They could then become employers like the man in Mayo and not be a burden on the State. The system worked in his case. We should not do away with a system that worked.</P>
    <P>I know that the Progressive Democrats would not have much respect for FÁS schemes and their workers. Why do Fianna Fáil Members not rebel and say that it is not right and that they will not <Col N="1224" /> vote in favour of the proposal? I compliment Deputy Hogan for putting this motion before the House.</P>

      <P>I also compliment Deputy Hogan on tabling this motion. I welcome the contributions of Deputies &ndash; there was little with which I would disagree. It is important to put in context what is happening. Some &euro;275 million has been provided in the Estimates for CE schemes this year. That is in addition to &euro;46 million for the jobs initiative and a further &euro;20.5 million, up from &euro;6.6 million in 2001, for the social economy programme so it is far from a case of schemes being discontinued. There is a reduction of 5,000 but at a time when the number of long-term unemployed is down to 1.2%, or to 21,000 people. Given the change which has taken place in the labour market since CE schemes were put in place to tackle long-term unemployment, it is appropriate we review those schemes and make some reductions in the numbers. I am satisfied we will have better CE schemes as a result of the initiatives being taken.</P>
      <P>We have three objectives in respect of this review. For the first time there will be a policy change whereby CE schemes, which were introduced as a labour market programme, will be extended to include community service programmes. I agree with what all the Deputies across the House have said and while community service has grown and provided good services over the years, those services were never recognised as part of Government policy but they will be under this review. We will put in place good quality, cost effective and efficient community services.</P>
      <P>In my travels around the country it has been made clear to me, and I am sure to all those in the House, including my backbenchers, that there is quite a divergence between the best and most high quality CE schemes and the worst CE schemes which need to be made much better. Part of this review will be to improve that service to the community. No more than any other expenditure of taxpayers' money, the money spent providing that service must be cost efficient, effective and spent on the basis that it provides a good quality service. It is also important to note that a community receiving a service from a CE scheme must make its own contribution. We must ensure we do not destroy volunteerism which was strong, particularly in rural areas, as has been mentioned by some Deputies opposite. We will develop CE schemes where we see good voluntary effort and a contribution from communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major concern expressed in the House, and one which I have made a priority, is that where it is quite clear that people cannot progress from CE schemes, we must do everything possible to try to provide them with CE places. I am especially anxious to try to deal with the problem of those who are over 55 years of age, to whom Deputy Callanan referred, in areas where it is <Col N="1225" /> clear there are no job opportunities and who, for whatever reason, cannot go on to employment. We will try to make a special effort in the review to deal with that problem. I have already had discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, with a view to looking at initiatives to ensure people do not go back on unemployment assistance and are given the opportunity to make a contribution. If and when we come up with new proposals on that, I hope we will get the support of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>I refer to those with disabilities who for some reason are unable to progress. Let us be straight about it; the progression element of CE schemes has been their success, as has been mentioned by Deputies, and Deputy Ring gave the best example. We want to ensure progression, so we will improve the training side. Where people are unable to progress because of disability or age or because they live in areas of the country or city where there are no opportunities, we will make every effort to try to look after them. I am confident the review will give us better community employment schemes, albeit with some slight reduction in numbers but certainly nothing which will be catastrophic.</P>

      <P>This is an important debate and I congratulate Deputy Hogan on his initiative in tabling this motion for discussion. FÁS means growth, support and looking after communities. It started off as AnCO, An Comhairle Oiliúna, and became involved in education and retraining. The community employment schemes have been the star of communities in urban and rural areas. It is unacceptable and reprehensible to those communities that the Minister proposes to cut those schemes. It is probably the unkindest cut of all because these schemes were successful in the good times. Given the Government's budgetary proposals, we anticipate that things will get worse yet that is the time to change the emphasis &ndash; not to take away community supports, but to improve them. As times get tougher more people will be on the margins of our society. People living in rural and disadvantaged urban communities will be the first to feel the brunt of this Government whip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1226" />Last night the Minister for Health and Children announced a cut back in respect of basic medication for people who are ill. This is an example of a tax on the ill. The sicker and more unfortunate one is in terms of one's health, the more money one will have to pay to the doctor or chemist. This is part of Government policy, that is, to tax the weakest and sickest and to tax those who are least able and untrained to get a job and who are in a bad way.</P>
    <P>As part of my job as spokesperson for community, rural and Gaeltacht affairs, I visited Mountjoy jail where I spoke to the governor. He said that if one looks at the addresses of the many hundreds of petty criminals who end up in jail, one will see they come from six or seven district electoral divisions, DEDs, in Dublin. The majority of petty criminals have suffered from and continue to suffer from disadvantage. They suffer from educational disadvantage because they often leave school early and there are poor supports in their communities for them.</P>
    <P>The major problem in Dublin city is drug abuse among young people. There are approximately 13,000 drug addicts in Dublin, more than 6,400 of whom are on methadone maintenance. I have visited some of these methadone maintenance clinics and last week I visited one not far from here in which I asked about the implications of Government policy and how these cutbacks, if effected, would affect these people and their communities. It will have a deep and lasting affect on these communities. What will suffer are the community organisations which set up, sustain and support these people, particularly in the drugs task force areas or in the partnership areas, which are defined areas in which social inclusion is supposed to be the model and community involvement is important.</P>
    <P>I welcome the 16% rise in the allocation for the national drugs strategy. At the same time, the Government is cutting back on those very schemes that will help those people to re-train and re-educate and to get involved and participate in their local communities. It really does not make sense. These schemes are an essential part of our community and this Government is acting in a disgraceful manner in cutting them back.</P>
    <P>A recent crime report by the Garda has shown that the detection and conviction rate for drug offenders have risen by 33% nationally. I welcome the fact that more drug offenders are being detected but the fact that it is increasing means that this problem is getting larger in our community. Tackling the drug problem is all the more important as a result of this development. Tackling the underlying reasons for taking drugs in the first place is necessary for the future of our young people.</P>
    <P>If we look at the budget of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, there is a cut of 16% for community and voluntary services. That will have a dramatic, negative impact on rural life. This scheme offers a wide range of supports for local help groups, community <Col N="1227" /> development and a scheme of community supports for elderly people. In general these schemes are put in place to enable communities to cope in the short-term and grow in the long-term. These community schemes are being as heavily hit by this withdrawal of the community employment schemes as anywhere else.</P>
    <P>These cuts will have a further debilitating effect on the aged and disabled, especially in isolated rural areas. This double blow to those who need help the most is very cruel indeed. This Government has decided that these people are a soft target to take the blame for the Government's gross mismanagement of the public finances.</P>
    <P>We should be encouraging people to invest and stay in the west, and encouraging new initiatives in communities to keep people there, where there is major depopulation in many areas. It is not acceptable that the western investment fund has been cut by 68%. To create a new dynamic in the west, a new interest and awareness in business and to attract new investment, we need organisations like the Western Development Commission, which it is necessary to support. This fund was designed to create future jobs and investment in the west. The fact these savage cuts have been made by the Government will leave the people of the west without any real confidence in creating jobs themselves and getting themselves involved in their community. Self help and working together to attract new industry and new jobs into areas should be an essential part of our community.</P>
    <P>I utterly condemn the Minister for what he is doing. If we look at partnerships, and at my own area of Drogheda in County Louth, tremendous work has been done by community employment schemes. Look at the work of the Drogheda Partnership, go and visit the breakfast clubs and the lone parents working in them. Children get their breakfast before they go to school, they come in for lunch and then come back in the evening to do their homework. There is a fantastic community support in these partnerships and community employment schemes. By attacking them and effectively destroying work and initiative in our communities, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey has done a very bad job. It is an absolute shame this is happening. When things are disimproving is the most important time to get in and support the people who really need help.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all of the contributors to this debate. It was a useful exercise to hear the views of all sides of the House on the considerable effectiveness of the community employment schemes. The schemes have been in place since the mid 1980s in order to support communities in various work and activities, particularly in resource centres, environmental works, community halls, parish halls and sporting organisations. A wide range of community activity has galvanised itself in terms of community development to give succour and support to people in <Col N="1228" /> order to boost the self esteem of participants and the self reliance of communities, enabling them to do things they could not have done without the help of that scheme.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Power that it is important that we have people who are healthy and in a position to go to work rather than doing nothing. Many speakers emphasised the small sum of money that would be required of the State to keep people on community employment schemes rather than consigning them to social welfare. The difference between participation on a community employment scheme and going on the unemployment assistance register is a mere &euro;1.24 per hour. If you take account of the material grants that are available, together with the support of the sponsor organisation, there is no net gain or not loss to the State arising from its involvement in this scheme. There is a huge gain, however, in terms of the self esteem of the participants and in terms of the community projects in which they have been involved.</P>
      <P>This is not simply a matter of the Government trying to balance the books, it goes much deeper. The great community partnership that has been built up would not have been achieved without these schemes. The tidy towns competition has been mentioned. Villages and towns around Ireland and community organisations in inner-city Dublin would not be able to do these things without the support of these important organisations.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael believes fundamentally in promoting enterprise, whether in terms of self-reliance, community initiative and enterprise or promoting individual self-worth. All citizens must have an equality of opportunity to participate for the benefit of themselves and their society. The community employment scheme has developed into an important community initiative. It would be a very sad day for this country if the scheme was reduced even further than it is being at the moment.</P>
      <P>I tabled this motion to ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to leave the scheme at 2002 levels of participation. I recognise that their is a difficult financial situation, not of the making of the Opposition but of the Government. The irresponsibility, mismanagement and incompetence with which the country's finances were discharged by the previous Government has brought about a situation where we have a massive reduction in the Estimates programme across a range of activities for 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where there is clear evidence that there is no net loss to the Exchequer from the continued participation at 2002 levels of the community employment schemes, I do not understand the logic or the philosophy of this Government in removing those schemes. We should have a re-think about this. I was delighted to see the Fianna Fáil backbenchers participating so eloquently in the debate and effectively supporting the motion before the House. They have been around their own constituencies telling community groups that <Col N="1229" /> they will get the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, down and that he will look after them&mdash;</P>

      <Quest>her proposals and those of the Government in relation to rent subsidy; and the new regulations she intends to introduce.</Quest>
      <QRef>[24850/02]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered by the health boards, provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. Payment is subject to certain conditions, one of which relates to the amount of rent a person may incur. Each health board sets a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur, taking the household size and other relevant circumstances into account. This is to ensure the rent is reasonable and that the health board is not subsidising the cost of overly large or overly expensive accommodation. Another condition is that each applicant is required to pay a minimum contribution towards his or her accommodation costs.</P>
      <P>I am introducing two changes in relation to rent supplements. First, I have decided to maintain, at their current levels, the maximum rent levels set by the health boards. The current maximum rent levels will remain in place until the end of December 2003. Regulations giving effect to this were introduced last month. I decided to do this because rent levels have been stable for some time and, accordingly, there is no need for health boards to set higher levels of maximum rents for the purposes of the supplementary welfare allowance rent supplement scheme. I will arrange to have details of the levels appropriate to the different family sizes across all health boards made available to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, I have decided to increase the minimum contribution that each person is required to pay towards his or her accommodation costs. The minimum contribution is currently &euro;7.62 per week and has not been increased since 1994. When the minimum contribution was set at &euro;7.62 or £6 per week in 1994, it represented 10.2% of the personal rate of SWA. As I announced recently, I intend to restore the minimum contribution to approximately 10% of the minimum personal social welfare rate. Regulations giving effect to this change will be introduced shortly. <Col N="1231" /> Apart from these two changes, I have no other plans to amend the conditions for receipt of rent supplements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think it is fair to introduce these changes at a time when thousands depend on rent subsidy and there is a housing crisis? The spending of over &euro;300 million per year on rent subsidy represents mismanagement by the Government. If it put that money into providing social or affordable housing, we would not have half the problems we have. Does the Minister think it is fair that a lone parent in receipt of a social welfare payment of &euro;137.50 per week should have to pay more on rent because of the changes she is introducing? Would it not be better if the Government targeted those charging high rents rather than the weak in society who depend on rent supplement? What will happen in the case of those who cannot afford the increased amount? We cannot regulate for one person or two or three people to get a three bedroomed or four bedroomed house. In many towns and cities one must take what one can get &ndash; what is available. Sometimes the only accommodation available for a lone parent with one child is a three bedroomed house. We cannot regulate for this because of the shortage of houses. How will the Minister assist those in receipt of social welfare payments who will have to pay more on rent when they can hardly live on their existing payment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated, there has not been an increase in the minimum contribution since 1994. The elderly will not be under any pressure in the context of the rent supplement. It might be beneficial if I advised the Deputy of the maximum rent supplement made available. For a couple with one child or a one parent family with one child, to which the Deputy alluded, the maximum rent supplement made available in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area is &euro;953 per month. The maximum rent supplement made available in the Western Health Board area is &euro;175 per week. These are substantial amounts and represent the variable rents charged in respective parts of the country.</P>
      <P>There has not been an increase since 1994 in the contributions recipients are required to pay. The minimum increase will still represent 10% of the rate of supplementary welfare allowance, which pertained heretofore. Given the increases in social welfare payments, the increase will be in equilibrium with the position that pertained in 1994.</P>
      <P>I appreciate and agree that in the context of housing difficulties many constituents are looking for houses and would like to be facilitated. The scheme available supports those on low incomes, who are under pressure. As the Deputy is aware, community welfare officers are more than flexible in supporting those in greatest need and I am sure they will continue that ethos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1232" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Government not cap rents rather than attack those on low incomes? Threshold is concerned about this matter. Has the Minister meet its representatives? Does she understand what they are saying about the problems these changes will create? Many who depend on rent subsidy are worried about these changes? The Minister is right in saying social welfare officers are understanding. Some are very good. The health boards do a good job and are reasonable. Why is the Government targeting those on low incomes and not taking on those who charge high rents? This is a sovereign country. There is a shortage of housing. Why is the Government not doing something to address the problem? It should not be attacking those who are trying to provide homes for their families in difficult circumstances due to the shortage of accommodation. It must assist those on low incomes. If such people find it difficult to cope, the Government must instruct the health boards to deal with them in a reasonable way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The ethos of the scheme is to support those who are less well off and cannot manage. I am sure Deputies will agree that one of the problems is that landlords are increasing rents to the level of the maximum rent supplement available from the health boards under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. There is a proposal to establish a private residential tenancy board. I will consult my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, in that regard. We would like those who are less well off not to be exploited in the private rented market. The supplementary welfare allowance rent subsidy scheme is in place to support those who are less well off. The take up of the scheme reflects the fact that we are supportive of those in most need.</P>

      <Quest>the additional resources her Department is making available to community welfare officers to deal with hardship among low income families in acquiring medical care in the wake of the Government's decision not to extend the medical card scheme to 200,000 additional people; her views on whether this is an adequate substitute for a medical card; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of medical cards is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by community welfare officers employed by the health boards, is the Government's guaranteed minimum income scheme. The purpose of the scheme is to provide assistance for those who have inadequate income in order that no person in the State suffers hardship because of a lack of basic financial resources. <Col N="1233" /> Under the terms of the scheme, a health board may make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of his or her weekly income. These payments are known as exceptional needs payments. They are made at the discretion of the health board, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and the relevant circumstances of each case.</P>
      <P>Exceptional needs payments are not intended to be a substitute for a medical card or for any other State service and it would not be good practice to think of them in that way. In the circumstances, I do not envisage any additional role for community welfare officers in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>The origin of this question is that I heard a Fianna Fáil Deputy advise that it might be the way to deal with the failure of the Government to honour its commitment to give medical cards to 200,000 working class people. Is the Minister aware that this originated in a desire to assuage the deep anger and disappointment of these people, who felt betrayed by the Government reneging on its solemn commitment?</P>
      <P>Will people who are slightly above the medical card threshold eligibility limits, which are abysmally low, and who find themselves strapped for cash and suffering hardship after having to purchase medicines and pay their GP, be assisted with a supplementary welfare allowance? Under section 266 of the 1993 Act, which outlines the grounds for entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance, would the chief executive officer of the health board be able to advise the superintendent community welfare officer that he or she could look favourably on people who might find themselves in such straitened financial circumstances and unable to pay those bills? What is the position in that regard? Would the Minister be prepared, particularly in the case of people who anticipated that they would get medical cards, which would be highly important to them from a psychological as well as a financial viewpoint, to provide an increase in the moneys available to the health boards to enable them to meet hardship payments, particularly those which might arise due to an outbreak of measles or some other disease in a family? These might not be once-off occurrences. A family might be obliged to meet these exceptional medical outlays a couple of times during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to answer a question which involves another Minister's responsibilities. The Minister indicated in the health strategy that he will continue to pursue significant improvements in medical card provision. The Deputy is correct that there is flexibility, at the discretion of the chief executive officer, to sanction the provision of a medical card where the chief executive officer considers that a person's medical needs or other circumstances justify it. <Col N="1234" /> That flexibility is available to deal with people with particular health or financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>I do not envisage SWA or exceptional needs payments being used in the provision of additional State services. It would be best to approach the chief executive officer and the chief superintendent of the relevant health board to seek the exercise of his or her discretion with regard to specific needs. The exceptional needs payments are used in exceptional circumstances, such as for the purchase of exceptional commodities which people could not reasonably fund from their weekly payments.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme, in conjunction with the Northern Ireland concessionary travel scheme, provides free travel on cross-Border routes for passholders of both jurisdictions. This scheme applies to cross-Border journeys and not to travel exclusively within either jurisdiction. There is a commitment in the programme for Government to putting in place an all-Ireland free travel scheme for pensioners resident in all parts of this island. I plan to advance this proposal as quickly as possible over the term of this Government.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of proposals for extending entitlement to free travel to people living outside Ireland, including the report of the task force on policy regarding emigrants which was submitted to the Minister for Foreign Affairs earlier this year. At EU level a report, Towards a Senior Euro Pass, was commissioned by the social affairs directorate of the European Commission and published by Age Concern, England, at the end of 1997. This report recommends that EU states should establish a senior euro pass card which would entitle older people to concessions on various services, including travel, cultural and social activities. Developments in this area would have to be advanced at EU level.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's proposal to make free travel available to persons in receipt of Irish pensions but living abroad will be examined in a future budgetary context, taking account of the other demands for extension of the free travel scheme, the cost implications, compatibility with EU law and administrative implications.</P>

      <P>This matter arises a great deal among elderly Irish people living in England who <Col N="1235" /> are anxious to have this facility. These are the forgotten people who did so much for this country. They sent back more money to this country than the EU ever provided in equivalent terms. They feel forgotten. In the spirit of Article 2 of the Constitution, does the Minister not agree that Irish-born emigrants who return to Ireland, even on short visits, should have their previous residence status taken into account and should be entitled to free travel, especially as the task force has recommended that this should be the case? If students are entitled to free travel, I cannot see why old age pensioners, particularly our own citizens, should not have the same entitlement. Does the Minister agree that this matter is important for Irish people living abroad and that we should provide this facility?</P>

      <P>I am from County Donegal so I am aware that many people who live in the UK and travel home regularly would like to be facilitated under the free travel scheme. My first priority will be to provide for a free travel scheme throughout the island of Ireland and then, in the context of the task force report, to examine the provision of those additional services which people who live abroad are seeking. The Deputy made a submission in that regard and it has been taken on board by the task force. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is taking the lead in the implementation of the report. He is considering a number of issues, among them the issue raised by the Deputy. There are currently 27,000 people living abroad in receipt of a contributory pension from my Department. Although it is difficult to estimate the cost of providing a free travel pass, I am sure we will look towards implementing it in the context of the implementation of the task force report, in consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>

    <P>65. <b>Mr. Ring</b> asked the Minister for Social and Family Affairs when the dispute between her Department and the Irish Dental Association will be settled; if settled, the amount of money which was saved by her Department during the dispute; and the compensation which will be paid to the PRSI workers who have lost out due to this dispute.

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The dispute between my Department and the Irish Dental Association arose out of a claim by the association for substantial increases in the fees payable to dentists under the scheme. The action taken involved the imposition of increased charges by some dentists in breach of the contractual arrangements for the provision of dental benefit. This action commenced in early March this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Patients continued to be treated under the scheme at that stage while efforts were made to <Col N="1236" /> find a resolution to the underlying issue. In the absence of a resolution, my Department ceased in early August to accept claims from dentists who were not prepared to adhere to the contractual arrangements. However, the scheme continued to operate and patients continued to be treated by dentists who were prepared to adhere to their contracts. Following a temporary suspension of the action in October the association subsequently rejected proposals put to it and advised members to resume the action. Claims received while the association action was suspended have been processed in the normal way. The position in relation to those dentists who have resumed their action is that claims are not being accepted from them and their patients are being advised of the position.</P>
    <P>Efforts to resolve the dispute are continuing but so far it has not been possible to reach agreement in a way which would afford the necessary level of protection for insured workers. Insured workers have been advised through the newspapers to check that their dentist is not imposing increased charges prior to starting treatment. They have also been advised that, where dentists offer to treat people as private patients, this is outside the terms of the dental benefit scheme and the Department will not be in a position to refund any costs arising. To do otherwise would undermine my efforts to secure a settlement which affords patients protection against the application of full private fees.</P>
    <P>It will not be possible to assess the impact of the dispute on expenditure under the scheme until a settlement is reached and the impact on claims experience has been evaluated. At this stage, expenditure on the scheme in 2002 is budgeted at &euro;35 million, the same level as applied in 2001.</P>

      <P>The Minister has sacked the dentists despite the fact that members of the public have paid their PRSI and that we were led to believe from the previous Question Time that this issue would be resolved last month. Members of the public are being told by their dentists to contact their local Deputies. How many queries has the helpline received? What will be done for the people who have paid PRSI and have had to pay again to obtain dental treatment? How will the Minister compensate them?</P>
      <P>Her reply stated that the &euro;35 million provided in the budget was the same as was provided last year. Does that not prove what I have said all along, that this dispute is being used by the Department to save money? What will the Minister do for the people who obey the law of the land, pay their PRSI yet cannot obtain the service for which they have paid? It is like paying car insurance on which the insurance company will not pay out when one has an accident. What will the Minister do for my constituents and those of other Members?</P>

      <P>They are not being protected if full private fees are expected of these patients when there is a contract with the Department. I appreciate that the Irish Dental Association had concerns in the context of the fees available. I have always said and reiterate that I am more than prepared to negotiate, but I cannot do so when people are trying to get rid of the scheme. The scheme is a good one but I cannot have people making PRSI contributions, expecting dental treatment and not receiving it under agreed contracts I have with dentists.</P>
      <P>I have negotiated on a number of occasions and put forward numerous proposals to safeguard the scheme but they have not been accepted by certain members of the dental profession. That is not to say there are not others in the profession who are participants in the scheme and who provide a service. I cannot allow people working within the scheme to proceed while also allowing others outside it to proceed as well. I would like to see a resolution to the dispute.</P>
      <P>I agree that I said at the previous Question Time that we almost had an agreement, but it was not acceptable to the dentists. I believe they want private fees and I cannot agree to that. Otherwise there is no relevance to the dental benefit scheme. It is a good and worthwhile one from which people who pay PRSI believe they get value for money and a service. I am trying to protect that.</P>
      <P>I reiterate my availability and that of my Department to examine realistically the cost of dental care and our openness to an independent evaluation if needs be. I also offered the option of an independent arbitrator where the dentists felt they could not work with my officials or myself. None of these offers was availed of. I would like the scheme and its participants protected and I would also like the dentists to be realistic and accept the proposals I have made.</P>

      <P>A person claiming an unemployment payment is expected to make reasonable efforts to obtain employment suitable to his or her age, educational qualifications, skills and experience. A person would be regarded as not being available for work if he or she imposed unreasonable restrictions on the nature of the employment he or she would accept or the location of that employment.</P>
      <P>It would be expected that any person seeking employment, whether in an urban or rural area, would be willing to travel a reasonable distance to take up employment. In determining what is reasonable in a certain case, a deciding officer would have regard to the availability of public or private transport and the availability of local employment opportunities. Account would also be taken of average distances travelled to work by other members of the community.</P>
      <P>If an unemployed person refuses an offer of employment because of the distance involved, account would be taken of the difficulty in getting to work and the possibilities which exist in that regard. Deciding officers have a level of discretion in determining what is reasonable in such circumstances and, generally, this is not an issue which gives rise to major difficulties. In addition, if a person is refused a payment for this or other reasons, he or she has the option of appealing to the social welfare appeals office which is independent in the exercise of its functions and to which the person can outline the circumstances of his or her case. If the Deputy is aware of a difficulty in a case, I am happy to meet him and have the matter dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The question was framed in the context of rural Ireland. I have no doubt the Minister is aware of the exceptional difficulties experienced there, especially with the lack of public transport.</P>
      <P>When people in rural areas are offered a job, there are two issues with which they must grapple. The first is that it is likely they will have to purchase a car. This involves not only the outlay for the purchase but also for insurance, tax and running costs, something I have no doubt will be more expensive today after the Minister of Finance has had a crack at it. The second issue is whether the offer of work will lead to them losing their medical card. Those are major issues for people.</P>
      <P>How does the Minister's Department evaluate a person's availability for work? What criteria are used to establish a single person's circumstances in the context of availability for work? In evaluating a single parent's work availability, is any consideration given to his or her responsibility for caring for children and the fact that he or she would have to employ a babysitter?</P>
      <P>People want to return to work and re-enter the workforce. Many people are being needlessly removed from FÁS schemes and placed on the live register again for the sake of saving a mere &euro;24 each week. They are stressed out by this.

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no definition of &ldquo;reasonable distance&rdquo;. What is taken into consideration is the employment situation in each county or area and whether public or private transport is available. I appreciate that work is difficult to find in some rural areas and travelling to it is also difficult. The Deputy adverted to the cost attached to it.</P>
      <P>The definition of being available for work was queried by the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs and I advised the Chairman I would be in touch regarding this matter. We want people to make a reasonable effort to look for employment. This should be followed through in cases of difficult circumstances. We did not go to three or four different employers to ask them for a letter because there was no job available. That is not acceptable. However, if a reasonable effort is made by someone to look for work, that is accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other schemes like the back-to-work and back-to-education schemes. Lone parents and carers are allowed to work a number of hours and keep their secondary benefits. The schemes are in place to allow people to move beyond <Col N="1240" /> unemployment and into work and from there into greater employment. The good reductions in tax, introduced by the Minister for Finance during the years, have made life much easier. Having said that, if the Deputy knows of a particular case involving the availability for work scheme or a problem with travel, I would be happy to meet him to discuss it.</P>

      <P>An interdepartmental working group has recently completed a comprehensive review of the existing school meals schemes. The review was carried out as part of my Department's programme of school expenditure reviews and involved extensive consultation with relevant organisations, including local authorities involved in the administration of the schemes. The working group have concluded that school meals arrangements have continued relevance and have made proposals for a programme of food provision in the school setting.</P>
      <P>Establishing a new targeted scheme of school meals for disadvantaged pupils is a very significant task that requires consultation between the relevant Departments, schools and other interested bodies. These consultations are ongoing and include consideration of the appropriate criteria for selecting areas or schools for inclusion in the new scheme. These criteria have not been decided as yet, but the focus will be on tackling poverty and promoting social inclusion. In that regard, the commitment in the review of the national anti-poverty strategy, Building an Inclusive Society, to reduce the number of young people who leave the school system early is particularly relevant. By targeting those schools with the highest levels of early school leaving, the new school meals system will help achieve education objectives, as well as health, nutrition and social inclusion objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending finalisation of the review, funds amounting to &euro;700,000 were made available in 2002 towards the food costs of voluntary and community groups and schools currently providing meals outside the existing scheme. The conclusions of the working group will be submitted to the Government in the near future at which <Col N="1241" /> stage the details of any new arrangements will be finalised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply. I hope the criteria will not be fobbed off because of budgetary constraints or anything else. Does the Minister agree that this is one of the most cost effective ways of tackling poverty and promoting social inclusion? Does she also agree it is a very cost effective way of helping to tackle educational disadvantage by keeping young people at school? Has she or her officials evaluated the Combat Poverty Agency recommendation, which called for the enhancement of the school meals scheme over three years? What has come out of the review group? Was it in agreement with the Combat Poverty Agency submission, which recommended that the meals should include breakfast and hot lunch as part of a targeted initiative to tackle dropping out from school? It also recommended standardising eligibility criteria to increase the take up of the scheme to about 100,000 children. Does the Minister agree the criteria are somewhat <i>ad hoc</i> as matters now stand? Does she also agree there would only be a minimal cost of &euro;15 million to extend it to 100,000 children?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy in saying it is one of the best schemes for dealing with poverty and nutrition and in support of those who are less well off. A tremendous pilot scheme was carried out involving breakfast clubs, lunch clubs and homework clubs, which reflect the proposals of the Combat Poverty Agency as well as those of the expenditure review group. In the very near future I hope to consider advancing the pilot scheme which has shown more than value for money and is a good investment in young people. In particular, we will target those who leave secondary school early, which was not previously a focus of the scheme.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three weekly rates of child dependant allowances payable to social welfare recipients, &euro;16.80, &euro;19.30 and &euro;21.60. Since the time of the report of the commission on social welfare, which recommended a rationalisation of the rates of child dependant allowances, the number of rates has been reduced from 36 to the current three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy direction followed by successive Governments has been to concentrate resources for child income support on the child benefit scheme rather than the child dependant allowances, as the loss of child dependant allowances by social welfare recipients on taking up employment can act as a disincentive to availing of work <Col N="1242" /> opportunities. Child benefit is neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parents and consequently does not contribute to such potential poverty traps.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to this policy is reflected in the substantial resources we have invested in the child benefit scheme. Over our first three budgets annual expenditure on child benefit increased to &euro;730.1 million, a rise of more than 40% above the levels in 1996. The subsequent payment in June 2001 of the historic increases in child benefit rates followed by increases of the same order from April 2002 meant that total Government investment in the scheme has risen to some &euro;1.556 billion.</P>
    <P>As a direct consequence of this policy, we have moved from a position in 1994 where 70% of child income support for a family claiming social welfare payments was in the form of child dependant allowances to a position where child dependant allowance now accounts for approximately 35%.</P>
    <P>The vastly improved child benefit rates are paid for children of all ages. This provides a major support for parents on a consistent basis regardless of employment status or income levels. In view of this, the substantial investment in the child benefit scheme, which the Government has made in recent years, has been of major benefit to families and is a most effective use of the resources available for child income support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's preference is for the rationalisation of child dependant allowances, if possible. Given that she has said in the House this will probably not be possible due to budgetary considerations, as a short-term measure the reorganisation of child dependant allowances on an age basis might be a good interim step as the current rates are arbitrary and do not recognise the circumstances in which some families find themselves. The Minister should particularly address the case of parents of multiple birth children.</P>

      <P>I gave my answer in the context of age difference as specified in the question.

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It all depends on how old the children are, as the Deputy knows. There is a premise that younger children are more expensive than older children, but I would not quite agree. It is the policy of the Government to give support through child benefit, which has had a real effect on poverty and addresses the issue of child poverty in particular. Under the CDAs <Col N="1243" /> there is a differential between the long-term and the short-term. It can&mdash;</P>

Over one year a family on the lowest rate is &euro;250 worse off, which makes a big difference to those on social welfare. The Minister, as a mother, knows the Constitution recognises that all children are equal. I call on the Government to ensure all child support payments are paid at the higher rate in order that every child in the State is treated equally. If it is not done in the budget today, I hope it will be done in the Finance Bill. I ask the Minister, as a parent, whether she thinks the current position is right.</P>

      <P>In the context of dealing with child poverty issues and child care, the child benefit scheme is a most appropriate scheme and the one that creates greater universality and equity. It is also more realistic in the context of assisting people on social welfare to move into employment as the loss of the child dependant allowances can often act as a disincentive to work, whereas child benefit is universally available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the week ending 25 October 2002 there was a total of 8,339 unemployment assistance claims awaiting a decision. The numbers were broken down as follows: pending for less than one week, 1,947; pending between one and four weeks, 3,752; pending between four and eight weeks, 1,702; and pending more than eight weeks, 938.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All customers applying for an unemployment payment, including unemployment assistance, are required to establish their identity and proof of residence. Delays may occur while customers obtain the necessary documentation to satisfy these requirements. When a customer makes a claim for unemployment assistance he or she must also satisfy a number of conditions. He or <Col N="1245" /> she must be available for work and genuinely seeking work. Providing the required evidence in order to establish compliance with these conditions may lead to a delay in making a decision.</P>
    <P>In determining eligibility for unemployment assistance customers must also satisfy a means test. This may involve a home visit from an inspector of my Department. Depending on the complexity of the case, it may take some time to complete the means assessment, particularly if the customer is required to produce financial statements from banks and similar institutions or documentation in respect of other members of the household. From time to time some customers are not available for interview when the inspector calls. This, inevitably, leads to further delay while a new appointment is made to see the customer.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy I am conscious of the need to provide as efficient a service as possible to people claiming unemployment assistance and other services from my Department. It takes on average four weeks to process an unemployment assistance claim and my Department is taking steps to minimise the level of avoidable delay in these cases. Performance targets have been set for all the Department's main schemes and these are monitored and reported on regularly. I am confident an improved level of claim turnaround can be achieved and my Department is working to achieve this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I came here to ask questions and I am putting them through a suggestion. Once I make a suggestion, it is up to the Minister to reply. I suggest a less benign interpretation of the figures, namely, that in order to massage the unemployment figures, the time taken to deal with unemployment assistance claims is being extended. The figures speak for themselves. Almost 80% have been pending for two weeks or more. I suggest it does not take more than two to three weeks to deal with a simple unemployment assistance claim. Is this because the Government wants to make the unemployment figures appear better than they are? Is the Minister aware that most of the claims in question must be dealt with by the community welfare officer in the interim? </P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I repudiate the Deputy's claim. It is totally inappropriate to suggest we are massaging the unemployment figures as a consequence of delays in decision making with regard to eligibility. This is untrue. My job and duty is to ensure people who are in need of a payment get it. This is the reason we have social welfare allowances to facilitate people in the <Col N="1246" /> interim. The average turnaround is four weeks. I have monitored and will continue to monitor the turnaround in respect of all the schemes in the Department. As the Deputy will be aware, the live register figures are available at the end of every month and are reflected in the claims made and those paid. In the interim, while people are awaiting processing of their claims, they are eligible for the social welfare allowance. No-one will find himself or herself in financial difficulty as a consequence of the processing of his or her claim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the claims being processed included in the live register figures? Does the Minister believe it is right that people attending the labour exchange in possession of three letters are being asked to get a further three letters? Is it reasonable that persons living 40 miles away from the nearest town are being told they must go to that town to get a letter? It is not reasonable. How will the Minister address the problem of wasting people's time by sending them around the country in search of letters to keep them off the live register? Is it fair to upset people who are making every effort to get employment and producing the evidence they are asked to supply only to be told they must get further evidence? I envisage a court case being taken against the Department along the lines of cases brought under equality legislation. Is it fair to treat people like this just because they are unemployed?</P>

      <QRef>[24759/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Public servants employed after April 1995 pay class A PRSI and are insured for all benefits. Their occupational sick pay and pension arrangements are adjusted to reflect this. Historically, however, many public servants were excluded from full social insurance cover as it was considered they had adequate occupational provision within the terms of their employment to cover sick pay and pensions. This group of permanent and pensionable public servants was insured at class D which gives entitlement to a limited range of benefits, including widow's and widower's (contributory) pension, carer's benefit and bereavement grant.</P>
      <P>Manual workers and unestablished workers in the public sector were always insured at class A for all benefits. This meant that on promotion or on reaching the insurable limit, which operated until 1974, a person in this group could move from class A to class D. This change of social insurance class leads to people who worked in the public sector having a mix of full and modified insurance contributions, which can affect their entitlement to a contributory pension at retirement.</P>
      <P>A number of measures have been introduced over the years to give more flexibility in the pensions system and thereby allow more people with gaps in their insurance record to qualify. In 1988, a special partial old age contributory pension was introduced for those affected by the insurable limit based on achieving a yearly average of at least five contributions. At the time the standard qualifying conditions required an average of at least 20 contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently, the Government introduced a range of measures designed to ease the qualifying conditions for pensions so that people with mixed rate or interrupted insurance records could qualify for a pension. These include a reduction in the yearly average required for a standard pension to ten contributions, the introduction of pro-rata pensions for mixed rate insurance cases and special pensions for those with pre-1953 insurance and certain self-employed people. These measures, particularly those relating to the yearly average and pro-rata pensions, have over<Col N="1248" /> taken the improvements made in 1988. Many public servants benefited from these changes.</P>
    <P>In introducing improvements in this area I must be conscious of the social insurance principle which requires that a person applying for pension has a reasonable attachment to the social insurance system, both in terms of the nature and number of contributions they have paid. With this in mind, I am satisfied that there are adequate arrangements in place to ensure that people with reduced or mixed rate insurance records can receive a pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Minister's Department has dealt with the anomaly of the pre-1953 contributions, does she accept that class D stamps represent the major difficulty for people seeking entitlement to contributory old-age pension for people who worked, not only in the Civil Service, as she indicated in her answer, but also those who worked in semi-State bodies? Previously semi-State bodies contributed at the higher percentage of the paid workforce. Some State bodies have ceased to exist and because of that she needs to give particular attention to this anomaly.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister been made aware of the budget submission of the Irish Senior Citizens' Parliament, which suggested an equivalence between four class D stamps and one class A stamp as a measure that might get over this anomaly? Is that something which she would consider positively in bringing about such a reform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the submission regarding the four to one equivalence. The term &ldquo;public servants&rdquo; includes those in the semi-State sector. Full PRSI contributions are available to new entrants since 1995, so the anomaly no longer exists for them. Many people have been facilitated in the context of the pro-rata pensions, the mixed rate insurance contributions and the reduction in the contribution eligibility and also the pre-1953 ruling.</P>
      <P>I have looked at this issue but do not expect to be in a position to change class D stamps at present. Almost 27,300 people have been facilitated in the context of the overall changes. The new arrangements in place also facilitate many more people. The anomaly has been rectified since 1995.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister confirm that the class D contributions are paid into the social insurance fund?

It is, in effect, an additional tax for being employed in this sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71, 82 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>The income maintenance needs of asylum seekers are met, for the most part, through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered by the health boards. The main objective of the scheme is to make up the difference between a person's means, whether in cash or in kind, and their needs.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the scheme, a person's needs are defined in legislation as the value of the full standard rate of supplementary welfare allowance payable, taking into account the size of the household in question. The means test is also defined in legislation. Where a person has access to some resources in kind or in cash, this must be taken into account in determining the amount payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1250" />The full rate of supplementary welfare allowance is payable if a person has no means. A reduced rate is payable if the person has means, but not a sufficient amount of means. The reason that a reduced rate of allowance is paid to asylum seekers in the direct provision system is because they receive meals and other services under that system, which is operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>The recommended weekly allowance for people in the direct provision system is &euro;19.10 per adult and &euro;9.60 per child. Additional exceptional needs payments are made by the health boards in cases where they are deemed to be appropriate. The direct provision system was considered by an interdepartmental working group and the payment rate will be reviewed in the light of the group's report which is currently being examined.</P>
    <P>Asylum seekers who arrived before 10 April 2000, and some who arrived since then, live outside the direct provision system. In these cases, if they have no other means, they may receive the full standard rate of supplementary welfare allowance including rent supplements, diet supplements or heating supplements, as appropriate. The criteria for assessment are precisely the same as those applying to any other recipients. Following an assessment of their means, assistance may be provided to bring their income up to the appropriate level of supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>Details of social welfare recipients immigration status are not held on my Department's computer systems. It is not possible, therefore, to state how many full rate payments are made to asylum seekers or to refugees. However, the Department's records show that a total of 7,293 basic payments were made in respect of 18,856 people in the week ending 29 November 2002 to people who are outside the direct provision system, in cases where the head of household is a non-national. A total of 7,538 children were included in these payments. Some 6,246 rent supplements were also paid to non-nationals in the same week.</P>
    <P>These totals include payments to people who are asylum seekers, former asylum seekers who have been granted leave to remain in the State by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, refugees and other non-nationals with no present or former connection to the asylum system. The households in question include non-nationals with Irish-born children.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the allowance of &euro;19.10 has not been increased for over two years? Does she have any intention of providing an increased level of allowance?

      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 72 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>Recent data from the quarterly national household survey, published by the CSO, show that almost 51% of persons at work aged between 20 and 69 have supplementary occupational or personal pensions cover. The company in question used these CSO statistics with their own recently conducted research on attitudes and awareness in relation to pensions. Its research highlights that knowledge and understanding of pensions among those without cover is extremely poor.</P>
      <P>The proposed pensions information and awareness campaign is intended to raise awareness among individuals of the need to provide additional pension cover for themselves. The proposed campaign, which will be managed by the Pensions Board, will complement and support other measures which are designed to raise the numbers with supplementary pension cover. The Pensions Board in its report on the national pensions policy initiative estimated that 70% of workers over 30 years require supplementary pension cover if they are to maintain their pre-retirement standard of living. The Government aims to increase private pensions coverage in line with this target.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the personal retirement savings account, a low-cost, flexible pensions product, provided for in the Pensions (Amendment) Act, 2002, will be a key instrument of this strategy on foot of the Pensions Board's proposals. The Pensions Board has commenced the approval process for PRSA products and it is expected that the new products will be available to the public early in 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participation in a PRSA arrangement will not be compulsory for either the employee or the employer but employers will be required to facilitate this for their employees if they do not already provide an occupational pensions scheme. The take up of PRSAs and the position regarding pen<Col N="1253" /> sions coverage generally will be monitored and a review of the overall strategy will be undertaken within three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the position that a minority of self-employed people have taken out pensions? Does the Minister agree there is a significant lack of knowledge about pensions among consumers, particularly those who are self-employed? Is she aware that only 1% of those surveyed were knowledgeable about the types of pensions available? Apart from PRSAs, which are a good idea, what steps will the Minister take to promote the benefits of pensions and, in particular, the advantage that accrues from contributing to a pension scheme early? Has she a specific programme in mind to reach the workplace? Will she use IBEC, CIF and various unions to promote a campaign to make sure people are aware of the importance of pensions and the need to contribute at an early age, particularly if they are self-employed? Has the Minister set a target in terms of attracting people to take out flexible pensions that can be transferred from employment to employment, which is important for the self-employed?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>The number of recipients of retirement pension was 80,300 at end 2001 and has shown a gradual increase from 1997 when some 72,000 people benefited from the scheme. As of September this year 82,278 people were receiving retirement pension. It is estimated that about 3,000 people annually are affected by the retirement condition which applies to the retirement pension. However, in practice only a small number of these cases are refused retirement pension each year as most wait until they are 66 years of age and apply for the old age contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The retirement pension was introduced in 1970 and was intended to bridge the gap between retirement at 65 and the pension age for social welfare which at the time was 70 years of age. The qualifying condition for old age contributory pension was subsequently reduced to 66 years of age. In the circumstances, the retirement condition only applies to one year. The estimated cost of removing the retirement condition would be &euro;28 million per annum. There could also be <Col N="1255" /> knock-on costs in other areas of the social welfare system.</P>

The Government is also committed to examining and seeking to remove other financial disincentives for people of pension age who may want to continue some sort of employment. Progress in this regard will made as soon as possible having regard to the availability of resources and the priority attaching to other elements of the programme.</P>

Would it not be better if such individuals, who have paid their dues to the State, were allowed to do a day or two's work when it became available? Is there not a daft system in place?

      <Quest>the reason her Department underestimated the take up of the FIS payments arising from changes in budget 2002; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Family income supplement, FIS, is designed to provide income support for employees with families, who are on low earnings and thereby preserve the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where employees might only be marginally better off than if they were claiming other social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1256" />The calculation of FIS payments is based on a family's net earnings and the number of eligible children. Payments are made on a weekly basis over a guaranteed period of 52 weeks. Following the increase of &euro;34 in FIS income limits from January 2002, there were 11,796 people availing of the family income supplement at the end of November 2002, compared with 11,739 in December 2001.</P>
    <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the fact that the 2002 Estimates for FIS at budget time overestimated spending on the scheme this year. In effect, this occurred because both the number of recipients and the average value of payments turned out to be lower than had been expected.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to estimate FIS take up following changes in income limits with any precision as it is influenced by a wide range of factors such as employment growth, earnings growth, taxation changes, the income distribution of lower earners with families and the extent to which people are aware of the scheme. The lower than expected spending in 2002 is probably the result of a combination of these factors.</P>
    <P>The improvements made to FIS over the years together with the measures taken to increase awareness of the scheme resulted in a steady increase in the level of take up during the 1990s, peaking at 14,686 families at the end of 1999. Since then, although income limits have been increased annually to take account of improvements in the rates of other social welfare payments, the numbers in receipt of FIS have declined somewhat, probably reflecting the fact that fewer people now require the supplement.</P>
    <P>I believe this should be viewed as a positive trend and highlights the success of a range of Government measures which have improved net take home pay for the lower paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason that the take up was low is because people moved beyond the <Col N="1257" /> threshold into better income. We increased the thresholds and the value of lower paid work. Therefore, the necessity of the supplement has been eroded, but that is not to say that the scheme does not exist to support families in need.

It will not review it or increase the FIS payment. People have to wait. If somebody is in receipt of FIS, it means he or she is on a low income.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past five years, the budgets I introduced helped to secure the most sustained period of investment and growth in the history of our country. The over-riding objective of this budget is to consolidate those gains which we delivered in recent years and to provide the foundation for future growth.</P>
      <P>Our policies have ensured the end of the era of mass unemployment and emigration. We implemented a major step-up in the funding of our public services to help them to catch up and develop. We also introduced major tax and social welfare packages to the benefit of all in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To those who want to know where the resources generated in recent years have gone, the answer is clear. They are providing more <Col N="1258" /> health services, higher pensions, smaller class sizes and improving the living standards of both taxpayers and social welfare recipients alike.</P>
    <P>Today's budget has been framed in very different circumstances from those of previous years. On budget day last year, I published detailed projections for 2003 and 2004 which signalled projected deficits for each of those years. Since then, the situation has become more difficult because of the unexpected continued weakness of the international economy. In exactly the same way as every other government in Europe, we are now faced with clear budgetary pressures.</P>
    <P>In the past, we in this country chose to ignore the unfavourable economic reality and went ahead with policies we could not afford. All that those policies delivered, however, was rising budget deficits and higher unemployment. They provided no solution to our economic problems.</P>
    <P>There are those who want us to forget the lessons of the past. They want me to announce major spending increases, irrespective of the economic situation. However, my view is that the responsible policy is to take a moderate route and to take the necessary decisions now so that we ensure growth in the medium term. That is why my budget has been developed within a three-year framework.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Budget Objectives</i>This budget has three key objectives: protecting the weaker sections of society, investing in the future to position ourselves for a return to better growth levels and securing stable public finances to safeguard the gains we have already made. These are three core objectives to achieve the vision for Irish society which the Government and the social partners have. They are also central to the conclusions reached by the National Economic and Social Council in its recent strategy report.</P>
    <P>These are sound and achievable goals. They are right in themselves and right for the times we are now facing. They lay the foundations for renewed economic and budgetary progress by setting the fiscal framework for the next three years. They also put in place a framework within which discussions on a successor to the PPF can be based. Social partnership has played a key role in the story of our success so far. The Government is keen that it should continue to play the same role in this more difficult environment. The Government will be fair in determining where the pluses and minuses fall. The aim is to support those areas of critical importance to overall economic and social progress. In the new situation, we also need to be more flexible and innovative in how we generate, allocate and manage resources.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Economic Outlook</i>This time last year, I underlined the unusual degree of uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. The pick-up then expected in the major world economies in the second half of 2002 did not happen. As a result, our growth in GNP <Col N="1259" /> terms, at an estimated 1.8% this year, has been well below target. As in other countries, the slower than expected growth has had an adverse impact on our budgetary position.</P>
    <P>The short-term prospects for the international economy are not good. This year's budget is presented in the middle of a substantial international economic slowdown. The best that can be expected now is a global upturn in the second half of 2003. Next year, the euro area economy is expected to grow by 1.8% and that of the United States by 2.3%. Ireland is part of a common currency area where average inflation is not far above 2%. We must get our inflation rate down close to that level as soon as possible, otherwise we risk losing out on jobs.</P>
    <P>We have lost competitiveness in the past few years. Our priority must be to halt this slide and regain our position. Competitiveness creates jobs and wealth, and generates the resources needed to build the sort of society we all want.</P>
    <P>There are significant downside risks to all economic projections at this time. The difficulties in the Middle East, the continued question marks about a recovery in the information and communication technology sector and possible sharp exchange rate movements are but some of the more obvious ones.</P>
    <P>Growth in Ireland next year will be modest. The range of commentators' forecasts for 2003 is far narrower than last year, centring around 3% and 4% GDP growth. At this stage, my estimate for GDP growth next year is 3%, with prospects improving as we move into 2004 and 2005. GNP growth next year is projected at 2%. We cannot now expect to be approaching our potential GDP growth rate until some time in 2004 at the earliest.</P>
    <P>Employment is expected to grow next year by 11,000, with unemployment at around 5%. On the assumption of unchanged interest and exchange rates, and taking account of changes in this budget, consumer price inflation will be 4.8% and, depending on wage cost factors, should be on a downward trend. If we get our cost base under control, we can expect to see inflation come down significantly by 2005.</P>
    <P>Full details of the economic projections underlying the budget are included in the EU Stability Programme Update published with the budget today. This update will be assessed by the European Commission in the new year in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact and the accounting norms applied by Eurostat, the Commission's statistical agency.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Budgetary Projections</i>The 2003 budgetary targets are subject to the same risks I outlined earlier. These targets are as follows: an increase in gross spending on public services of 5.7%, bringing it to a total of &euro;38,015 million; a current budget surplus of &euro;3,685 million; a capital budget deficit of &euro;5,554 million; an Exchequer deficit of &euro;1,869 million, including a release of &euro;250 million from the capital services <Col N="1260" /> redemption account to meet interest costs on the national debt; a general Government deficit of &euro;885 million or 0.7% of GDP; and a debt ratio of 34% of GDP, the second lowest in the European Union.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Position in 2004 and 2005</i>In present circumstances, we have no choice but to move our expenditure, pay and cost levels onto a lower growth trajectory. Even by doing that we are facing the prospect of having to borrow more than &euro;3 billion in 2004 and again in 2005. The position is that in 2004 and 2005 we will face a large and continuing Exchequer borrowing requirement and a general Government deficit of around 1.2% of GDP, which will require us to continue to take the necessary corrective action.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Service Pay</i>As the House is aware, talks on a new national pay agreement and on the implementation of the recommendations of the public service benchmarking body are currently under way. Any such agreement would have to deal with the issues highlighted in the benchmarking body's report, including the need for real change. If there is a new agreement, one cost that will arise is in respect of the first phase increase under benchmarking. Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, this would be due to be paid with effect from 1 December 2001. The cost of this to the end of 2003, including arrears, is &euro;565 million and I am providing for same.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other pay and pay-related issues which are currently being dealt with in various processes. I do not intend to prejudge the outcome of any of these individual issues, but I consider it sensible to make a global provision of &euro;50 million in respect of the totality of these issues.</P>
    <P>The growth in the public service pay bill has to be contained. One factor in achieving this is restraint in relation to the level of pay increases and the Government is making its position clear in the national pay talks. The other main factor driving the rise in the pay bill is the growth in public service numbers. These have risen by about 50,000 over the past five years. As a first step, the Government has decided that numbers employed across all sectors of the public service are to be capped at their present authorised levels with immediate effect. In addition, the Government has decided that there will be a reduction of 5,000 in those numbers over the next three years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Spending</i>This Government is committed to spending such public resources as can be made available to provide for the welfare of our people. We have shown that commitment in the past and we will continue to do so in the future. When we had the extra resources we used them to provide much-needed additional public services, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" />We have achieved a lot in this respect since 1997, as the increase in spending between 1997 and 2003 shows. In that period, total gross spending, capital and current, will have increased from under &euro;19 billion to over &euro;38 billion, an increase of 102%.</P>
    <P>In that time, total health spending will have risen by &euro;5.2 billion to &euro;8.9 billion; total education spending will have risen by &euro;2.5 billion to &euro;5.6 billion; social welfare spending will have increased by &euro;4.5 billion to &euro;10.2 billion; and spending on infrastructure will have increased by &euro;2 billion to nearly &euro;5.6 billion.</P>
    <P>The Government is continuing to provide substantial funding in 2003 for those key priority areas. As everyone knows, we must keep our spending consistent with the available resources. There is a limited pool of such resources. This means that we must prioritise, and if one sector receives more, others must receive less.</P>
    <P>The Report of the Independent Estimates Review Committee, which I am publishing today, was of considerable assistance to the Government in prioritising our spending choices for 2003. Ultimately, however, the decisions underpinning the expenditure Estimates were taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>The committee highlighted the limitations associated with a one year focus on expenditure planning. It recommended that a further review of expenditure should be undertaken by my Department immediately after Budget 2003 with a focus on expenditure in 2004 and 2005. I agree fully with this recommendation and my Department will initiate such a review in January 2003.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Spending</i>I expect voted public expenditure to come in on, or close to, target in 2002. Including the social welfare package outlined, I am today providing an additional &euro;1.3 billion in gross spending in 2003. Taking account of the spending set out in the Estimates last month, this means that total gross spending on public services next year will be &euro;2 billion above the estimated 2002 outturn, an increase of 5.7%. This means that since 1997, this Government will have more than doubled total gross expenditure on public services to &euro;38,015 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Services</i>Whatever deficiencies exist in relation to the quality and quantity of our public services, money alone is clearly not the answer. There is scope for securing better value for money through more effective control and management of public expenditure. Every euro saved is a euro available to spend on hospital patients, our children's education and our roads.</P>
    <P>The Government has recently agreed a number of improvements to the financial management systems which will be introduced from the beginning of 2003. I will briefly refer to some of them. To facilitate a more informed assessment of emerging spending trends, we will publish the <Col N="1262" /> monthly spending profiles submitted by Departments at the start of the year. We will also publish corresponding information from the Revenue Commissioners on monthly tax revenue profiles for 2003. Ministers and their management committees will be required to manage strictly within the allocations given to them. I will continue to submit monthly expenditure management reports to Government, reporting on overall spending and revenue trends. Improvements will be made in risk assessment measures and contingency planning to cater for unforeseen pressures which may emerge as the year progresses. Spending on demand-led schemes will be managed effectively, as is required in all other spending programmes. I am introducing revised arrangements for managing capital spending.</P>
    <P>The financial management system will provide incentives for Departments to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness. For example, where Departments secure savings as a result of specific efficiency measures or steps they have taken to curtail a programme, these savings should, as a general rule, be available for other high priority programmes within the same Department. These measures will encourage public service managers to achieve greater efficiency in the management of public expenditure, to the benefit of all.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Infrastructure &ndash; Capital Spending</i>The economy has developed substantially in recent years. The number at work has increased by more than 370,000 over the last five years. Our infrastructure needs to catch up. In the national development plan we outlined our vision for the development of the infrastructure required by a modern, dynamic society. We are already making good progress on this. Our existing public spending rate on capital, at 5% of GNP, is nearly double that of the European Union generally.</P>
    <P>The Government has accorded top priority to investment in economic and social infrastructure. We have more than delivered on our financial commitments to this priority in the national development plan. In the first three years of the plan the Exchequer has invested almost &euro;9 billion in this area, almost &euro;1 billion more than the original commitment. This represents a massive acceleration over pre-plan levels of investment. Unfortunately, cost increases have impacted adversely on output and timescale, but the plan is continuing to fund projects of unprecedented size, especially in the key area of transport.</P>
    <P>The Government remains committed to the infrastructure investment strategy in the plan and welcomes the continuing broad political and social partner endorsement of this strategy. In recognition of the key importance of the national roads programme, I am today allocating an additional &euro;209 million to the programme for 2003. This means that next year the Exchequer will be investing &euro;1.25 billion in the roads programme.</P>
    <P>The Government is also anxious to explore more radical and innovative approaches to the <Col N="1263" /> funding and delivery of the roads programme, including, in particular, the scope for greater private sector investment and potential ways of remunerating this investment. A working group, chaired by the Department of Transport, has been established to examine all options in this regard and report to the Cabinet committee on infrastructure by 31 January 2003. I propose to examine the scope for introducing a multi-annual funding envelope for the programme in the light of the report.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Private Partnerships</i>To help ensure public infrastructural projects are financed in a cost effective manner, I have brought forward legislation to establish the National Development Finance Agency under the aegis of the NTMA. The new body will advise State authorities in relation to the optimal financing mechanisms for infrastructural projects and ensure private sector finance is used where it is most effective. I hope to have the agency operational early in the new year which will help to promote the public-private partnership concept.</P>
    <P>Public-private partnerships are making a significant contribution to delivering priority infrastructural projects under the national development plan. A milestone in their development will be passed in the near future when the first motorway PPP contract is signed. The various PPP national roads projects will incorporate substantial private finance and real tolls will generate a stream of revenue that will contribute to meeting the cost of this vital infrastructure. Public-private partnerships are also being developed in other sectors, including education, the Luas operator and environmental services.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Inclusion</i>One of the key objectives of this budget is protecting the weaker sections of society. We committed ourselves in An Agreed Programme for Government to implementing a wide range of social inclusion policies aimed at supporting the most vulnerable in society. Specifically, we are committed within the lifetime of the Government to reducing consistent poverty to below 2% of households and progressing the revised national anti-poverty strategy, with its ambitious targets, across a broad range of areas. Since the Government first came into office in 1997 we have significantly reduced consistent poverty and improved living standards to the benefit of all groups in society. Today's budget will consolidate the progress made over several years.</P>
    <P>This year the greater pressures on public finances will obviously affect my spending proposals, but nevertheless, I aim, with this social inclusion package, to direct resources to those most in need.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare</i>Today's social welfare improvements will cost &euro;530 million in a full year. This will bring the <Col N="1264" /> gross allocation for the Department of Social and Family Affairs next year to &euro;10.2 billion. As a result of the improvements I will announce today, social welfare expenditure in 2003 will be &euro;4.5 billion higher than it was in 1997, an increase of almost 80%. Even in these more difficult circumstances the cost of the social welfare increases this year will be twice what it was in 1997.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Dormant Accounts Fund</i>The social inclusion area will also benefit next year from the first disbursement of funds from the dormant accounts fund which will be established using unclaimed dormant account moneys from financial institutions. The funds disbursed will be spent on charitable and community projects, with a particular focus on children with learning disabilities.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Old Age Pensions</i>Today I am increasing the full personal rate of old age and related pensions by &euro;10 per week. This will bring the old age contributory pension to &euro;157.30 per week and the old age non-contributory pension to &euro;144 per week. This is a first step towards An Agreed Programme for Government commitment to increase the State pension to &euro;200 per week. The rate of payment for old age pensioners will, by 2003, have increased by 59% over the rate payable in 1997. This is well ahead of inflation and represents an enormous improvement in the living standards of our older citizens.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Widows and Widowers</i>In line with the targeted increases provided in my last two budgets, today I am providing a further special increase in the weekly rate of the widow's and widower's contributory pension for those aged 66 years and over to bring the rate of payment closer to that of the old age contributory pension. Accordingly, the weekly rate of payment in 2003 for the widow's and widower's contributory pension will rise by &euro;11, bringing the payment rate to &euro;155.80 per week, and &euro;162.20 per week for those aged 80 years or over.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In budget 2001 I announced the Government's intention to allocate over &euro;1.27 billion in increased child benefit over a three year period. As I said at the time, our central objective is to support parents in whatever choices they make in looking after their children. Child benefit is an important financial support for families with dependent children and a key instrument for tackling child poverty. We achieved two thirds of the planned increase in the last two budgets. However, in the current budgetary circumstances it is not possible to complete the Government's plans this year. I am now announcing an <Col N="1265" /> additional &euro;105 million in a full year to increase child benefit further. This will see child benefit rates increase by &euro;8 per month for first and second children to &euro;125.60, and by &euro;10 per month for third and subsequent children bringing the new rate to &euro;157.30. I intend to complete the planned increase in child benefit in 2004 and 2005.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Other Social Welfare Measures</i>The Summary of Budget Measures contains a range of other social welfare improvements, the full details of which will be announced by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. These measures include an increase of a minimum of &euro;6 per week in the full-rate social welfare payments other than those to which I have already referred. Proportionate increases will be paid for all persons in receipt of reduced rates. There will also be an increase of &euro;17 per week in the family income supplement income thresholds; an increase in the weekly income disregards for means assessment of the carer's allowance scheme; a doubling of the hearing aid grant, payable under the medical appliance scheme, to &euro;700; an increase of &euro;30 in the rate of the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance paid in respect of each child aged 12 years or more, bringing it to &euro;150; an extension of the free telephone allowance to persons aged 70 years or over who reside in nursing homes and have their own telephone account; and a further increase in the annual respite care grant provided to carers, bringing it to &euro;735 per annum. The effective payment dates for all increases in 2003 will be the same as this year.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Taxation.</i>Many factors combined to produce the high rate of economic growth in the past ten years. Some of these were not permanent, such as the strong labour force growth. Others should have a longer-lasting effect, such as our investment in education.</P>
      <P>One factor in our economic success has undoubtedly been the lowering of the direct tax burden on enterprise and labour which this Government brought about. This lower direct tax environment is as much an investment in our future as the resources we are putting into building up human and physical capital.</P>
      <P>Demands have been made for income tax rates to be increased, or for the reductions in corporation tax already provided for to be delayed or postponed. The Government is convinced that this would be a short-sighted and misplaced policy. It would put in doubt our ability to regain our medium-term growth potential and handicap our development agencies in attracting and retaining foreign direct investment. I do not plan to adopt this course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Personal Taxation.</i>The reform of the direct tax system and the reduction in the personal tax burden, which this <Col N="1266" /> Government delivered in the last three budgets, was substantial by any standards. In these budgets we have more than delivered on our commitment in relation to net take-home pay in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The figures are there to demonstrate this. This year I propose to make only a limited number of changes to the personal tax system. These measures, which will have a total cost of &euro;186 million in a full year, are as follows.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employee Tax Credit.</i>I am increasing the employee tax credit, formerly known as the PAYE allowance, by &euro;140 from &euro;660 to &euro;800 per annum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. P. McGrath Mr. P. McGrath">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This will increase the entry point to the income tax system from &euro;209 per week to &euro;223 per week for employees, which is 90% of the current minimum wage.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Age Exemption Limits.</i>I also propose to increase the annual income tax exemption limits for those aged 65 and over from &euro;13,000 single and &euro;26,000 married to &euro;15,000 single and &euro;30,000 married, respectively.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Mortgage Interest Relief.</i>The Government is also increasing the mortgage tax relief available to first-time buyers. The current annual ceiling on the amount of interest that can be allowed will be raised&mdash;</P>
      <P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;by over one quarter from &euro;3,175 single and &euro;6,350 married to &euro;4,000 and &euro;8,000, respectively. In addition, the period for which the relief is available will be extended from the current five years to seven years in all. Some 45,000 first-time buyers will benefit from these changes.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Numbers in Tax Net.</i>These increases in tax credits, exemption limits and mortgage interest relief combined will take 37,400 taxpayers out of the tax net. One third of these taxpayers are aged 65 or over.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Employee Pension Contributions.</i>As part of the process of increasing the equity of tax reliefs, I am introducing an annual cap on the pension contributions made by employees, as already applies for the self-employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Benefit-in-Kind</i>When an employer remunerates an employee by way of benefit-in-kind, this falls outside of the <Col N="1267" /> PRSI and health levy nets for both employer and employee. I propose to apply the PAYE, PRSI and health levy systems directly to such benefits from 1 January 2004. This will raise up to &euro;83 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Indirect Taxes.</i>It is usual in each budget to seek a contribution to the funding of the Exchequer from indirect taxes. This budget is no different. Accordingly, I propose to increase VAT and excise duty.</P>
    <P>
      <i>VAT.</i>The 12.5% lower rate of VAT will be increased to 13.5%. This measure will take effect from 1 January 2003.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Excise Duty.</i>I propose to increase the VAT-inclusive excise duty on cigarettes and other tobacco products by the equivalent of 50 cent per packet of 20 cigarettes. I am also increasing the VAT-inclusive excise duty on spirits by 20 cent per standard measure. The VAT-inclusive excise duty rate on spirit-based ready-to-drink products or &ldquo;alcopops&rdquo; is being raised by 35 cent per bottle, to align the rate with that on spirits. The VAT-inclusive excise duty on diesel will be increased by three cent per litre. These excise duty increases are to take effect from midnight tonight.</P>
    <P>
      <i>VRT.</i>I propose to make a small but significant change to VRT bands. At present, a VRT rate of 25% applies to cars with engine sizes from 1401cc to 2000cc and a rate of 30% applies for cars of 2001cc and over. From 1 January 2003, the 30% rate will apply to all cars of 1901cc and over.</P>
    <P>
      <i>CPI Effects.</i>These increases in indirect taxes will raise &euro;535 million in a full year and will add 0.85% to the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Carbon Energy Tax.</i>We have international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, the Government has asked the relevant Departments to advance the plans for a general carbon energy tax, with a view to introducing this from the end of 2004. Given the many implications of such a tax, both environmental and economic, there will be full consultations with interested parties on the design of the tax and a reasonable period is being allowed for its effective introduction.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Business Taxes.</i>The business tax environment here has been a notable contributor to our economic success in the past. This has been due not just to the tax regime itself, but also to a stable policy environment. I intend to continue to pursue that approach, but nonetheless I feel it is appropriate <Col N="1268" /> in present circumstances to seek an equitable balance in raising revenue from all sectors of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I see this as a fair and reasonable demand in view of the prosperity secured by many parts of business and commerce during the past few years.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Financial Institutions.</i>The Government proposes to raise a revenue contribution from the financial sector of &euro;100 million per annum for three years. This will be done by means of a levy on financial institutions, calculated by reference to the amount of tax payable by them in 2001 on deposit interest. Full details of this measure will be set out in the Finance Bill. The financial sector has proved its dynamism and business ability when given the chance. It is not unreasonable to see some of their good fortune applied to assisting the public finances.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Capital Allowances for Plant and Machinery, including Motor Vehicles.</i>At present, capital allowances for plant and machinery, including motor vehicles, allow a write-off for tax purposes over a five year period. I propose to extend this period to eight years as and from today. This will involve a cash-flow gain to the Exchequer in each of the next seven years, ranging from &euro;20 million in 2003 to nearly &euro;315 million at the maximum in 2007. This is a base-broadening move and helps to maintain low corporation tax rates.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Payment of Corporation Tax.</i>I propose to simplify the current corporation tax pay and file arrangements by ensuring that a company must pay the balance of tax it owes within nine months of the end of the accounting period in question. This will reduce the number of necessary contacts with Revenue and will raise a once-off &euro;16 million in 2003.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Stamp Duty.</i>Non-Residential Property.</P>
      <P>No changes have been made to the rates of stamp duty on commercial property since 1990. I propose to increase from today the current rates of stamp duty on non-residential property and to amend the valuation bands to which they apply. The full details of the changes are set out in the summary of budget measures. They involve the introduction of additional rates of 7% to 9% depending on the value of the property concerned. This change will raise &euro;158 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Other Stamp Duty Changes.</i>I am increasing the stamp duty on cheques from 8 cents to 15 cents per cheque, and the <Col N="1269" /> stamp duty on credit cards from &euro;19 to &euro;40 per annum. I also propose to increase the stamp duty on ATM cards from &euro;6.25 to &euro;10 per annum and to introduce a stamp duty of &euro;10 per annum on laser cards. The stamp duty on combined ATM and laser cards will be &euro;20 per annum. These changes take effect from midnight tonight and will raise &euro;52 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Young Trained Farmers' Exemption</i>In the stamp duty area, I am also continuing for a further three years the existing exemption for the transfer of land to young trained farmers.</P>
    <P>CAPITAL GAINS TAX</P>
    <P>
      <i>Payment Dates</i>At present capital gains tax is payable on a preceding year basis. The Finance Bill will provide that in future a preliminary tax payment will be made by 31 October each year in respect of gains made up to 30 September in that tax year. Tax due on gains made over the remainder of that tax year will be paid by the following 31 January. This will result in an estimated once-off gain of &euro;250 million for the Exchequer in 2003. In making this move we will be putting CGT on a similar footing to other tax charges.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Roll-over Relief and Loan Notes</i>It is proposed that no roll-over relief will be allowed for any purpose on capital gains arising from disposals on and from today. Also, it will no longer be possible to defer capital gains tax on share disposals by taking the proceeds in the form of loan notes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Indexation for CGT</i>In addition, indexation of the base for computation of capital gains will only be allowed to be calculated up to 31 December 2002.</P>
    <P>All these reliefs and allowances made sense when the CGT rates were 40% and 60%. These base-broadening changes will bring in about &euro;20 million in 2003 and about &euro;100 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>Reliefs narrow the tax base. A widened tax base is the price that must be paid to keep tax rates low. It is a price worth paying. All tax reliefs, therefore, must be subject to ongoing review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The business sector and investors have been much assisted by schemes of special tax reliefs. These have played an important role in many areas and in the development of certain business sectors. I am a supporter of properly-focused, clearly defined, specific reliefs which can encourage the development of goods and services, including public services, which might otherwise <Col N="1270" /> not be provided, or where provided, are too little or too late. I have, accordingly, in the past introduced several reliefs. On the other hand, I have also substantially capped certain reliefs and taken strong action in relation to various tax avoidance schemes. I am continuing this approach by closing a number of loopholes today, as I will explain later.</P>
    <P>A study by the Revenue Commissioners indicates that capital allowances on buildings continue to be the chief instrument used by high income earners to reduce their taxable income by substantial amounts. I acted on similar research in the 1998 budget by capping the amount of capital allowances on buildings that could be set off against non-rental income.</P>
    <P>While later research indicates an increase in the effective tax rate of high earners, some of them continue to achieve substantial reductions in their tax liability as a result of reliefs. I will place a copy of this latest research in the Library, as I did with the previous study. Having examined the position, I have decided to make the following changes to a number of reliefs in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Deadlines for Certain Tax Incentives Schemes</i>A series of tax incentive schemes, many of them involving capital allowances, have been extended in the past for a number of years and several are due to expire on 31 December 2004. The list is set out in the summary of budget measures and includes urban renewal, rural renewal and car parks reliefs. These schemes were introduced over the years to provide a development incentive for the areas or activities in question. All these schemes, without exception, are to end on 31 December 2004. As part of this process, I am bringing forward to 31 December 2004 both the termination date for film relief from 5 April 2005 and that for student accommodation relief from 30 September 2005. Given the current and prospective budgetary position, the existing demand for property investment and the desire to improve equity in the tax system, there is no justification for a continuation of these reliefs beyond 2004.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Allowances for Hotels and Holiday Homes</i>To assist in broadening the tax base, I am also reducing the special capital allowance for hotels. They are currently written off over seven years and I am changing this to 25 years, the same period as applies to general industrial buildings. I am also abolishing capital allowances for holiday homes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Closing Tax Loopholes</i>I have no doubt that one effect of terminating existing tax reliefs will be to sharpen the creative wit of tax avoidance experts. The summary of budget measures gives details of the anti-avoidance measures in capital gains tax and income tax <Col N="1271" /> which I am taking with effect from today. These measures will protect the revenue base going forward.</P>
    <P>One particular change will ensure that those going temporarily off-shore to avoid capital gains tax liability will no longer be able to use the loophole in question. I will continue to act quickly to close down tax avoidance schemes as they come to my attention.</P>
    <P>CONCLUSION</P>
    <P>Today's budget has been planned within a three-year framework. In the 1970s and 1980s our country ended up in an unsustainable situation because of the wrong budgetary policies. Governments refused to respond to challenges as they arose. They chose short-term solutions which caused long-term problems. This Government will not make the same mistake. The people know and understand the need for the policies I have announced today. This budget is a prudent and planned response to the impact of the continued international downturn on our public finances.</P>
    <P>Today I have provided a stable framework for our public finances going forward; strengthened our productive capacity, which is critical for future growth; ensured that the business sector makes an appropriate contribution to the public finances, and safeguarded the position of those on social welfare and those on low incomes.</P>
    <P>This is a budget rooted in a vision of an Ireland which values stability as the necessary base for advancing the welfare of all its people. It is a budget which avoids the mistakes of the past&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is a balanced and fair budget, which responds properly to the international downturn by preventing the huge deficits of the past, but also by making sure that important areas like social welfare pensions and health are prioritised in difficult times. This is a budget which will protect our long-term future and secure the welfare of all sections of our society. I commend the budget to the House.</P>

      <P>It is a cruel twist of fate that today is the day Jim Mitchell was buried. Just 12 months ago, Jim stood in this place and responded to the budget presented by the Government. Jim was a man of great heart, formidable courage, immense energy and of simple faith. He threw his many talents into the pursuit of fairness and accountability in this House. He set a standard which others must strive to follow and I hope that when the tributes are paid to him next week, we will have the chance to pay sincere sympathy to his family, Patsy and the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" />I now turn to today's budget. This budget is genetically flawed. Its genesis is in a fraudulent vision which was sold relentlessly in the run up to the general election. &ldquo;Much done, more to do&rdquo;&ndash; that was the slogan which was like a garland festooned everywhere one went. It was a reckless project designed with one thing in mind &ndash; to secure power again for those opposite. It was a project of self-preservation which resulted in spending growing at ten times the rate of growth of revenue generated by the Minister. However, this was all in the interests of the few and not in the interests of the public. Politically for this Government, this deception has been a political blunder on an enormous scale. It undermined the moral authority of this Government before it even started on its path of so-called reform.</P>
    <P>This Government has for the most myopic reasons ensured that the truth about the reckless project in which we are engaged did not come out. That is why people feel angry, annoyed and frustrated. They know they were conned in the budget which resulted from two years of reckless spending. Ireland is not in economic crisis. The crisis we have today is a crisis of competence on the part of the Government. It is a crisis born of sloppy and unprofessional leadership in Government, of decisions driven by personal ego rather than the national interest. We are not in recession today. We have economic growth that is the pride of Europe but it suits the Government to say that some great meltdown has resulted in what is before us &ndash; the most niggardly budget we have ever seen.</P>
    <P>Today's budget is a culmination of an about-face since the general election. It is ordinary people &ndash; those who drive our buses, who check in at the supermarket, who teach our children and who nurse us when we are ill &ndash; who are going to have to pay in spades in this budget. They are paying for the recklessness of the Government as it sought to secure power for the future.</P>
    <P>We see in the budget a follow-on to what we have seen all summer. People are being made pay with a higher cost of living. They have had to pay more for college fees, for medication, for local authority rents, for VHI, for hospital beds, for casualty charges, for everything one can think of. Today we find that the Minister for Finance is asking them to pay in excises an amount that will add over 3% to consumer prices. This is a scandal. The Government said it would protect us from the rip offs of unscrupulous traders during the euro changeover. Far from it, it has added its own fuel to the fire. It has got in enthusiastically on the job of fuelling price increases and damaging our competitiveness.</P>
    <P>It is ordinary people who will pay these prices. Ministers may smile at the excises on old reliables but these will have to be paid out of budgets that are already tightened trying to pay for child care or housing, by people already negotiating a daily struggle to keep their lives afloat. That is the snake oil that came from the Government's &ldquo;a lot done, more to do&rdquo; slogan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1273" />In income tax, the Government, by failing to index basic allowances and credits, has robbed the people of &euro;300 million. That is &euro;250 for every household in the country just wiped out by a failure to index income tax. Again it will be the ordinary people at the bottom of the pile trying to pay for their daily struggle who will carry this can.</P>
    <P>I have heard the backbenchers say that their campaign on housing has been rewarded and that the attack on the first-time buyer is going to be reversed. What we see, however, is that a couple are going to get a benefit of &euro;330 in cash. A single first-time buyer will get just half of that. This will be spread over seven years, so the total even at the end of that period is a mere &euro;2,000. Compare that to the first-time buyer's grant of &euro;3,800 that was washed away at one blow. This is the most niggardly recompense.</P>
    <P>Cast your mind back to just one year ago to what the Government did to squeeze out first-time buyers. It allowed those who wanted to invest in property to use not only the stamp duty which gave them &euro;12,000 but also allowed them interest worth &euro;4,200. We now have a situation where compared to the single first-time buyer, the investor will get seven times as much interest concession and a concession on stamp duty.</P>
    <P>We all know the consequence of this. The first-time buyers who are already only getting one out of every five new houses are going to be squeezed out even further. This was a sham response to a genuine protest of people who felt abused by the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant. That is only the start of it. The Government has increased VAT by 1%. That is &euro;2,000 that will be asked for from every first-time buyer. It has gone from the abolition of a grant of &euro;3,800 to another &euro;2,000 being taken from first-time buyers. This was cynical&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. P. McGrath Mr. P. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear. Where are the backbenchers now? They are very quiet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a cynical attempt to pretend there was a response. The people are going to pay not only in terms of the money that is going out of their pockets as inflation forges ahead under the influence of this Government but also in terms of the perverse cutbacks we have seen again in this budget and in the Estimates that preceded it. In housing, health and among carers, people will be squeezed by these cutbacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We see it even more today in the changes the Minister has made in his Estimates. When you strip away the Estimates you find that the public pay bill is going to go up by 11%. Social welfare will also go up but by very little. The remaining non-pay element that goes to lubricate services and give to people the crumbs and scraps that fall from the Government table is being increased by just 1.5%. We are going to see the ludicrous situation later this year of administrators administering schemes with no money to spend. We will see social workers with no petrol allowances to <Col N="1274" /> visit the people who need their care. We will see expensive hospital beds closed even though the doctors and other staff are there as they will not be able to afford to keep them running. That is the consequence of the sort of slide rule cutbacks this Government has introduced and made its hallmark.</P>
    <P>This is the product of the &ldquo;a lot done, more to do&rdquo; model. People will also pay in another way. They will pay with their jobs. The Minister for Finance is today adding to economic costs, adding to pressures on prices and wages and adding to the pressures of congestion and delay on our streets. He continues to cut his capital budget. His derisory provision on the capital side will be wiped out by the VAT increase. A provision of just &euro;200 million will be well wiped out by the VAT increase on construction products.</P>
    <P>What we will see once again is projects slowed down to a crawl and greater congestion. We already know from a survey on behalf of small businesses that it takes longer to deliver a parcel across Dublin than any other city in Europe. It is rivalled by only one other city &ndash; Calcutta. That is the environment this Government has created for people trying to do business in this city and country. We are going to see more job losses.</P>
    <P>In a small open economy the one thing you cannot afford to do is damage competitiveness. In this budget we see an assault on competitiveness with higher prices, extra charges and less investment. The message is very clear. It is going to get tougher for people trying to do business. This was going to be a tough budget because of the reckless spending that preceded it. What is remarkable, however, is that the personal pet schemes of the Minister for Finance have not been touched. Some &euro;517 million will be paid next year into the SSIA scheme. How can the Minister for Finance ask the lowest paid in our community to accept that there will be no increase in their tax credits and 3% extra inflation while at the same time he is going to protect those who can afford to save in these schemes? Where is the justice or equity in that?</P>
    <P>It is not justice or equity that is inspiring this but pride and ego. That is where this Government has gone so badly wrong. There is &euro;1,300 million being stashed in the Minister for Finance's great pension fund. I agree with the principle of the pension fund. I am glad it was put in place. I do not agree, however, that at a time of serious bottlenecks in our infrastructure we should be using &euro;1,300 million of taxpayer's money, most of it borrowed this year, in order to invest in the stock exchanges of New York and Japan. Perhaps that will protect employment in New York or Japan but it will certainly cost jobs here among the people for whom the Minister for Finance is supposed to be caring.</P>
    <P>This budget is a massive disappointment right across the scale. The Minister deserves no plaudits for donning his new-found zeal for fiscal rectitude. It has come too late. He had 17 months of a run up to the general election and two election <Col N="1275" /> budgets. During that time spending ran ahead at 50%. In May this year before the election was called spending was running ahead at 15%. The Minister was spending ten times what was being generated in revenue. That was the time when we relied on him to call a halt and to say, as he well knew, that the consequences of this sort of reckless spending would be that the weak and the poorest would suffer. In his reaction to a budget introduced by a former Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, in 1997, he said that he knew when spending went wrong it was the weakest and the poorest in our community who suffered. They were depending on him to call a halt, to rein in the Taoiseach and his Ministers who were relentlessly pursuing their electoral goals.</P>
    <P>Despite having built his political reputation on his criticism of Charlie Haughey and the reckless spending of the 1980s, when the Minister's courage came to be tested he was found wanting. He could not respond. He could not face down those around him who wanted to put electoral gain ahead of the national interest. People before politics is the slogan. This was politics before people. Today the people are being made to pay.</P>
    <P>Ireland has become a tougher, meaner and darker place. Our suicide rate tells as much. The opportunity to relieve escalating stress in our lives over the past five years was missed. The opportunity to implement basic values such as prudence, fairness, respect and community was neglected. Such values did not inspire decision making. Priorities were misplaced. Power was praised. The screaming need for reform was ignored at a time of great opportunity. Queuing and congestion replaced proper planning in crucial areas of public life. We wait for buses, trains and a seat, never mind a trolley, in a casualty department. Caring has been devalued.</P>
    <P>It is crucial that we now strongly assert a different approach. We must build stronger standards of accountability. We must confront interests that are frustrating progress. We must protect opportunity in education. We must ensure solidarity in times of need. We must reach beyond the boundaries of bureaucracy and focus on the elements that make a strong social fabric.</P>
    <P>If we sleepwalk through this budget &ndash; already we can see those on the backbenches of Fianna Fáil who will sleepwalk through it &ndash; we will fail because we are following tired prescriptions. We need to wake up. We need to remember that we represent those people who will be hurt today &ndash; first-time buyers, those who are in accident and emergency departments crammed like sardines while awaiting care, the carers of this country who will see the small supports that were to come to them cut back.</P>
    <P>There are other ways of dealing with public service reform. We can get value for money if we are determined to do so. That is what will inspire <Col N="1276" /> Fine Gael over the coming years as we oppose this Government.</P>

      <P>We need to ensure that ordinary people are given a decent standard of service. Having spent 50% more, it is appalling that nothing was delivered and no value was achieved. That is what we must stand up against. If we call ourselves a parliament and a democracy, we must say, &ldquo;stop, this must not go on. This is not the way to deal with the people.&rdquo;  It is time for a radical change.</P>
      <P>This time last year the Minister for Finance boasted of the five chapters of his first book. He might name them, &ldquo;how I blew the crock of gold at the end of the rainbow.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>He inherited an economy where borrowing was falling and employment levels were growing at a rate of 1,000 a week. He has turned that around and borrowing is now rising. How was that done? He turned a surplus of &euro;4,800 million, which he had only two years ago, into the deficit we face today of &euro;800 million on general Government spending or &euro;1,800 million in the Exchequer borrowing requirement, the measure he prefers to use when it suits his case.</P>
      <P>No doubt the Minister is searching for a name for his next volume. The volume could well be titled &ldquo;Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde&rdquo;. Dr. Jeckyll had much to say in the run up to the election. Hospital waiting lists were to be ended in two years. Another 200,000 people were to get medical cards.  First-time buyers were to be protected from being squeezed by investors. All this was set out in the Fianna Fáil manifesto. A website was set up to show how children in substandard schools would have their problems resolved. Some 2,000 extra gardaí were to take to the streets. The glossy &euro;10 billion health strategy was to be immediately and systematically implemented. Consumers were to be protected from the euro rip-off. Child benefit was to be increased by &euro;31.80 per month. Where did all this go? What we have seen today is the other side. We have seen Mr. Hyde who has banished all sign of that benign doctor who promised us much done and more to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has become one of the richest countries in the world. This Government had an unprecedented opportunity to get to grips with serious reform, but instead reform was an early casualty in its approach to dealing with the public service. Instead it invested in the art of spin. It spent money, but where was the value for it? That it ignored. The procedures for controlling spending were allowed rust over. The Taoiseach and the Ministers present failed to maintain even the minimum standards of prudence in relation to public spending. The basic principles, cost accurately, carefully identify the benefits, plan <Col N="1277" /> efficient delivery, monitor and spend the outcomes, were abandoned, nowhere more so than in the Taoiseach's pet project, Stadium Ireland, which cost us &euro;400 million alone. However, he was not outdone, there were plenty of Ministers vying with him to produce their own follies.</P>
    <P>We are one of the richest countries in the world, yet we cannot care for the carer, the early school leaver, the homeless, the low paid in bedsits or a young couple struggling with the cost of child care and housing. The Minister said when we had it, we spent it, but these groups were not on the list of beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>These are the choices that betray the Ahern-Harney Government. Deputy Ned O'Keeffe had the courage to speak the reality that everyone must realise, that such choices betray the heart of Fianna Fáil and how it had changed. It is no longer the party that cares for people in need but the party who cares for those in privilege. That is the sad realisation that is presented to us today.</P>
    <P>Budget 2003 is full of lazy answers. It makes the punters pay. It imposes crude, sly cutbacks and perpetuates wrong priorities in tax policy. This Government's tax priorities were wrong from the start. The Minister set his priorities for tax much more by his career as a tax accountant seeking to help clients shelter from tax liability than by his national responsibility to ensure fairness and equity. The opportunities to shelter money were piled one quickly upon the other &ndash; halving the capital gains tax, and the dramatic increase in the amounts that people could put into pension funds. All these measures were aimed at those at the top end. Most dramatic of all was the switch in the basis for taxation from domicile to residency which allowed people who could bed and breakfast outside the State for 183 days to get away scot free and not pay any tax. The Minister is belatedly closing one of those loopholes in the area of capital gains tax but only after one notable investor has gone away with &euro;50 million in terms of tax avoided by using these schemes.</P>
    <P>This system, created by the Minister, allows the super rich to quickly and easily wash out all tax liability for capital gains, income tax and even capital acquisitions tax by bequeathing it to their children without any tax being paid. This is the type of thinking that spawned the special savings accounts. It was intended to spread the largesse far and wide and in an election year it had to be spread wider than just to the privileged few. Where were the priorities in this?</P>
    <P>A different approach has been meted out today to the ordinary people within the tax code. Spouses who work in the home were disenfranchised and they continue to be so today. Over a number of years there was an opportunity to create a tax regime that would encourage participation in the labour force and support affordable child care so that women could make choices. They could perhaps take a couple of years out to look after their child and return to work thereafter. That could have been supported. There <Col N="1278" /> could have been support for child care and for those options. Instead, the Minister's approach was to conscript people into the labour force by narrowing their options and failing to recognise home caring as a valid pursuit.</P>
    <P>Low income earners are the biggest casualty today. The Minister boasted that he has again increased the number of people outside the tax net. This is an irony. The Minister deserves praise for introducing a tax credit system. The system had great potential to improve the way tax benefits were spread. However, what has happened since tax credits were introduced four years ago? The personal tax credit, which was to be the vehicle to spread the benefits more fairly, has not been increased in real terms in four budgets. The increases were less than the increases in inflation in the same period. The &euro;4.5 billion of tax benefit was crowded into the top end of the tax schedule. Those at the bottom got nothing. This was an opportunity, a system with real potential, that was spurned.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us he is wonderful because 36% of the low paid are outside the tax net. He does not tell us what income these people have. They are on tiny incomes of less than &euro;10,000 per year. These are not incomes that will support a proper home. The Minister's concessions are bogus.</P>
    <P>Nowhere has the damaging social consequences of the Government's priorities been more clear than in the housing market. Twelve months ago investors in the housing market got the boost of a 12% cut in stamp duty on an average house and their interest concessions were returned. This year first-time buyers have lost. What was the Government's big idea for the housing market? It was affordable housing. Four years later, how many houses has that system produced? The total is 534. That is the magnificent achievement of the affordable housing scheme after four years.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that housing lists have doubled and that rents in the private sector have increased by 44%. Hidden in the Estimates, however, is an assault on the poorest of the poor. Today the Minister is providing that the poorest people on social welfare, those on supplementary welfare and in receipt of a rent supplement, are to have &euro;4.38 taken from them with one stroke of a pen. The Minister tried to boast that he is giving &euro;6 to people at the bottom of the scale but for those dependent on rent supplement, &euro;4.38 is already wiped out. They will be asked to live on an increase of just &euro;1 and a few odd cent at a time when inflation is being increased by the Minister's activities.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Minister has decided they will be denied any rental support if they cannot find a property for a single person costing less than &euro;107 per week. If the rent is more than &euro;107, they will not get a cent towards it. In the case of a married couple with a child, if the rent is more than &euro;220 per week, they will not receive a rent <Col N="1279" /> supplement. What are the priorities in this Government's housing policies?</P>
    <P>Today the Minister made provision for benchmarking. Benchmarking was designed as a political cop out. The reason benchmarking was pushed outside this agreement and into the next one was to avoid confronting the difficult issues of reform in the public service before the general election. It was a political compromise which was cobbled together to keep Ministers away from awkward decisions. We now see the result. Benchmarking was a process with great potential. It was an opportunity to look at public services in a new way and to benchmark best practice, to look at what was happening in the private sector, to look not just at rewards but at how public services are and could be organised and to look at what could be achieved to bring our public service up to best standards.</P>
    <P>However, that was not to be. The concept of looking at best practice was quickly discarded. A great fanfare was made of the work done on rewards and comparators before the awards were announced. The taxpayer, who will be asked to pay &euro;565 million, and the public service worker, who felt undervalued by these increases, are not to see how they were put together. What type of process was it? Where was the fairness, equity or drive for reform in a process that was buried in this way? This was a political move to try to bury a difficult issue. This was where the Government had to and should have focused its efforts over the past five years. It should have looked at how public services could be reformed and how we could change the way services are delivered to get better value and better services. Instead, the age old system was allowed to crank on in secrecy. Now we are told this money will be paid but the Minister has not told us what changes in public service delivery will be negotiated to ensure we see real value from the benchmarking process.</P>
    <P>Benchmarking is only the most visible manifestation of a system that has gone wrong where public service reform is concerned. The public service has not been able to deliver the standards we need because of ministerial intervention and lack of ministerial leadership. Look at the national development plan. This was to be the pride and glory of the Government. It is now running two years behind schedule and 62% over cost. It is a shambles. There will be more congestion, more difficulties for business and for commuters and a lower quality of life as a result of the stop go approach adopted by the Government.</P>
    <P>We have not seen a determination to apply policies consistently and fairly. The Government has taken the wrong turn on virtually every serious area of public policy. The health sector will probably suffer most. This year the provision will result in the closure of hospital beds. There was an opportunity to reform public services. This was a period in which they could expand. They did expand by over 30,000 people but these people did not go into the front line. They went <Col N="1280" /> into administration. The Government, having received a recommendation that the number of health boards should be reduced to five, increased the number to 11. This year, hospital beds were closed but patients were flown out of the country for much more expensive care. Where is the logic in that?</P>
    <P>Where is the logic in deciding that 200,000 people who should have had access to primary care and are at the poorest end of the income scale are to be denied it while others, people over 70 years of age, are stocking up with their medicines before going to their apartments in Spain? Where is the sense in that? We have skimped on primary care and made access to it more expensive with the result that more people have been piled into the difficult, expensive and chaotic hospital system. This was not a Government that recognised priorities and sought to deliver them. It did the easy thing and responded to the latest lobby.</P>
    <P>We need to look afresh at the partnership process. It has stood us well in years gone by but there are limits to what consensus can achieve and we need to recognise that. It has slowed down necessary reform, shelved devolution and responsibility being passed down within the public service, given priority to producers over consumers and distorted reform in key markets. These are some of the key consequences. Due to its excessive focus on the workplace it neglected policies that helped create connected lives and we are paying for that in the type of development we have seen.</P>
    <P>It is time the House reasserted its authority over the way public spending is managed and run. We in Fine Gael believe it is time for a fiscal responsibility code where there would be explicit disclosure of multi-annual costings of new initiatives and immediate revelation of the first signs that a budget is going off target. Every euro spent on the public capital programme should be firmly linked to the delivery of identifiable work on projects within a specified timetable.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a permanent better value for money commission with resources to accelerate re-organisation and innovation and to ring-fence revenue from bailing out the type of overspending we have seen in the past two years. We want to see serious exercises within the public service in benchmarking against best practice throughout the world. We want to see independent supervised evaluations of the quality of public spending under the aegis of much stronger Oireachtas committees. These are the type of changes needed if we are to face up to our responsibilities in this House.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, what we have seen today is a budget whose seeds were sown in 2000. The Ahern-Harney Government found the solution to the Boston-Berlin dilemma, namely, offering the prospect of Boston-style taxes and Berlin-style spending standards. The Minister for Finance endorsed the project. It was party time. In 17 months, spending was increased so rapidly that <Col N="1281" /> the Government merrily burst through every target the Dáil had set for it. Every sport was to have a world-class facility. The health strategy was to make us the envy of the world. A new metro would make congestion a thing of the past. Expensive launches, lavish models, finger food receptions and photo-calls were the mark of the day. We are paying a heavy price for that. Those who have had to wait at the end of the line for public services are paying the price.</P>
    <P>What rankles with people is the way the truth was concealed from them. Last year, the Estimates revealed no evidence of what was going to happen on the spending side. When budget day dawned, a latent Exchequer deficit was looming, but this had to be concealed at all costs. The Minister found the classic smoke and mirrors solution. He raided every piggy bank he could find and sold off the family silver. We are paying for that now. Those piggy banks are empty and the family silver is gone. The Minister has brought forward new taxes to try to cover the difficulties he has this year. He is robbing next year to pay this year, just as he robbed this year to pay last year. These are the approaches the Minister has adopted.</P>
    <P>What will rankle with people and will last as the legacy of the Government is the assurances he gave to and contempt with which he treated those who criticised what was happening. It is worth remembering the famous letter the Minister issued to the then Fine Gael leader, Deputy Noonan, on 13 May in the run-up to the election. The letter stated:</P>
    <P>I can confirm that there are no significant overruns projected and no cutbacks whatsoever are being planned, secretly or otherwise . . . In relation to revenue, I'm sure you also welcome the recent strong rebound of our economy from the effects of the global downturn. In terms of employment, exports, industrial activity, consumer confidence, retail sales, housing demand and foreign direct investment, all of the key indicators have recently improved considerably. The latest tax returns confirm the return to growth. . .  As such, our overall budgetary projections remain the same as published.</P>
    <P>I can also confirm that we will not be repeating the very real cutbacks implemented by you and the then Minister for Finance in 1997 on the funding for waiting lists and health capital funding. I am proud that over my five years as Minister for Finance I have never resorted to the cutbacks which you implemented.</P>
    <P>What strange words from the Minister for Finance who seeks plaudits from the financial community for what he has done today in savagely cutting back spending and piling up charges on people.</P>

      <P>The binge of the last two years has had a serious effect on the long-term competitiveness of the economy. We are seeing it today in the budget with higher costs, inflation and people not being compensated for the losses they have suffered. We have seen it in cutbacks in vital infrastructure. People will pay with their jobs and this will be the legacy of the Minister for Finance. Instead of prudently managing us out of the crisis we are in, which is not an economic crisis but a crisis of Government competence, he has slammed on the brakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not those who are comfortably bedded into their seats such as the Minister and his colleagues <Col N="1283" /> but those with no seatbelts who will go out through the glass. That is when we will see the hardship that will be borne during the course of the next year by ordinary people who will not forget that the budget has betrayed everything that was promised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose stallions and their owners can sleep easily tonight after the lobbyists visited the House last week and the week before. They certainly showed the people on community employment schemes how to lobby. They got what they wanted.</P>
      <P>Let us perform some simple arithmetic on the budget. Some &euro;186 million has been given in personal tax changes by the Minister but he has taken back &euro;83 million in the PRSI levy attached to benefits-in-kind and &euro;52 million in additional stamp duty on cheques and credit cards. This adds up to &euro;135 million. That is even before he has raised cigarette, drink and petrol prices and increased the standard rate of VAT from 12.5% to 13.5%. The people who will pay for the budget are the ordinary taxpayers. Closing tax loopholes will save some &euro;10 million. We are terribly impressed.</P>
      <P>This is a shameful budget. It is socially irresponsible, mean spirited and small-minded. It is a budget of promises broken and hopes betrayed. The Minister has betrayed all the most vulnerable groups in society. There has never been a budget with so little in it to meet the needs of those on the margins of society. Even in much harder times than this, Governments made investments in housing, health, education and disability services specifically aimed at shielding those most in need from the worst effects of retrenchment. There is nothing whatever for them here. Those on the lowest rate of social welfare will get 30 cent a week over and above the Minister's projected rate of inflation. Higher inflation next year will consume &euro;5.70 of the &euro;6 increase in the lower social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>The increase in child benefit the Minister has implemented is almost exactly one quarter of what the Government has promised. The term &ldquo;child care&rdquo; is not mentioned anywhere in the 100 page document the Minister gave us. He had the gall to say he was protecting the least well off in his budget, but that is a lie. His budget is an attack on the least well off.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the most shameful feature of the budget is the reintroduction of the concept of charity where children with disability are concerned. Last year there was the Supreme Court case for Jamie Sinnott. This year the Minister has to depend on the dormant account funds to give additional money to those with a disability. That is a disgraceful policy development. This is a budget devoid of compassion, without ambition, and lacking in courage. It reflects only too well the character of the Government which produced it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1284" />The Government was formed 182 days ago, almost six months to the day. This has been a half year of political betrayal, dishonesty, incompetence and broken promises, capped by today's dismal budget. In 182 days the Minister has effectively brought forward three budgets. There was a mini-budget of harsh price increases and the first cutbacks, brought forward almost before the votes in the general election were counted. This was followed by one of the most draconian Books of Estimates we have seen for years and today we have this latest threadbare offering. All three have something in common. They speak volumes about the dishonesty of a Government which knew how bad things were when it campaigned on a vision of continued growth and development. They tell us everything we need to know about the incompetence of a Minister who has frittered away many of the social and economic gains we could have put in place.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the number of times the Government has broken its word, but there is a more fundamental point, a more serious charge to be levelled at it. It offered a promise of a better future to this generation of voters, families and children everywhere. However in six short months of economic mismanagement, incompetence and downright dishonesty it has stolen the promise back from this generation. This budget, only six months into its second term, is a political swindle. The paltry compensation for first-time house buyers is only the proof of its dishonesty. The grandstanding of Fianna Fáil backbenchers produced nothing.</P>
    <P>The budget is worse even than that. The mini-budget, the Estimates and the dreary litany of today have something else in common. All three attack families and eat into the resources available for those coping with the stresses and strains of economic difficulty. All three make the future look bleaker. The Minister may be aware of the play in the Gate Theatre, an adaptation of &ldquo;A Christmas Carol.&rdquo;  I would not wish to cast him as Ebenezer Scrooge, but there are three ghosts in this budget. There is the ghost of Christmas past, reminding us of the great opportunities open to the Minister during the boom and how he blew the lot. The ghost of Christmas future shows us the bleak prospects for the economy and future jobs, when this country grinds to a halt because of lack of vision, lack of proper planning and lack of appropriate investment. There is the ghost of Christmas present, with paltry social welfare increases, substandard schools, no new medical cards, no health strategy and waiting lists for health and disability services growing scandalously longer.</P>
    <P>I watched the Minister's colleagues and backbenchers during his speech. I could see, as all of us could, that this was no longer a man who inspired confidence or trust. They know in their heart of hearts he has let them down. I wonder if they, like the rest of us, get the impression in this budget of a rather subdued and slightly bewildered Minister. The swagger of recent years is <Col N="1285" /> gone. This is a man who just can't see how it has all gone so badly wrong. It went wrong because his management was wrong. His policies were wrong. His forecasts were wrong. His mean-spirited philosophy is wrong and, above all, his priorities are wrong. Will he apologise and give us an act of contrition? We have as much chance as James Gogarty had of getting a receipt from Ray Burke.</P>
    <P>The Minister, with his Fianna Fáil backbenchers, would like us to believe we are in a budgetary mess solely because there are international difficulties. I do not believe this, nor does anybody else. It is time to stop blaming external factors such as the downturn in America and Germany. It is time to start recognising that our difficulties have been greatly compounded by the Minister's misguided management. The result is that families will suffer. Across the country tonight thousands are following the budget coverage and asking what it means for them. It is a slap in the face for families who want the best for their children and are prepared to make sacrifices for them. They will pay for the incompetence of the Government.</P>
    <P>This budget is a three part package aimed at making families pay for the mess created by the Minister and his Government colleagues. The first part of the package produced a range of extra charges: a 17% increase in VHI charges; a 69% increase in third level registration charges; an increase in charges for drugs from &euro;53 to &euro;70, with the final &euro;5 added only last night; a 26% increase in charges for casualty visits; a 13.5% increase in ESB bills; and an effective 14% increase in bus and rail fares. After today there is more to come: increases in energy costs, local authority rents and service charges. These are all inevitable outcomes of the Minister's squeeze.</P>
    <P>What of the cutbacks, in addition to the charges? Even before we got to the Book of Estimates, there were shameful cuts in aid to the developing world. There was a demand from the Minister that he wanted to see real cuts in services across all Departments. The result in the Book of Estimates was an all-out attack on public services, schools, hospitals, housing, transport and the basic needs of families.</P>
    <P>It was a blatant and cynical abandonment of Fianna Fáil's specific election promises. While it promised 2,000 additional gardaí, it has cut the number on the streets. I invite the Minister to come to Blanchardstown some time. There is nothing here to help prevent crime. It promised 200,000 additional medical cards, but will deliver none. It promised modern schools for all our children, but is delivering cuts in the building programme. It promised thousands of extra hospital beds and a permanent end to waiting lists within two years, but there has been no delivery and we are still waiting.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to the health service in the light of what the Minister has had to tell us today. The January sales can have a special offer this year: a free copy of the Government's health <Col N="1286" /> strategy with every woolly jumper. After today the Government will not be able to give away copies of the strategy.</P>
    <P>The continuing battle between the Minister and his colleague in the Department of Health and Children represents a sort of contest between beauty and the beast. The contempt of the Minister for the health service always wins and families who are suffering always lose. This was to be the budget in which there would be a huge extension of eligibility for medical cards. Patients were also promised they would not have to wait as long. Families have been deceived by the Minister for Health and Children and the Taoiseach while the Minister sat quietly waiting for the general election to pass. They also deceived families promised that waiting lists would be eliminated in two years. The country is counting the days, even if the Minister is not. In a rich country like ours it should not be too much to ask that people be able to go to the doctor without having to worry unduly about the cost of the visit or the prescription, that when someone needs emergency medical treatment, he or she should be seen promptly in a casualty department which does not resemble a war zone and that when someone requires an operation, he or she does not wait in pain for years. These simple demands remain the stuff of fantasy for far too many.</P>
    <P>We live in a society where health care is provided on a two tier basis. Medical cards are generally only available to those on very low incomes, those who cannot afford private care wait for years for simple procedures while many young couples who do not have medical cards have to think hard before taking a sick child to a doctor. No matter what one's income is, should one be unlucky enough to find oneself in a casualty department, one will learn very quickly what is meant by the crisis in the health service.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party promised to solve all this. The national health strategy was a bedrock of its election campaign. We now know it never intended to implement it. One only needs to look at the Book of Estimates. The health strategy promised &euro;7,700 million in additional capital spending on the health service over the next ten years. The step-down beds, extra hospital beds and all the other facilities are vital, no matter how one chooses to reform the health service.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party promised to deliver the necessary funding. At election time it pledged an additional &euro;1,102 million in health capital funding in 2003 alone. How much did the Minister deliver in the Book of Estimates? The answer is an unbelievable &euro;3.8 million, leaving a shortfall on that single promise of more than &euro;1 billion. Today's budget, which changes nothing, proves that the health strategy was a con job from day one. The Book of Estimates left no doubt as to its true status. Today's third chapter reinforces the Minister for Health and Children's abject, hopeless defeat in the battle for funding. He has been defeated by a Minister trenchantly opposed to the whole concept of social medicine.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1287" />It is the Government's job to manage, not to whinge. When funding of a strategy falls victim to a stop-go policy, it makes a nonsense of planning. There is no long-term capacity, no commitment to phase in improvements, no means to measure progress and no way to sustain morale among staff in the health service. What will staff make of the 5,000 proposed cutbacks over the next couple of years? In my constituency the Northern Area Health Board's expenditure on new administrative facilities is astonishing. How will the cuts be applied? Will they occur right across the board resulting in the loss of even more doctors, nurses and frontline staff? The budget is a disgrace in relation to health.</P>

      <P>The Government's approach to education funding is disquieting. Lurking behind all the weasel talk of targeting benefits is the dark shadow of means-testing and the intention to reintroduce fees and charges and make education, once again, a privilege, rather than a right. After all, these are the political parties which took a mother all the way to the Supreme Court to establish that her autistic son had no right to lifelong learning. These are the political parties which today, in the midst of our affluence, preside over a primary school system that is simply not delivering.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of primary schools require extensive refurbishment. The Government admits this and Fianna Fáil backbenchers can recite the list by heart. This is the reason it established an elaborate system of deception about different lists in the year running up to the general election. The object of the exercise was to create the illusion of progress. The Book of Estimates and the Budget Statement tell a different story. The capital funds allocated offer nothing but longer than ever waiting times and shameful neglect. Very young children and their teachers must make do with substandard and, in many cases, appalling facilities.</P>
      <P>The position on schools in new areas is just as disturbing. The Government makes grandiose spatial plans, but will not guarantee the provision of new schools in the locations it chooses as development zones. I will cite just one example which lies adjacent to Clonee, right beside the Minister's constituency. As a result of one of the Bacon reports, this area was zoned as a special development zone and construction is proceeding apace with thousands of new homes already built and a further 5,000 planned. When Fingal County Council established a broad based, inter-party, inter-agency committee to examine the needs of the new area, it asked the Department of Education and Science to appoint a representative to sit on the steering committee for the new area. How did the Department respond? It refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no commitment to meet the demand for additional schools which must inevitably arise when homes are built in such numbers in a very <Col N="1288" /> short time. The shredding of the primary schools capital programme in the Book of Estimates can only confirm the misgivings of families in these new development areas that they, too, will have to wait.</P>
    <P>As the Minister spoke, I waited for him to pull back from the slowdown in third level capital and research funding he announced a few weeks ago. I was sure wiser counsels would prevail in the meantime. I waited in vain. We have slowly started to build a research and development culture in our learning institutions. In fairness, I acknowledge the Government encouraged this process in its first term. Slowly, a framework has evolved in most of our universities and colleges. Now, astonishingly, the Minister appears to want to strangle his own creation in its infancy. I warn him this cannot be turned on and off like a tap. Once damaged, it will not be easy to put it together again; neither will the reputation of the country be readily rebuilt when the Government chooses to dismantle the capacity of our advanced educational institutions to serve the knowledge economy through research and development. How will foreign investors react in these circumstances?</P>
    <P>I detect a nasty piece of political subterfuge in the severely reduced allocation to third level education. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, has decided to get his way on third level fees by hook or by crook. We will shortly see the reintroduction of fees, either directly or through the back door by way of further registration or other charges. I understand the expert group is this afternoon in the process of recommending an increase in third level registration fees of &euro;1,000 per year.</P>
    <P>I now turn to social welfare. The social welfare increases in the budget are paltry. While everybody will welcome the additional &euro;10 per week for the principal old age pensioner of a couple, the increase of &euro;6 for other social welfare recipients will amount to a net gain of 30 cent per week for some of the poorest in society. There is a simple and basic point about social welfare which the Government refuses to acknowledge. Unless social welfare payments are increased in line with wages, the poor will fall behind everyone else. It is not rocket science, but the Government refuses to recognise it. It simply does not want to acknowledge the truth about its record over the past five years. It has systematically favoured the rich at every turn.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the facts. The ESRI has analysed the record of this Government over the past five budgets. It has compared the percentage increase in incomes resulting from tax and social welfare changes for the poorest 20% of the population with that of the richest 20%. The top 20% has gained, in percentage terms, four and a half times more than the poorest 20% from the Government's actions. That is a measure of how the Government distributes resources. That is a measure of its priorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" />The Minister says that budgets are about choices. We know what his choices are. He has chosen to favour the rich. In its pre-budget submission, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul called for an increase in social welfare rates of at least 9%. This would mean increasing the lowest social welfare payment to &euro;130 per week. The Combat Poverty Agency called for a 7.5% increase. The increases which the Government has delivered today fall far short of these minimal recommendations. They barely cover the Minister's forecast for the rate of inflation. As I said before, the net gain to people on the lowest rates of social welfare in one of the richest economies in the world, will be 30 cent per week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>His scandalous VAT increase, particularly in the standard rate, will hit the poor hardest. When we were students the higher rate used to be called the luxury rate. This will increase the cost of gas, electricity and fuel, items on which people with lower incomes have to spend a disproportionate amount.</P>
      <P>The Government has made much of its target for social welfare payments included in the new national anti-poverty strategy. This sets a target for the lowest social welfare payments of &euro;150, in 2002 terms, to be achieved by 2007. This target itself is inadequate, because it provides no guarantee that social welfare rates will keep pace with earnings. If the Government is to achieve even this target, it has to provide for significant increases in social welfare, over and above the rate of inflation. The Minister has not done that. In fact, a 9% increase this year would have been the minimum required to keep faith with that commitment. Once again, the ink is hardly dry on yet another promise, before it has been abandoned. The national anti-poverty strategy can now join the national health strategy and the national development plan in the dustbin.</P>
      <P>The Government seems to enjoy nothing better than spending years on end and piles of taxpayers money drawing up glossy strategies. I heard the Minister refer in his speech to the setting up of another board to look at carbon taxes. Members of the Fianna Fáil party will be fighting to get on that board.</P>

Not in this budget, which treats carers with condescension and contempt.</P>

      <P>It was Deputy McCreevy who promised to increase child benefit by &euro;95 per week over three years, with more for larger families. We must bear in mind that some 50% of families who have more than five children live on a social welfare income. Poverty among larger families is quite exceptional in this country. He said, at the time, that this increase would help all parents with the costs of caring for their children. He also said it would &ldquo;represent a major move towards achieving the goal of ending child poverty in this country&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Let us be clear, this was never about child care. If the Government cared about child care it would have done something serious about it long ago. It is so inept that it cannot even spend the money it sets aside for child care. The Minister can look in vain at his colleagues and wonder where the money is gone. What about the child care proposals for poor communities that have not even been able to get off the ground because people are literally bogged down in files of application several feet high. The Tánaiste knows what I am talking about. The levels of bureaucracy created by the Government is truly amazing when it comes to poor people. Its child care policies are pathetic. They are piecemeal and they are ineffective.</P>
      <P>We welcome the proposed increases in child benefit, because it will help to tackle child poverty. Everyone knows that this was really to do with winning votes for Fianna Fáil in the general election, but we still supported the measure last year. Once the Minister is safely back in office, the promise on the increase he had made has been abandoned. One measure for children, which I wanted to see introduced, is a school breakfast programme in disadvantaged areas. I saw one in operation recently in one school in my constituency where staff report a much greater level of attention and discipline directly due to this initiative. The Minister should respond to the commitment and dedication of the people who run these schemes by introducing a national programme. It has been costed at a modest &euro;15 million, yet the Minister provided a derisory &euro;2 million. What are we supposed to say to that.</P>
      <P>The Minister is fond of saying that his job is to make choices based on priorities. His approach to taxation tells a clear tale of the Minister's priorities. For five years, during the boom times, he lowered taxes on high incomes and on capital gains. He also lowered taxes on profits. In contrast, at the lowest end of the income scale, he has made only the most tepid moves to lift the tax burden on workers who earn the basic minimum wage. Now, when things are not so good, he places the burden of his incompetence on families. Today, we get higher excise duties, stealth taxes imposed by not indexing bands and more people paying at the top rate of tax. There is nothing here for the low paid but there is a clear signal of other public charges and tolls in the pipeline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1291" />As I said earlier, consumer price inflation is by far the highest in the EU and twice the average for the EU as a whole. The Minister is adding to the problem by increasing charges for everything he can think of. He has added 0.85% to the consumer price index as a direct result of this budget. He says that additional excise duties make the price of cigarettes reflect the damage to the smoker's health and the public cost of medical treatment for tobacco related illness. The Labour Party supports the excise duty increase on cigarettes. I want an assurance from the Minister and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that there will be a sustained crackdown on illegal cigarette sales by criminal elements. Apart from the large loss of revenue involved, these provide scope, now as in the past, for consolidating criminal empires. I know this from my constituency and the Taoiseach and Tánaiste know it from theirs. Customs officers and the Garda must be deployed to tackle these crime empires.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister not even made an effort to have cigarettes removed from the consumer price index? While he pays lip service to this issue, it remains the case that every time he raises the price of tobacco, he increases pressure on the poorest families. The same is true of his increase in VAT on fuel. In fact, what is missing entirely from this budget is any serious measure to repair the impact these excise increases will have on the consumer price index. For months now we have listened to increase after increase feeding into the index. The college registration increases being one case in point, and the excise increases today being another. We know that these price increases will impact most heavily on the poorest in our society. Once again, the most vulnerable will suffer for the Minister's incompetence.</P>
    <P>The Minister has left himself no choice, because of the way he has managed Government revenue in recent years, without properly counting the cost. In his hurry to cut taxes for the rich and to open up tax shelters for his friends, he has completely miscalculated the effects of his policies. Would we really be seeing the increases in taxes and charges in this rolling budget of the past six months, if he had got his sums right in recent years?</P>
    <P>For weeks we have been fed selective leaks that tax shelters would take a decisive hit. If one believed the Taoiseach's assurances to his backbenchers, our high income rollers would be trembling in anticipation of this budget. That has not happened and, as the Minister stated, there will be a saving of &euro;10 million in his budget summary. Our tax system has become impossibly twisted by these shelters and by the ease with which wealthy interests can locate offshore. They now have to do so for five years rather than three years in regard to capital gains. That is a big change. They can live here for as long as they like with no serious exposure to taxation. &ldquo;Ansbacher Man&rdquo; can sleep easily after this budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1292" />One windfall that helped the Minister in his bookkeeping is the &euro;34 million obtained by the Revenue from companies brought into the limelight at the Flood tribunal but the ordinary taxpayer might well ask how it is that companies with significant construction activity had escaped for so long with returns that bore no realistic relationship with the scale of their operations. This is similar to those specific cases highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General recently. A property investor with a large portfolio of buildings, a luxurious house and car still managed to return derisory income statements and got away with it.</P>
    <P>The budget is asking families to pay more, while too many in our society still get away without paying their fair share. There is no adjustment to tax bands. The Minister has proposed the least he can get away with and, once again, he has done practically nothing for those on the legal minimum wage. There is a solemn commitment to the social partners to increase the basic tax credit to the level of the minimum wage in this budget but he has only gone to 90%. He has welshed again on this promise and these low wage earners will suffer the double impact of reduced spending power and taxation.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister has not adopted a sensible suggestion from the National Economic and Social Council that he should claw back for the public benefit the windfall gains that will accrue to certain owners and developers directly from the State's own investment programme. The national spatial strategy and the roads and rail programmes all have the potential to dramatically increase the value of large parcels of land. These arise directly from public decisions and investment. Are we to sit on our hands while, once again, huge profits are made through rezoning and development?</P>
    <P>If the community at large is to benefit from these measures, we need a form of windfall tax on gains made from buying and selling land for development purposes.</P>

      <P>It is also high time that the Minister came to grips with the issue of eco-taxes and through the establishment of another committee, as he has suggested. The plastic bag levy was a worthwhile gesture but no more than that. The core environmental issues include greenhouse gas emissions, air quality, water quality and waste management. Another budget has come and gone with no sign that the Minister has given serious thought to these issues. He has held the portfolio for longer than anyone and has had more opportunity to take effective measures in this area, not as a means to increase overall revenue but as responsible public policy. Now we have the Kyoto committee for Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn to the matter of capital spending. While families are being made to pay more, the Minister persists in significantly reducing the rate of cor<Col N="1293" /> poration tax this year. Was this truly necessary? Could corporate Ireland not have been asked to wait until next year? Children in run down schools have been asked to wait, but not the corporate sector. In moving this year to the 12.5% corporation tax rate, the Minister is giving a present of &euro;305 million to the richest companies in Ireland. The levy on financial institutions is a pretty small clawback by comparison.</P>
    <P>We have been told the 12.5% rate is essential to attracting foreign industry but it is not and, in any event, how is any foreign investor going to take Ireland seriously, if they cannot get in and out of its capital city from the airport in a reasonable time, get workers to their factories and transport their goods to market? They will turn around and get back on a plane and take their investment plans with them. Not even our astonishingly favourable corporation tax rates will overcome the scepticism of a mobile international investor when faced with a congested road and outdated rail network.</P>
    <P>That message must have gotten home to the Government in the wake of its ill judged reductions in the public capital programme announced in the Book of Estimates. The sense of dismay was apparent in every sector. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, got an earful even from her hosts at the Thanksgiving lunch of the US Chamber of Commerce. They told her all about the infrastructural deficit. They expressed what is evident to everyone but the Minister.</P>
    <P>One well regarded international competitiveness index pushed Ireland down from 11th to 24th place. As a country, we must invest in our own future, yet there is a major funding gap in terms of delivering on the Government's own plans. A recent study suggests that as much as &euro;9 billion in additional funds will be required. In last year's budget, the Minister predicted that capital spending in 2003 would amount to &euro;6.1 billion or 5.5% of GNP. The additional capital spending in today's budget is paltry. He has been trying to cut back on capital spending since he was re-elected. This is sheer economic lunacy. Now that the economy is in a slowdown, it is precisely the time to increase investment.</P>
    <P>When the boom was at its height, the Government invested money in infrastructure and saw a great deal of it eaten up by high construction prices. Now the construction industry has slowed down dramatically, and prices in that sector have stabilised. The Government is, therefore, in an ideal position to push ahead with investment. It has taken years to get some projects to the point where they are ready for work to commence. Suddenly the Government is saying, &ldquo;Stop, there will be years more of delays because we won't spend the money.&rdquo;  Unless the Government gets its act together on public investment, this country faces a bleak economic future.</P>
    <P>We have a Minister for Finance who betrays a stunning lack of confidence in the outlook for his own country. He cuts investment and insists on <Col N="1294" /> shovelling money into a pension fund, which will not be invested in the country's infrastructure and which is losing money hand over fist on international stock markets. The reputation the Government acquired for economic management is in tatters. The budget is basically a long confession of failure and incompetence.</P>
    <P>What kind of Minister for Finance persuades 1.2 million people to put money into special savings accounts, without knowing what he can afford to pay out? In any other country, that level of incompetence would have seen the Minister out of a job long since.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite all the spin he has done nothing to curtail the cost of SSIAs. At this stage he cannot calculate the cost. The reality is the Minister's record is one of cynical and dogmatic incompetence. At the height of the boom, he stoked up the economy, pouring scorn on those who counselled otherwise. The result is that the economy overheated. We have higher levels of inflation and redundancy than were necessary. To add insult to injury, he is cutting back on public expenditure and raising taxes at precisely the time the economy is at a low point. It is the complete opposite of sensible economic management.</P>
      <P>Anyone with even a passing knowledge of economics knows that the Government should not try to accentuate the economic cycle. I do not say that it should try to actively spend its way out of recession. because that also will not work. The Minister should adopt a sustained and sustainable course, particularly where investment in infrastructure is concerned.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil does not manage the economy for the good of the people but for the good of Fianna Fáil. Let us not forget that in his first year in office this Minister kept public spending tight, as he built up his electoral war chest. Then spending gradually increased until the pre-election spending splurge started in 2001. The same process has begun again. As soon as the election was over they went back to the hair shirt. This budget is about building up the war chest for the next election.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil wants us to believe the myth that this austerity is somehow necessary. So we are getting all this nonsense about not going back to the 1980s as though the crisis of the 1980s was not a Fianna Fáil creation. These cuts are not necessary. This year we will again run a substantial current budget surplus, so there is plenty of room for improvements in public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sheer scale of our capital programme and our infrastructural deficit means it makes sense to borrow to fund projects that will provide us with a return over decades to come. As late as last week, this reality was very publicly recognised by the EU Commission when it proposed making changes to the stability and growth pact. Debate on the stability pact has been going on in Europe for months but the Minister for Finance <Col N="1295" /> does not seem to notice. Instead, he has been sitting at home, ignoring this vital debate and muttering nonsense about only spending it when you have it. It is as though the Nice referendum never happened. Once again, the Government is back to its old trick of ignoring what is going on in Europe and failing to engage in debates of vital importance to this country. Of course, this Minister is ideologically opposed to public borrowing because he is ideologically opposed to public services and investment.</P>
    <P>Ireland is one of the richest countries in the world. We can afford decent public services, to treat people with decency and dignity and to invest in our future. We certainly cannot afford not to invest. Our new wealth should be the basis on which we offer the promise of a better life for every citizen, and we should deliver on that promise. To do so requires vision, ambition and courage but none of these can be found in this miserable budget.</P>
    <P>For that reason, what is now clear to everyone are the two things we cannot afford. We cannot afford this Government, and we can no longer afford this Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Here we are again on our annual visit to Charlie's Christmas grotto where hopes are raised and expectations are dashed by a promoter who absconds with our aspirations. It is hard to know whether the Minister for Finance is acting intentionally or whether he believes that what he presents to us and says in this House is the truth.</P>
      <P>The Minister's budgetary objectives of last year were to develop infrastructure, improve public services, promote equity, encourage enterprise and investment, sustain fiscal policy, safeguard the vulnerable, prioritise needs and invest in the future. On each of these grounds the Minister and the Government have failed miserably.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been engaged in the &ldquo;Enronisation&rdquo; of the national accounts. This budget repeats the trick of last year of front loading receipts and dipping into secondary accounts to present the best possible gloss on the national figures. However, this time instead of pretending there is no deficit he has to admit that there is a deficit of at least &euro;900 million. Given the way he got last year's figures so badly wrong we can anticipate that those figures will rise further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has introduced a number of measures that are nothing less than taxation by stealth. By not touching the personal tax credit or tax bands he has told every income tax payer that the amount of tax he or she pays will increase by at least the rate of inflation next year. He has introduced a number of indirect tax increases, which will have a secondary effect. The most pernicious of these is the 1% increase on VAT, which is an additional tax on labour, goods and services and, once again, will affect those who have least. This makes a further nonsense of the <Col N="1296" /> Government's pretence to being concerned with the idea of equity.</P>
    <P>The pretence continues with the pantomime surrounding the idea of house buyers being encouraged by the Government. Having got rid of the first-time home buyer's grant the resultant saving of &euro;38 million has been met by the sum of between &euro;6 and &euro;8 from the mortgage interest tax relief for first-time buyers. This itself has been eaten away by the 1% increase in VAT. The Government and the Minister are more concerned with perception than reality.</P>
    <P>The Government talks about capital infrastructure and yet is reducing the amount to be spent next year by 1.5%. It hopes to meet the shortfall by a further reliance on public private partnerships, a system of funding that we know costs more in the long run, benefits those who already support the Government parties and does not provide the infrastructure we need in the way we need it. The experience of our near neighbour shows how fraudulent public private partnerships are and our limited experience of them in this country show they do not represent a response. Once again the Government is ignoring its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, again uses smoke and mirrors to pretend that tax loopholes are being closed. Other than a tinkering around with the capital allowances, which is welcome in itself, the Minister does not propose to close any tax loophole in the next fiscal year. He even suggests that all existing loopholes should continue until the end of 2004. The Minister talked about the need to share the burden and the risk which comes from changed budgetary circumstances. The Green Party asks where in the budget or in the Book of Estimates has the Minister asked that any of that burden be shared by him, his party, his supporters or those who have benefited from six budgets which have overwhelmingly benefited the better off? How can the Minister talk of equity when, after his five previous budgets the difference between someone earning more than &euro;50,000 per year and those who are dependent on social welfare has increased by &euro;12,000? What kind of society has 14,000 earners in the top bracket earning the same as 250,000 earners in the bottom bracket? Where is the equity or the response? This is a Minister who talks the talk but acts otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to have retracted his undertaking to provide additional funding for the roads programme. There is no doubt that some infrastructure projects, such as bypasses, some road improvements and consistent improvements on secondary roads are needed. However, the roads programme which the Minister wants to see supported and which will benefit his supporters in the construction industry is one which is not required because it will produce a road capacity the country does not need. This has been ascertained by studies previously done by the Department of Transport.</P>

      <P>The social welfare increases in the budget are derisory and insulting. The increases range from the lowest which are no more than the rate of inflation to a high of 8% for pensioners. These increases will be eaten into by the inflation which will result from the indirect tax increases in the budget, which will bring our inflation to three times the European average.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Government pride themselves on budgetary prudence. The Tánaiste has already commented on the fact that this is a prudent budget. I am sorry that she, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are absent from the Chamber.</P>

      <P>It is not the Ireland that has benefited from the tax reductions that Deputy McCreevy has introduced in the last five budgets. It is the Ireland suffering from the spending cuts introduced in the Book of Estimates, a series of cuts that constitute nothing less than an attack on the very ideas of society and community. We now live, because of Government policies and priorities, not so much in a society but in an economy that is ordered to the benefit of a select few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Carbon tax was mentioned. The paragraph in the Minister's budget speech in this respect is the exact same paragraph he has had in it since 1999. Every year we are to have a committee to examine the economic and competitive effects of carbon tax on the economy, despite the fact that the ESRI has done many studies on the likely effects. The National Economic and Social Council has endorsed the tax as an instrument that will have a good effect, not only in terms of the environment but in terms of the economy. There would be a short-term financial benefit, just as we <Col N="1298" /> have had from the plastic bags levy. In the long-term, we would be avoiding the costs that the Government is still unwilling to accept will result from the fact that we have already exceeded our carbon emission levels. We will have exceeded them by a likely factor of ten by 2010.</P>
    <P>In overall terms, this budget talks about the wrong priorities, and it is from a Minister who has always talked about the wrong priorities. However, I think he is being hoisted on his own petard today. The examples within the budget document talk about the effects of taxation on particular sets of married couples. Take the example of Duncan and Mary. Duncan is a technician earning &euro;40,000 per annum while his wife Mary works at home. They will be better off by the tune of &euro;95 per year, something in the region of &euro;1.85 per week.</P>

There will be none because those who pay the price are those who do not participate in the electoral process and who do not support the Government parties. Once one has such a set of skewed priorities, one will have the unbalanced Ireland that we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was famous, in another incarnation, for being responsible for a dirty dozen in terms of social welfare cuts. A similar dirty dozen has been highlighted by the SIPTU newsletter <i>Liberty.</i> It refers to the effects of the Minister's policy in terms of home buyers, the decision in relation to the drugs refund scheme, overall spending in terms of the health service, which is running below the rate of inflation, and education cuts, not only in terms of the built infrastructure but in light of the fact that to better and improve <Col N="1299" /> oneself in Ireland is a matter of how one can pay for it. Today's society is no longer about who one knows but about what one can afford. That is Deputy McCreevy's Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy has spoken about having a three year budgetary strategy. I bless his confidence in being able to come into this House again to produce another set of what I consider to be fraudulent figures. He has done this for five budgets too many already. If the Government, particularly the Taoiseach, wants to restore confidence in the management of the public finances and get back on track in terms of economic development, it should note that Deputy McCreevy's confidence in himself is ill-founded. Then the confidence we need to have in terms of the future of this country can be restored.</P>

      <P>I commend Deputy Boyle on his contribution. This budget must shock and anger everyone who seeks a society of equals on this island. Only seven months have passed since the general election. That was the Minister's last outing as &ldquo;Champagne Charlie&rdquo;. The bubbly was still flowing and the sky was the limit. Four days before the election he told the people, &ldquo;I can confirm that there are no significant overruns projected and no cutbacks whatsoever are being planned, secretly or otherwise.&rdquo;  Clearly, it is a long, long way from May to December. It is also a long way from Fianna Fáil and PD promises before the election to the reality of this budget.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, in his address here 12 months ago talked about his books and the final chapter in his first book. However, is this really the first chapter in his second book, as he so haughtily declared here just 12 months ago, or could it be the last chapter in his single and sorry tome on the steps to be taken to reward the well-to-do while at the same time dropping just enough crumbs to mute enough people among the masses who yearn for economic justice?</P>
      <P>The dictionary will introduce a new word, as it is quite entitled to do &ndash;&ldquo;McCreevyism&rdquo;. It will be defined as rewarding one's friends from the toil of others while maintaining the pretence that one cares for all. Deputy McCreevy will enter the dictionary just like other notable figures in Irish history, such as Boycott, and on the wider diaspora scene, to our shame, McCarthy. We still have no explanation why the Minister promised no cuts in the middle of May and his Department proposed cuts of the order of &euro;900 million a few weeks later. It could only be because of massive incompetence or massive deception.</P>
      <P>Today the deception is exposed. The Fianna Fáil election manifesto, the programme for Government, the national development plan and the so-called national health strategy have been thrown into the incinerator, and the national spatial strategy might as well be the national space exploration strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1300" />The publication of the Book of Estimates caused widespread and justifiable anger throughout the State and the budget just presented by the Minister for Finance will surely deepen that anger. Before the budget we had already seen the axing of the first-time home buyer's grant, the reneging on the promise to extend the medical card entitlement to a further 200,000 people, the cut in the school building programme, the social housing cuts, the shortfall in the health budget and the cutting of 5,000 community employment places.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Minister for Transport's portfolio, we are looking at a 9% increase, although the 9% claim is up for question, in relation to public transport costs. A possible &euro;43 increase in the television licence will be introduced and only last evening we heard of the second increase in the ceiling limit in the drugs refund scheme which has been increased by &euro;5 to &euro;70.</P>
    <P>All of this represents a damning indictment of this Government's approach to the needs of ordinary citizens. This budget has confirmed the cuts I have already outlined and it has imposed even more penalties on many deserving people who had every justification to expect that the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, would deliver a very different message today.</P>
    <P>This budget follows five years of squandered opportunities in every budget presented by this Minister for Finance. There is still unprecedented wealth in this economy, yet the Government has failed to harness that wealth in a planned way to benefit all citizens. We face these difficulties not simply because of the shortfall in the public finances which arose in 2002 but from mismanagement and the squandering of the unique opportunities of the past five years.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, looked after the wealthy in all his budgets and he has done it again. Those on lower incomes have been left behind once more. This budget represents the Minister's footprint in the telling sands of our economic history.</P>
    <P>Before the general election Fianna Fáil made two promises it has now reneged upon in the most blatant manner. There were others, but two stand out in particular. It promised to end hospital waiting lists in two years. It did not even bother including that in its programme for Government. It was dumped as soon as the polls closed. This week, at my own local authority, Monaghan County Council, one of the Minister for Transport's colleagues, having listened to criticism of his party's dumping of the so-called national health strategy and the general election health commitments, responded with surprising honesty by saying, &ldquo;But that was before the general election&rdquo;. One can imagine the reaction of colleagues in the chamber. I will tell the Minister who I am talking about later, although I have no doubt the Ceann Comhairle will be able to tell him who this person is.</P>
    <P>The outgoing Government promised to extend the medical card to a further 200,000 people. That <Col N="1301" /> was signalled before the last budget over 12 months ago. That promise has been reneged on for the second time.</P>
    <P>The low paid fare worst in this budget in terms of our health services because the Government has not provided the resources required. For a better health service, we need both resources and reform. It is often said that throwing money alone at it is not the answer. The national health strategy was a fudge. It does not tackle our grossly inequitable two-tier system, nor does it reform, but even the positive aspects of that strategy are now thwarted by the lack of resources. As signalled in the Book of Estimates, this budget does not keep the health services in line with medical inflation and those are the figures by which it must be judged.</P>
    <P>The wealth and resources exist in the economy to extend medical card entitlement. That is not just a broken and forgotten election promise of 2002. This was a legitimate expectation of tens of thousands of families throughout the Twenty-six Counties and during the Celtic tiger years, and it is a right to which they are entitled. It is a disgrace that in 2002, after the most prosperous period in the history of this economy, it is still wealth that determines the standard of health, and the standard of access to health services, for our people.</P>
    <P>If the Minister, as he claims, is interested in value for money, why did he and his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, not initiate an immediate value for money assessment of the national treatment purchase fund? This stop-gap measure sponsored by the Progressive Democrats is subsidising the private health system. While they are at it, they could assess the overall cost of subsiding the private health care operators in public hospitals.</P>
    <P>This Government has broken its promise to parents who find themselves just over the income limit for the medical card and who must continue to struggle to scrape the money together to bring their children to the doctor.</P>
    <P>We need progressive tax reform. The recent report of the Revenue Commissioners showed that over 22,000 people in this State earn more than &euro;100,000 per annum. Many of those also benefit from the many tax avoidance schemes that exist. The most recent National Economic and Social Council report expressed its concern at &ldquo;the highly complex system of tax reliefs and the lack of any clear principles in the evolution of these reliefs&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister has yet to spell out which of these he proposes to address. Even after he does what he has allegedly committed himself to doing today, the wealthy will still have their loopholes. The Minister should have created, as my colleagues and I argued in our pre-budget submission to him, a new 50% band for income in excess of &euro;100,000. It is not too late to undertake to carry out a necessary review of all aspects of taxation &ndash; who is paying, who is not &ndash; and to follow it through with the necessary reforms to <Col N="1302" /> ensure we have an equitable tax system, something that has been called for by the NESC.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a range of adjustments in tax reliefs. In doing so, he has all but admitted that these were inequitable and benefited the better off. Why did it take him five years to make these adjustments? It is because now, with the public finances in a tighter position, they have become an embarrassment and even the Minister has had to address them. He could have removed many more, however, as part of a major review and reform, as I have already stated.</P>
    <P>The Government has failed to take the lower paid out of the tax net as promised. People on the minimum wage are still taxed. The earning limit is &euro;223 per week, in other words 10% of all those earning below the minimum wage remain within the tax net, only 90% being excluded. That is a damning figure. People earning below the minimum wage are still in the tax net. That is a startling fact that will not be ignored.</P>
    <P>Income tax changes in this budget have again benefited the better off disproportionately. A married couple with two children and one income gain &euro;144 per week, while the same family on &euro;130,000 gain &euro;269.</P>
    <P>The Minister is relying on widespread and sweeping VAT changes to raise extra revenue. These changes will have a massive knock-on effect and they take no regard of income. Once again, they will hit those on lower incomes who will feel the increase in the cost of living, and a whole range of costs and charges will affect them. The increase in the lower rate of VAT, from 12.5% to 13.5%, will impact on housing and services. There is no realisation of how this will affect ordinary people. The resulting increase in inflation will be accentuated by the 3 cent increase in duty on a litre of diesel. All goods and services are delivered by transportation on the questionable roads infrastructure. The increased costs will not be absorbed by those in the transport industry or those engaged in manufacturing or the delivery of services. They will be met by consumers. It is another blow.</P>
    <P>The outrageous abolition of the first time buyer's grant, signalled some weeks ago, is accentuated by the increase in the lower rate of VAT, which will add thousands of euro to the cost of new homes. This is a fraud. The mortgage relief increases for first time buyers will not disguise the fact that people are being penalised at every other level.</P>
    <P>The Government has reneged on its commitment to a three stage implementation of increases in child benefit costing &euro;1.27 billion. The former Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs said in 2000, when the first increase was implemented, that there would be similar increases in 2002 and 2003. That promise has not been honoured. The Government has engaged in treachery and the electorate will not have it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful that my section of the Technical Group has facilitated a response by <Col N="1303" /> me to the Budget Statement. As I represent the Socialist Party I do not necessarily speak for other members of the group, but all members will have the opportunity in the ensuing debate to express their views.</P>
      <P>The budget is a continuation of a process, in train for a decade and a half, of distributing the wealth in society between the various classes, between on the one hand the majority, comprising working people and on the other hand, the minority, comprising the privileged owners of capital and finance. In 1987, wages and salaries of workers amounted to 59% of GDP while the profits and rents taken by the minority amounted to 41%. Fourteen years later, in 2001, the amount going to the workers had fallen to 46% of GDP while profit and rents had risen to 54%. There has been a huge shift in resources from the majority of working people to the minority who benefit from profits, rents and dividends.</P>
      <P>This change reflects the philosophy of the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government. The Minister for Finance is a conscious right wing politician who has set out, deliberately and with cold calculation in this budget, to continue the trend of shifting resources to the capitalist minority away from social services and working people. Last year he reduced corporation tax from 20% to 16%, at an annual cost of &euro;329 million. He also reduced employer's pay related social insurance contributions by &euro;340 million in a year. The combination of these two figures amounted to &euro;676 million last year. The further reduction in corporation tax announced in the budget means that an additional &euro;305 million will be taken from the tax net and given to the corporations. With the changes announced last year this means that every year from here on, just under &euro;1 billion will be taken from the social fund, which should be allocated to services and to fund the needs of the majority, and given to the minority, who cannot believe the profits they made over several years in the days of huge economic growth.</P>
      <P>The treatment of the corporate sector should be contrasted with that meted out to ordinary working people. Take those who have been hoping to purchase a home and put a roof over their heads, a basic human right. The abolition of the first time buyer's grant was a cruel blow by the Government, reflecting the heartlessness of the right wing ideologues who drive policy. For five and a half years they have done virtually nothing while speculators and developers have profiteered outrageously by doubling and trebling the price of a home to working people and in making massive profits. At the same time workers' wages have been pegged under the misnamed partnership agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that many of the speculators who have been let rip have contributed to Fianna Fáil. However, the Minister's response was to injure the first time buyer with the abolition of the first time buyer's grant. In the budget he <Col N="1304" /> insulted them. The effect of the so-called increase in mortgage tax relief for them amounts to between &euro;10 and &euro;12 per month. They could not buy a doorbell with it, which is perhaps as well for the sake of the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats candidates, who in a year and a half will be seeking votes. The increase in the lower rate of VAT will add at least &euro;2,000 to the price of the average home. These combined measures effectively amount to a further take from young people as they attempt to purchase a home.</P>
    <P>Nothing has been done to alleviate the plight of those depending on private landlords. A significant section of the landlord class now rack-rent with a vengeance that would put their landed counterparts in the 19th century to shame. A mass movement led by Michael Davitt was needed to sort them out. A modest three bedroom home in a working class suburb now commands a rent of &euro;1,500 month, yet no relief is available to the sector.</P>
    <P>However, there is continued relief for those who have been privileged to live under the tax shelters and who have been protected for decades by successive Governments. Over the past five years I have repeatedly raised in this House the scandal of the stud farm industry, which has escaped any kind of substantial taxation. I was going to suggest that the stallions in Kildare would sleep easy in their stalls tonight, but they probably will not sleep because they will be disturbed by their millionaire owners celebrating another budget which has not laid a finger on them. No doubt the champagne will flow late into the night in tribute to their Minister who has protected them once again. We have the spectacle of a single horse in a prestigious stud farm, perhaps Sadlers Wells, earning &euro;250 every time it covers a mare, one animal earning &euro;20 million, at a conservative guess, in a year. In the prestigious stud, Coolmore, where there are dozens of such horses, hundreds of millions of euro must be earned with not a cent paid in taxation.</P>
    <P>Every morning, working class women from Dublin west and from working class communities in cities and towns, in the black winter morning long before dawn, drag themselves from their beds and make an often long trek to offices and factories to clean them before the day staff arrive. They do this to earn some money in order to maintain their families. Every cent they earn is taxable and if they earn the minimum wage they will still qualify for PAYE as the Minister has refused to remove them from the net in today's budget.</P>
    <P>There is a double whammy suffered by PAYE workers. The owners of these tax-free stud farms are tax exiles in many cases. They are millionaires who fly in at the weekend in their private jets from their luxury retreats in Barbados or Switzerland or wherever. They fly by helicopter to their tax-free stud farms, swan around at prestigious horse races with often a Taoiseach or a Minister for Finance tugging at their arm. They will often show up at their favourite charity event because <Col N="1305" /> they all have favourite charities; it makes them look quite good. If they paid their taxes we would get ten, 20 or 30 times more for necessary services than their so-called charitable endeavours earn. The reality is they continue to be protected by this Government.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have dealt shamefully with the funding of local authorities. In the 1980s there were savage cutbacks and in 1983 there was the double cross of the possibility of local authorities raising service charges for water and refuse as a parallel tier of local taxation again hitting PAYE workers. Happily the outraged among the PAYE sector and their demonstration of people power in the 1990s forced the abolition of the hated water tax. That was an important reform because otherwise we would now have a parallel tier of taxation with charges of perhaps &euro;100 per year for the average family or household. The Minister for Finance would like that.</P>
    <P>As a result of the cutbacks in real terms in spending on the local government fund, we have new pressures on local authorities to raise charges. Bin taxes are going through the roof. Be warned, I say to the Government. There is a movement of mass opposition in Dublin which is spreading and will intensify if this pressure continues.</P>
    <P>There are all kinds of extra taxes under different guises which have been imposed today on working people. The charge on bank cards, the tax on drink and cigarettes, are all extra ways to soak more from working class people. Let us not pretend that they are imposed for health reasons.</P>
    <P>There are resources in this society but we have a Government and a system which considers those resources untouchable because they belong to the most privileged layer. We have a Government that preaches prudence and care with public funds but it hands over our fabulous natural wealth in the Corrib gas field to multi-nationals without a single cent being charged in royalties. Yet students at a difficult time in their lives are hit with registration fees in an attempt to bring back full fees. This budget is saturated with the right wing values of capitalism, with the class interests of capitalism which Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats represent. It is saturated with the values of globalisation and favouritism for the very powerful. Working people should resist it. Leaders of trade unions who have been too cosy in their dealings with the bosses and the Government should be forced to resist it so that we get back the amount of wealth that has been transferred from working people to the super wealthy. There will be no return to the 1980s and the programme of cutbacks of that time.</P>
    <P>I counterpose to the rich person's philosophy of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael a society that is democratically owned, controlled and managed, where the resources are for the benefit of all, not for the tiny minority. In that democratic socialist society, as I see it, we can have dignity, equality and enough for everybody.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Financial Resolution No. 1 is an anti-avoidance measure aimed at closing off an unintended use of capital allowances by passive investors in the area of electricity generation. Where individuals are merely &ldquo;passive investors&rdquo; in electricity generation, that is, where they invest in electricity generation without actively participating in the trade, it is intended to restrict their entitlement to tax reliefs. In future, such individuals will not be entitled to set off losses and capital allowances of such a trade against their other income so as to reduce their income tax liability.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Over the past few years, the Minister for Finance has taken action on a number of occasions against tax avoidance schemes which used tax incentives and the tax code in artificial or packaged ways to reduce effective tax rates on high incomes to very low levels. In the 1998 budget, for example, the Minister took action against &ldquo;asset-backed&rdquo; schemes, where individual passive investors used special incentive reliefs in relation to expenditure on certain buildings so as to reduce the tax liability on their employment income. If unchecked, schemes such as these would allow individuals with high income to avoid paying their fair share of tax to the disadvantage of the general body of taxpayers.</P>
    <P Just="Center">What is proposed in this resolution is entirely consistent with the Minister's approach in other instances in recent years of ringfencing losses and capital allowances for passive investors so that they prevent a reduction in tax on their employment income. That is what we are seeking to do here. The schemes countered by this resolution are in the area of electricity generation using wind turbines. The schemes appear to have no real economic purpose other than to provide tax efficient investment opportunities for high earning individuals. There appears to be little risk associated with the investment. No new turbines are built. Instead, turbines erected by companies who continue to operate them are acquired by the passive investors. The only effect of the schemes, therefore, is to increase the tax cost to the State of turbines already erected.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Under the schemes, tax reliefs which in the hands of a trading company would be set off against income taxable at the rate of 12.5% are transferred to individuals. In the hands of the individuals, these same reliefs can be set against income arising from sources other than the trade of electricity generation and which would otherwise be taxable at the 42% rate. This resolution has no effect on individuals or companies who are genuinely engaged in a full-time capacity in the trade of electricity generation or supply. The measure is targeted at passive investors who do not participate in such businesses in an active way. The resolution seeks to restrict the way the tax reliefs work so that the reliefs can only be <Col N="1311" /> used to shelter the individual's income from tax to the extent, if any, that it is earned from electricity generation. It is estimated that this anti-avoidance measure could prevent tax leakages of up to &euro;10 million per year over the next few years. I commend the resolution to the House.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Resolution No. 2 seeks to impose for the tax year 2002 and subsequent years an earnings cap of &euro;254,000 on the amount of remuneration on which an employee may get tax relief in respect of contributions made by him or her to an occupational pension scheme. The House will recall that in last year's Finance Act the relief available to employees was considerably increased on an age-related basis from 15% of remuneration to a maximum of 30% of remuneration at the age of 50 years or over. The same cap of &euro;254,000 has applied since 1999 in respect of retirement annuity contracts for the self-employed and employees not in pensionable employment and is also being applied to the new personal retirement savings accounts which are expected to be available early in the new year. The existing caps apply as a single cap to the aggregate of the contributions made by an individual to an RAC and PRSA. In the same vein, a single cap will now apply to the aggregate contributions made by an individual to all three pension arrangements, namely, occupational pension schemes, RACs and PRSAs. The new cap only applies to contributions made on or after today. Therefore, pension contributions made by employees before today are unaffected by the change, even if they would have exceeded the limit being imposed.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The resolution does not affect the amount an employee may put away for his or her retirement. That is not the issue. It merely limits the amount on which he or she may obtain tax relief. For example, an individual aged over 50 years with earnings of &euro;300,000 could still put aside &euro;150,000 a year, but the tax relief will be restricted to &euro;76,200, or 30% of &euro;254,000, instead of &euro;90,000, or 30% of &euro;300,000. The excess contribution will be carried forward for relief in later years subject to the limits on relief for those years.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The resolution does not affect the amount an employer may put into an occupational pension scheme for his or her employees. Employer contributions will continue to be allowable up to whatever amount is required to secure the benefits under the scheme subject to Revenue approval limits, for example, a maximum pension of two-thirds of final salary.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The earnings cap &ndash; both the existing cap applying to the self-employed and the proposed cap for employees &ndash; will have no impact for the generality of taxpayers as it is set at a generous level of &euro;254,000. It is unlikely that much more than 10,000 taxpayers, about half of whom would be higher paid employees or proprietary directors, will be affected. I commend the resolution to the House.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Resolution No. 3 is concerned with mortgage interest relief and, especially, the enhanced <Col N="1312" /> amount of interest that qualifies for relief in the case of first-time buyers. Income tax relief at the standard rate is granted in respect of interest paid on loans used by an individual for the purchase, repair, development or improvement of a person's sole or main residence. Since 1 January 2002 this relief is given &ldquo;at source&rdquo; and applies to interest payments up to a maximum of &euro;3,175 for a single person or &euro;6,350 for married or widowed persons for the first five years for which mortgage interest relief is due. In the case of persons outside the five year period, the interest limits are &euro;2,540 for single persons and &euro;5,080 for widowed or married persons.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The existing higher ceilings for first-time buyers on allowable interest are being increased further, from &euro;6,350 to &euro;8,000 for married couples and widowed persons, and &euro;3,175 to &euro;4,000 for single persons. In addition, the period for which increased amounts of relievable interest will be granted to first-time claimants is being extended from five to seven years. Some 122,300 first-time claimants enjoy the benefit of the higher interest ceilings at the existing levels which are available for five years. From 2003 an estimated 45,000 beneficiaries will benefit from this measure, the cost of which is in the order of &euro;6 million next year and &euro;8 million in a full year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The new arrangements will apply from next January and be of benefit to individuals who began to claim tax relief in respect of mortgage interest in the tax year 1998-99 or later. All such persons will enjoy a further two years giving them a total of seven years during which their relief will be based on the higher interest ceilings. Persons who commence to claim in 2003 will also benefit. The new arrangements will come into effect in January and it is necessary to have the statutory authority tonight to cover that period.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The measure proposed recognises the difficulties faced by home buyers in current circumstances and will obviously be of assistance. The enhanced first-time buyer's ceiling will benefit those who have sufficient interest to absorb the higher allowance. It is targeted at those first-time buyers who have had to raise or are about to raise high mortgages. Mortgage interest relief covers both new and second-hand houses, whereas the first-time buyer's grant applied only in the case of new houses. Thus, the measure proposed will not just benefit those who would have received the first-time buyer's grant, but all first-time buyers. The estimate is based on the number of first-time buyers who will have sufficient interest to absorb some or all of the enhanced allowance and on the number of those who will benefit from the extension of the period.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The proposed measure on mortgage interest relief will provide a maximum additional amount of relief worth &euro;1,409 for single persons or &euro;2,818 for couples or widowed persons over a seven year period. The total potential tax relief available to a first-time buyer over the seven years will amount to &euro;11,200 in the case of a couple and <Col N="1313" />&euro;5,600 in the case of a single person. I commend the resolution to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with the third proposal first. The sum total of the concession is &euro;330 to a married couple or half that amount to a single first-time buyer. To understand how that does not meet what is required one merely has to bear in mind that the saving from the first-time buyer's grant, which was abolished, is close to &euro;40 million. The additional 1% levy in VAT imposed on first-time buyers of new houses will bring in about &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,000 per house which will yield another &euro;25 million. First-time buyers, therefore, will be asked to yield about &euro;65 million next year and the Taoiseach said the Government is giving &euro;6 million in return. Only one tenth of what the budget is taking from first-time buyers is being returned in this concession. Those on the back benches who believed their protest would be heard will be disappointed. First-time buyers will be disgusted.</P>
      <P>The sad reality is that first-time buyers are a minority in the new housing market. Fewer than one in five new houses go to first-time buyers. The vast majority go to those trading up or investors. To evaluate this financial resolution one only has to examine what the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance did last year for investors. They were given the concession of a cut of 6% on their stamp duty which meant a saving for them of &euro;12,000 to &euro;15,000 on a typical house. On top of this, they were granted 100% interest relief at the top rate of 42%. The value to investors of interest relief given last year was about &euro;5,250 as against this concession today of &euro;330.</P>
      <P>The Government is deliberately and systematically making it difficult, if not impossible, for the first-time buyer to get onto the first rungs of home ownership. Some simple things could have been done that would not have been hugely costly. For example, the threshold for stamp duty on second hand houses is currently &euro;190,000, which is much less than the average house price in the country, let alone in Dublin. If that threshold had been pushed up to &euro;400,000, the cost to the Exchequer would have been &euro;2.5 million, which is buttons, but would have meant that first time buyers in the second hand market would not have to worry about stamp duty. That would have been somewhat reformist and shown insight into what is happening in the housing market. The stop-go approach to the housing market has produced the sort of problems we are seeing. More young families on what used to be good incomes are being forced to go back on to the housing lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great idea of affordable housing has only produced 500 houses for the whole country. It is not generating a response to the need. Only 2% of house purchases are through the shared ownership scheme, which is the other great hope. This is only scratching the surface of the problems faced by huge numbers of people who are trying to become homeowners. This resolution on mort<Col N="1314" /> gage relief simply ignores what is happening in the housing market. There is no understanding of what is going on.</P>
    <P>Many people in my area are on rent supplement, including single parents and other single people who are trying to get by. Their income after paying rent is &euro;111 and the Minister has decided to take &euro;4.30 off them. Why is the Minister imposing that sort of mean-minded petty cut on the poorest of the poor? The people targeted in these housing measures are the poorest of the poor and the first-time buyer. If the Government wanted to do something in the housing market to generate some revenue, why not bring some equity back and do something in relation to investors who are having a field day at the moment? They have kept up prices and have enjoyed huge increases in rent.</P>
    <P>I cannot oppose Financial Resolution No. 1, which the Taoiseach eloquently described as simply a loophole that was robbing the taxpayer of money. However, at a time when we are considering loopholes, why do we continue to tolerate the use of residence as the basis for capital acquisitions tax and income tax instead of domicile? Since the Government brought in this concession it has just been a charter for people who have the ability to bed and breakfast offshore to avoid paying any taxes in Ireland. I know some changes have been made in relation to CGT after the horse has bolted. Real tax shelters have been created by this Government and the measures in pursuit of these tax shelters will only yield &euro;10 million. Much more could have been done. One characteristic of this Government has been to provide tax shelters at the upper reaches of the tax scale and not for those lower down.</P>
    <P>The proposal to put a ceiling on the contributions to pension funds is correct. I understand that ceiling already exists in relation to the self-employed, so it merely applies the same ceiling in both areas. It shows the difference in standards we are applying in many ways. Here we are capping the tax-free contribution that can go into a pension fund at &euro;76,200 per year. This is a far cry from the problems of the people we thought we would be protecting in the budget. They do not have &euro;80,000 to spare to put into a pension fund each year. While this is not an objectionable measure and it is good to encourage contributions to pension funds, we must be aware that the huge increases in the ceilings for pension fund contributions in recent times have been used as a way of avoiding a very substantial amount of tax.</P>
    <P>This year when we are not even giving indexation to the people at the bottom, it is hard to understand the balance that is being struck by Government in relation to the tax contributions of people at the top and bottom of the scale. These concessions have nothing to do with ensuring that tax is collected fairly from those with the greatest ability to pay. Quite a different agenda was being pursued. That is what has come unstuck about this tax policy and the way this budget has been structured perpetuates the series <Col N="1315" /> of budgets that have gone before it and does not come to grips with the needs of people at the bottom of the scale. There are too many people on very low incomes paying tax and here we are giving a shelter up to &euro;254,000 in the pension fund area. There is an imbalance that cannot even escape the Taoiseach and Tánaiste as they look at our economy and society.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak specifically to Financial Resolution No. 3, which deals with mortgage interest relief. The Government is trumpeting this measure as addressing the needs of first-time buyers following the Government's earlier disgraceful decision to abolish the first-time buyer's grant. Today's measure to slightly increase the mortgage interest relief ceiling for first-time buyers goes nowhere near addressing the problems faced by those buyers as a result of the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant. By trying to redress the problem in this way, the Government is clearly demonstrating it does not understand the problem in the first place. This problem relates to the difficulty that first-time buyers have in assembling a deposit and in being in a position to compete with investors who are now buying four out of every five new dwellings that come on the market.</P>
      <P>When one looks at the cost of this measure, one discovers the real giveaway. The cost of the increase in mortgage interest relief will be &euro;6 million next year and &euro;8 million in a full year. The Government is saving &euro;40 million next year in the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant. In other words, what is being given back to first-time buyers under this measure is at best one fifth of what the Government is taking away through the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant. Indeed the 1% increase on basic rate of VAT will make things worse because it will go directly on the price of houses. The average price of a new house is now in excess of &euro;200,000. An increase of 1% on that will mean an additional &euro;2,000 to the first-time buyer. First-time buyers are being hit on the double. They are being conned by a measure which goes nowhere near compensating the first-time buyer's grant, and are then being hit by the increase in VAT.</P>
      <P>There is another measure in the budget that will also impact on the first-time buyer, albeit indirectly. That relates to the changes in stamp duty on non-residential property, the effect of which I believe will be to encourage investors in property to shift from non-residential to residential property, thus increasing the pressure in the residential property market on the first-time buyer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1316" />A comparison between what has been done for first-time buyers and what is being done for the corporate sector indicates the extent to which the Government is giving the two fingers to the first-time buyer with this measure. The reduction in corporation tax will be of 40 times greater benefit to corporate Ireland than the measure seemingly introduced to address the problems facing first-time buyers. The Government appears to be trying to give the impression that this measure will redress the difficulty it created with the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant. It will do nothing of the kind. Its introduction in this manner, coupled with the increase in VAT which will add to the price of houses, is an insult to the intelligence of first-time buyers and will hit them in their pockets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be aware that nobody has a problem with ending tax shelters. However, to use such tax shelters as a reason for introducing Financial Resolution No. 1 fails to give the whole picture. It is important to consider this in the context of the Taoiseach's reference to investments such as wind energy. There should be no need to give tax breaks to encourage renewable energy. If the economy was organised in a way which took into account the full costs of activities such as energy generation, renewable energy would be very competitive. Regardless of the rhetoric emanating from the Government in support of renewable energy, the reality is there is a willingness on its part to allow the fossil fuel sector to avoid paying the full costs associated with its activities.</P>
      <P>Tax shelters are inherently unjust and perpetuate the divisions in society. I ask the Taoiseach to address the fact that the fossil fuel sector does not pay its share of the cost of climate change and pays nothing towards either flood prevention, the high insurance premia floods cause, the health problems associated with air pollution or the damage to buildings associated with acid rain. Rather than discussing tax breaks, he should encourage measures to place a realistic value on energy generation by internalising its costs. The taxpayer has subsidised gas pipelines and the grid for fossil fuel power stations for years. We need to strip down all the tax breaks offered to this sector and internalise its costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Financial Resolution No. 3 is a different matter. It is similar to Financial Resolution No. 1 only in the sense that while mortgage interest relief is portrayed as a means of assisting people, the new measure does nothing more than provide material for a press release. The benefits from the higher limits will be quickly eaten up by the cost of living, the main part of which for the house buyer is the cost of the house. We should revisit the Kenny report and its fundamental recommendations for addressing the core issue under debate, namely, the price of houses. The housing market is being dictated by sheer greed on the part of people so focused on profit they are prepared to allow others to live in misery and pov<Col N="1317" /> erty rather than forego their profiteering. A further issue which must be addressed is the price of land for housing.</P>
    <P>When I asked about the Kenny report in a parliamentary question last week, I was informed there were constitutional issues to be addressed. If this is the case with regard to the provision of housing and shelter, the most basic necessities of life, let us address these constitutional problems by holding a referendum. There have been few problems to date with holding referenda when the Government feels like it, as demonstrated by the decision to hold two referenda on exactly the same issue.</P>
    <P>Let us have a referendum on an issue of fundamental importance, namely, the widening gap between rich and poor in society, much of which is perpetuated by the price of housing and property. While those with property can increase their wealth many times over, those without are left to try to scrape together the price of rent and those fortunate enough to get on the property ladder must scrape to pay for a mortgage.</P>
    <P>We need to start talking about fundamental problems. These will not be solved by mortgage interest relief or even the first-time buyer's grant, which was at least more up-front and generous than this measure. We need to be focused. We already have the Kenny report and the Government needs to implement it. If a referendum is required, let us have one to ensure we can proceed in a manner compatible with the Constitution.</P>

      <P>In relation to Financial Resolution No. 1, listening to the Minister for Finance's address this afternoon I was surprised this solitary area was singled out for special address. I would have expected a raft of loopholes, as they were described by the Taoiseach earlier, to be addressed this evening. I hope this loophole will be followed by many others because, as the Taoiseach has acknowledged in recent weeks, there are so many which need to be addressed.</P>
      <P>I will not oppose the resolution. However, there is much more to be done. As the only resolution which addresses the whole area of people involved in business &ndash; active traders &ndash; it is interesting. I am sure Members will have noted the Minister's failure to underline or even acknowledge, other than in his preamble, the fact that the standard rate of corporation tax on trading profits will fall to 12.5% with effect from 1 January 2003. One will not find reference to this in the text of the Minister's statement. As it is unlikely there will be another opportunity to highlight this fact, I draw attention to it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly the proposal in Financial Resolution No. 2 will not be greeted by some people in the legal profession and other high earners about <Col N="1318" /> whom we spoke in the recent past. What is proposed will only marginally affect people who can put away sums in excess of &euro;250,000 for their pension provision. We are dealing with a world I and perhaps the Taoiseach can hardly imagine.</P>

      <P>I wonder why we are being so generous in terms of the cut-off points that are applied. These strike me as strange. The Taoiseach stated the excess can be carried forward. Why is this? It is not a justifiable position. If people have the wherewithal to put away such sums, it should be done on a yearly basis. The notion that the excess can be carried forward for assessment in the next or subsequent years does not stand up.</P>
      <P>Financial Resolution No. 3 is a smokescreen. The notion that it will in any way compensate first-time home buyers is unfounded, although it applies to first-time home buyers of both new and second-hand homes. The sum of &euro;6 million was referred to for 2003 and &euro;8 million in a full year. Does it not apply from 1 January? Why were two figures quoted in the Taoiseach's opening remarks? The first-time buyer's grant applied to new homes only. How will this change compensate for the increase in the lower rate of VAT from 12.5% to 13.5%? How will it impact on house prices? It will not do anything at all.</P>

This measure is simply a smokescreen that does nothing to relieve the pain of recent decisions by the Government in regard to the first-time buyer's grant and the increase in the lower rate of VAT. As Deputy Gilmore raised the point in regard to stamp duty that this particular measure might actually have the opposite effect to that intended, it is not one that I will underline in this contribution.</P>

      <P>They will count at the weekend as soon as individual first-time buyers come to see them to go through it in detail. They are being offered &euro;350 as compared to &euro;3,850. That is the comparison. This appears to have been sold to backbenchers by the Minister for Finance on the basis that they need not worry about the scrapping of the first-time buyer's grant because mortgage interest relief will take care of it. That certainly has not happened. It was pathetic today to see them try to muster feeble applause on the basis that the damage done to the first-time buyer was somehow repaired in this minimalist measure which is worth virtually nothing. It is a spit in the eye to the first-time buyer.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the affordable housing bruited about so much by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen. As Deputy Bruton said, it is 500 houses, most confined to the Fingal local authority area. It is factored into the price. It is essentially in the deposit. The cheque went to the local authority, not the first-time buyer.</P>

      <P>It is incorrect to say the Government has failed to provide incentives for investment in renewable energy, including wind turbines. Deputy Sargent knows the number of schemes, some of which are tax-based while others provide price support for the output of such turbines. I do not have time to go through all of them, but there is a corporate tax rate, capital allowances, companies specific tax relief, individual specific tax relief and an alternative energy requirement programme. There are, therefore, many initiatives.</P>

      <P>If we could do something about stopping objections, it would be far better than letting on that there are no reliefs. That would be the main purpose.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the first-time buyer's grant, as the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, has already stated, was to encourage house building at a time when there was only a handful of houses being built. That is what it was all about.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because of the Government's policies. Of the 23,000 first-time house buyers, 10,000 or 45% bought new houses while 55% bought second hand houses. Deputy Rabbitte is correct that some Members cannot count but they do not sit on this side of the House. A married couple will receive &euro;133.33 per month for the first seven years of their mortgage and, therefore, the increased relief is worth an extra &euro;1,409.</P>

    <P>(8) The delivery of any statement required by subsection (2) may be enforced by the Commissioners under section 47 of the Succession Duty Act, 1853, in all respects as if such statement were such account as is mentioned in that section and the failure to deliver such statement were such default as is mentioned in that section.</P>
    <P>(9) A promoter shall be entitled to charge to the card account the amount of stamp duty payable in respect of the debit card by virtue of this section and may apply the terms and conditions governing that account to interest on that amount.</P>

    <P>This resolution provides for increases in stamp duty for non-residential property and for various financial cards and cheques. Stamp duty is a good contributor to the Exchequer and this helps to fund public services while keeping the direct tax burden low thereby facilitating continued economic success. Stamp duty on the items in question has not been increased for several years and it is, <Col N="1342" /> therefore, appropriate that an increase in stamp duty be made at this time to assist the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>As regards non-residential property, the resolution provides for a change in the stamp duty rates and threshold structure on conveyances, transfers and leases of non-residential property. At present, there is an exemption from stamp </P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1343" /> duty on such property up to &euro;6,350 and, thereafter, stamp duty is charged at rates of 1% to 6%, with the top rate being applied to amounts in excess of &euro;76,200. The various threshold amounts will now be increased so that an exemption from stamp duty will apply on the property up to &euro;10,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>What property could one buy for &euro;10,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Thereafter, stamp duty will be charged at the existing rates at higher thresholds up to 6% and this rate will now be applied to amounts in excess of &euro;80,000, but not exceeding &euro;100,000. Three new higher rates are being introduced &ndash; 7% for non-residential property valued between &euro;100,001 and &euro;120,000, 8% for non-residential property valued between &euro;120,001 and &euro;150,000 and 9% for non-residential property valued over &euro;150,000.</P>
      <P>Changes have been made to the stamp duty on residential property in recent years, but no amendments have been made to the non-residential property rates and thresholds since 1 September 1990. While the top rate of stamp duty for certain categories of residential property is now 9%, the top rate for non-residential property has remained at 6%. The new rates now being introduced will ensure that the top rate of 9% will exist for both residential and non-residential property.</P>
      <P>The new structure will apply for conveyances, transfers and for the premium element in leases of non-residential property executed on or after 4 December 2002, subject to certain transitional arrangements. These transitional arrangements will apply where the purchaser has a binding contract in place before today and, in such cases, the old rates and thresholds will continue to apply where the conveyance, transfer or lease is executed before 1 March 2003. The additional yield, as a result of these changes, is expected to be &euro;118 million in 2003 and &euro;158 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>This resolution also provides for an increase in the stamp duty charged on bills of exchange, including cheques, and on promissory notes, as well as on various financial cards. It also provides for the introduction of an annual stamp duty charge on Laser cards.</P>
      <P>The rate of stamp duty on bills of exchange, including cheques, and on promissory notes will be increased from eight cent to 15 cent. The increased rate will apply for cheques supplied by financial institutions to customers on or after 5 December 2002 and for other bills of exchange and promissory notes drawn on or after 1 January 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate of stamp duty on credit cards and charge cards will be increased from &euro;19 to &euro;40 per annum. This rate will apply to accounts, in the case of credit cards, and to cards, in the case of charge cards, to be included in the appropriate <Col N="1344" /> returns to be sent by a banker or promoter to the Revenue Commissioners on or after 5 December 2002.</P>
    <P>The stamp duty rate for ATM cards which do not have a Laser function will be increased from &euro;6.25 to &euro;10 per card per annum. Stamp duty will be introduced for Laser cards. Regarding Laser cards which do not have an ATM function, the rate will be &euro;10 per card per annum. Where cards have a combined ATM and Laser function, the stamp duty rate will be increased from &euro;6.25 to &euro;20 per card per annum. The increased rate for ATM and combined cards, as well as the new charge for Laser cards, will apply in respect of cards which are valid at any time on or after 5 December 2002 and are included in the appropriate return to be sent by a bank or a building society to the Revenue Commissioners on or after that date.</P>
    <P>The stamp duty rates on many of these items have not been increased for many years. For example, the stamp duty charge on cheques has not been increased since 1984, while the rate of stamp duty on credit cards and charge cards has not been increased since 1992. This has resulted in a reduction in real terms in the rate of these duties, given that the increase in the consumer price index between 1984 and mid-October 2002 has been about 77% and the corresponding increase between 1992 and mid-October 2002 has been of the order of 34%. No stamp duty was charged on Laser cards in the past as it was a relatively new concept that also needed to be promoted. However, they are now used widely and all of these products are now well embedded in the financial system.</P>
    <P>The additional yield, as a result of these changes in the stamp duty charged on the various financial cards and cheques, is estimated to be &euro;51 million in 2003 and &euro;52 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>It is against the background of the increasing costs to business that we are opposing the imposition of extra stamp duty. Increasing stamp duty costs on commercial property transactions to 9% is another additional cost at a time when there are two million square feet of vacant commercial property in the north Leinster area generally. The Tánaiste, in particular, will be well aware of the escalating costs to business and the deterioration in the competitiveness of the economy, about which she has done nothing. She will also be aware that we have now dropped from fifth to 24 in terms of world competitiveness according to the World Economic Forum report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an imposition of stamp duty for financial transactions for business and individuals, <Col N="1345" /> which is anti-consumer in nature, and an imposition of additional stamp duty on people in the commercial sector who wish to create employment. Is there any semblance of pro-enterprise activity left in the Progressive Democrats? </P>

      <P>On top of energy charges and all the other costs in respect of enterprise and employment, an additional stamp duty of 2% has been added to the exorbitant charge of 7% that already exists. Additionally, the Government is expecting to get another &euro;100 million from the banks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot come to terms with it. It is inequitable and I do not understand why he put forward that argument. He argues that there is a surplus of commercial and industrial properties. An additional 2% on stamp duty is not the relevant factor. The business climate and the way it <Col N="1351" /> operates affects the type of property that is used. It varies from time to time and it is based on many other factors such as location, etc. That is the reality. I had a property in Dublin and I moved for various reasons. That is the issue, not the 2%. It was inequitable that commercial property was treated in that manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes it is but let us bear in mind what this budget is trying to do. It is a balanced budget to achieve a wide range of objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>So tax everybody, is that it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my first opportunity to speak and I am trying to direct my comments through the Chair. It is a balanced budget to achieve a wide range of objectives. I admit this is an additional burden of tax, but what will it be? If an investor buys a property and lets it to a business, the business will ultimately pay a higher rent. The return to the Exchequer will be approximately &euro;50 million but it is a balanced budget and if Deputy Hogan was here I would put that to him.</P>
      <P>There has also been a reduction in the rate of corporation tax, from 16% to 12.5%. If that was a matter for debate now, Deputies on the other side of the House would probably argue that the money lost from such a reduction could have been used to fund services. However, this balanced budget will achieve a wide range of objectives. It is wrong to cherry-pick issues such as arguing that the increase in stamp duty on commercial property amounts to a tax on business and a disincentive. That argument cannot be made in isolation. The wider aspects of the budget favour business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP" hpid="Mr. Cuffe Mr. Cuffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure effectively amounts to a 50% increase in stamp duty on commercial property. For the bulk of commercial properties the increase will be from 6% to 9%. That represents a heavy anti-business tax and is not the right way to proceed.</P>
      <P>Stamp duty is an invidious tax as it acts as a disincentive to move to an appropriate building. In the residential sector it prevents empty nesters, for example older people, from moving down to a smaller house that might be more appropriate to their needs. The same trend will emerge in the commercial sector where businesses will strain at the seams or under-occupy larger buildings.</P>
      <P>Stamp duty is also not a good tax from a business point of view. It will reduce competitiveness in the commercial area and act as a disincentive to businesses of all sizes to move to appropriate premises. This will affect our international competitiveness. It would be much better to tax business in a more streamlined manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>To raise &euro;185 million a fractional increase in corporation tax would be a more appropriate step to take.

      <P>The corporation tax rate should have been maintained at 16%. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been especially engaging in this debate. He described the collective Opposition as an assembly of losers, a light-headed remark.</P>

      <P>It would not be viewed as light-hearted by the assembly of losers outside this Chamber in view of the reality of the measures introduced by the budget. I welcome the Minister's decision to impose a levy of &euro;100 million per annum on the banks and financial institution for three years. He could have gone further. It is something I have advocated in my pre-budget submissions on behalf of Sinn Féin to the Minister during the years. It is good to note that he is reading and listening. It would do the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform no harm to also read and listen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean what I said. Workers are either paid by cheque or their wages are paid directly to their accounts. Many do not operate cheque books and are provided with a credit or ATM card to access their wages. They will now have to pay the Government for the right to access their weekly wages, which is a disgrace.</P>
      <P>The duty on ATM cards is to increase from &euro;6.25 to &euro;10 and from &euro;6.50 to &euro;20 on joint ATM and Laser cards. Stamp duty on the use of cheques will continue. Deputies on the other side of the House may scoff at these increases because they are small by comparison with their incomes, but these are disgraceful increases for the great majority of workers who must draw their weekly wages in this manner. I reject them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy Hogan's point on the stamp duty on ATM and credit cards, during the years the Government has given a great benefit to consumers in the form of reductions in income tax. The stamp duty on these cards was first introduced by a colleague <Col N="1353" /> of the Deputy 20 years ago. Increases were last imposed in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Very few could afford ATM or credit cards then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was also introduced for cheques. Investors in commercial properties such as offices are usually bodies such as pension funds, life assurance companies and corporate investors. They will not switch to residential property where investors are individuals. Two issues are being confused here. However unusual, I appreciate the right of the parties of the left to favour the activities of pension funds, life assurance companies and corporate investors in the commercial sector against the interests of those involved in the residential market. Pension funds and life assurance companies are not interested in the property market. The few which were in it thought they would never get out of it and are unlikely to re-enter.</P>
      <P>The new rates will increase the stamp duty exposure for commercial operations. They must be seen in the context of a competitive corporation tax regime of a 12.5% tax on profits. I ask Members on the other side of the House to reflect on what they are saying. On the one hand, they argue that we did not take enough from the corporate sector while, on the other hand, they seek to defend the sector when we have taken money from it. They must make up their minds on where they stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have reduced capital gains tax from 40% to 20% and the income tax burden has been significantly reduced over successive budgets. In addition, the stamp duty payable by purchasers is an allowable deduction for capital gains tax purposes. Stamp duty provides approximately 4.5% <Col N="1354" /> of the total tax take. While it will not affect competitiveness, the corporation tax rate will. It makes no sense to argue against the reduction in the corporation tax rate to 12.5% while also arguing against the changes in stamp duty.</P>
    <P>We are seeking in the budget to ensure there is a reasonable take from stamp duty headings in order that those who make and have made substantial profits for the last seven or eight years from the commercial sector pay a reasonable amount of tax. The Minister has tried to increase stamp duty as a proportion of total tax receipts. The proportion increased to 4.2% in 2000 and 4.4% in 2001.</P>
    <P>He is being ridiculed in this House tonight because he is trying to take some more tax from what are normally called the fat cats but tonight they are the angels &ndash; the insurance companies and pensions and life funds. I am sure I will not be disappointed in this vote.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolution No. 6: Excise &ndash; Spirits.</Title>
    <P>(1) THAT in this Resolution &ldquo;alcohol&rdquo; means pure ethyl alcohol.</P>
    <P Just="Center">(2) THAT the duty of excise on spirits imposed by paragraph 4 (2) of the Imposition of Duties (No. 221) (Excise Duties) Order 1975 (S.I. No. 307 of 1975) shall, in lieu of the rates specified in the Second Schedule to the Finance Act, 1996 (No. 9 of 1996) as amended by section 240 of, and Part 3 of Schedule 5 to, the Finance Act, 2001 (No. 7 of 2001), be charged, levied and paid, as on and from 5 December 2002, at the rate of &euro;39.25 per litre of alcohol in the spirits.</P>
    <P Just="Center">(3) IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P Just="Center">Financial Resolution No. 5 provides for an excise duty increase on tobacco products with effect from midnight tonight which, when VAT is included, amounts to an increase of 50 cent on a packet of 20 cigarettes with pro rata increases on other tobacco products. The increase is expected to yield &euro;138.5 million in a full year and to increase the CPI by an estimated 0.42%. It is expected that the increase in price will reduce projected consumption by 2.5% compared to what it would otherwise have been. The Government remains very concerned about smoking and its impact on health. A substantial increase should help to discourage smoking, particularly by young people. </P>
    <P Just="Center">Financial Resolution No. 6 provides for an increase of excise duty on spirits which, when VAT is included, amounts to 20 cent per standard measure of spirit. It also abolishes the lower rate of duty which currently applies to low strength spirit alcopop drinks. The measure will, when VAT is included, increase the tax on a typical bottle by 35 cent. The expected yield from these <Col N="1358" /> increases, which will take effect from midnight tonight, will be approximately &euro;89.8 million in a full year. The increases are also aimed at contributing to tackling the health and public order problems associated with excessive consumption of such drinks, particularly among young people. This measure will increase the CPI by approximately 0.176%.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the thinking behind this if it is to reduce the consumption of cigarettes and alcopops in particular. I wish to focus upon the alcopops issue for a moment. An extra 35 cent on the cost of a drink that already costs between &euro;4 and &euro;5 is going to have absolutely no impact on the number of alcopops sold on an annual basis. Barmen will tell you that young people who are buying alcopops often do not even look for their change. If the Government is serious about targeting a specific drink type and trying to price it so as to reduce consumption significantly, 35 cent is a miserable effort at doing so. An alcopop like Smirnoff Ice costs about &euro;5 in Dublin and &euro;4 outside Dublin. Raising this to &euro;5.35 is not going to reduce the consumption of that drink in Dublin. So this is effectively a taxation on the backs of young people on the pretence that the Government is trying to reduce the consumption of alcopops. The result will be that the exact same amount of alcopops will be drunk next year, in fact probably more because of the aggressive marketing campaigns those companies have. The Government, though, will be taking a nice slice of taxation off the backs of young people.</P>
      <P>I am happy to see the increase in prices on cigarettes. That is an adequate and good measure. In relation to the alcopops, however, this is neither one nor the other. It is not going to have the desired effect of reducing consumption. If the Government was serious about that it would significantly increase the price. This would force young people to think again and buy alternative drinks. Unfortunately that will not happen with this relatively small increase. We are taxing young people but getting no social benefit from it.</P>
      <P>We have the worst binge drinking problem in Europe, as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will know. It is not a laughing matter. Two out of every five 12 to 15 year-olds binge drink once a week at the moment. That is a horrifying figure, and most of them binge drink on alcopops. This measure will have no social impact in terms of reducing the consumption of this drink. On the other hand, it will tax young people. Consequently, I have a major problem with this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>My only advice to Deputy Coveney and his younger voters is to remember the old saying &ldquo;a pint of plain is your only man&rdquo;. This Government has not touched the pint and it is right not to do so. This particular measure is <Col N="1359" /> not a discrimination against young people. The Tánaiste has rightly pointed out that there is a great deal of excessive drinking. This measure more or less brings the alcopop-type drink in line with other spirits.</P>
      <P>The most important thing we can do in budgetary matters is to bring an element of simplification to the tax code. It is better that we harmonise similar drinks into similar tax brackets. That is basically what the Minister for Finance is attempting to do here. There is the other motive behind all of these measures of raising revenue at a time when we have seen a huge shortfall in the Exchequer returns in terms of tax revenue.</P>
      <P>It is rich and ironic to hear Fine Gael, who are supposedly, according to Garret Fitzgerald at least, being urged to move to the left, coming wildly to the aid of binge drinkers and, if you are to believe the debate on the previous resolutions, credit card holders&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;as if credit card holders in this country or any other are poor or disadvantaged people. The poor and the disadvantaged do not have bank accounts. Therefore, they do not even come under this particular user tax that is being imposed in relation to credit cards&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the last debate. We have moved onto cigarettes and alcopops now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it quite funny and rather rich to hear that happen. It is funny also to hear Deputy Cuffe of the Green Party coming to the defence of the large commercial investor class who have found that the stamp duty is now being raised. It is ironic to see left-wing parties in this House complaining about a budget which has taxed the business community more than the ordinary citizen. That is the kind of budget I am very much in favour of and I am disappointed to see left-wing parties in this House not recognising the clear principle that the Minister for Finance has outlined in that regard in this budget. This budget is increasing the tax take to a certain extent from the business classes and not from the ordinary people, PAYE or otherwise. That is the right approach in the current economic circumstances.</P>
      <P>In doing that the Minister for Finance has paid a very close ear to Fianna Fáil backbenchers, who have made the point continuously for the last few months that if we are to go through a straightening or difficult period it should not be at the expense of the less well off. That is evident in this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironic also that the parties opposite are criticising the Government from an almost pro-<Col N="1360" /> business right-wing perspective. After years of&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should focus his remarks on the resolutions before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am focused on the resolutions. It is a pity some of the Members opposite are not particularly focused on them. I am focusing on the issue of spirits and cigarettes. I would be interested to hear the views of the Tánaiste as to what extent this budget will add to inflation. I hope we can meet our inflation targets. My one serious worry about this budget is that it perhaps may add to inflation, though hopefully it will not.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coveney's spirited defence of young people in their binge drinking habits is just amusing. Perhaps he should find some other area to deploy his many talents. In relation to the overall effects&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a very intelligent contribution by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy is not the arbiter of intelligence in this House. If he was it would be a very sad day for the House and the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has spent about a minute on the relevant topic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Coveney about alcopops. To correct the record, he was not at all defending binge drinking. He was making the suggestion that the amount of taxation being put on alcopops was inadequate to have effect. I agree with him. It is mere tokenism. It is revenue raising rather than having the desired effect of preventing young people from drinking to excess.</P>
      <P>I am amused at the idea of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, being described as left-wing by Deputy Lenihan. I am sure Deputy McCreevy would be amused also. I have first-hand knowledge of the effects of cigarettes and addiction to them. I am disappointed at the level of additional taxation. A sum of 50 cent will not be effective in preventing people from taking up the habit. If it was &euro;2 to &euro;5 extra, making a packet something around &euro;10, that would prevent young people from taking up the habit in the numbers they are now doing according to statistics. As somebody who is suffering from the addiction of nicotine, I advise them not to take up this very bad, unhealthy and costly habit. There are no positives in it from any point of view.</P>
      <P>Extra taxation should be at a level that would be revenue neutral. There should be no extra take to the revenue because of the reduction that tax will cause in consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking extra revenue from cigarettes is the wrong way to go. I am not sure if the Minister for <Col N="1361" /> Finance can revisit this area. If he considers the impact of nicotine addiction on the cost of health care he should introduce a penal tax on cigarettes to make them so expensive that it would be difficult for people to avail of them widely and would discourage young people from starting to smoke.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The imposition of the tax on cigarettes has the dual purpose of raising revenue and promoting health. I represent Dublin South Central, a socially disadvantaged area. Many people, including single parents, in receipt of social welfare payments smoke cigarettes. I ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure that some of the revenue collected from the sale of cigarettes is directed towards putting in train various methods and programmes to assist people who want to give up cigarettes. Deputy Stagg said smoking is addictive and is difficult to give up particularly if it is the one addictive vice one has and is considered a necessary crutch. The increase in the excise duty on cigarettes will discourage young people from starting to smoke and perhaps that will be its greatest effect.</P>
      <P>The increase in the excise duty on alcohol is welcome. I am sure that a number of Members present saw the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme the other night on the behaviour of young people following the excessive consumption of alcohol. The increase of 20 cent on a measure of spirits will have an effect. Not only do young people use alcopops but they spike them from naggins of vodka which is a regular occurrence. With this measure, the price of vodka will also increase. We must not only increase the excise duty but we, as an Oireachtas, must put in place in the future some form of legislation or programme that will discourage young people from drinking to the extent that they do. This is a small step towards how that can be done.</P>
      <P>I met a person recently who said that the SSIAs should be abolished because it is terrible that such money is being given freely to people who are saving and the scheme is costing the country a fortune. He told me that he runs two pubs in the city and that people are coming in on only one night at the weekend rather than two. These measures will help address the drink problem, including the behaviour of young people who have consumed excessive alcohol, and the health aspect for cigarette smokers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that these price increases will have the sobering effect that is sought. It would have been a better exercise to ban alcopop drinks. The alcohol industry uses them as a device to lure young people in particular into binge drinking. While we will support the increase in this instance, banning alcopops would be the best way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1362" />The Leas-Cheann Comhairle might be able to give me some guidance on a matter, given that on a number of occasions I got advice from him on the long-standing traditions of this House. When I can I like to take such advice. Since I have been elected, I notice that it seems to be a long-standing tradition of the House that governments in general and Ministers for Finance in particular seem to be continually hoodwinking those who elect them to office. Is there any method I could use to change that long-standing tradition?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak on the issue of the 35 cent tax on alcopops. It is good this measure was introduced by the Minister for Finance because it is a topic of conversation following the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; special programme the other night. I join those who say that the 35 cent increase on the price of alcopops is not half enough. I am sure not one person buying an alcopop drink tonight knows the price of it or what it will cost after midnight following the increase. I watched on the RTE News this evening the reaction of young people who were asked for their view on the increase. They said that it would have no impact on their drinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the point we were making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance tapped into this issue by highlighting it in his Budget Statement and it is one to which we could usefully return. There seems to be a broad consensus on the damage to young people caused by the consumption of alcopops and the binge drinking sessions in which they engage at the weekend. I welcome this measure, but I would like it to be only the first step in a radical examination of this area.</P>
      <P>When I watched the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; special programme and saw gardaí on the street carrying people who were drunk and putting them into police cars I was shocked at the waste of hard earned taxpayers' money. The gardaí have more important things to do. It is tragic that these young people, drunk out of their minds, end up in the accident and emergency units of our hospitals. This is not a Dublin phenomenon. It is happening in every town. Doctors and nurses cannot be blamed for not wanting to work in these units at the weekend. Likewise, gardaí cannot be blamed for not wanting to work if that is their job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a good deal of publicity about the personal public service number. Such young people who end up in casualty departments would be too drunk to know their number, but a mechanism to provide for a minimum charge of, <Col N="1363" /> say, &euro;50 every time a person comes into the casualty unit drunk should be introduced. If they did not have that amount, having probably spent several times that sum in the pub prior to arriving at the casualty unit, their PPS number could be noted and the money could be taken out of their wages within 28 days if they did not pay the charge in the casualty department or to their local health board office, Such a charge would have a sobering effect. At issue is not only the impact of alcohol consumption on their health, for which society will have to pick up the tab as the years go by, but the immediate cost to the health services when they end up drunk in casualty units. There is a strong case for the introduction of such a minimum charge.</P>
    <P>Television advertising of alcopops must be radically examined. The industry should be given a short period in which to change its advertising approach and if it does not do so the House should ensure it happens. The advertising of alcopops is not even geared at teenagers but at nine and ten year olds to ensure that by the time they reach the age of 12 or 13 they will be buying these drinks. The advertising of these products should be radically overhauled as it is doing untold damage. Any money collected in revenue from tax on such products, including this increase, is not half enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard some justifications for the SSIAs, but Deputy Ardagh's excuse that they are actually a health measure took the biscuit. The excise duty on cigarettes does not go far enough. This issue led me to become involved in the environmental movement. I was always passionately opposed to cigarette smoking and its effects. We see those effects in terms of health.</P>
      <P>Prior to the publication of the Estimates, I met an American expert on cigarette pricing, as did the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley. I was given to understand from the statement issued subsequently by Deputy O'Malley that there would be a massive increase in the price of cigarettes, which I would welcome. I want cigarettes to be priced out of existence. This price increase will not do it. The Minister, Deputy Harney, said it would lead to a 2.5% reduction in smoking but that is nothing. Look at the number of people who are suffering from emphysema, heart disease and cancer. Deputy Fleming spoke about the cost of alcohol to the Exchequer and our hospitals. Look at the cost of cigarette smoking. It is phenomenal. We have to examine this again. There cannot be any more ambivalence. We can either see it as a revenue raising exercise or we can focus on the health issue. We should do the latter and say, for once and for all, that we have enough of cigarette smoking and its glamorisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" />The increase in the price of alcopops will not have any impact on the drinking habits of young people. We need to increase the price significantly if it is to act as a deterrent of any sort. The programme on RTE was sobering, if Members will pardon the pun. One could see the effects of alcopops. Why do we have alcopops? In the first place, they are easy to drink and they are sold to teenagers on that basis. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of women who get badly drunk, to such an extent that some of them have to get the morning after pill because they do not know what happened the previous night. That is the effect of alcopops. They are anti-social and have a devastating effect on society.</P>
    <P>Look at the violence on our streets. People who are drunk on alcopops seem to experience a different type of inebriation. They seem to have no respect for anybody. The inebriation is on a different level. We have to get extremely tough on this matter. Look at the number of fights that occur. How many constituents have written to us about their children's safety when they go into town on a Saturday night? People behave in a most violent way towards them for no reason.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, this resolution is simply a revenue raising exercise. It will not change behaviour, one of the reasons for taxation. Look at the success of the tax on plastic bags. That changed behaviour. I agree with Deputy Ardagh that we need more hypothecated taxes, where the tax is ring fenced and used for a good purpose. In the case of plastic bags, the tax is being used for environmental purposes. Taxes on cigarettes could be used to get people off cigarettes. That is the approach required.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with these measures. They will not change behaviour. I hope Deputy Fleming is serious and that we can revisit this issue at a later stage and change people's behaviour.</P>

      <P>With regard to cigarettes, the increase is 50 cent. There was significant support within the Government to make it higher but we could not do it because of the impact on the CPI. The 50 cent&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that as well. The impact on the CPI is 0.42%. The Government said in the programme for Government that it wishes to discuss with the social partners the removal of alcohol and particularly cigarettes from the CPI index as a basis for negotiations. The ICTU has disagreed. The consumer price index is harmonised throughout Europe and the CSO publishes the CPI increase every month. It also publishes, separately, the figure without alcohol and tobacco but most people ignore it. The impact on the CPI is the only reason the increase was not higher.</P>
      <P>The situation with alcohol is different. All Members have suggested that the increase on alcopops should have been higher. I wish we could do that but under EU law we could not increase alcopops more than the general increase that applies to spirits. The increase we are applying on this occasion, the biggest ever, will increase the price of the typical bottle of spirits by approximately &euro;4. That is substantial and will make Ireland the third highest in Europe in excise duties imposed on spirits. The CPI impact of the price increase in alcopops is small. Although they are a significant problem for young people, they do not account for a huge amount as a percentage of the spend of disposable income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other issue with imposing a larger increase on spirits is that people can bring in spirits from other EU states, given the relative prices, for <Col N="1366" /> their personal consumption. Furthermore, there would be an encouragement to smuggle. Clearly, we had to move in a reasonable way. However, it is the highest excise increase ever imposed on spirits and we could not impose a higher increase on alcopops. If we were to ban alcopops, we would have to ban lemonade, coke and other drinks so that was not an option. These issues accounted for a considerable amount of discussion and analysis at Cabinet between the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health and Children and other Ministers.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Financial Resolution No. 7 provides, with effect from midnight tonight, for a increase in mineral oil tax on auto diesel which, when VAT is included, amounts to 3 cent on a litre. In addition, the resolution provides for a similar increase for substitute auto fuels to maintain parity with the rate for auto diesel. Following these increases Irish rates for auto fuels will still be below the EU average. The expected yield from these increases is approximately &euro;52.5 million in a full year. The measure will increase the CPI by approximately 0.017%.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Financial Resolution No. 8 amends the structure of vehicle registration tax for private cars. The top rate of VRT, 30%, will apply to cars with an engine capacity exceeding 1900 cc. Until now, the rate only applied to cars with an engine capacity of 2001 cc and over. The cars affected will, therefore, move from the 25% VRT band to the 30% band.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1368" />The amended structure will come into effect from midnight on 31 December this year. The Exchequer yield from these increases is estimated at &euro;30 million in a full year. It is estimated that these measures will increase the consumer price index by about 0.05%. This change is in line with the commitment in the programme for Government and the national climate change strategy for further rebalancing of VRT to favour more environmentally friendly cars.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Resolution No. 9 provides for the continuation to 31 December 2004 of the scheme whereby 50% of the vehicle registration tax payable or paid on certain hybrid electric motor vehicles may be remitted or repaid by the Revenue Commissioners. The scheme was introduced in the Finance Act, 2001, and was due to expire on 31 December 2002. A hybrid electric vehicle derives its locomotive power from a combination of an electric motor and an internal combustion engine. It is expected that &euro;50,000 per annum will be repaid under the scheme.</P>

      <P>On the previous occasion when the Minister for Finance introduced this measure, I remember &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; asked me to test drive one of these hybrid cars. The problem is that they are so expensive.</P>
      <P>If the Minister was talking about fulfilling the Kyoto Protocol and combating climate change, he should have really grasped the nettle and introduced a carbon tax. We are only tinkering around the edges with the measures in this resolution. Liquid petroleum gas is still to be included despite the fact that it is a relatively clean fuel. There have been suggestions that the taxi fleet or the buses in Dublin city could run on LPG. The Tánaiste introduced the measures as environmentally friendly but they are window dressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government does not understand the way climate change will affect future generations. It is undoubtedly the greatest challenge humanity faces. I hear people talking about global terrorism but it is nothing compared with global warming and the devastating effects it will have this century. The Government appears oblivious to this.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with the increase in diesel of 3 cent per litre. I would like to think that the Minister for Finance does not realise the effects this will have on rural communities. I wish to speak about the fishing industry and the margin of economic survival, especially for inshore fishermen who take enormous risks to maintain a tradition of life as well as trying to keep alive the vibrancy of their communities.</P>
      <P>I estimate that this increase in diesel will add &euro;2,000 to &euro;2,500 per year to these fishermen's running costs, and that is for smaller boats. Given the amount of suffering and losses the sea takes on a yearly basis, much of which happens because fishermen cut corners because of their economic position and their determination to remain involved in fishing, this added burden will create enormous hardship and difficulties for people involved in the fishing industry. I do not know if this measure can be reversed but what I have said should be considered.</P>
      <P>The buzz words doing the rounds at present concern rural development and regeneration and trying to maintain traditional values in rural areas. The population of most rural areas is declining and the family farm has been eroded. This extra burden being placed on rural communities will affect the farming community, especially small farmers who are trying to survive, as well as contractors involved in farms and road hauliers. This increase in the price of diesel will undoubtedly create further difficulties for people trying to survive in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The knock-on effect of the increase on road hauliers will be a greater cost for transporting goods throughout the country and this will affect people dependent on the hauliers to transport their goods throughout the country. The farming <Col N="1370" /> community, especially small farmers, will suffer from this increase. There is also the additional pressure of an increase in VAT.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister takes this into account. What he has done is a terrible mistake. I disagree with most of the budget. In this instance, he has done a terrible disservice to people who are trying hard to survive in rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in transport costs brought about by the increase in the cost of diesel and the increase in VRT will have a negative impact on jobs as the year progresses. I do not know how the motor industry will greet the VRT provision but I have a good idea. It is concerned about it, because a dip in the economy generally results in a dip in the motor industry economy. The increase in VRT will have a negative effect and there will be job losses as a result.</P>
      <P>The increase in transport costs will be passed on to consumers throughout the country. This in turn will have a negative impact on the economy and inflation and will affect everyone because they will have to pay for the increase in transport costs which will automatically follow from the increase in the price of diesel.</P>
      <P>Diesel compares much more favourably with petrol on ecological and environmental grounds. Modern diesel engines have been perfected to the extent that the impact of their emissions is minimal in comparison with petrol engines. The increase in the cost of diesel will have a negative effect. It is a ready and easy means of raising revenue but the negative effect will impact on every person in the country in terms of transport and the motor industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to follow up on Deputy Durkan's remarks on the impact of a 3 cent per litre increase. He is suggesting that if this is passed on through business, it will eventually impact on inflation. It is a revenue generating measure. Deputy Durkan was asked to suggest an alternative to raise this money. I believe it is a fair and equitable measure and is not excessive in relation to the current cost of diesel. Deputy Durkan spoke of the added cost to business. The 3 cent per litre already includes VAT, which businesses do not have to pay. Anybody running a business with transportation costs knows the price of diesel will fluctuate during the year due to other factors such as the strength of the euro, which has been favourable recently, and the price of oil on the world market. I view the 3 cent per litre as a balanced figure.</P>
      <P>I listened to the comments of Deputy Ferris in relation to the fishing industry. Although I am not acquainted with that industry, I had understood that diesel for agriculture was at a preferential rate anyhow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>This represents a further cost on industry. I live in the Border area and have seen such taxation changes from time to time. At the present, those who are operating legitimate businesses selling diesel are having a more balanced time. I question whether enough is being done to control the legitimate, as opposed to the illegitimate, use of diesel. There is an enormous problem. People are getting rich very quickly through that by whatever means. If more effort was put into addressing that, this charge might not have been needed.</P>
      <P>The haulage business here is under extreme pressure. The Tánaiste is charged with responsibility for insurance. Many lorry drivers are under extraordinary pressure to maintain their businesses against competition elsewhere. The Exchequer take from this charge will come largely from that industry. It is 14 cent per gallon, a very significant amount for somebody filling a lorry to travel across Europe.</P>
      <P>My county is heavily involved in poultry, pigs and mushrooms, which all need significant road transport. We do not have a rail line and have no other means of transport. We also have poor roads. I accept that revenue needs to be raised through some means, but road transport is very important in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1372" />I have a personal interest in that I have a diesel car, but my concerns are not based on that. That will make some difference but it will be negligible compared to the hard pressed transport businesses. Many bus and haulage companies are under pressure and some have already gone out of business.</P>

      <P>This measure is for environmental and green reasons, as the Tánaiste said when she moved the motion. I support the increase to 30% in VRT for cars between 1900 cc and 2000 cc.

      <P>Deputy Gormley mentioned the energy tax and our international obligations in relation thereto. We recently saw the floods on the north side of the city and around Ringsend in the constituency of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Ireland and all countries in the world have the responsibility to do something in relation to global warming in general. I am delighted to note the determination to introduce a carbon energy tax from the end of 2004.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal to increase the excise duty on road diesel will have a significant effect on the many people who use diesel engines in their personal transport arrangements.  I concur with the point made in relation to the transport industry which is the area that will affect every one of us. It is not only the Cavan-Monaghan constituency and other constituencies of similar infrastructural neglect which are totally dependent on road deliveries for all services and goods. One will find that the 3 cent increase in diesel will have a domino effect in terms of the overall cost of all goods and services that each of us will use. There is no question that it will be absorbed by an industry that is already hard pressed to make ends meet. It will have to be passed on and, again, it will be passed on to the people who are affected by each and every negative measure inbuilt in the budget on whom it will have a damaging effect.</P>
      <P>It will further damage the Border areas, in particular, where for many years the traffic moved entirely from south to north in terms of access to petrol and diesel. In recent years the flow has been the other way around, which is very welcome and has given a fillip to the economic life and condition of Border counties. However, the proposed increase will put at risk this North-South traffic which is so important in sustaining the economy. In the town of Clones, for example, where there was not a petrol or diesel filling station for many years, these opportunities have only opened up again in recent years.</P>

      <P>It is critically important that people recognise that any increase that will upset that bias towards the retail outlets for motor fuels south of the Border will have an adverse effect in terms of the overall economic reality of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" />In relation to the vehicle registration tax, the motor industry, which gives employment to so many in this country, will be deeply disappointed that the Government has chosen to increase VRT in certain categories. This is a further penalty and disincentive and will undoubtedly have a very damaging effect on what is a fluid market. The failure of the Government lies not only in the damaging effect of what it included but also its failure to take on board the argument from the Society of the Irish Motor Industry that a full refund of VRT for re-exported cars should have been introduced. For those Members from other parts of the country who may not understand the position, in constituencies such as mine and others in the Border counties, there has been and will continue to be a significant number of purchases of vehicles north of the Border. We live within a few miles of the Border. This type of trade means the importation of cars from north of the Border on which VRT is paid here. Given the reality that our communities do not stop at the Border but encompass a hinterland that straddles it, these cars are subsequently resold to people north of the Border. Individuals and dealers, in particular, should have the right and opportunity to reclaim the VRT in order that they can compete on a level playing field with their competitors just a short number of miles away north of the Border.</P>
    <P>Not only has the Government adversely affected the motor industry by this measure but it has failed to take on board the very fair and logical arguments put forward by SIMI this year and in previous years. This amounts to a double whammy to the motor industry and the many people who depend on it for their livelihood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to respond to some of the points made. In relation to the excise rate which applies in Ireland compared to other European Union countries, it is 30 cent per litre here, 74 cent per litre in the United Kingdom and 44 cent per litre in Germany, with the European Union average some 35 cent per litre. Therefore, the rate here is well below the European Union average. Even after the 3 cent increase, diesel is still 3 cent cheaper per litre here than in Northern Ireland. As there is no change in the special rate that applies to public transport and school buses they will not be affected by the increase.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gormley suggested we should have lowered the rate of excise on LPG. The European Union applies a minimum rate for LPG. As we currently apply the minimum rate, we have no scope to reduce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister commented on the issue of carbon tax in the Budget Statement. Emissions trading will be introduced in the European Union in 2005. Many of our companies are preparing for the advent of this trading and are spending considerable resources on moving to alternative <Col N="1375" /> sources of energy. The competitiveness of Irish industry was mentioned in the previous two motions. The Opposition was united in opposing the Government for increasing stamp duty on commercial transactions. If we had unilaterally decided to go down the road of carbon taxes, vulnerable industries here would have been put at risk. For example, such taxes would add some &euro;10 million to the overall cost base of a specific company which employs several hundred people in a peripheral location here. The approach taken by the Government in today's budget is a reasonable one which will deliver the results.</P>
    <P>While there were no positives in the closure of IFI, one beneficial result, if it can be so described, was that the closure will enable us to meet some of our carbon emission targets more readily, certainly in terms of the proportion allocated to the industrial sector. IFI was a major producer of carbon emissions to the tune of something in the region of two million tonnes per annum.</P>
    <P>We should encourage people to move to smaller cars for all the reasons mentioned earlier.</P>
    <Col N="1376" />
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have recently changed to a smaller car. However, I do not know the cc of its engine. We have not increased excise on petrol for a host of reasons, mainly so many people require their cars to go to work and its potential impact on the consumer price index. As I stated earlier, the impact of the increase in the price of diesel will be 0.017%.</P>
      <P>I commend the resolutions to the House. There are environmental and competitiveness reasons for the measures and reasons related to the CPI and tax raising. Although the Opposition opposed all the tax raising measures in this budget, it has not proposed a single alternative for raising the revenue we need to run the country for the next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1) THAT the rate of value-added tax on the supply of certain goods and services at present chargeable at the rate of 12.5 per cent be increased to 13.5 per cent of the amount on which tax is chargeable in relation to the supply of such good and services, and that, accordingly, subsection (1) (inserted by the Finance Act, 1992 (No. 9 of 1992)) of section 11 of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972 (No. 22 of 1972) be amended by substituting in paragraph (d) &ldquo;13.5 per cent&rdquo; for &ldquo;12.5 per cent&rdquo; (inserted by the Finance Act, 1992).</P>
      <P>(2) THAT this Resolution shall have effect as on and from 1 January 2003.</P>
      <P>(3) IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
      <P>This resolution provides for an increase to 13.5% on the supply of all 12.5% rated goods and services with effect from 1 January 2003. This change will apply to all goods and services which are currently rated at 12.5%. The increase will raise &euro;187 million in 2003 and &euro;224.5 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>The difference is due to the way in which VAT is collected as the change in the rate will only apply in respect of five two-monthly VAT periods in 2003. There are six VAT periods of two months each in any year but VAT due for the period November-December only falls to be paid in January the following year. The increase in the 12.5% rate will add approximately 0.18% to the CPI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This increase, along with the changes in excise duties and other changes in the budget, is necessary to raise revenue for improved and more efficient public services. The need to raise revenue arises from changed economic circum<Col N="1379" /> stances, which have had an impact on Exchequer revenues generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This resolution together with the previous three resolutions will drive inflation mad. Inflation will rise above 5% next year and the implications of that for the next round of national wage negotiations are serious. It will also have a serious effect on business and industry.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael ran a campaign over the past number of weeks to bring back the first-time buyer's house grant and I am glad the Government heeded some of our suggestions. However, having done that with one hand, it has slapped a 1% increase on VAT with the other, which represents an average increase of &euro;2,000 on the price of a house. That is a kick in the teeth to many young people who planned to purchase their own homes and it is a serious blow in the context of the current crisis in housing. There are 100,000 people on local authority housing waiting lists and many of them depend on the private rented sector for accommodation. They cannot afford a house and are funding the mortgage repayments of investors.</P>
      <P>This is an appalling scenario and I cannot see how Fianna Fáil backbenchers who were so vocal on local radio throughout the country and who were so strong in their criticism of the abolition of the first-time house buyer's grant can agree to this proposal, which will slap &euro;2,000 on the average price of a house.</P>
      <P>It is make your mind up time for Government backbenchers before the public see through their double talk. They cannot be the tough defenders of the public in their constituencies and tamely walk through the division lobby in support of a proposal such as this. The proposal is a kick in the teeth for young people and will drive inflation even higher.</P>

The repayments on that will be financed by the tax relief which is being given. That will make the house buyer better off and more capable of buying a house than if he was getting the once-off first-time house buyer's grant.</P>
      <P>While no one likes raising VAT it is necessary to raise revenue in order to improve infrastructure, create a more efficient and effective economy, make possible improvements in social welfare and help to have a fairer and more equitable society. I support this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not want to impinge on the time of my colleague and friend, Deputy Ardagh, but it is unusual to debate the financial resolutions back and forth across the House as though they were a Bill. Normally, the Minister presents his case and the Opposition argues against it. I do not want to deny Deputy Ardagh the right to speak but it would have been better if he had not ventured into this argument. He has done quite well in the filibuster throughout the evening but of all the speeches I have heard in a long time Deputy Ardagh's makes no sense at all, and he knows that himself.</P>
      <P>He says this measure is being brought in to assist the Exchequer. It is being brought in to assist the Government. It is the Government that is in trouble. When people get an opportunity to look at this budget they will recognise that by a series of stealth taxes and indirect taxes the Government is clawing back from low and middle income earners whatever little advantage they got during five years of being treated as second class citizens to the super-earners in the period of economic boom.</P>
      <P>It is an established principle that indirect taxes impact disproportionately on people with the lowest incomes. The greater part of the disposable incomes of people on low incomes goes on the goods and services which have a VAT rating of 12.5%. Heating is an essential item. An increase of 13.5% is proposed on ESB charges. Another 1% has been added to that by the Minister. How will that impact on a person on a very low income? Other forms of heating such as coal, peat and other solid substances that are sold solely as fuel are similarly VAT rated.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ardagh knows that the VAT increase will impact on the most vulnerable people. The Minister did not have the courage to address the taxation situation. He hoped he would get away with that by stealth and indirect taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of this budget people are already going to pay more tax because they will pay <Col N="1382" /> income tax at the marginal rate sooner than before. The Minister did not index taxation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen raised the question of housing. If the building materials for a house cost &euro;100,000, an increase of 1% amounts to &euro;1,000. Government backbenchers applauded earlier when the Minister announced an increase of &euro;350 in mortgage interest relief to a married couple. Here at one stroke he adds &euro;1,000 to the cost of building a house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>To facilitate as many people on the other side of the House who wish to participate in this debate, I will be brief. One of the first contributions referred to the adverse effect of increasing the rate of VAT in respect of housing from 12.5% to 13.5%. I am not sure I believe it at all, funnily enough, because house prices in the area of Dublin where I live are determined by the old formula of supply and demand. At the moment, whether one likes it or not, the supply is not equal to the demand, certainly around the greater Dublin area. The function of developers building houses is to maximise their profit and I do not see an increase or a decrease based on the 1% change in VAT.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that long before my entry to the House, the rate of VAT was dropped from 21% to 20%. We did not see a significant change in prices in the shops when that drop took place. The increase is a revenue exercise for the Government because the funding is badly needed for a range of services. If we do not use mechanisms like increasing the rate of VAT or other fund-raising measures we will be left with the issue of borrowing. We have paid that price before, so we are increasing the rate of VAT by 1% to pay for a range of social welfare necessities, such as child benefit. I do not accept the argument made by the Opposition that it will increase house prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We could accuse the Government of a total lack of equity in the past five years or of being incompetent in terms of how it spent our money on infrastructure, but its greatest sin was counter-cyclical from an economist's point of view. It took an economy that was booming and pumped it further, thus causing <Col N="1385" /> inflation. This tax change will further increase that inflation. We will become uncompetitive and our levels are already way above those that obtain in our competitor nations in Europe in terms of labour and other costs, particularly in Dublin.</P>
      <P>We will see massive unemployment if we do not get inflation under control and this Government, being the champion of politically correct, orthodox economic thinking, is further pumping inflation with this measure. This must be borne in mind in light of the other costs that are now coming through, such as increasing electricity and transport prices. The Government's greatest sin will be the creation of unemployment because of the inflation it created. There is no answer to that. Our rate is twice the European average and will be three times that rate, and what will we do then?</P>
      <P>Not only is a VAT increase inequitable in that it strikes the poorest more, but this particular VAT increase &ndash; I would have to do some research to back this up &ndash; tends to apply to the areas with the highest level of labour input. In effect, it is a tax on Irish labour and resources and it will fuel inflation. That is what the Government has done wrong and what it does not realise today with its bluster and filibuster.</P>

      <P>What is the increase in the refund on VAT to non-registered farmers? It is always the case that if VAT is increased, the increase is matched. I want an exact figure in that regard.</P>
      <P>Anyone who says the VAT increase of 1% will not bring itself to bear on a house to the value of &euro;200,000 is obviously in cloud-cuckoo-land. It will affect tourism and housing and it will affect the aged and the sick who need electricity and telephones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is where the mask slips. There are fundamental economic principles that the Minister or anybody else cannot deny. Indirect taxes fall disproportionately on the poor. There is not a single text in economics that disproves that. The &euro;224.5 million will be gathered disproportionately by those who work and are on lower incomes. The test of this is to take out the list of commodities governed by the 12.5% regime at present. One will see they that they include, at the most vulnerable end, heating fuels. One does not need to be a rocket scientist to know the fuel allowance is not increasing, yet the VAT increase will be on the fuel one needs for heating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then one looks at the average activity of the average worker, prepared and cooked food, and recreation, the cinema for example. The film industry is destroyed completely. The relief on <Col N="1386" /> film is now gone. Going to the cinema will be affected by the VAT increase. One will find that every activity in the ordinary day of the average worker, in terms of food, sustenance and work, will be affected. When one retires and becomes a pensioner, one's right to heat will be affected. It is regressive and disgraceful. It is a robbery of &euro;224.5 million and it is a scandal that there are so many exemptions. Let the public see who got exemptions in this budget&mdash;</P>

      <P>The extremes in this budget cry out and there will be a public outcry in response. On the one hand corporation tax has been reduced from 16% to 12.5% yet a range of measures have been introduced that will severely impact on the daily lives of ordinary people. This measure is one of the most severe but there is no realisation on the part of Government of its real effect.</P>
      <P>A range of services will be affected. Many of them have been outlined already and I will not repeat them, but we must not be in any doubt that the lowest paid workers in our society will be victims of this decision because they are the people providing the services in many of the outlets that have been referred to. Many of these people depend on gratuities to supplement their already meagre incomes but those who will avail of the various restaurant and other opportunities will be less inclined to be generous in the future when they are faced with such a punitive additional VAT demand on the services of which they have availed.</P>
      <P>This is a most regressive measure and one which this Government has not properly evaluated. It will have a negative effect across the board and it is one of the most outrageous elements in the overall construction of this disgraceful budget.</P>

The industry sought a decrease in VAT to 10%. All of our main competitors &ndash; France, Portugal, Italy and Spain &ndash; have an average VAT rate of 5% on hotel accommodation, food and so on. We <Col N="1387" /> now have a VAT rate of 13.5%. That is a negative statement on our competitiveness in regard to tourism. This increase, coupled with the increase in insurance, which is up 200% in some cases, and an increase of 14% in electricity charges, with an additional 8% next year, will mean that our tourism industry will not be competitive at a time when we are trying to increase our competitiveness.</P>

      <Quest>if she will remove the anomaly in the social welfare system whereby a widow receiving a widow's pension and blind person's pension will lose the blind person's pension on reaching the age of 66 thus reducing income by 50%, in view of the fact that the small number of people involved justifies such action.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The social welfare income maintenance system is a contingency based system. To qualify for payment, a person must experience one of a range of defined contingencies, such as sickness, unemployment, old age, widowhood, etc.</P>
      <P>However, it can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time. For instance, an unemployed person may also be sick. Accordingly, there is a general rule whereby a person who is entitled to more than one income maintenance payment at any one time, can only receive one of those payments.</P>
      <P>However, there are exceptions to this rule. A person in receipt of a blind person's pension may receive disability benefit, unemployment benefit, health and safety benefit, widow or widower's pension, or one-parent family payment in addition to the main payment. In total just over 400 persons in receipt of blind person's pension are receiving an additional payment. Once a person reaches 66 years of age only one payment may be made.</P>
      <P>The issues surrounding the making of other payments in addition to the blind person's pension are being considered in the context of a review of disability payments generally which will be completed early in 2003. Changes to the current arrangements will be considered in the light of the conclusions of that review.</P>

      <P>The Child Care 2000 Campaign made a submission to the Government in April 2000 which contained a number of proposals on child care. Among these, was a proposal for a parent's childcare payment &ndash; PCP &ndash; which would be paid to parents in respect of all children. The payment would be taxable and would be paid at a rate of &euro;25.40 for children under five and &euro;12.70 for children aged six to 14 years.</P>
      <P>The Government's core objective is to provide support which will offer real choice to parents and will benefit all children. Child benefit has been identified as the key vehicle to achieve these aims and the Government is committed to substantially increase the level of resources made available for child benefit.</P>
      <P>Since 2000, child benefit rates have risen by &euro;63.64 per month for each of the first two children and &euro;76.19 per month for the third child and subsequent children. Government spending on the scheme has risen to some &euro;1.556 billion and is expected to reach &euro;1.9 billion when the current programme of multi-annual increases is complete. The Minister for Finance will shortly announce details of the child benefit package for next year as part of his financial statement. The Government believes investment in the child benefit scheme is still the correct approach and represents the most effective use of the resources available.</P>

      <P>As the House will be aware, on 7 October I announced that the Christmas bonus for 2002 will again be paid at a rate equivalent to 100% of the person's normal weekly payment, but with an increased minimum payment of &euro;30.</P>
      <P>The cost of this measure is estimated to be &euro;103.3 million. Payment of the bonus will be made this week and it is estimated that it will benefit some 1.1 million persons comprising some 740,000 recipients and an estimated 400,000 dependants.</P>
      <P>The bonus will be paid, as in previous years, to recipients of all long-term social welfare payments, including retirement and old age pensions, widow's and widower's pensions, one-parent family payment, carer's allowance, invalidity pension, disability allowance, long-term unemployment assistance, farm assist and employment support payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" />Recipients of short-term payments do not qualify for the Christmas bonus. This includes persons in receipt of short-term unemployment payments and disability benefit, maternity benefit, carer's benefit, family income supplement and supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>The focus of the Christmas bonus has always been on long-term welfare payment recipients, who rely on the social welfare system for financial support over the long-term. There are no plans to extend entitlement to the bonus payment to the short-term schemes and any such extension could only be considered in a budgetary context having regard to the resources available and the significant cost which would be involved.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the reason for the 18% reduction in funding for the family income supplement as revealed in the Book of Estimates; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Family income supplement &ndash; FIS &ndash; is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families and thereby preserve the incentive to remain in employment.</P>
      <P>The 2003 Abridged, or pre-budget, Estimate for FIS is &euro;42.8 million. This sum provides for an average of 12,000 recipients at current weekly income thresholds. These thresholds were increased by &euro;34 from January this year as part of the current year's budget package.</P>
      <P>The reduction of 18% in the 2003 FIS Estimate reflects the fact that the number of recipients in 2002 is lower than had been expected. The 2002 Estimate, to which the 2003 Estimate is compared in the Abridged Estimates volume, provided for an increase of 3,900 recipients in the year.</P>
      <P>Despite the increase in income thresholds this year, the extra number of recipients failed to materialise. The number of families in receipt of FIS stood at 11,796 at the end of November 2002. This is very similar to the number at this time last year.</P>
      <P>As I stated recently in the House, in response to another parliamentary question, it is very difficult to estimate take-up of FIS. The improvements made to the scheme over the years, together with measures taken to increase awareness of it, resulted in a steady increase in the level of take-up during the 1990s &ndash; peaking at 14,686 families at the end of 1999. Since then, although income limits have been increased annually, the numbers in receipt of FIS have declined, reflecting the fact that fewer people now require the supplement. This should be viewed as a positive trend which highlights the success of a range of Government measures which have improved net take-home pay for the low paid.</P>

      <Quest>the likely impact that spend ing cutbacks in her Department, as outlined in the Book of Estimates, will have on social welfare recipients; the projections in spending for her Department for 2003 in full; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Details of planned expenditure by my Department for 2003 are included in the Abridged Estimates Volume which was published recently. These do not include additional social welfare spending to be announced by my colleague the Minister for Finance today.</P>
      <P>As provided in the Estimates, social welfare spending will rise by 3.5% on a pre-budget basis in 2003 compared with the 2002 Estimates to a total of &euro;9.7 billion.</P>
      <P>The Estimates volume shows significant increases in spending on a number of social welfare schemes before any budget changes are provided for, for example, spending on child benefit which will rise by &euro;100 million, spending on old age contributory and retirement pensions which will rise by &euro;52 million, widow's and widower's contributory pensions expenditure which will rise by &euro;12 million, and supplementary welfare allowance spending which will rise by &euro;77 million.</P>
      <P>Expenditure in some areas is projected to decline by reason of an underlying reduction in the number of claimants and decline in demand for the schemes in question. The only other change in this area is that unemployed people participating in the back to education scheme will be required to seek employment during the summer holiday period from 2003 and will not have automatic entitlement to the allowance over the summer months.</P>
      <P>Due to the continued decline in demand for the back to work allowance scheme and in the light of the recommendations of a review of labour market programmes by independent consultants, the qualification conditions for the scheme are being re-focused on the most disadvantaged groups. This will mean that from January 2003, the scheme will be open to those who are very long-term unemployed, that is, on the live register for five years or more. Those in receipt of DB for three years or more may also be eligible, as will those in receipt of one of the following for one year or more: disability allowance, invalidity pension, one parent family payment, carer's allowance, blind person's pension, ex-prisoners, PRETA and unemployability supplement.</P>
      <P>The PRSI exemption scheme is being similarly re-focused to target these disadvantaged groups. Current participants on these schemes will not be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other changes I am introducing concern eligibility for rent supplements under supplementary welfare allowance scheme. First, I have decided to maintain, at their current levels, the maximum rent levels set by the health boards. The current maximum rent levels will remain in place until the end of December 2003. Regulations giving effect to this were introduced last <Col N="1397" /> month. I decided to do this because rent levels have been stable for some time and accordingly there is no need for health boards to set higher levels of maximum rents for the purposes of the SWA rent supplement scheme.</P>
    <P>Second, I have decided to increase the minimum contribution that each person is required to pay towards their accommodation costs. The minimum contribution is currently &euro;7.62 per week and has not been increased since 1994. When the minimum contribution was set at &euro;7.62 or £6.00 per week in 1994, it represented 10.2% of the personal rate of SWA. As I announced recently, I intend to restore the minimum contribution to approximately 10% of the minimum personal social welfare rate. Regulations giving effect to this change will be introduced shortly.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which her Department calculates the interest earned on savings for assessment purposes; when this formula will be adjusted to reflect the current market returns; and her views on whether it is reasonable that people are being assessed as earning 10% interest, when they cannot get 3.5% actual interest return.</Quest>

      <P>In assessing means for social assistance purposes account is taken of any cash income the person may have, together with the value of capital and property. For the purposes of assessing the value of capital and property a notional assessment method is used. The use of the notional method avoids the necessity of frequent reviews of the entitlements of a very significant number of recipients whenever interest rates fluctuate or whenever the capital is moved from one investment option into another.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 2000, provided for the introduction of a new assessment method for capital and property which came into effect in October of that year. This new method applies to all social assistance schemes &ndash; other than supplementary welfare allowance. Under these arrangements the first £10,000 or &euro;12,697.38 of capital is disregarded and the assessment is on a sliding scale for amounts above this. At present a single pensioner with capital of up to &euro;20,315.80 qualifies for a full pension while a single pensioner with capital of up to &euro;63,486.89 qualifies for a minimum pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effective rate of assessment of capital depends on the level of capital: for example, when account is taken of the amounts disregarded, it is less than 3% for a pensioner couple with savings up to &euro;25,000, and less than 4% for a pensioner couple with savings up to &euro;63,000. The new system continued and enhanced the policy of ensuring that those with modest amounts of capital receive the greater share of available support, while the small proportion of people <Col N="1398" /> with large amounts of capital should avail of it to contribute, at least partially, towards meeting their needs.</P>
    <P>Any changes to the current method of assessment of capital and property would have significant financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to introduce a number of legislative initiatives in 2003, and have prioritised three Bills for progression in the next Dáil session.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill, 2003, will provide for implementation of social welfare changes to be announced in this week's budget other than increases in weekly rates of payments and PRSI changes. The latter will be included in the Social Welfare Bill, 2002, which will be presented to the House shortly.</P>
      <P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service Bill was presented to the House in March 2002. It will provide the legislative framework for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service &ndash; MABS &ndash; established under the auspices of my Department in response to problems of moneylending and over-indebtedness. The purpose of the Bill is to provide for a statutory basis for the service.</P>
      <P>My Department has been directly involved in activities to tackle the problems of moneylending and over-indebtedness since the publication in 1988 of the Combat Poverty Agency's report, &ldquo;Moneylending and Low Income Families&rdquo;. One of the key responses to this research was the establishment of a number of local projects to provide advice on money management and budgeting to families and persons who were experiencing difficulty.</P>
      <P>Currently, this Money Advice and Budgeting Service &ndash; MABS &ndash; includes 52 projects around the country each of which address the problems of moneylending and over-indebtedness through the provision of personalised and confidential advice. Projects can also avail of an arrangement with the local credit union to provide alternative sources of finance for their clients where they consider it is warranted. The MABS budget has grown from £260,000 &ndash; six projects &ndash; in 1992 to &euro;8.7 million &ndash; 52 projects &ndash; in 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Civil Registration Bill, which is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, will provide a new legal framework for the registration of births, marriages and deaths. It will update the existing legislation, some of which <Col N="1399" /> dates back to the mid-19th century. The passing of this legislation is one element of the civil registration modernisation programme which is a joint project between my Department and the Department of Health and Children. The modernisation project also involves the development of a new organisation structure and business processes for the service and the introduction of modern technology.</P>

      <P>My Department is committed to delivering a quality, comprehensive and up to date information service to all customers. It is the policy to make people aware of all their entitlements under the social welfare system when they make an application for any social welfare payment.</P>
      <P>The information services unit in my Department produces a comprehensive range of information leaflets and booklets covering each social welfare payment and these are widely available across the country from the Department's local offices, post offices, citizens information centres and from many other local organisations.</P>
      <P>There is a national network of information officers based in the Department's local offices who are trained to give information on all social welfare schemes and services and to advise people on all their entitlements. Support is also provided through Comhairle, to a network of 85 citizens information centres whose role is to provide information to the public on all social services.</P>
      <P>Application forms for various benefits and pensions indicate any secondary benefits that are available with the particular scheme or pension. We have produced this year a new household benefits package booklet which gives a very comprehensive account of the free schemes.</P>
      <P>My Department ensures that citizens are made aware of new schemes and services by advertising these initiatives in all national and provincial newspapers. All changes and improvements in schemes are advertised as they occur. The Department's services are publicised on Aertel, RTE's teletext information system and on the Department's website at www.welfare.ie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has been pro-active in recent months in providing information to customers. To mark the United Nations Day of Ageing in October this year Comhairle's Publication &ldquo;Entitlements for the Over Sixties&rdquo; was issued to more than 330,000 pensioners. This booklet pro<Col N="1400" /> vides information and advice on a broad range of social services and explains clearly and simply the various cash payments and other services available to people over 60. We have recently published a new edition of the Guide to Social Welfare Services &ndash; SW4 &ndash; and have distributed copies of this guide to information providers around the country including voluntary and community groups.</P>
    <P>Under the grants scheme for the development and promotion of information and welfare rights the Department contributes towards the annual funding of a number of nationally based organisations and provides once-off funding to non-statutory information providers towards the cost of specific information giving projects.</P>

      <P>The range of employment support services administered by my Department has been under review in the light of the major economic and labour market changes which have occurred in recent years. The transformation in labour market conditions is illustrated by the drop in unemployment levels since the introduction of the back to work allowance in 1993. When the allowance was introduced the overall unemployment level was 15.7% and long-term unemployment stood at 8.9%. By 2001 overall unemployment had fallen to 3.7% and long-term unemployment was down to 1.2%.</P>
      <P>An independent evaluation of the scheme, conducted by Indecon International consultants, found that high levels of dead weight &ndash; over 50% &ndash; are attached to the scheme. It recommended that participation levels be reduced and the scheme re-focused on the very long-term unemployed.</P>
      <P>It is important that my Department's employment support services retain their relevance to current labour market conditions and retain their focus on the more vulnerable groups in our community. It has been decided therefore to restructure these services and in going forward the scheme will now target those in most need in accessing the labour market and provision has been made to allow for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the continued decline in demand for the back to work allowance scheme and in the light of the recommendations of a review of labour market programmes by independent consultants, the qualification conditions for the scheme are being re-focused on the most disadvantaged <Col N="1401" /> groups. This will mean that from January 2003, the scheme will be open to those who are very long-term unemployed, that is, on the live register for five years or more. Those in receipt of DB for three years or more may also be eligible, as will those in receipt of one of the following for one year or more: disability allowance, invalidity pension, one parent family payment, carer's allowance, blind person's pension, ex-prisoners, PRETA and unemployability supplement. The PRSI exemption scheme is being similarly re-focused to target these disadvantaged groups. Current participants on these schemes will not be affected.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="WA" LHead="Written Answers." RHead="- Summary Note">
    <Title>Written Answers. - Summary Note</Title>
    <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs employment support services consist mainly of three schemes: the back to work allowance scheme, the back to work enterprise allowance scheme and the back to education allowance scheme.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The back to work allowance scheme was established in September 1993. The objective of the scheme is to encourage long-term unemployed, lone parents and people with a disability to return to the active labour force in either paid employment or self-employment.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Participants in the scheme receive 75% of their weekly social welfare payment for the first year, 50% for the second year and 25% for the third year. Subject to some income limits, participants also continue to receive all secondary benefits while working under the scheme. There are currently 11,692 participating in the employee strand of the scheme.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The back to work enterprise allowance scheme was introduced as the area allowance in 1992 in partnership areas to encourage long-term unemployed people to become self-employed. Participants in this strand of the scheme retain 100% of their social welfare payment for the first year, 75% for the second year, 50% for the third year and 25% for the fourth year. From 1 January 1998, the area allowance was extended nation-wide and re-named the back to work enterprise allowance scheme. At present there are 13,530 participants.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The back to education allowance is a separate stand-alone scheme established in January 1998 &ndash; replacing the third level allowance &ndash; and comprises two strands, the second level option and the third level option. Participants receive a weekly payment equivalent to the maximum standard rate of their social welfare payment for the full duration of the course of study, together with an annual cost of education allowance of &euro;254.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The allowance is payable for the full duration of the course of study, including holiday periods. It is not a means-tested scheme and, consequently, participants may work without affecting their payments. Similarly, any payments under the higher education grants scheme or in respect of ESF funded courses do not affect their weekly <Col N="1402" /> allowance. The numbers participating in the scheme have grown since the scheme was first introduced in September 1990, from 67 to 5,300 in the 2001-02 academic year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>From 1 October of this year, I have begun the phased implementation of individualisation of payments on an administrative basis, starting with claims to old age &ndash; contributory &ndash; and retirement pension. The arrangements now in place are in keeping with the recommendations in the report of the Working Group on Administrative Individualisation of Social Welfare Payments published in August.</P>
      <P>The working group was established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to produce proposals to progress the implementation of administrative individualisation of social welfare payments, that is, the provision of a direct payment to persons who are currently supported as qualified adults on their spouses' social welfare payment. The group, chaired by my Department, comprised representatives of the social partners and relevant Departments.</P>
      <P>Under the arrangements introduced, the qualified adult allowance rate of pension may be paid directly to a spouse with the personal rate of pension being paid to the main beneficiary. The splitting of payments is on a consensual basis and both the applicant and their spouse are required to indicate their consent in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both spouses are advised of the position and invited to avail of the split payment arrangements. Since implementing the change in October <Col N="1403" /> 2002 a total of 110 claimants &ndash; 8.5% &ndash; and their spouses, out of a potential total of some 1,300 cases received, have indicated their preference to have the qualified adult allowance paid directly to the spouse.</P>
    <P>The existing changes are confined to new applicants to old age and retirement pensions. The extension of these arrangements to other categories is under active consideration and further progress will be made when the necessary administrative and other arrangements have been addressed.</P>
    <P>Administrative individualisation does not involve any changes in the rules and conditions for entitlement, but rather comprises arrangements whereby payments, which include increases in respect of a qualified adult, are split between the parties involved. My Department has always provided for payments to be split in certain circumstances, for example, in cases of domestic difficulty where a spouse might otherwise have no other form of income. Administrative individualisation implies a more general application of this approach.</P>
    <P>Administrative individualisation can be seen as an interim measure pending consideration of the more fundamental issue of full individualisation. Separately, there has been a trend towards a greater level of individualisation in the system through the extension of the scope of the social insurance system, thus enabling more people to accumulate their own individual insurance-based entitlements.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89, 104, 107, 108 and 350 together.</P>
      <P>The most recent estimate of the number of full-time carers is available from the results of the Census Pilot Survey carried out by the Central Statistics Office. This survey was carried out in September 1999 and is based on a sample of 8,000 households in which persons aged 15 years or over were asked if they provided unpaid personal help for someone with a long-term illness, health problem or disability, including problems due to old age. The detailed results are as follows: 35,000 people provide more than 50 hours unpaid personal help per week, or seven hours per day; 17,000 people provide 20-49 hours unpaid personal help per week, or between three and seven hours per day; and 79,000 people provide 1-19 hours unpaid personal help per week, or between nine minutes and 2.5 hours per day. These results are consistent with the conclusions of the review of the carer's allowance and it also explains the estimate of 120,000 carers used by the carer organisations.</P>
      <P>There are currently more than 20,400 carers in receipt of carer's allowance which means that almost 40% of the 52,000 carers, as estimated by the CSO to be caring for more than three hours per day, are in receipt of carer's allowance. This is an increase of more than 19,000 in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since the end of 1990, the first year of the scheme's operation. Expenditure has also increased from &euro;0.13 million at the end of 1990 to &euro;130.3 million at the end of 2001. I will make a table available to the Deputy giving the specific statistical information that he sought.</P>
      <P>With regard to paying carer's allowance concurrently with another social welfare payment, the primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual. This ensures that resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual. The carer's allowance is an income support payment and not a payment for caring. A person qualifying for two social welfare payments will always receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to evaluating the needs of carers, the review of the carer's allowance was completed by an interdepartmental committee, <Col N="1405" /> chaired by my Department and published in October 1998. The submissions and proposals of all organisations representing carers were considered as part of the review process and are comprehensively addressed in the report. Arising from proposals in the review, a range of measures has been introduced over recent budgets to improve and develop the position of carers.</P>
    <P>As part of the process of developing the Health Strategy, which was published at the end of last year, my colleague, Deputy Micheál Martin, the Minister for Health and Children, commissioned a survey of the general public to obtain their views of health services and the health system. The strategy proposes to reform existing arrangements, including the carer's allowance, in order to introduce an integrated care subvention scheme which maximises support for home care. The Department of Health and Children has begun to work with my Department to develop proposals in this area. In addition, the strategy proposes that a co-ordinated action plan to meet the needs of ageing and older people be developed by the Department of Health and Children in conjunction with my Department, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>In addition to consultation on the opinions and needs of carers which has taken place at this level, I have met various organisations representing carers on a number of occasions and I am aware of their views, concerns and priorities in relation to carers.</P>
    <P>Although the carer's allowance is not a payment for caring, carers of more than one incapacitated person are currently entitled to an additional 50% of their rate of payment. This is an acknowledgement of the difficulties, both financial and personal, faced by these carers.</P>
    <P>Further improvements to the scheme such as introducing carer's allowance on a &ldquo;per person cared for&rdquo; basis could only be considered in a budgetary context in the light of available resources. However, the development of the range of supports for carers will continue to be a priority for this Government and, building on the foundations now in place, we will continue to develop the types of services which recognise the value of the caring ethos and which provide real support and practical assistance to people who devote their time to improving the quality of life for others.</P>

      <P>The illustrative benchmark options examined in the report included 30% of gross average industrial earnings and 50% of average weekly household income. The group did not reach consensus about which of these would be the better option as there were advantages and disadvantages associated with each option. For example, while gross earnings provide a fairly stable measure in relation to other indicators, it is not fully indicative of wage trends throughout the economy.</P>
      <P>In addition, the report acknowledges that there is a significant time lag with regard to the production of figures for average household income even though it may reflect more accurately the prevailing standard of living. In the final analysis, it did not prove possible for the group to achieve a consensus on the desirability of establishing a formal benchmark.</P>
      <P>The report has, however, provided a valuable resource for the assessment of the implications of adopting particular approaches to the uprating of social welfare payments and was carefully considered by Government as part of the review of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy. Recognising that the exact rate was a matter for Government, the strategy set a target of &euro;150 per week &ndash; in 2002 terms &ndash; for the lowest social welfare payments to be met by 2007.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 116 together.</P>
      <P>The current dispute relates only to the provision of dental benefit and there has not been any change in the availability of ophthalmic services under my Department's treatment benefit scheme. The dispute with the Irish Dental Association commenced in March and has continued, with a short suspension of the association's action in October. Efforts have continued over that period to try to resolve the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1407" />In the absence of a resolution to the dispute, my Department has ceased to accept claims from dentists who were not prepared to adhere to their contractual arrangements under the scheme. However, the scheme continues to operate and patients continue to be treated by dentists who were prepared to adhere to their contracts.</P>
    <P>The dispute relates to the imposition of unlimited fees on patients in breach of the contractual arrangements under which treatment is provided under the scheme. My concern, throughout this dispute, is to ensure protection for insured workers seeking basic dental treatment under the scheme. Efforts to resolve the dispute are continuing, but so far it has not been possible to reach agreement on a mechanism which would afford the necessary level of protection for these workers.</P>
    <P>It will not be possible to assess the impact of the dispute on expenditure under the scheme until a settlement is reached and the impact on claims experience has been evaluated. At this stage, expenditure on the scheme in 2002 is budgeted at &euro;35 million, that is, the same level as applied in 2001.</P>

      <P>The administration of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance is mainly carried out by staff of my Department in 57 local offices throughout the country. There were 1,195 staff allocated to my Department's local offices at the beginning of the year and this has increased to 1,206 at the end of November. The staffing level is reviewed formally on a regular basis and adjusted to reflect demands arising from changes in the claim load and other factors. In addition, there are 68 branch offices which are operated on a contract basis by branch managers. Under the terms of their contract, branch managers are required to provide adequate staff resources to deal with the workload in their office and this is monitored on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>There are 392 social welfare inspectors, part of whose work is to investigate and report on claims to unemployment benefit and assistance. There are also eight staff serving in the central headquarters support area for local and branch offices.</P>
      <P>There were 157,706 persons on the live register at the end of October and this compared with a figure of 141,835 at the same time last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Processing times for unemployment claims and other customer service issues are kept under con<Col N="1408" /> stant review. The day to day work in the local offices is monitored by the managers who deploy the staff resources in order to meet claim decision and payment priorities. The staffing requirements for the unemployment schemes will be kept under review in the context of the changing number of claimants and having regard to resource requirements of other areas of the Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>Rent supplements paid under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme have always been subject to a cap as there has always been a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur. Maximum rent limits are set by each health board for various household types as a basis for calculating the amount of rent supplement payable in individual cases.</P>
      <P>The health boards reviewed these limits regularly, usually once a year, and increased the limits as required in response to conditions in the housing market in their functional areas. During 2002, this resulted in increases in the maximum rent limits ranging from 5% to 28%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Data provided by the Central Statistics Office show that rent levels have been stable for some time. In fact, rents have been falling since last April and are now lower than they were one year ago. Given this background, there is no justification for landlords to increase the levels of rents they charge. Accordingly, there is no need for health boards to set higher levels of maximum <Col N="1409" /> rents for the purposes of the SWA rent supplement scheme.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I have decided to maintain the maximum rent levels set by the health boards at their current levels until the end of December 2003. I do not accept that this will have a harsh impact on social welfare recipients in the private rented sector. On the contrary, setting higher maximum rent limits than are justified by the open market would distort the rental market, leading to a general rise in rent levels that would disadvantage people on low incomes.</P>

      <Quest>the changes which would be required in her Department to make the transition to the guaranteed basic income method of income redistribution as outlined in the Government Green Paper on GBI.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recently published Green Paper on basic income sets out the main features of a possible basic income system, the advantages and disadvantages of the approach, an indication of the size of the tax rate that would be required to fund the system and sets out a number of key issues which would need to be considered were such a system to be seriously considered. The purpose of the Green Paper is to bring the issues to the attention of the wider community and to encourage debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Green Paper did not specifically set out to identify the administrative measures required to implement a basic income system. Neither did the independent research carried out under the Partnership 2000 agreement, on which the Green Paper draws, seek to identify the specific administrative implications of such a system. The steering group which oversaw this research emphasised that the P2000 commitment did not refer to a <Col N="1410" /> specific detailed model of basic income for implementation, but rather the implications of a basic income approach.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, it is clear that a basic income system would have major implications for a number of Government bodies and in particular the Revenue Commissioners and my Department. Were it to be considered as a viable option these implications would have to be the subject of detailed investigation and analysis covering the following implications of the scheme: the abolition of current payment systems which are based on social contingencies such as old age and unemployment; the abolition of the system of social insurance records and their replacement with an age-specific population register on which payments would be based; the establishment of a universal payment for all members of the population differentiated by age; the introduction of a social solidarity fund to respond to cases where the basic income as proposed would unacceptably reduce disposable incomes &ndash; essentially, this would mean the introduction or reintroduction of a number of targeted means tested schemes with associated administrative consequences; and if it were decided to make the basic income payment in the form of a tax credit for people at work, and a direct payment to the rest of the population, complex administrative measures would have to be put in place to ensure smooth transition as people moved from employment to unemployment, and to avoid any duplicate payments. Such an analysis would require considerable commitment of resources and given current priorities, it would be premature at this stage to undertake it.</P>

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of a standard rate old age contributory pension is that a person must have commenced paying social insurance contributions in Ireland <Col N="1412" /> before reaching age 56. They must also pay a minimum number of full rate contributions at the appropriate rate, and achieve a minimum yearly average of at least ten contributions paid or credited at the appropriate rate over their working lives.</P>
      <P>In addition to standard rate pensions a number of pro-rata pensions are also available to cater for people with full and modified rate social insurance or insurance from other countries. Since Ireland's accession to the EU in 1973, entry into insurance under the legislation of other member states satisfies the requirement to have entered insurance before aged 56 for an EU pro-rata pension. Appropriate insurance from other member states can also be combined with full rate Irish contributions to qualify for a pension. These arrangements comply with the relevant EU legislation &ndash; Regulations (EEC) 1408/71. Similar arrangements apply to social insurance contributions made in countries with whom Ireland has bilateral social security agreements.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the current arrangements in relation to the use of social insurance from other countries for pensions purposes are adequate and no changes are being considered at this stage.</P>

      <P>In this regard, the Garda Síochána are involved in a new partnership involving local communities known as the community policing forum which is being piloted in one area in Dublin. Among the objectives of the forum are to create dialogue between the gardaí and the local community, to seek the views and opinions of the local community with respect to their concerns on crime and policing and to provide solutions to concerns raised, within an agreed timeframe, through dialogue and action. An independent evaluation of the forum is being conducted and, following this, consideration will be given to replicating this model in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1413" />The authors of the report also suggest that income improvements are critical for the households surveyed in the study. In this regard, the Government is committed to achieve a rate of &euro;150 per week in 2002 terms for the lowest rates of social welfare by 2007. In addition, we have committed ourselves to reduce the numbers of those who are consistently poor below 2% and, if possible, eliminate consistent poverty.</P>
    <P>Also, objectives in relation to building social capital, reducing the harm caused to individuals and the community by the use of illicit drugs, and various other targets under the national anti-poverty strategy are designed to improve the living standards of people, particularly in disadvantaged areas, and to improve social cohesion in these communities.</P>
    <P>The revised strategy has the potential to significantly reduce poverty and assist in combating the type of exclusion and marginalisation felt by the people in the study.</P>

      <P>Since late 1998, all memoranda for Government and key policy initiatives, upon which significant policy decisions have to be made, are required to be poverty proofed. Poverty proofing is defined as &ldquo;the process by which Government Departments, local authorities and State agencies assess policies and programmes at design and review stages in relation to the likely impact that they will have or have had on poverty and on inequalities which are likely to lead to poverty, with a view to poverty reduction&rdquo;. The primary aim of the process is to identify the impact of the policy proposal on the poor so that this can be given proper consideration in designing the policy. Each Department, including by own, is obliged under Government procedures to poverty proof its own policy proposals. I can assure the Deputy that my Department's budget package will be poverty proofed as usual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national office for social inclusion, which is being established under the revised national anti-poverty strategy, will be resourced to develop a more effective poverty proofing process and to ensure that it is appropriately operationalised in all relevant Departments. The development of the process, which will include the production of new guidelines &ndash; will take account of the findings and recommendations contained in the review of the poverty proofing process published by the National Economic and Social Council. In line with increasing the effectiveness of proofing <Col N="1415" /> procedures generally, it is intended that greater integration of poverty proofing and other proofing processes, for example, gender and rural proofing, will also be developed.</P>

      <P>The telephone allowance scheme administered by my Department covers land-line and instrument rental and calls to the value of &euro;2.42 in each two-monthly billing period. Some 280,000 customers are benefiting from this scheme currently, at a cost of &euro;72.75 million in 2002. Eircom is the only operator participating in the scheme at present.</P>
      <P>I am committed to the extension of coverage under the scheme to meet market demands and customer needs. However, as the allowance is paid by way of direct credit to individual client bills, this will require both the Department and companies interested in participating in the scheme to invest in significant computer systems development in order to share relevant client data.</P>
      <P>It is intended that coverage of mobile phone usage will be facilitated within the telephone allowance scheme as part of the next phase of the Department's new service delivery model which has recently been implemented in the child benefit scheme.</P>

      <P>The regulation of moneylending is a matter for the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs which operates under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has been involved for a number of years in activities to combat the problem of over-indebtedness through the money advice and budgeting service which was established in <Col N="1416" /> 1992. The number of money advice and budgeting service projects now stands at 52. A total of over &euro;42 million has been provided to the service since 1992.</P>
    <P>The key feature of the MABS programme is the provision of money advice. The service is targeted primarily at individuals and families who have problems with debt or moneylending and who are on low income or in receipt of social welfare. The service places an emphasis on practical, budget-based measures that will succeed in removing people permanently from dependence on moneylenders and open up alternative sources of low cost credit, mainly through the credit unions.</P>
    <P>There is a growing level of debate on the impact of financial services, including credit and debt issues, on the living conditions of those on low incomes. The MABS programme contributes to, and informs this debate at, a broader level through the work of the MABS national advisory committee. This committee was established to advise on policy in relation to the MABS programme and on issues that impact on those affected by over-indebtedness.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. Eligibility is subject to a means test. People who qualify for means tested pensions or allowances such as old age non-contributory pension, unemployment assistance or one-parent family payment automatically qualify for fuel allowance. The majority of people who receive fuel allowances qualify because they satisfy the relevant means test for their primary weekly payment.</P>
      <P>In addition, special arrangements have been in place for a number of years which allow people who are participating on approved employment schemes such as back to work allowance and community employment to retain entitlement to secondary benefits, including the fuel allowance, subject to a weekly household income limit of &euro;317.43.</P>
      <P>In the case of contributory pensions such as old age contributory, retirement and invalidity pensions, which are not means tested, a person may have a combined household income of up to &euro;50.79 per week or savings/investments of up to &euro;41,901.35 over and above their pension and still qualify for fuel allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The means test has been eased in recent years enabling more people to qualify. Easing the <Col N="1417" /> means test, rather than abolishing it, ensures that the people who benefit are those whose incomes are in the next income band above the previous income limit. In this way, the available resources are better targeted.</P>
    <P>Any further changes would have to be considered in the context of the budget and in light of alternative proposals for delivering improvements in social welfare supports to pensioners and others.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards provides for the payment of a rent or mortgage interest supplement to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances, less a minimum contribution which all applicants are requires to pay towards their accommodation costs. Many recipients pay more than the mini<Col N="1418" /> mum contribution because applicants are required to contribute any additional assessable means they have over and above the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate. The standard means test has been eased in recent years so that, if a person or his-her spouse takes up part time employment, he or she can retain the first &euro;50 of their weekly earnings.</P>
    <P>Supplementary welfare allowance is not normally payable to people in full time employment. However, arrangements are in place to enable people taking up employment through approved employment schemes such as back to work and community employment to retain a proportion of their rent supplement subject to a weekly gross household income limit of &euro;317.43 and to certain other conditions.</P>
    <P>The means test for scheme participants has also been eased in recent years with income from back to work allowance and family income supplement being disregarded in assessing the household income level.</P>

      <P>The revised national anti-poverty strategy which was launched earlier this year, sets out a range of key targets aimed at addressing the issues of poverty and social exclusion. Progress towards the implementation of these targets will be the subject of ongoing monitoring in line with key social indicators which have been agreed at EU level. In this regard, my Department will shortly commence preparation of the second national action plan against poverty and social exclusion which will cover the period 2003-05.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of the institutional supports required to underpin the implementation of the NAPS is well advanced. The National Office of Social Inclusion, which will report to me, will formally replace my Department's NAPS unit shortly. The work of the Office will be overseen <Col N="1419" /> by a management group drawn from relevant Departments.</P>
    <P>The Office will have a number of key functions in relation to the NAPS &ndash; supporting and monitoring the implementation of the strategy, developing a more effective poverty proofing process, developing a formal data strategy and research strategy programme and drawing up an internal and external communications plan.</P>
    <P>A technical advisory group, set up to assist in the development of the NAPS data strategy, recently held its inaugural meeting. This group consists of representatives of relevant Departments, the Economic and Social Research Institute, the Central Statistics Office and the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
    <P>The social inclusion consultative group is being established to strengthen the involvement of the social partners in the NAPS process. The group will comprise of representatives from Departments, the social partners and anti-poverty experts. It is planned to hold the first meeting of the group early in the new year.</P>
    <P>The first social inclusion forum, to be convened by the National Economic and Social Forum, is expected to be held early in the new year. This forum will provide an opportunity for those working on the ground in the area of social inclusion to have a direct input into the NAPS process.</P>

      <Quest>if she has received the annual report of the Combat Poverty Agency; her views on the finding therein that relative income poverty has risen from 16% to 22% between 1994 and 2000; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Relative income poverty can be measured by counting the number of households or persons who have income below a certain percentage of mean or median average household disposable income. The revised national anti-poverty strategy states that progress in relation to the proportion of the population falling below relative income lines, particularly for a sustained period, will be monitored over the lifetime of the strategy.</P>
      <P>The figures the Deputy referred to are the number of persons below the 60% median income line. The data is taken from the Economic and Social Research Institute's analysis of the Living in Ireland surveys and shows that the numbers below the line increased from 15.6% in 1994, to 18.2% in 1997, to 20% in 1998 and 22.1% in 2000. The Combat Poverty Agency notes in its report that this does not take into account the impact of non-cash benefits as only disposable income is measured. In addition, this measure does not take into account how resources have been accumulated or eroded over time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to address such limitations, the ESRI has devised the consistent poverty measure. This <Col N="1420" /> measure is used for the NAPS poverty targets. It combines the relative income poverty measure with the experience of enforced deprivation and is intended to capture the notion of resources being eroded over time from persistence on low incomes.</P>
    <P>Ireland has seen significant reductions in consistent poverty over the period from 1994 to 2000. From 15% in 1994, the level of consistent poverty stood at 6% in 2000. The Government, in the revised NAPS, has committed itself to reduce the numbers of those who are consistently poor below 2% and, if possible, to eliminate consistent poverty altogether. The achievement of this target would be a significant milestone on the road to building an inclusive society, a goal to which this Government is fully committed.</P>

      <P>Digital content is emerging as a new economic sector with tremendous enterprise and creative potential for Ireland. In order to properly exploit the opportunities that the digital content sector provides, my Department requested Forfás to develop a co-ordinated strategy for the promotion of the digital content industry. As a first step in that process Forfás, in conjunction with the Department, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, commissioned a review of the relative stage of development and potential of the digital content industry in Ireland and internationally. Published in November of this year the review pinpoints future opportunities and identifies priority actions to achieve a co-ordinated and strategic approach to the promotion of the digital content industry into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the digital content industry is enormously complex and varied, five market sectors have been identified in the strategy document as <Col N="1421" /> high potential growth sectors to be jointly targeted by the indigenous and overseas development agencies. One such sector is the digital library sector. This sector is increasingly being recognised as a source of historical, educational and cultural reference and as such, libraries and other services are beginning to move towards becoming digital libraries. The sector is still evolving and there has been little enterprise development in Ireland in the digital library sector to date. However a range of related projects are taking place at third level institutions in Ireland, assisting the development of skills in this area. The Dublin Institute of Technology and the National Gallery of Ireland have undertaken a project to develop a virtual reality based system for viewing the gallery's art collection.</P>
    <P>The digital library niche is one where Irish enterprise could potentially develop a strong capability with high growth opportunities in content design through to content storage. Plans to develop this sector are at an early stage and in order to guide and co-ordinate the development of the digital library sector and the other sectoral strategies pinpointed in the report my Department, in association with Forfás, will establish a digital content steering group, comprising the industrial development agencies and relevant Departments.</P>

      <P>Community employment provides temporary employment for participants, which as a general rule lasts only for a period of one to three years depending on the eligibility of the participant entering the programme. FÁS has limited discretion to extend an individual's term on CE on a case by case basis, having regard to that individual's personal development needs and future employment prospects.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure CE, participation levels are gradually being reduced reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of the long-term unemployed, and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. A total of &euro;274.738 million is being provided for CE under the 2003 Estimates, which will provide for an average participation rate of approximately 22,000 in 2003. The corresponding allocation for 2002 is &euro;332.095 million to provide for an average participation rate of 28,000. Accordingly, the costs involved in maintaining the CE programme will be reduced by &euro;57.357 million in 2003.</P>
      <P>Participants exiting CE may avail of assistance from FÁS placement services and the local employment services to seek alternative employment in the open labour market, or to explore other options such as further education or training opportunities available locally. I would hope that many of the participants exiting the programme will have gained from the work experience and training received while participating on CE and will be in a position to progress directly to open labour market employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the BMW region has tended in the past to perform less satisfactorily than the rest of the country in terms of increasing and sustaining its employment in manufacturing and internationally-traded services, there are encouraging signs that the policies being adopted by the enterprise development agencies to promote the development of the region are having a positive impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1423" />In 2001, the BMW region accounted for 26% of the national population and 25% of the workforce. In 1999, the region accounted for 18% of gross job gains in agency-assisted companies. The corresponding figures for 2000 and 2001 show an increase to 20% and 25% respectively. Data in respect of 2002 will be available early in 2003. Gross job gains in the region for the companies concerned in the period 1999 to 2001 were 23,308. The regional share of employment in agency-assisted companies will continue to be monitored into the future.</P>
    <P>As regards redundancies, the number of notified redundancies in respect of the BMW region in the period 1 January 2000 to 31 October 2002 was 11,726, or 22% of total redundancies. When compared with the BMW share of the national population and workforce, this indicates that the impact of redundancies has been less severe in the BMW region than in the south and east region.</P>
    <P>Regional emphasis is a strong feature of the various programmes adopted under the National Development Plan, 2000 to 2006, and carried out through the Structural Fund Operational Programmes for that period. It is underpinned by the strong regional emphasis in the work of agencies such as IDA and Enterprise Ireland. IDA is committed to delivering half of all new greenfield jobs into the Border, midland and western regions in the period 2000 to 2003. Both agencies have re-focussed their resources on regions outside Dublin, and particular account is taken of the needs of the BMW area in matters such as transport, roads and telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Regional development will continue to be a strong focus of policy. This will be facilitated by the implementation of the national spatial strategy, published last week, in which the majority of the newly identified gateways and hubs are in the BMW region. Regional impact will also be one of the main factors to be considered in the mid-term review of the operational programmes for 2000 to 2006, to be carried out in 2003.</P>

I subsequently met representatives of the overholders in the Curragh Camp on 2 October 2002. Since then, officials of the Department have interviewed the persons concerned in order to establish the particular circumstances in each case. It is now the Department's <Col N="1424" /> intention to work with Kildare County Council, the statutory body responsible for housing, with a view to resolving the problem of overholding and it is hoped to meet with officials of the council in the near future. All options will be discussed with the council, including affordable housing, shared ownership and co-op housing schemes. Every effort will be made to ensure that the council offers assistance in all cases where the individuals are eligible for local authority housing and also grant applications for mortgages in cases where overholders have been offered sale of the quarters. Each case will be considered on its own merits and the Department will be in further contact with each of the individuals concerned in due course. In the interim no further action will be taken in the matter.</P>

      <P>One of the findings in the report for the 2001-02 season is that a veterinary post mortem examination found that a re-captured deer died due to a ruptured aneurism.

Aneurism may result from a congenital weakness of the blood vessel or from disease of its lining cells, etc. When an aneurism is present there is potential for it to rupture either spontaneously or during or after exercise.</P>

      <P>As I stated in previous replies to the Deputy, the capital investment scheme for the marketing and processing of certain agricultural products is specifically designed to encourage the marketing and processing of the products covered by the scheme. It is logical therefore that a basic level of primary processing of these products should be allowable under the scheme and this was pointed out in information provided by officials of my Department to individual growers and organisations prior to applications being received in my Department.</P>
      <P>In relation to pages 4 and 5 of the scheme document referred to by the Deputy, the broad sectoral priorities for the potato sector are set out on these pages. It is emphasised that the objective of the scheme is to speed up improvements in the marketing infrastructure of the potato sector. Some examples of the marketing equipment which could attract grant aid are listed. However, the list is not exhaustive and, as the aim of the scheme is to encourage marketing and processing, it is open to my Department to fund items of equipment other than those given as examples if they contribute to the development of the sector.</P>
      <P>I am fully satisfied that all aspects of the scheme were correctly and fairly administered by officials of my Department and that the successful applicants meet the sectoral priorities laid down for the potato sector.</P>

      <P>Farmers who have commonage land in REPS qualify for generous payments of up to &euro;242 per hectare. My Department was obliged to provide the European Commission with detailed justification for this level of payments in terms of additional costs and income forgone by farmers as a result of following more extensive farming methods. It includes an element of &euro;90 per hectare which relates specifically to reductions in ewe numbers. Farmers may opt for a complementary scheme of compensation, to be operated by Dúchas, instead of REPS.</P>

      <P>REPS payments, as approved by the EU Commission, are calculated taking account of income foregone and costs incurred by participants generally as a result of following more extensive farming practices, together with an incentive element. The incentive element of general REPS payments is 10% for holdings between 20 and 40 hectares and 20%, the maximum percentage allowed under the relevant EU regulation, for holdings under 20 hectares.</P>
      <P>Since REPS payments are area-based, the amount of the payment reckonable as disposable income will vary from farmer to farmer because the income forgone and costs incurred will be different in every case.</P>

      <P>My attention has not specifically been drawn to the <Col N="1431" /> number of civil servants engaged in answering parliamentary questions, or to the annual cost to the State or the estimated employee hours involved. In this regard no staff in my Department are assigned full time to dealing with PQs. PQs are dealt with, as the need arises, by the staff in the sections dealing with the particular issue(s) raised in individual PQs. The number and level of staff and the time spent on an individual answer depends on the complexity and importance of the issue raised, the form in which the information exists in the Department and the form of the proposed response, i.e. whether oral or written. In my own Department I responded to some 1,600 PQs in 1999 (of which 378 were oral), some 1,800 in 2000 (of which 377 were oral), some 1,750 in 2001 (of which 358 were oral) and some 1,300 to date in 2002 (of which 239 were oral). It is not possible to quantify the cost for the reasons outlined above. Producing a current annual cost to the State for staff and time spent answering such questions would require a detailed civil service wide survey to be undertaken and I have no plans to institute such a survey at this time.</P>

      <P>The existing VAT treatment of electronic content services will be changed following agreement in May, 2002 on a directive to amend the VAT treatment of electronic services. It will come into force on 1 July 2003. The effect of this directive is that digitally supplied services supplied to business or private customers outside the EU will no longer be subject to VAT. Supplies across frontiers to business customers in the EU will be subject to a reverse charge regime. This means that the business customer will account for the VAT at the rate in the member state where the business receives the supply. The directive provides for a special scheme for supplies made to private consumers in the EU by third country providers, and these will be taxed at the rate applying in the member state of the consumer. Supplies within the EU to private consumers in the EU from suppliers in another member state will continue to be taxed at the rate that applies in the member state of the supplier. These are the supplies where competitive pressures arise in terms of the rate.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that to reduce the rate of VAT for such services, when provided by Irish businesses supplying private consumers in other member states, would require a general reduction in the standard rate. This would be costly for the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I consider moreover that the changes which will arise out of the adoption of this Directive will remedy many of the difficulties which have been raised in respect of the on-line supply of digital services.</P>

      <P>The national assessment and remand unit is fully occupied. The care and education unit is undergoing some refurbishment work. As a result of this work not all of the places are available for occupancy. In addition due to some refurbishment work on the administration area in the care and education unit the grove pre-release unit is being used temporarily for administration staff.</P>
      <P>There are a number of factors that have impacted on the operation of the Finglas centre in recent times. A major programme of capital redevelopment works has been undertaken in the centre in the past two years. These works have significantly reduced the capacity of the centre and caused considerable disruption for both the young people in care and the staff. When the programme of capital work is complete it is intended that the Finglas Child and Adolescent Centre will be in a position to operate to capacity. In this regard the Department of Education and Science has commissioned an independent review of the residential requirements for young offenders. The purpose of this review is to examine the existing residential provision for children who have been convicted of an offence or placed on remand by a court and indicate if the places available are being used optimally and appropriately at present. The outcome of this review will assist in planning for the optimum number of places required in all of the young offender centres, including the Finglas Child and Adolescent Centre.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department decided to examine post-primary provision in the New Ross area with a view to possible rationalisation. This decision was taken in light of capital grant applications received from all five post-primary schools in the centre, including the CBS. It was also decided to extend the scope of this examination to include the five primary schools in the area.</P>
      <P>In view of the extent of this examination, it was decided to appoint a facilitator, Dr. Tom McCarthy, to consult with the local providers with a view to identifying the key issues in relation to primary and post-primary school provision in the area. Dr. McCarthy's report has now been received and is currently under examination in the planning and building unit of my Department. It is intended to decide how best to respond to the issues identified in the light of available resources and the competing demands of other schools.</P>
      <P>In the interim, the planning and building unit of my Department is addressing any health and safety issues at New Ross CBS and is currently awaiting details of the works involved and the estimated cost of same from the school authorities. Upon receipt of this information the matter will receive further attention.</P>

      <P>Transition year is a one year, in-school programme, designed to bridge the gap between the highly structured, guided learning of the junior certificate and the more independent self-directed learning requirements of the leaving certificate and beyond. It is a programme which aims to promote the personal, social, vocational, technical and academic skills of the students so as to prepare them for their role as autonomous and participative members of society &ndash; Department of Education 1994-95.</P>
      <P>Responding to the challenge of facilitating the development of such skills has necessitated the putting in place of a range of policy recommendations and strategies aimed at ensuring that not only are such skills identified, but also developed in the transition year classroom. This ongoing process is undertaken through a variety of transition year programmes, teaching and learning strategies, calendar events and links with outside agencies. Since social and personal development is seen as the cornerstone around which all other transition year competencies are developed, it follows that the cultivation of interpersonal and intra-personal skills would provide the optimum means of accomplishing this. The development of these generic, or soft skills as they are currently referred to, is essential to effective participation in contemporary society with its emphasis on teamwork and flexible collaborative practices. Facilitating the development of such participatory competence is one of the goals of transition year and is most frequently mediated through programmes and practices which include developing a proficiency in communication and leadership skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the development of general communication skills underpins many modules or subjects in transition year &ndash; and may be defined as communicating language, music, art, sport, drama, technology &ndash; it is specifically nurtured through the following which are described in some detail in the transition year curriculum support service handbooks of 1998 and 2000: Oral Presentations Programme &ndash; TYCSS Handbook 2001; Project Work &ndash; TYCSS Handbook 2000; Role Play/Drama in Education &ndash; TYCSS Handbook <Col N="1458" /> 2001; language classes; media studies; Information Studies Module &ndash; TYST Handbook 1998; information-communication technology; get up and go mini-company programme; group work; school musicals; the visiting speaker; public speaking and debating; and work experience.</P>
    <P>Many of the aforementioned programmes as well as other programmes specified below are also important tools in the development of leadership skills. The chief programmes are get and go mini-company programme; public speaking/debating; sports leadership programmes; social outreach programmes; transition year induction programme; and transition year specific programmes.</P>
    <P>Examples of the latter are: staying alive &ndash; road safety module; agri-aware; safe food for life; young social innovator of the year; in search of Europe; leaving home; citizens information for students; mental health matters; family awareness module; shaping space; SWAY skills; youth and work; and GAA/FAI/IRFU coaching courses.</P>

      <P>The special rates of maintenance grant for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grants, were introduced with effect from the 2000-01 academic year.</P>
      <P>The target group of those most in need has been defined in terms of the dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, where the necessary conditions are fulfilled. The special rates of grant are also available to mature students who meet the prescribed conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1460" />Earlier this year, my Department carried out a review of the operation of the special rates of maintenance grant. This review also had the benefit of input from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Arising from the review, the income thresholds for the award of the special rate of grant were increased by 32%. In addition, the criteria were broadened significantly, and a number of additional social welfare payments have been included as eligible payments for the purpose of the scheme.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of assessment under the terms of the scheme, applicants are divided into three main groups as follows: grant holders assessed on parent(s)/guardian(s) income &ndash; other than those classified as mature; mature grant holders assessed on parent(s) income; mature grant holders assessed on own income; and mature grant holders assessed on income of spouse or partner.</P>
    <P>To qualify for the top-up grant in respect of the current, 2002-03, academic year, all candidates must satisfy the following conditions: qualify for the ordinary maintenance grant in respect of 2002-03; total reckonable income in the tax year ended 31 December 2001 must not exceed &euro;9,190 &ndash; net of standard exclusions, as set out in the 2002 maintenance grants schemes and net of CDA payments, where applicable; and the reckonable income of parent(s)/guardian(s), the candidate himself or herself, or the income of the spouse or partner, as the case may be, must include one of the eligible social welfare payments prescribed under the scheme.</P>
    <P>If a person in receipt of the ordinary maintenance grant considers that s/he may be eligible for the special rate of maintenance grant, s/he should apply to the relevant local authority or VEC which approved the ordinary grant. My Department will forward full details of the eligibility criteria under the special rates of maintenance grant scheme directly to the Deputy for his information.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 281 to 283, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Digital Hub is an initiative of the Irish Government to create an international digital enterprise area in Dublin city. Through the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, &euro;130 million of public funds has already been committed for The Digital Hub and for Media Lab Europe (MLE), a third-level research and education centre already located in The Digital Hub.</P>
      <P>A fund for collaborative research between Irish third-level institutions and Media Lab Europe was established in 2000. The objective of the fund is to encourage academic staff and researchers in Irish third level institutions to develop joint research projects with Media Lab Europe. Co-operation between researchers from more than one Irish institution is encouraged.</P>
      <P>In particular, the objectives of the fund are as follows: to assist and facilitate quality interdisciplinary research in media, materials, and methods; to contribute to the development of media, materials, and methods research in Irish third level Institutions and Media Lab Europe; to promote and foster collaboration between academic institutions and Media Lab Europe and, by extension, MIT Media Lab.</P>
      <P>This scheme is administered by the Higher Education Authority on behalf of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. To date, &euro;3.81 million has been allocated to third level institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, it is proposed that the Digital Hub Development Agency will develop a strategy for <Col N="1463" /> educational provision, particularly for digital arts and technology, including links with third level institutions engaged in digital content projects.</P>
    <P>ICT and digital-related industry is a high-skills, high-tech area requiring a strong graduate skills base. The third level sector has greatly expanded the number and type of these courses available to students at both sub-degree and post-degree level in recent years in order to meet the identified skills needs of industry. The issue of the supply of these type of courses was originally examined by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs in the single issue report on e-Business Skills published in August 2000.</P>
    <P>The Forfás report that the Deputy refers to entitled &lsquo;A Strategy for the Digital Content Industry in Ireland' was published on 5 November 2002. This report makes a number of important recommendations on the skills profile that will be required by the digital content industry sector. On education and training, the report recommends that a detailed audit of skills requirements for the digital content industry should be conducted by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs. I will await the recommendations of the expert group in this regard and I understand that this audit is planned for completion by the group by mid-2003. The Deputy will appreciate that the issue of curriculum content at third level is a matter for course directors in individual institutions in the first instance. The recommendations of the report will inform policy discussions between my Department, the Higher Education Authority, the institutes of technology and other relevant institutions in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of the new primary school curriculum in 1999 represented an important landmark in the history of primary education in Ireland. The curriculum incorporates current educational thinking, the most effective pedagogical practices and represents a process of revision that is both evolutionary and developmental. It is designed to cater for the needs of children in the modern world. The ability to think critically, to apply learning and to develop flexibility and creativity are important factors in the child's life. The curriculum places an emphasis on promoting these skills and abilities so that children may cope successfully with change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of the various subject areas under the new curriculum are being supported by a programme of in-service training that is taking <Col N="1464" /> place each year under the primary curriculum support programme. Under this programme all primary teachers are receiving in-service training and it is consequently expected they will be in a position to begin the implementation of the revised curriculum in their schools.</P>
    <P>The in-service programme has been supported by a series of once-off grants over recent years to assist schools in the implementation of various subject areas under the new curriculum. These grants enable schools to purchase suitable equipment and materials and to initiate various activities with a view to ensuring that children are enabled to participate in all areas of the new curriculum.</P>
    <P>My Department, in co-operation with Kildare Education Centre, since September 1998 has been engaged in a project aimed at introducing a modern European language to fifth and sixth classes in primary schools on a phased basis. A full-time national co-ordinator was appointed to this project with effect from the beginning of September 2001. Seven project leaders &ndash; trainers &ndash; are working with schools participating in the project &ndash; approximately 378 schools at the end of December 2002 &ndash; on an ongoing basis. The targeted languages are French, German, Spanish and Italian. Funding of &euro;1.8 million has been allocated to the project for 2003 under the national development plan.</P>
    <P>At second level my Department, in conjunction with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, is pursuing a programme of ongoing curriculum development. Revised syllabi are being introduced on a phased basis and a second level support service provides ongoing cost implementation support in a number of subject areas.</P>

My Department is currently considering the recommendations contained in the report including recommendation No. 3.8 to which the Deputy specifically refers.</P>
      <P>One of the key recommendations of the report relates to the establishment of a digital content steering group by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, supported by Forfás, comprising the industrial development agencies and relevant Departments to guide and coordinate the development of the sectoral strategies for specific niches and to progress implementation of the actions in the report.</P>
      <P>My Department will contribute to the work of that group as appropriate.</P>

      <P>Persons suffering from any of the following conditions, who are not already medical card holders, may obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness, for persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
      <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. There are no plans to extend medical card eligibility automatically to include children with Down's syndrome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit <Col N="1468" /> pays more than &euro;65 per calendar month, rising towards &euro;70 per month from 1 January 2003, towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>
    <P>The domiciliary care allowance is paid by health boards in respect of eligible children up to the age of 16 years who are so severely disabled or mentally handicapped that they require care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the provisions of a lung transplant unit. The provision of such a unit at the Mater Hospital forms part of a major capital development approved for the hospital. Considerable preparatory work has already been completed ahead of the commencement of lung transplantation in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Revenue funding in excess of &euro;3 million has already been provided to support the enhancement of lung transplant services for Irish patients, including persons with cystic fibrosis. Additional funding of &euro;4.5 million is being provided to further develop this programme in 2003. This will facilitate the early commencement of lung transplantation at the Mater Hospital.</P>
      <P>Pending the establishment of lung transplantation in this country, an agreement is in place with the Freeman Hospital in the UK for the treatment of Irish patients. This agreement will continue while the necessary arrangements are being progressed in terms of establishing the programme in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 297 and 303 together.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned at the increase in alcohol consumption in Ireland in recent years. Earlier this year I established the strategic task force on alcohol. It has made a number of recommendations aimed at reducing the overall level of consumption. The current position regarding the content of labels on alcoholic beverages is strictly regulated. The most recent development at EU level on labels on alcoholic products is that all alcohol products must now display a list of ingredients. Research provided to the task force has suggested that there is very little evidence of any effect on drinking behaviour and alcohol related harm by placing warnings on alcohol beverage containers. The research evidence in this area will continue to be monitored.</P>

      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the ERHA. There are currently three levels of dependency, medium, high and maximum, in respect of which maximum rates of &euro;114.30, &euro;152.40 and &euro;190.50 apply respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second schedule of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, sets out the general rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for a nursing home subvention. Means, for the purposes of these regulations, are the income and the imputed value of assets of a <Col N="1472" /> person in respect of whom a subvention is being sought and the income and imputed income of his or her spouse. Paragraph 2 of the second schedule provides that, in calculating the means of an applicant, a health board shall take all sources of income into account, including rental income. Means are assessed for this scheme to ensure that the available funding is directed at those older people who have the greatest need of financial assistance.</P>
    <P>Articles 8.1 and paragraphs 12 to 14 of the second schedule of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, deal with the assessment of the residence of a person in respect of whom subvention has been sought for the purposes of determining the amount of subvention to be paid.</P>
    <P>The residence of the person seeking a subvention is treated as a special asset and is not taken into account in certain circumstances. For example, if it is occupied by the spouse of the person seeking a subvention or by a son or daughter less then 21 years of age or in full-time education or by a relative in receipt of the old age non-contributory pension or a disability allowance type payment.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this rule is to avoid causing undue hardship where the home of a person going into nursing home care is occupied by a dependent relative. If the principal residence is not occupied by a relative falling into those categories a health board may impute an annual amount of 5% of the estimated market value of the residence as income.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of the second schedule of the regulations sets out an exclusion whereby a health board may refuse to pay a subvention to a person if his or her principal residence is valued at &euro;95,230.36 or more and is not occupied by a spouse, a son or daughter aged less than 21 years or in full-time education or a relative in receipt of the disabled person's maintenance allowance, blind person's pension, disability benefit, invalidity pension, or old age non-contributory pension and the person's income is greater than &euro;6,348.69 per annum.</P>
    <P>Articles 9.1 and 9.2 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, allowed health boards to assess the ability of the adult sons and-or daughters of older people who apply for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care. The subvention regulations were amended from 1 January 1999 and the provision to assess the capacity of adult sons and-or daughters to contribute towards the cost of nursing home care of their parent was deleted. The ability of adult sons and-or daughters to contribute towards the cost is, therefore, no longer assessed.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently examining a number of aspects of the nursing home regulations including a review of the value of the principal residence for the purposes of the exclusion clause.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1 January 1993 general practitioners have been allocated an annual target budget for expenditure on drugs for their GMS patients. This scheme is called the indicative drug target saving scheme. Targets are determined by national norms and form part of an agreement between my Department and the Irish Medical Organisation.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to limit the escalation of the annual costs of GMS drugs, general practitioners participating in the scheme are permitted to accrue savings under this scheme which can then be used to fund general practice developments at their practice premises for the benefit of their patients. Applications for funds from this scheme must be formally approved by the local health board in advance of payment by the GMS payments board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of the scheme undertaken by Professor Michael Murphy, which was published in <Col N="1474" /> July 1997 found that there were changes in prescribing behaviour as a result of the scheme. Some doctors made savings through enhanced prescribing of generic medications and there were no discernible negative effects on the overall quality of prescribing.</P>
    <P>Many of the new drugs are patent protected so that generic substitution is not possible. The total number of items prescribed under the GMSS in 2001 was 25,656,314. The total number of generic items prescribed under the GMSS was 5,363,002 or 20.90%. The total number of items prescribed under the drugs payment scheme is 8,599,098. The total number of generic items prescribed under the DPS is 986,136 or 11.47%.</P>
    <P>The results of a study carried out by the national centre for pharmaeconomics, at my Department's request, indicate that of the balance of items prescribed under the DPS, generic substitution was only possible for approximately 18%.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently examining policy options in relation to the increased use of generic medicines in the community drugs schemes.</P>

      <P>Persons suffering from any of the following conditions, who are not already medical card holders, may obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness for persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia. There are no plans to amend the long-term illness scheme to include persons with Crohn's disease.</P>
      <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. Where a person's income exceeds the guidelines a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. There are no plans to extend automatic eligibility to a medical card for those with Crohn's disease.</P>
      <P>Non-medical cardholders and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;65 per calendar month, rising to &euro;70 per month from 1 January 2003, towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 312 and 313 together.</P>
      <P>The High Court ruled on 31 July that where an individual accepts an award from the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal, that person is entitled to appeal the amount of the award to the High Court at any time.</P>
      <P>The High Court was incorrect in its interpretation of the intentions of the Oireachtas when it enacted section 5(9)(<i>a</i>) of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act, 1997. This provides that:</P>
      <P>where the Tribunal makes an award to a claimant, the claimant shall have a period of one month or such time as may be prescribed from the date of receiving notice of the making of the award during which the claimant may decide in writing either to accept or reject the award or to appeal the award under subsection (15).</P>
      <P>I do not believe the Oireachtas envisaged that all claimants would be able to accept their tribunal award and appeal, which is the effect of the court's ruling. I also believe that the time limit provided for in section 5(9)(<i>a</i>) is not capable of extension by the court. In the light of legal advice I received I have instructed that the ruling be appealed to the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>In relation to the specific case mentioned by the Deputy, I have recently received correspondence from the person in question which appears to indicate that she may have an interest in the outcome of the appeal to the Supreme Court. It would not be appropriate for me to comment further until the court's judgment comes to hand.</P>

      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in March 2000 with phase one covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. The target population consists of approximately 136,000 women and represents about 50% of the national target population. To the end of August 91,906 women had been called for screening and 68,184 women have been screened. This represents an uptake of 74%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process. It is essential that the programme is driven by international quality assurance criteria and best practice. The board of BreastCheck has submitted a business plan to my Department for the national expansion of the programme. My Department is in discussions with the executive of BreastCheck in relation to the expansion of the programme and especially the linkages with the existing symptomatic services. I have invested substantially in the develop<Col N="1479" /> ment of symptomatic services and further development is required.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the national extension of BreastCheck and a decision in relation to this issue is being considered in the context of the overall investment programme for cancer services. Any woman, irrespective of her age or residence, who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</P>

      <P>Services for eligible patients at Beaumont Hospital are provided under an arrangement with the ERHA. My Department has asked the authority's regional chief executive to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and to reply to him directly.</P>
      <P>The health strategy sets out a comprehensive set of actions to reduce waiting times for public patients. The target is that by the end of 2004 all public patients requiring admission to hospital will be scheduled to commence treatment within a maximum of three months of referral from an out-patient department. Intermediate targets have been set to achieve this aim to ensure that the focus is being turned towards people who are a long time waiting.</P>
      <P>While the waiting list initiative will continue to fund additional elective activity, a new dedicated national treatment purchase fund is being used to target those waiting longest for treatment by purchasing treatments for public patients in private hospitals. To date the NTPF has treated up to 1,600 patients and from January 2003 it expects to refer 600 patients per month for treatment.</P>

      <P>All major road projects are reassessed periodically by the NRA as projects develop and move towards construction. The need for further strengthening of these and related arrangements will be considered in the context of the Fitzpatrick Associates report Evaluation of Investment in the Road Network, which the NESC report referred to and the upcoming mid-term review of the operational programme on economic and social infrastructure.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office strategy, entitled A Platform for Change 2000-16, contains proposals for the provision of new Luas lines and for a metro in the Dublin area. The strategy updates the previous proposals to cater for future demands for public transport services in north Dublin and supersedes the planned construction of the Luas line D.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year the Government decided that the metro should be developed on a phased basis, with phase one involving a line from Dublin Airport and Blanchardstown through the city centre to Shanganagh. The outline business case for phase one was submitted to me recently by the Railway Procurement Agency and is being evaluated by my Department. I intend to bring proposals to Government early in the new year.</P>
      <P>The precise route alignment of the metro has not yet been decided upon. The RPA is also considering the wider extended Luas network but specific route planning will be determined by the final decision on the alignment for the metro.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Shanganagh Castle was opened in 1969 as an open detention centre for males aged between 16 and 21 years of age. The centre, which stands on grounds of 24 acres, has dormitory accommodation for 60 inmates. However, it has been increasingly difficult to identify young male offenders suitable for this type of open prison accommodation. Last year Shanganagh Castle had an average offender occupancy of 30 inmates. This has fallen again this year with as few as 16 inmates being detained recently. In addition, the full implementation of the provisions of the Children Act, 2001, will mean that 16 and 17 year old inmates must be completely segregated in the prison system, resulting in a further drop in those offenders who might be found suitable for transfer to the castle.</P>
      <P>The annual cost of keeping an offender at Shanganagh Castle in 2001 was &euro;127,000. This is significantly higher than the average overall cost per prisoner of &euro;79,000 in the same year. The suggestion in the correspondence referred to by the Deputy that Shanganagh Castle provides the only drug free environment for young offenders in the Irish prison system is factually incorrect. St. Patrick's Institution, which caters for the same age group as Shanganagh Castle, has operated a designated drug free wing since November 2000. This wing allows inmates who do not have a background of drug abuse and those who have demonstrated the desire to stop taking drugs to be detained in a drug free and secure environment. A study contracted by the European Conference on Drugs and HIV/AIDS Services in Prisons indicated that St. Patrick's Institution was an example of best practice in the area of drug policy in establishments of its type. They also singled out the institution as a fine example of multidisciplinary working with good care and planning services for offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the very considerable decline in the number of young offenders found suitable for transfer to Shanganagh Castle in recent years, the Irish Prisons Service established a group to examine the options for its continued use as a detention centre. While the group's report identified <Col N="1483" /> an increase in the upper age limit of offenders as one option, they also recognised that:</P>
    <P>If none of the recommended options were considered viable then, as the current regime at Shanganagh Castle cannot be justified on operational or financial grounds, the closure of the castle and the subsequent disposal of the site will have to be considered.</P>
    <P>I recognise the important service that Shanganagh Castle and its staff have given to the prison system over the years, particularly in terms of dealing with juvenile offenders. I have given careful consideration to this report, its current viability and the options available for its future use. As a result I intend to close the centre in order to contribute to the control of costs in the prison service, to make more effective use of prison service staffing and other resources, and to release funds through the sale of Shanganagh Castle to be used, subject to the agreement of the Minister for Finance, for more productive prison related purposes.</P>
    <P>The small number of inmates currently in Shanganagh Castle can be accommodated elsewhere in the prison system without difficulty or, in appropriate cases, given temporary release as part of the normal process of preparation for re-integration into society upon final release. The needs of offenders in this age category can be adequately met elsewhere in the prison system, for example, in St. Patrick's Institution which has introduced important new programmes over the past two years for the rehabilitation of offenders, including a positive sentence management programme and the drug free wing to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>I reject suggestions that there has been a deliberate policy of under utilising the centre over recent years. While there is a considerable number of persons aged between 16 and 21 years of age currently detained in closed prison institutions, it is misleading to imply that all or a significant number of these prisoners would be eligible or suitable for a transfer to Shanganagh Castle. A number of initiatives were taken to increase the number of inmates in the centre. Among these was the implementation of new procedures for dealing with assessments of candidates for Shanganagh Castle. Many offenders in this age group are either unsuitable or are not eligible for a transfer to the centre for various reasons. In addition, offenders were often unwilling to transfer to Shanganagh Castle.</P>
    <P>Closure of Shanganagh Castle will also necessitate the reassignment of its complement of 43 prison service staff to other institutions. The terms of such reassignments will be the subject of discussions with the Prison Officers' Association. Discussions will also be necessary with the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee in regard to the position of the full-time and part-time teachers at the castle. The probation and <Col N="1484" /> welfare officer currently assigned to the centre will be assigned to other duties.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the evidential breath testing instrument. I have been informed by the Garda authorities that where a person is arrested on suspicion of drunk driving, being drunk in charge, refusing or failing to provide a preliminary breath specimen, dangerous driving, unauthorised taking of MPV, or in connection with an alleged hit and run collision resulting in personal injury, and a member of An Garda Síochána is of the opinion that the person has consumed an intoxicant, a member of the force may at a Garda station, at his/her discretion, do either or both of the following: require the person to provide two breath specimens using an EBT instrument or require the person to permit a designated doctor to take a specimen of blood or provide a specimen of urine.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that a weekly breakdown of the numbers of persons charged is not available. Provisional figures indicate that from 1 January to 27 October as many as 9,155 arrests were made under the above provisions and the person required to provide a breath, blood or urine specimen. I am also informed that statistics are not yet available to indicate how many of those arrested were dealt with using an EBT instrument.</P>
      <P>The scheduling of cases for hearing is a matter for the courts. The Garda authorities do not see the use of EBT as having a negative impact on the road safety campaign. I agree that, on the contrary, the availability of such instruments is an important tool in combating drinking and driving.</P>

      <P>There have been three High Court challenges heard in relation to the operation of the instruments.

To date all three cases have been successfully defended by the State in the High Court and there are approximately 45 cases pending.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 340 and 341 together.</P>
      <P>While the Exchequer provision for social and affordable housing in 2003 is down 5%, the provision of &euro;932 million for Exchequer capital expenditure in 2003 is more than double the spending in 2000 when Exchequer capital spending was just under &euro;452 million. Total capital funding for housing in 2003 is &euro;1.7 billion, including Exchequer and non-Exchequer components, and will exceed by almost 7% the amount provided in 2002. This will allow for increased provision under voluntary housing programmes and other schemes such as affordable housing and shared ownership schemes.</P>
      <P>In relation to the largest area of spending, the local authority programme, the substantial overhang of commitments affecting the programme in 2002 will not be repeated in 2003 and the funding reflects this. Local authorities are likely to have commenced about 4,300 starts in 2002 and I envisage some increase in this level of starts next year.</P>
      <P>I anticipate that the range of social and affordable housing measures will deliver accommodation for about 12,000 households in 2003 compared to almost 13,000 this year.</P>

      <P>Between 1992 and 1994 a survey of known areas of ecological interest in Ireland was undertaken by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which is now part of my Department. The survey recorded habitats, land uses and threats to these sites as well as identifying appropriate site boundaries. The survey recognised more than 1,100 areas of conservation value, which were then publicly notified as proposed Natural Heritage Areas. This suite of sites formed the main basis from which 364 candidate special areas of conservation under the EU Habitats Directive have been selected to date.</P>
      <P>The Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000, provides the basis for statutory designation of NHAs. The Act defines a natural heritage area as &ldquo;an area which is worthy of conservation for one or more species, communities, habitats, landforms or geological or geomorphological features, or for its diversity of natural attributes.&rdquo; To date no NHAs have been formally designated under the Act but the process leading to designation has commenced. Last March proposals were published, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, of the intention to designate seven coastal sites as NHAs in respect of their bird interest.</P>
      <P>I am committed to publishing, later this month, proposals of my intention to designate 75 raised bogs as NHAs. These sites are located mainly in midland counties. They will form the first major group of conservation sites to be proposed for designation under the provisions of the Act. In 2003 and subsequently, on a phased basis, I intend to publish proposals for statutory protection of further sites as NHAs. These proposals will deal mainly with sites of ecological interest previously notified on a non-statutory basis as proposed NHAs, as well as sites of geological interest which are being identified and recommended to me by the Geological Survey of Ireland.</P>

      <P>My Department provides assistance to the elderly in a variety of ways and co-operates with the Department of Health and Children and other Departments as appropriate.</P>
      <P>The fuel scheme operated by the Department runs from early October to mid-April each year. The aim of the scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.</P>
      <P>There is also a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, by way of a heating supplement, to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. Heating supplements under the scheme are normally paid to people who have special heating requirements as a result of illness or infirmity.</P>
      <P>If a person has an exceptional need they can apply for an exceptional needs payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Exceptional needs payments are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government operates a grant scheme for elderly people in respect of home improvements. <Col N="1494" /> Grants are available to assist with the cost of carrying out essential repairs or improvements that will prolong the useful life of a house.</P>
    <P>Finally a high level working group whose function is to develop an action plan to meet the needs of older people has been established. This group comprises representatives of my Department, the Departments of Health and Children, Environment and Local Government and Transport. The group is chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, who has special responsibility for older people.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if she will extend pro rata old age pension payments to all contributors in line with their contributions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>In order to qualify for the maximum rate of the old age contributory pension a person must, amongst other qualifying conditions, achieve a yearly average of at least 48 contributions paid or credited on their social insurance record. Reduced pensions are paid to those with yearly averages as low as ten contributions. Standard pensions are paid at 98%, 75% and 50% of the maximum rate depending on the average number of contributions paid or credited. This rates structure is of particular benefit to those with less than complete insurance records.</P>
      <P>In 2000 the Department published a review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pension phase 1. This report proposed, amongst other things, that consideration be given to changing the basis of assessment for old age contributory and retirement pensions from the current system of average contributions to one based on total contributions paid or credited.</P>
      <P>Phase 2 of this report is at an advanced stage of preparation and it is hoped to publish it as a discussion document early in 2003. The report will examine the implications of a system of assessment based on total contributions and outline options for such a system, taking account of the developments in the social insurance system which have resulted in considerably extended coverage of the workforce by the system.</P>
      <P>Changes to the current rate and contribution structure will be considered in the light of this review.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the steps she will take to expedite the process in respect of applications for various pension or other payments which comprise contributions made outside this jurisdiction; if she will review the bilateral agreements to ensure that all applications are processed within a reasonable time; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Pension applications based on a combination of Irish insurance contributions and contributions from another EU member state or a country with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement take longer than normal to process for a variety of reasons. The cases are complex and involve checking insurance records from various sources. Cases where employment contributions have been made outside of EU countries entitlement may have to be tested under more than one agreement.</P>
      <P>Everything possible is being done to process these applications quickly. Additional resources have been applied to this work as circumstances and demands on other fronts allow. In all cases the over-riding consideration is to ensure that customers receive their correct entitlement and decisions cannot be taken until all appropriate information is received.</P>
      <P>Following a review of the implementation of EU and bilateral arrangements carried out by my Department last year, the institutions in the other countries have been requested to expedite insurance records for the cases in question as quickly as possible. Officials from my Department also recently visited the UK social security authorities to discuss ways in which the current process could be improved upon.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the delay in processing applications will not result in any losses to pensioners who are awarded <i>pro rata</i> pensions. Their claims will be backdated in accordance with the standard provisions governing the backdating pension claims.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the delay in having the Pensions (Amendment) Act, 2002, enacted as passed by Dáil Éireann during the term of the 1997-2002 Government; if her attention has been drawn to the difficulties arising from the delay in this enactment, that is, for ex-employees of IFI; and if the Act will be immediately enacted.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Pensions (Amendment) Act, 2002, was published in July 2001, introduced to the Seanad in October 2001, passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in March and enacted in early April.</P>
      <P>A significant number of regulations are required to bring sections of the Act into force. Much work has already been done in this regard particularly in relation to the introduction of personal retirement savings accounts which will be available early in 2003.</P>
      <P>The provisions in relation to preservation which are of particular value to workers came into force in June. In addition, an advertisement was placed last week by the Civil Service Commission to recruit a pensions ombudsman.</P>
      <P>There are many technical issues associated with the introduction of the remaining sections of the Act and associated regulations. They require extensive consultation with the Pensions Board, social partners and representatives of pension funds and the pensions industry. This work is proceeding as quickly as possible with a view to the commencement of the remaining sections as early as possible in 2003.</P>
      <P>Overall, I am satisfied that everything possible is being done to bring the provisions of the Pensions (Amendment) Act, 2002 into force without delay. I am not aware of any particular difficulties being experienced by former employees of IFI in relation to aspects of the Act. If the Deputy can supply further details I will have these examined as a matter of urgency.</P>
