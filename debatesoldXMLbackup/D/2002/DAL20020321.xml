      <P>Before the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputy Sargent. I call on the Deputy to state the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I request that Dáil Éireann be adjourned to discuss the manner in which the Government is reportedly to make about 300 Government appointments to various semi-State boards, including top positions in the Environmental Protection Agency, before leaving office. This carry on is in conflict with the tired and discredited Government mantra of openness, transparency and accountability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise again this morning the Taoiseach's pet project, Campus and Stadium Ireland, and in particular the aquacentre. Will the Tánaiste inform the House as to what precisely are her concerns about the Attorney General's report? She expressed concerns last night and she should inform the House now as to what those concerns are. Will she give a guarantee that the Attorney General's report will be provided to the Committee of Public Accounts so it is fully informed as it examines this particular project this morning and, in particular, the allocation of the management contract at an overall benefit of almost &euro;170 million to a dormant shelf company, which was instituted with a neat euro resource underpinning it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Tánaiste aware of claims made by unsuccessful tenderers for the project, and in particular one made on radio this morning, that boxes of supporting documentation were provided by the tenderers, that the closing date was a Friday and the successful tender was awarded on the following Monday, and that it was impossible on any practical evaluation of this for those assessing the project to have adequately assessed the competing bids with the boxes of supporting docu<Col N="1516" /> mentation over a weekend when effectively the people involved were not working?</P>
    <P>This is beginning to look like a scandal. It is beginning to smell like a scandal. The longer the Taoiseach tries to keep the lid on it and to maintain a situation where the House is not fully informed, the more the public will worry. The Tánaiste has expressed concerns. She is in full possession of the facts. The Attorney General is president of her party. I am sure she has his ear and his advice. Could the rest of us hear what the concerns are? Will she at least take on responsibility and act in the role to which she committed herself five years ago as the conscience of the Government and the monitor of good standards and ethical behaviour in Government? Will she recommit herself to transparency and accountability, of which she spoke five years ago? Let us have it out now here in the House. What is going on with this fiasco which is organised by the Taoiseach and which is becoming a source of scandal in terms of public sector tendering and the allocation of public moneys?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of the series of questions which Deputy Noonan has rightly put to the Tánaiste, could I add a supplementary question? When will the game of political pass the parcel end and is the Tánaiste's concern at this stage simply to ensure that there will be no Progressive Democrats' hands near the parcel when it explodes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste:</NameTxt>
      <P>My concerns relate to the fact that appropriate processes and procedures were not in place for the expenditure of huge sums of public money. This was a 30 year contract awarded to a company which had no trading record, which was a requirement.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's reply puts the Government in the position of the downtown office of Campus and Stadium Ireland. It is a disgrace that the Government would make decisions without having full information. Government is about making decisions on the basis of full information. The memorandum to Government went from the Taoiseach's office. In the normal way, it passed through the Attorney General's office, who signed it off. Full information should be provided to Government in all circumstances.</P>

If she is suspicious that something improper has occurred, will she level with this House in its dying days and tell us the full facts which she has in her possession? Will she stop passing this back to the point when the Dáil goes into recess? Will she tell us what is going on and make a commitment that the Committee of Public Accounts, which under law is mandated to ensure public money is spent properly, will get the Attorney General's report? It should have the Attorney General's report this morning and I want the Tánaiste to give a commitment it will get it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste:</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Government made a decision in this matter on 19 December 2001, we were informed that this was the best bid and that on all criteria it had won out. It was on that basis that the Government made the decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Tánaiste, along with the remnants of her party, has been reported on numerous occasions as having been upset, concerned or unhappy with the very structure of Campus and Stadium Ireland, will she confirm the following regarding the position at the very beginning of this project? Will she confirm, first, that the proposal for the Abbotstown project, of which the aquatic centre is a sub-part, was one which did not come to Government in the normal way, in other words, that a memorandum from the Taoiseach, who is responsible for the Department, was not circulated to other Departments for observations and comment and that the memorandum was not put through the Department of Finance for scrutiny and evaluation?</P>
      <P>Second, did she or the Attorney General, who at the time was not re-integrated into the Progressive Democrats, raise the question as to the appropriate management structure of Campus and Stadium Ireland, where the chief executive and chairman was the same person, in contradiction of the Cadbury committee's recommendations on corporate governance? Third, did she, the Attorney General or anybody in the serried ranks of the Progressive Democrats raise the question of whether there should be a separate finance director? If they did not raise those questions at that point, why are these concerns being expressed now?</P>
      <P>Given the Tánaiste's experience of Cabinet over the past five years and given that she had not been given the full facts by the Taoiseach on a previous set of occasions, did alarm bells not ring in the watchdog compartment of the Tánaiste's office to the effect that incomplete information was being put to her on 19 December, just six days before Christmas? Did she not have some concerns about a project to sign off what, I understand, is a management contract for 30 years? This is without precedent in normal commercial practice. There might perhaps be a lease for 35 years, but a management contract for 30 years is quiet extraordinary. Did any of these concerns manifest themselves to the Tánaiste? Was she made aware of them or did she raise them, or was everybody in such a rush to get to the Christmas break that this thing slipped through, as it seems to have done?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste said her primary concern was that the Government did not have full information when it made the original <Col N="1519" /> decision. Is she suggesting the Taoiseach withheld information from Government when he presented the memorandum?</P>
      <P>Secondly, has she inquired how those who evaluated the competing tenders could have come to a decision over a working weekend between Friday and Monday given that supporting documentation, according to one tenderer, involved boxes of information and supporting documentation put together by way of extensive travel abroad while examining the management of projects abroad? How could this possibly be evaluated on the Saturday and Sunday allowing this shelf company to be awarded the contract on Monday? Does the Attorney General's report deal with this? Could we be given his observations on it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am probably right in thinking the Tánaiste is the longest serving Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment or, to use the ministry's previous title, Minister for Industry and Commerce. I presume it is reasonable to make the observation that, given her experience plus the business background of the Progressive Democrats, the recommendations of the Cadbury committee on corporate governance would have been known to her prior to the circulation of the <Col N="1521" /> legislation to give effect to a decision that had already been made, which was to establish Campus Stadium Ireland. Can the Tánaiste say that this project &ndash; we know she was not happy about it from the very beginning &ndash; was agreed in principle in advance of the statutory legislation, a project which at that time had in its structure the fusion of both chairperson and chief executive into the one personage? Did she raise any objections at that stage? If not, why not?</P>
      <P>The parties concerned have been asked to give their observations on the contents of the report and that will not be completed until tomorrow. In view of the fact that the Committee of Public Accounts is meeting this afternoon, can the Tánaiste not make the draft report available to the members of the committee on a confidential basis so it can be used in the context of having a meaningful discussion with Mr. Teahon and others this afternoon? Otherwise, had she been in my position on this bench and I in her position, does she agree she would have accused me with all the elegance she can command of riding roughshod over the accountability procedures of this House and treating with contempt its Members and the taxpayers who are being asked to underwrite a 30 year contract for the sum of approximately &euro;70 million?</P>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste agree that she should have used her expertise and her position as Minister with responsibility for company law to veto or demand the separation so we would not have had the problem and the difficulty in which Mr. Teahon now finds himself &ndash; the political scapegoat for the political incompetence of Ministers? Will the Tánaiste assure the House that she will make the report available to members of the Committee of Public Accounts on a confidential basis? They have proven their trustworthiness in the past in such matters. In support of what Deputy Noonan has said, irrespective of what the Tánaiste decides in regard to that issue, will she ensure that the report is published over the weekend so she, the Taoiseach and the remaining members of the Government can be held to account in the last week of this Dáil?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night we heard the Minister recite a long litany of the financial and economic achievements of the Government, some good and some foolish. I do not deny there were achievements, such as the expansion of employment and the improvement in the ratio of debt to GDP. However, it could not be otherwise, given the economic circumstances the Minister inherited in 1997. The test of this Government will be the <Col N="1527" /> shape in which it will leave the economy it inherited in 1997 on the cusp of a boom.</P>
      <P>The Government foolishly pretends and persuades people to the belief that it is responsible for the boom. That is nonsense. I would not even claim that the previous Government was responsible for the boom. A conjunction of factors is responsible for the boom some of which go back more than 25 years in terms of investment in education and so on. The availability at a critical time of a pool of skilled labour attracted foreign direct investment and some of the lead players in the IT sector into this economy. It is nonsense to engage in games about who created the boom. The management of the boom is the issue and the question now is whether the Government is leaving an economy in the same shape as the economy it inherited in 1997. The truthful answer to the question is that the economy has changed dramatically for the worse in the past 15 months.</P>
      <P>Yesterday in her annual speech on the Estimates, the Tánaiste told the House there were 19,800 redundancies registered last year. She went on to say that in the first two months of this year, the number of redundancies is 63% higher than the comparable period last year. For five successive months the rate of job losses has been higher than for any five consecutive month period even at the low point of the 1980s. That is how bad things are on the jobs front. Different colleagues on this side of the House have pointed to the job losses toll in their constituencies in recent months.</P>
      <P>It is not just the question of job losses. Suddenly growth is stagnant and the rate of deterioration in the public finances is dramatic. Despite the Minister's conjuring job in the budget where he raided a number of funds including the social insurance fund, he cannot conceal the extent of the deterioration in public finances. It now appears all our eggs are in the basket of international recovery and the suggested expected recovery in the United States.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach may well regret his decision not to have a general election last May. Although the downturn had started by then and the economy was in a state of flux, the feel good factor still existed and he would have just about got away with it. To do so now is to perpetrate a fraud on the Irish people because the circumstances, as I have outlined them, have dramatically changed. The proposition that we can simply rely on recovery in the United States and on previous patterns to produce resurgent growth in this economy is not soundly based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were to give one example to the House to show why we cannot rely on developments in the United States to lift all economic boats here, I would refer to one serious aspect of infrastructure deficit. I see that Deputy Michael Ahern is in the House. At 7 o'clock yesterday morning we attended a briefing on the rollout of broadband in this economy. It is an aspect that is seldom discussed in this House in the context of the infra<Col N="1528" /> structure deficit, but in terms of the casual reliance on us benefiting from any pickup in the United States economy, the whole question of broadband capacity in this economy is critical.</P>
    <P>At present we are ranked at 27 in the OECD in terms of broadband capacity. Whereas in the public mind it might be associated with telecommunications, information transmission, entertainment transmission, etc., fundamentally the provision of broadband capacity in this economy is about economic development. Without that there is a real risk that improvements in the US economy will pass us by. Although I acknowledge roads are important, broadband is critical in tackling regional imbalance. In what is becoming a sickening pattern of deathbed announcements by the Government, we had to wait until the dying days of the Administration for a vague announcement by the Minister for Public Enterprise in this regard. As with so many other official announcements in recent weeks, it carries no credibility within the framework of no borrowing and no tax increases expostulated by the Minister for Finance last night and by the Taoiseach at his party's Ard Fheis.</P>
    <P>Government intervention in this area is necessary and that means public investment. The Minister for Finance is grossly distorting the economic financial and budgetary reality. As my colleague, Deputy McDowell, showed convincingly last night, he concealed a budget deficit. I do not know what Deputy Roche is sneering about. The very sight of him sneering irritates me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte has a very low threshold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I commented before, a low threshold is something with which Deputy Roche would be familiar. Last night, Deputy McDowell, showed the Minister for Finance concealed a real budget deficit of the order of &euro;2 billion as a result of the raids he mounted on the social insurance fund, etc. However, the chickens will come home to roost at the end of the year. The question for the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance is how within the rubric of no borrowing and no tax increases he will fund the health strategy, the national development plan and the rollout of broadband. It is simply not possible for the Taoiseach, as he did at the Ard Fheis, or the Minister for Finance, as he did here last night, to feign to denigrate the notion of borrowing, to give an absolute commitment about no tax increases and at the same time to say we will tackle the infrastructure deficit, invest in our public services and implement the health strategy. It simply cannot be done, unless serious cutbacks are planned and perhaps that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two days ago I attended a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts. I am quite sure that one of the things that will be announced in the coming weeks is a public service embargo. In answering questions before the committee, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance <Col N="1529" /> can only be interpreted as foretelling that a public service embargo has been agreed in all but name. We should remember that Fianna Fáil fought the famous general election in 1987 on the slogan, &ldquo;health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped&rdquo;. A month later in office it imposed the most savage cuts in the health service ever, from which we are still recovering. This represented a 180-degree turn. It was opposed to cuts the month before the general election and the month after it implemented them. It took 3,000 beds out of the system from which we have not yet recovered. I believe it will do the same now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Carey and Roche.</P>
      <P>At the launch of Fine Gael's policy document Just Economics, a throw back to the just society which I believe they have thrown out, Deputy Jim Mitchell promised more borrowing. Of course, Deputies Mitchell and Noonan would know all about borrowing. Both of them were members of the Cabinet in 1982-87 which doubled the national debt and brought this country to its knees, indeed to the brink of bankruptcy. Does the country need a rerun of that period? It does not and I believe the people would say the same. Putting Deputy Mitchell at the helm of the financial ship would have the same result as when he was at the helm of Irish Shipping which he sank in all the ports around the world in the 1980s. How can one trust a schizophrenic leadership who, on the one hand, talk about economic hair shirts and, on the other, are all for throwing money, as evidenced from pronouncements in the past couple of weeks, where they think it will gain them a few votes? Deputies Mitchell and Noonan &ndash; dream team how are you. They are more like &ldquo;d'Unbelievables&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tom and Pascal&rdquo;, two comic groups who, incidentally, also come from Limerick.</P>
      <P>The past five years have been marked by, as the amendment states, sound and successful economic and budgetary policies of the Government. This has resulted in unprecedented growth in living standards and employment, enabled strong improvements in public investment and service provision in tandem with a continued easing of the burden of taxation and national debt and the establishment of the national pensions reserve fund. It is with growing incredulity I listen to many speakers from the other side denigrating the progress which has been achieved, particularly over the past five years. Much of their rantings bear no resemblance to the facts of life and the facts of the economy. The views of objective outsiders give a truer picture of our successes. Many countries, including countries of the former eastern bloc such as the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and so on, look to us as the example to be followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1997 this Government knew there was a need to change the economic climate to help the economy prosper. The sound management of the economy has been one of the cornerstones of the <Col N="1530" /> Government's success. Over the last four years we have achieved one of the best economic performances in the world. The economy has grown in GDP terms by an annual average of 10%, something which has not been achieved in any other country in the world. Living standards have been raised by almost one-third. Involuntary emigration has effectively ceased and more than 300,000 jobs have been created. Unemployment has decreased from 10.3% to less than 4%. Long-term unemployment has decreased from 5.5% to 1.2%. It is a fact that the public finances have been put on a sound footing. In 1996 46% of all income tax receipts were being swallowed up in servicing the national debt, which at that time stood at 74% of GDP. It is now down to 34%, a massive reduction of 40% over the past four and a half years. The proportion of income tax now being used to pay interest on the national debt is down to 21%, a reduction of 25%. Some 25% more tax receipts are now available for investment in other areas of the economy such as health, education, social welfare and so on.</P>
    <P>We made a commitment to reduce personal taxation which we knew was essential to encourage people to take up work and put in a greater effort. Some &euro;4.5 billion has been delivered back to the people in tax cuts. The standard tax rate has been reduced from 26% to 20%, the higher tax rate from 48% to 42% and the tax bands have been widened significantly. In 1996, 380,000 people who were registered with the Revenue were found to be outside the tax net. Today 690,000 people registered with the Revenue are outside the tax net, that is 37% of the workforce. All taxpayers have benefited substantially from the major tax reforms of the past five years. Criticism from the Opposition that the tax cuts only benefit the rich and very rich is not true. Just 11% of tax reductions went to cut the top rate of tax. More than 43% went to increasing basic tax credits, including PAYE allowances. Some 22% went to taking 370,000 people out of the tax net and more than 16% went to reducing the standard rate of tax paid by all taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Our tax policies were aimed at promoting investment, rewarding effort, encouraging risk-taking and securing equality in the distribution of resources. In the business area we saw the need for incentives to create more jobs. The reduction of corporation tax from 36% in 1997 to 12.5% in 2003 helped in the creation of thousands of new jobs. Also the reduction of capital gains tax from 40% to 20% resulted in the freeing up of resources for investment and yielded more than a fivefold increase in the CGD tax take between 1997 and 2001.</P>
    <P>Taxation is not the only area in which unparalleled progress has been made. Some 52,000 extra houses were completed last year. We are building 13 houses per 1,000 of the population, which is by far the highest rate in Europe. In the area of social housing, more than 4,000 local authority houses were completed or acquired last year. That is the highest level of output for more than <Col N="1531" /> 15 years. In the voluntary housing sector, 1,200 units were completed in 2001. Again, that is the highest level ever achieved by the sector.</P>
    <P>In the health area, where there is grave concern, the facts show that great progress has been made in the past five years. Between 1997 and 2002, the spend in the health and children allocation increased by &euro;4.5 billion, or 125%, compared to 1997. There are now more than 4,000 additional doctors, nurses and other health care professionals. Hospital waiting lists have been reduced by one fifth during the Government's term of office. The waiting list for cardiac surgery has been reduced by 49% and ENT waiting lists have been reduced by 22%. Behind this waiting list reduction lies a huge increase in the throughput and workload of our hospitals. The number of medical procedures performed has almost doubled over the past five years from 422,000 to 825,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>There has been a massive increase in both capital and current funding in education. Capital funding for the building and refurbishing of schools has almost quadrupled.</P>

      <P>In normal circumstances in the life of a Government, a motion of this nature would come by way of a no-confidence motion from the Opposition to be countered by an amendment from the Government. It speaks volumes about the obvious terror in the Fine Gael Party and in the Opposition in general that they are not prepared to debate openly the policies of the Government and their policies and record. I am afraid I will hold some of their track record and the Government's record up to scrutiny.</P>
      <P>The reality is that we are talking about which policies are best for the future. The Government has managed to achieve the highest level of employment ever seen in the economy, reformed the taxation system, especially personal taxation, improved public services and infrastructure, distributed resources fairly, significantly reduced the national debt burden and run budget surpluses, and made provision for the future by setting up the national pension reserve. Obviously there has been sound management of the economy by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan suggested in his recent Ard-Fheis speech that Fine Gael, when last in office, restored economic security and sound fiscal poli<Col N="1532" /> cies after the first Haughey Government. This is a bizarre contortion of history. The Fine Gael leader must be reminded that in October 1986, a full four years after his party took office, this country had the highest debt per head on the planet. Barely a year after Live Aid &ndash; there are some who might remember that &ndash; Ireland had a higher debt per head than Ethiopia, Sudan or Chad, all thanks to four years of Fine Gael economic management. That same October, unemployment stood at 232,400 and emigration stood at its highest rate for 20 years. After four years of a Fine Gael-Labour Government, the figure had risen to an appalling 31,000 per year.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of what the current Government has done. Let us take the area of education as an example, an area about which I have heard a great deal. In 1998 the Government spent £133.2 million on first and second level education infrastructure, which was an increase of 45% relative to the spending of the previous Government. In 1999, the spending was £194 million, an increase of 113% relative to the allocation in 1997 by the previous Government. In 2000, the spend was £257.5 million or 181% of the previous Government's allocation for 1997. Last year we increased spending to £317.68 million or 246% of the previous Government's allocation in 1997. This year, when members of the Opposition at every meeting they can attend raise the lack of spending on education, the proposed spending is &euro;337.6 million, an increase of 370% on or almost four times more than that allocated by the parties in opposition when they were in government five years ago.</P>
    <P>In the area of social welfare, it must prove acutely embarrassing to members of the Opposition, including Deputy Rabbitte, that they voted for an increase of £1.50 per week for pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous Government increased old age non-contributory pensions by just 9.9%. The current Government increased them by 48.7%. Widow's and widower's pensions were increased by 10.2% by the previous Government whereas we increased them by 36.6%. We have increased unemployment and disability payments by 38.6% compared with 10% when the previous Government was in power. Old age contributory pensions were increased by 10% by the previous Government and by 85.3% in the life of the current Government. I could go on but it would become acutely embarrassing for the Opposition, which is the reason it is not prepared to debate openly its record against ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Michael Ahern, mentioned housing. There has been comment on the amount of public housing provided. More than 5,000 local authority houses were completed or acquired last year, the highest number in 15 years. More than 1,200 were completed by the voluntary sector. In 2002 we will spend &euro;1.7 billion on housing. Fianna Fáil will spend three and a half times <Col N="1533" /> more on housing this year than Fine Gael or Labour did in 1997.</P>
    <P>The issue of infrastructure has been touched upon. There is no doubt that the task of the next Government will be to focus significantly on continuing the Government's record investment in infrastructural development. Wherever one travels throughout the country, one sees massive investment. Let us take as an example my constituency where we waited for 30 years for a decision from any Government on freeing up land for commercial and residential development. The Government provided funding of £30 million for the north fringe sewer and about £100 million for the north fringe water main.</P>
    <P>The sceptics said Luas would not be delivered, but it is in progress. If one walks around St. Stephen's Green, one can see work being done there. The Dublin Port tunnel, which will take 9,000 heavy goods vehicles off the streets of Dublin each day, is being built. The largest tunnelling machine in the world is being constructed to bore the tunnel which will be ready for use at the end of 2004.</P>
    <P>The water quality management plan for Dublin Bay will, after years of neglect, be implemented. The Acting Chairman will remember the debates we had on Dublin City Council about the appalling condition of the water in Dublin Bay. It will have blue flag status next year because of secondary and tertiary treatment of the water supply. Some 300 extra buses have been provided under the national development plan. The metro project is well on its way. The number of road projects being undertaken is such that there is no doubt that the level of investment is unprecedented. The paltry and pale record of the Opposition is embarrassing by comparison. Without reservation, I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an interesting debate and I am pleased to contribute to it. The economic record of the Government is by any objective standards an impressive and progressive one. On each occasion on which the House discusses the question of the economy, one is treated to an extraordinary display of histrionics and downright mendacious economic revisionism, especially from the leading Opposition parties. We were not disappointed as Deputy Rabbitte rose to his usual low standards, and the mere presence of a Member who would accost him with his record was enough to have him scurrying out of the Chamber. That is exactly what we expect of that gentleman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the previous occasion I spoke on the economy, which was the Finance Bill, we were treated to a characteristically rip-roaring, fantasmagorical and, even by Opposition standards, bizarre performance by that economic guru from the far west, Deputy Ring. I remind Deputy Michael Ahern that not all the comedians come from Limerick, although there are one or two clowns from there, but there are certainly one or two others in other parts of the country who rise to very high <Col N="1534" /> standards of economic clowning. One of the interesting aspects of Deputy Ring's contribution was that he suggested that the 1970s was where the economy of today began. In a sense, perhaps he is right. A great deal has been spoken about the period from 1977 to 1981 and it is always taken that economics began in that period.</P>
    <P>Ireland's economic progress dates back much further than that. The current economic position in which we find ourselves in this country, one of the youngest in Europe, had its foundations laid by a Fianna Fáil Minister, which is appropriate because great economic progress has always been achieved under Fianna Fáil Ministers. That Minister was Seán Lemass who had foresight and vision at a time when Ireland was lacking people with those qualities and imagination. He had the foresight, vision and political courage to launch the country in a particular direction.</P>
    <P>The modern economy goes back to the early 1960s. We hit a bad patch in the 1970s and there is no point in gainsaying that. We crossed an important Rubicon during the period of the Government which ran from 1973 to 1977, which Members opposite often wish to overlook. We started borrowing on a significant enough scale for the first time to meet current expenditure. Keynesian or neo-Keynesian policies were followed with vigour in 1977 and 1981 and, with the benefit of hindsight, we would perhaps say those policies should have been truncated earlier than they were. It is interesting to examine the period from 1977 to 1981. We started from a very low economic threshold and the objective was to reboot and re-launch the economy. Economic circumstances changed dramatically in the late 1970s with the wars in the Middle East and the activities of OPEC with a quadrupling of oil prices as well as near civil war on our northern Border. We tend to forget that when we revisit that time.</P>
    <P>By 1981 there was virtually universal acceptance in economic circles &ndash; Deputy Richard Bruton will bear me out on this &ndash; that the kind of expenditure we were engaged in was no longer sustainable and that we needed to cut back. In particular there was an acceptance that we could not continue to borrow simply to fund current expenditure. The reality is that the Government which was in office from 1982 and 1983 up to 1987 doubled the national debt, as Deputy Ahern has pointed out. The analysis, that accepted the Keynesian policies of trying to fund economic growth had failed, already existed in 1981, and was well accepted in the political community in 1982 and yet, when the parties now in Opposition controlled the economy in the period 1983 to 1987, they doubled the debt. That is a record of which they cannot be proud.</P>
    <P>It took another Fianna Fáil Minister to take the reigns in the Department of Finance and call a halt to the madness that existed. It was interesting to listen to Deputy Rabbitte's subjective analysis of the period. There was an extraordinary lack of generosity which we have grown to expect from <Col N="1535" /> Deputy Rabbitte because he does not recognise that if we had not taken control of our economy in 1987, the World Bank would have. The point has been made that we enjoyed a rate of borrowing that was on a par with impoverished Third World countries. The Irish economy was re-launched by courage from 1987 onwards. I well remember the period 1987 to 1989 when a minority Government that was trying to put the economy back on track was beaten time and time again, usually on Private Members' motions. The Opposition could if it wished have overturned the economic policies of that Government. It did not because of the foresight of one man who does not get enough recognition, the then leader of Fine Gael, and I am prepared to pay generous tribute to the Tallaght strategy.</P>
    <P>The Tallaght strategy would only have been a success if there was a Government with the courage in office to turn the economy around. That is why the announcements yesterday by the Fine Gael finance spokesperson, Deputy Jim Mitchell, and his comments in the newspapers bring a smile to my face.</P>
    <P>The political record in the more recent past is what we should judge politicians on. We should not judge them purely on rhetoric because everybody in this House intends to do their best but if one examines the record in relation to health, which will be a big issue until May, during the last Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition one will see it was a disaster, particularly when one recalls that Deputy Noonan was in charge. It brings a smile to my face and a chill to my heart to think that a person who had such a disastrous record on health could be in charge of the economy as a whole. Health spending increased by just £400 million to £2.5 billion in the period up to 1997, less than half its current level, and let us not forget that waiting lists increased during that period by 27%. Incredibly, the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition cut funding for the hospitals waiting list initiative in 1997 by 20%.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the record on social welfare because Deputy Rabbitte comes to this House and parades his ersatz socialism as he does on his Prime Time slots on RTE. While his party leader was Minister for Finance and his party president was in charge of social welfare, old age contributory pensions increased by only 9.9%. Child benefit increases of £1 and £5 were given in Deputy Quinn's budgets. Those increases compare miserably with increases of £25 and £30 in the last two Fianna Fáil budgets but the most derisory and insulting thing they did while in office was in 1995 when it gave old age pensioners a miserly £1.60 per week. That was the meanest act since the time many years ago when Fine Gael cut the old age pension. It is astonishing to sit here and see Deputy Rabbitte ascend the Everest of his own indignance and pomposity and discuss the economic record of this Government. The man voted to give pensioners £1.60. He should be <Col N="1536" /> thoroughly ashamed of himself, his party leader and his party president.</P>
    <P>The non-contributory pension has increased by almost 60%, from £67 to &euro;134, under Deputy McCreevy's budgets. The widows' and orphans' pensions have increased to &euro;144.80. Much has been achieved and much more needs to be done. We have entered into commitments which will be honoured by the next Fianna Fáil-led Administration.</P>
    <P>Another issue the Labour Party likes to address is housing. It was dealt with by the last two speakers but let us reiterate the record. Since 1997, a staggering 215,700 new homes have been completed. Last year over 5,000 local authority houses were either built or acquired, the largest number in 15 years. In Wicklow, we are undergoing the biggest programme for 30 years. Over 1,200 houses were completed by voluntary agencies. Under the last Fine Gael-Labour Party Administration, local authority housing output actually fell by 11% to a low of 2,632 houses. That Government's record was miserable and the misery of that record can only be appreciated when one looks at the final year. In 1997, the Government spent less that one third of the amount being spent by this Government on local authority housing in 2001.</P>
    <P>The health record also bears examination. The health budget has doubled to £8.2 billion during the term of office of this Administration. People will say it is not enough and others will say one can never have enough money for health. We need not just more funding but better management. Public transport is another issue which is being celebrated on the billboards but when one examines the track record of this Government, it makes that of the previous Administration pale into insignificance.</P>
    <P>The record of this Government is that it has achieved a level of employment never seen before. It has reformed the taxation system. Other parties have talked about it &ndash; Fine Gael had a strong commitment in this area but were not allowed to deliver by their partners in Government. This Government has delivered: it has reformed the taxation system, in particular personal taxation. It has improved public services and infrastructure, created the conditions for over 300,000 additional jobs to be created, shared the fruits of economic growth fairly throughout the economy, committed substantial amounts of money to social welfare, built the national pension reserve fund and created, through radical taxation measures, a sense of security into the future for pensioners. The Government has also significantly reduced the national debt. Our economy has grown, in GDP terms, by an annual average of almost 10%. Living standards, in <i>per capita </i>consumption terms, have risen by almost one third. Involuntary emigration is now virtually unknown. We are the envy of Europe because of economic policies masterminded by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and delivered by this Government. Involuntary immigration is now <Col N="1537" /> virtually unknown. We are currently the envy of Europe because of the economic policies masterminded by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and delivered by this Government.</P>

      <P>Five minutes will be plenty for me. Deputy Roche spoke about Ireland being the envy of Europe. We have an enviable economic record, a strong private sector and great growth in private sector employment, but we have a pathetic record in delivering serious public service reform. We are very like the American economy in the 1960s, which the economist John Kenneth Galbraith described as &ldquo;public squalor in the midst of private wealth&rdquo;. He painted a vivid image where streets were strewn with litter, people lay on hospital beds in accident and emergency wards, and children left school without basic literacy. We have created the same phenomenon. The Government is particularly guilty because it had an opportunity during five years of almost double digit growth, yet it failed to deliver public service reform or any serious improvement in public services to the people we are here to serve.</P>
      <P>The glib arrogance of the Government can be summed up in the statement of the Minister for Finance that now is the time to get out and party. That sort of frivolous arrogance has typified this Government's approach to public policy. We have serious problems in our economy and in public services, but far from reform we have had crude attempts by the Government to pay its way out of the problems we are facing. We will rue the day we took that approach. The disciplines of prudent public spending policies have clearly been abandoned, this year in particular. We have seen a 2000 surplus of &euro;3,000 million turned into a projected deficit for this year, and an even bigger deficit in the following two years. The epitaph of this Government will be that never has an Administration spent so much to achieve so little. Critical areas crucial to our economic competitiveness have been handled in a ham-fisted manner thus affecting businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte has described the problems we are facing in the telecommunications sector where, while we once enjoyed a lead, we now find our broadband access behind that of Mexico and Poland. There has been no serious reform of the public service which will be one of the negative bequests to the next Government. Benchmarking has been a sham; it is only a way of deferring public service pay increases to the next Government. There has been no serious reform of public service structures to match pay increases. One trade union leader described benchmarking as an <Col N="1538" /> ATM machine. The process is unreconstructed and unreformed with everyone doing as they always have done, yet expecting large public service settlements. At a time when we are facing into economic difficulties, that approach will leave the next Government to cope with far greater problems.</P>
    <P>It may have been party time for the close friends of the present Government but it certainly has not been for those involved in the daily struggle with the sort of public services that pass as adequate in this State. We now know that the health services are struggling close to breaking point. One third of nurses leave accident and emergency work every year because they cannot take the abuse and other difficulties they face there. These problems are now bubbling to the surface and there are belated attempts at reform. How arrogant it is for the Government to produce a ten-year strategy for health within two months of leaving office. It is a pathetic approach to managing serious public sector reform. Our health services need to be reformed, yet no such reform has been undertaken.</P>
    <P>The education system is another case in point. One out of every five children still leaves school without sitting the leaving certificate, and one out of six leaves school with serious literacy problems. There has been no reform of our education structures. We have the most centralised Department of Education and Science which is leaving teachers to struggle without technical support, and which does not even measure literacy standards. How can that pass for reform of a crucial area such as education which is the source of our future economic growth?</P>
    <P>Last week, I produced a report on traffic for the Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport. The Government's record in that regard is pathetic. The deficit of Dublin Bus has increased tenfold in the past five years and, despite increased spending, fewer passengers are using the service. We have no park and ride facilities, no integrated ticketing system, and no competition among bus companies, which was a darling issue for the Progressive Democrats of which the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, was formerly a member. In addition, we have no Dublin transport authority, no real time information, and public transport is losing its share of the market, falling from 30% to 25% during this Government's tenure in office. The Government has failed to bring about public service reform and that will be its epitaph.</P>

      <P>I thank my party colleagues for the opportunity to say a few words on the Government's failed economic policies. Agriculture has experienced serious problems, including BSE and foot and mouth disease, yet the Government has allowed the basic agricultural structures to become run down. In 1997, the last year of the rainbow Government, Deputy Yates held the post of Minister for Agriculture and about £104 million was paid out in agricultural <Col N="1539" /> grants for farm buildings and dairy hygiene. That was done with the support of Deputy De Rossa of Democratic Left who was highlighted by Fianna Fáil, in the run-up to the last general election, as having been the main problem of that Government. They are now questioning whether a new Government might be held back by the Greens, but what has the current Government done? It decreased grants for farm buildings and dairy hygiene from £104 million to £12 million last year. Is that inflation or deflation? It demonstrates the Government's lack of commitment to agriculture. In the same period, four agricultural colleges closed. The only agricultural target this Government will achieve is the suggestion by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, that there will be less than 20,000 full-time farmers by 2010. If Fianna Fáil remains in Government after the election that target will be reached and, in fact, there will be a lot less than 20,000 full-time farmers.</P>
      <P>The Government has failed on many agricultural issues, including live exports. The main issue I wish to discuss, however, is the peace dividend. We all supported, and to some degree were involved in, the negotiations to bring peace to Northern Ireland. We were assured that if that happened there would be a peace dividend for the Border regions. I remember walking across the floor of the House to the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, who, in fairness to him, gave me a commitment that some money would be made available for re-opening Border roads. What has happened in the last five years, however? There has been no restructuring of the N2 or N3, no gas pipeline and no broadband. Above all, in the health sector, Monaghan General Hospital has been almost completely ignored. A few patches may have been applied here and there but there has been no real commitment to restructuring the hospital. This Government will be remembered not for what it did in the Border regions, but for what it failed to do there.</P>
      <P>The Government could have achieved something with cross-Border bodies but did not do so. A cross-Border body was situated in Cork, not in Monaghan. The Government will certainly be remembered in the Border regions for its failed economic policies. We were guaranteed that, if we provided the wherewithal for three by-passes, money would not be an issue. However, we have not even received one such by-pass. That is a disgrace because, in the absence of rail lines, airports, etc., roads are the only means by which people in the area can travel. The Government's economic policy has failed.</P>
      <P>I apologise to Deputy Belton for interrupting him when he was commenting on the new gas pipeline. When one realises that Clara, County Offaly, will be connected to this new line, all one can say is that Ministers obviously count.</P>

      <P>I am my party's front bench spokesperson on regional development, a concept which is non-existent in the minds of the members of the Government. We have had unprecedented economic growth in the past five years. No country in the OECD has experienced such a high level of growth during that period. However, nothing has been done here to promote regional development. The country is creaking. The eastern seaboard is in a mess and there are no people living on the western seaboard. One does not need to be a genius to work out what must be done. There is a need for infrastructural development which, to date, has not occurred.</P>
      <P>Public expenditure has risen to 22% this year. Deputy McCreevy staked his reputation on being a Minister for Finance who would keep public spending under control. In the first two years of its term of office the Government managed to keep spending within the 4% limit it laid down. However, in the past two years or so it has gone completely out of control and has now reached 22%. The sad aspect is that no results have been achieved despite this high level of spending.</P>
      <P>I made a statement yesterday regarding the Bord Gáis announcement about the towns that will be connected to its new gas pipeline. I said the new natural gas pipeline has the fingerprints of Cabinet Ministers all over it, despite arguments from Bord Gáis that only commercial considerations were taken into account. That is not the way to run Government. Decisions of this sort should not be based on where Cabinet Ministers live. What is needed is a properly balanced regional development policy. However, the Government has failed to put one in place. I wish to highlight some examples of this failure.</P>
      <P>The first of these is the brain drain from the north-western region. A total of 85% of all second level educated children in Sligo and Leitrim proceed into third level education. When they graduate, only 7% obtain their first job in County Leitrim while only 12% obtain their first job is County Sligo. Up to 48% of these people obtain their first job in Dublin and will probably remain here for the remainder of their lives. There is no third level university in the north-west.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>Another mistake on the Government's part. Both regions should have such universities. Sligo is supposed to be a spatial growth centre and the Ministers for the Envir<Col N="1541" /> onment and Local Government and Marine and Natural Resources continually state that it will be connected to the natural gas grid. However, this has not happened despite the fact that money is available for it. With regard to the spatial strategy, the NRA made an announcement about the inner relief road in Sligo &ndash; the most vital item of infrastructural development necessary for that growing city &ndash; but no funding was provided for the project this year, despite the fact that only &euro;5 million is required.</P>
      <P>The Government has squandered the money from the economic boom. It had the greatest opportunity ever presented to an Administration to implement its policies in order to ensure that the country could benefit from balanced regional development, but failed to take it. I guarantee that Fine Gael, when in Government, will make a much better fist of matters, even though it will have less money to do so.</P>

      <P>All independent commentators agree the economy was in good shape when responsibility for it was handed over by the rainbow coalition led by Deputy John Bruton. A blind man could have steered the economy through its recent period of success. Regrettably, however, this inept Government was incapable of doing so. Following a period of unprecedented economic opportunity and growth, we are now faced with the fact that the wealth of the nation has disappeared. Everyone is asking what has happened.</P>
      <P>I was in the Chamber approximately 14 or 15 months ago when the Tánaiste stated that there was so much money in the Exchequer that the Government would have to accelerate its programmes of national development in order to spend it. At that time we had a surplus of billions. Only 12 months later the Minister for Finance was obliged to raid the social insurance fund to plug a leaking hole in the economy. However, he only told half of the story as £1 billion was not sufficient because the shortfall had risen to £2 billion. It is no longer a leaking hole, the economy is like a sieve. The great projects, programmes and policies that were previously mooted have now been placed on the long finger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in my possession a list of national schools in my area which are awaiting major refurbishment and extension works. The work on Butlersbridge national school, situated close to where I live, has been in the pipeline for five years but nothing has happened. The Department has been stalling on this project and all we have received is an insulting reply from the Minister, to which I will refer later. Refurbishment works are also required at St. Clare's school, Ballyjamesduff, and Lackan national school near Bellananagh, which is outside Cavan town, where the teachers are obliged to move desks away from the partitioning wall in case the glass falls out and injures the children. Outside this school, an area has had to be cordoned off to prevent children being hurt by glass falling out of windows. The <Col N="1542" /> teachers are obliged to plug holes with paper in order to keep the draught out. Work on this school has been in the pipeline for ten years but nothing has been done by successive Ministers.</P>
    <P>On the list to which I refer there are many other schools, such as St. Anne's in Bailieborough, which require refurbishment works and improvements. However, all that has been forthcoming is an insulting and stupid reply from the Department of Education and Science to the effect that &euro;153 million, a record level of funding, has been provided and demonstrates the Government's commitment. Where is that commitment if I alone can produce a list of schools that are in dire straits? If a child is injured in Lackan national school, the Minister will be held responsible.</P>
    <P>Work on the national roads programme has also been placed on the long finger. That is not good enough; it is not acceptable. I advise the Government, before it does any further real harm to the economy, to pull down the blinds, get out of office and let Fine Gael assume power. We have a proven track record, we have successfully managed the economy in the past and we will do so again. The people are waiting for honest, decent management and accountability. We will stand over what we do in Government. We will not, as the Tánaiste did this morning, stand there and waffle on. For a person who stakes her political reputation on her integrity, she let herself and her party down badly. However, she did not let the Government down because we expected nothing more of it and we got nothing less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's amendment asks us to note its sound and successful economic and budgetary policies. The vast majority of people know that while there has been prosperity in recent years, there has been no fairness. That prosperity has been limited to Ministers' constituencies. Ministers have shovelled millions of pounds into their constituencies to the detriment of other constituencies throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In the past 12 months there has been an increase of 22,800 on the dole queues. My constituency, Tipperary South, has experienced a significantly higher level of unemployment than the remainder of the country in recent years. The rate of unemployment in Tipperary town and Carrick-on-Suir is running at three or four times &ndash; between 12% to 15% &ndash; the national average. Unfortunately, both are listed as among the four most deprived towns in the country. In addition, a large part of Clonmel is listed in the deprived category in the recent RAPID report. In the past 12 months, unemployment levels in Carrick-on-Suir have increased by 12.5% and 1,000 people out of a population of 5,500 in the town are unemployed.</P>
      <P>The figure for Cahir is up by 10% over the past 12 months and the figure for Cashel is up by 13.4% in the past few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as south Tipperary is concerned, the Government has been a liability. It has promised <Col N="1543" /> decentralisation on four occasions over the past two years but that has not been delivered. Cahir has a housing waiting list of up to six years, with 120 people on the waiting list for this small town. There is no radiotherapy service in the region and cancer patients have to travel to Dublin or Cork on a regular basis, with consequent trauma to their families and themselves. As other speakers have said, our schools are awaiting extensions and refurbishment, right across the county from Mullinahone in the east to Annacarty and Mount Bruis in the west and many other places also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has shown that the essence of the problem lies in management and a complete lack of managerial competence at Government level in relation to the national development plan. It has now been revealed that the national roads programme is grinding to a halt as no new major road projects will commence this year. The Monasterevin bypass, the Ennis bypass, the Carrickmacross bypass, the Cashel bypass and the Sligo town relief road are at construction stage but there is no funding available to complete those projects. This reveals a total absence of forward planning across a range of Departments. As year three of the national development plan begins, there is an immediate need for an urgent review of all aspects of the national roads programme. The Government needs to put in place a management system and professional expertise capable of implementing the plan within the time scale. That is seriously lacking.</P>
      <P>The national development plan proposes to eliminate infrastructural deficit which is severely hindering Ireland's ambition to be a world class economy. Business and enterprise are suffering as a result of failure to meet the targets under the national development plan. This is one of many failures on the part of the Government. Essentially, we are suffering from systems failure and management failure. Our transport infrastructure is in a ramshackle state. The Kildare bypass will finish but the Monasterevin bypass will be years behind. The bottleneck is simply being shifted six miles down the road from Kildare to Monasterevin. I can tell the Minister of State, who perhaps does not use that road on a daily basis, that this has seriously hampered the enterprise expansion programme for the midlands and beyond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health service is a shambles. There are 850 schools in need of repair. One would be forgiven for thinking the Government had been penny-pinching in relation to public spending. As recently as 1999, gross current supply services spending amounted to less than &euro;20 billion. This year, the figure will be more than &euro;30 billion, an increase of 50% in three years or over 15% per annum on average. Over the same period, capital spending will have risen by almost 70%. Those are frightening rates of increase, with very little return. If those figures are sustained, big increases in tax rates will be required or else there <Col N="1544" /> will be a return to large scale Government borrowing. Either way, the growth potential of the economy would be fatally undermined and we would be plunged back into a fiscal crisis. That is a real danger and the Minister of State has some responsibility in that area. How can public spending grow so rapidly while the quality of many public services remains appallingly low and the quality of other services continues to deteriorate?</P>
    <P>Let the message be clear, the Government has presided over a massive rise in inflation, the highest in the Euro zone and twice the EU average. It has allowed an increase of &euro;13 billion per annum in current spending, which is totally out of line with commitments given in its manifesto. The economic reality is that the Government has gone completely off the rails. Meanwhile, the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, jobs are lost and public services continue to deteriorate. The blame for this massive failure clearly lies on the desks of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste. In essence, the Government has squandered the boom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mayo) Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins (</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Mayo</i>)<b>: </b>When the Government assumed office, following the rainbow Government, the Celtic tiger was rampant, its roar could be heard internationally and the prognosis for the future was exceedingly bright. Today, the Celtic tiger is well and truly back in its cage and its roar has been reduced to a purr. When the Government took over five years ago, we had a huge budget surplus, a huge surplus on our balance of trade, low inflation and massive foreign investment. I vividly recall sitting in Cabinet and having memoranda presented in relation to new industry coming into the country. There were two or three mega scale job announcements every week and home grown industry was thriving. Emigration had dried up and we now had immigration, with people seeking work permits, visas and, in the case of some who had been here for a number of years, Irish citizenship. We had a stable industrial relations climate. We had sorted out an industrial relations problem which had been one of the major obstructions to national growth and prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Celtic tiger has gone into the sand. In the past five years, we have had unprecedented industrial relations problems in sectors where they had not occurred before. We had the first national farmers' strike, when farmers were compelled to sit for weeks on end, heating themselves with tar barrels, trying to make their case in relation to cattle prices and to break up the cartel. We have had two national nurses' strikes, for the first time ever in the history of the State. For the first time ever the Garda Síochána, one of the cornerstones of democracy and the preservation of law and order, was forced to go on strike in what became infamously known as the &ldquo;blue flu&rdquo;. Secondary teachers went on strike last year and again this year there is a very inconvenient work to rule in place. In Aer Lingus, there have been strikes by pilots, cabin crews, ground staff, baggage handlers and caterers. Taxi <Col N="1545" /> drivers and train drivers were also on strike. In the public sector, which should be leading the way in terms of industrial relations, further strikes are threatened in search of their pound of flesh before the expiry of the Government.</P>
    <P>During the rainbow Government, there were job announcements every week. We are now losing 150 jobs every day, but the 25 to 50 job enterprises that are closing down, with devastating consequences for the employees, no longer make the headlines. We hear of job losses in the range of 200, 300 and 400 every day and there are no replacement jobs coming on stream. In the public sector, Aer Lingus has had to shed one third of its staff. Some 1,200 jobs have to go in An Post and 200 in RTE. In both the public and private sectors, jobs are being lost by the new time, without any replacement jobs. In reality, the bottom is fast falling out of this economy. Neither the infrastructure nor the forward planning are in place and the Government seems to act as if there was no tomorrow, as if we were riding on a magic carpet, as if the economy was on autopilot and as if management did not count. At the end of the day, management, foresight and planning are absolutely crucial.</P>
    <P>Nowhere has planning been more abjectly absent than in relation to the national development plan, a plan that has not delivered the infrastructure which this country so desperately needs. If we look at the revenue figures for the first two months we find them hopelessly behind target. If the revenue yield is as abysmal for the next four months as it has been for the past two months, the next Government may be forced to introduce a mini-budget. That would be the first time that happened since the former Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, took office in the period 1981-82.</P>
    <P>There is traffic chaos and there is an abysmal need in the areas of insurance and infrastructure. The verdict is that these have been five wasted years. The Government has blown the boom, the jury is out and will give its verdict in the next three months. I am convinced that the verdict will be one of guilty on the part of the Government in terms of performance.</P>

      <P>It is very sad to listen to the Opposition, in particular Fine Gael which is very much bereft of ideas, policies or any original thought process. God be with the days when their late colleague, the former Deputy John Kelly, came into the House to put forward a vision of what Fine Gael had in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether I agreed with him, at least he had vision, but all Fine Gael seems capable of now is carping from the sidelines and misrepresenting the facts. I am convinced the party is disappointed the economy is not in recession as that would suit it. If it could talk it into one that <Col N="1546" /> would certainly be an objective as it seems to be the only policy emerging from Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>The Government's record on management of the economy speaks for itself. Since 1997, about 300,000 new jobs have been created; unemployment has fallen dramatically, from 10.3% in 1997 to 3.9% last year; long-term unemployment has fallen from 5.6% in 1997 to 1.2% last year; involuntary emigration is no longer an issue; disposable income levels have risen substantially; social protection has been enhanced significantly; and the long-term public finances have been put on a more stable, sustainable footing.</P>
      <P>While it is true that economic growth slowed from mid-2001, this largely reflects factors outside our control. For instance, the moderation in growth reflected external factors, such as the slowdown in the US economy, the threat of foot and mouth disease, global difficulties in the IT sector and the terrorist attacks in the US. Despite the temporary set-back, the prospects for the Irish economy remain favourable and I am confident it will return to GDP growth rates of around 5% from next year onwards, which will still be by far the best in the OECD and certainly the best in the EU. This is a prospect which is the envy of our EU partners. However, nothing can be taken for granted. We must ensure that Ireland remains a competitive place in which to do business.</P>
      <P>Indeed, we are aiming to do even better. We are vastly improving the economy's infrastructure, encouraging investment and enterprise, and working hard to improve the regulatory framework within which business operates, as well as facilitating cost moderation through our commitment to social partnership. This year's budget was framed against the background of ensuring that the economy is in a position to benefit fully from the rebound in global economic activity. Indeed, on the basis of some indicators, there are signs that economic activity is already improving, most notably in the US. Developments there are particularly important from an Irish perspective, given that the US is the main source of foreign direct investment into Ireland, our second largest export destination and one of the main drivers of world economic conditions.</P>
      <P>As I outlined earlier, the Government has put the public finances on a more stable and sustainable footing. We have run budget surpluses during our time in office, the national debt has fallen substantially and is now the second lowest in the EU. We have significantly reformed the taxation system, particularly in the area of personal tax. All taxpayers have benefited substantially from the major tax reforms and tax reductions which the Government has introduced. The tax reductions have helped to cement the social partnership process, which has played an important role in our recent strong growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has substantially improved the country's stock of infrastructure, with major resources being committed to roads, public transport and housing. The first two years of the national development plan have seen a sustained <Col N="1547" /> roll-out of the infrastructure programme in terms of roads and public transport. The evidence of this is available throughout the country where large infrastructural projects are currently under way. In relation to social housing, over 5,000 local authority houses were completed or acquired last year, the highest level of output for over 15 years. The Government is also delivering on its promise to improve public services, most notably in relation to health, education and social inclusion. Between 1997 and 2002, we increased the gross allocation to the Department of Health and Children by over &euro;4.5 billion or 125%. Hospital waiting lists have been reduced by one fifth during the Government's term of office. The Government has also delivered in terms of investment in the area of education, where capital funding for building and refurbishing of schools has almost quadrupled since we came to office.</P>
    <P>We are strongly committed to social inclusion. The rates of social welfare, child benefit and old age contributory pension have been increased substantially during the Government's term. The facts speak for themselves. The latest figures from the Economic and Social Research Institute show that the level of consistent poverty continues to fall, to 6% of the population in 2000 from 15% in 1994. However, there are still challenges to be met and the Government is determined to build on the progress achieved.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future, the Government has moved to place the long-term public finances on a more stable footing by establishing the national pensions reserve fund. The aim of the fund is to smooth the Exchequer burden arising from the additional cost associated with the ageing of our population. By pursuing sound, consistent and clear economic policies, the Government has delivered the conditions which have created strong economic growth. This has generated large increases in employment, incomes and living standards for all, and will continue to do so into the future.</P>

      <P>The economy was destroyed by one manifesto in 1977 and it has taken us 20 years to recover from it. By means of the Tallaght strategy, which built on earlier efforts, the economy was turned around, but the Government is trying to wreck it again. I do not understand why the <Col N="1548" /> media is complicit in this. Why does it not highlight the fact that our public finances are hurtling out of control?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State did not refer to the fact that last year current spending went up by 22%. These are not our figures, they are the figures of the Minister for Finance. Income went up by 4% last year, which is a gap of 18%. This year the Government estimated in the budget that expenditure would go up this year by 12%. In February, having taken into account the developments up to the end of the year, the Department of Finance revised that to 14%. Yesterday the Minister of State, speaking on behalf of the Minister for Finance at the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service, said the figure is 14.4%.</P>
      <P>Growth of 14.4% this year on top of 22% last year will come to a compound of 39.6%, and that is if the Government meets its objectives. There has been almost a 40% increase in expenditure and to make matters worse, there is underspending on capital, implying that the percentage on the current side would be even higher. The Exchequer finances are hurtling out of control and we are heading for a crash unless something is done. The figures for January and February are much worse than the Government expected in terms of expenditure. Incomes rose by less than 4% in the first two months. If we add 22% for the first two months of this year on top of 22% from last year, we get close to a compound of 50%. There has not even been the slightest indication from the Minster of State that he understands the problem.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State used to be an honest speaker in the House. It is the type of politics that the Minister of State promoted earlier in his speech that brought this country to its knees. It involves a lack of honest, clear thinking. I appeal to Ministers to get their acts together and to put their national duty first, not squander the tremendous achievements of our country. That is what our document &ldquo;Just Economics&rdquo;, published on Wednesday, is about. It sets out a reasonable format for continued economic growth and for continued, well-managed growth in public services. We are not asking the Government to cut anything, we are simply asking it to stop increasing spending at an untenable rate. The scenario is like that of a car travelling down a motorway at 150 miles per hour. It is going to crash, whereas if it stuck to 70 or 80 miles per hour it would be doing very nicely. If the economy did that, it would continue to grow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael has set out the formula for the highest tenable growth in current expenditure, which is nominal growth plus 2%. Nominal growth pays for itself because that is the growth in the economy, being inflation plus real growth, and as most of the Government's commitments go to dealing with inflation, one has something left. One can, <Col N="1549" /> therefore, afford to spend a little more than nominal growth to improve public services. If one spends more than that one gets an inflationary scenario rather than one of output. Spending more allows things to grow too fast and one loses value for money, which is what is happening. If one is growing at anything like 22%, one is heading for a crash and one will cause an awful lot of damage and heartache. After the crash, one will have to impose taxes to make good the damage done and those taxes will, in turn, have a depressing effect on the economy, leading one into a vicious circle like that into which we got ourselves post-1977.</P>
    <P>That is the Exchequer reality at present. People say to us that we cannot realistically expect the Government to do anything with six or eight weeks to go to an election. I do not expect the Government to announce in blaring headlines in the newspapers that they have got things wrong. It is not going to do that, but in the interests of the country every Department should be told categorically that it is not to exceed expenditure as projected in the budget. Those targets at least must be adhered to. Regardless of the election, it should not entertain or permit growth in expenditure which exceeds what was provided for in the budget. What was provided for in the budget was 12% and that can be lived with under the Fine Gael formula because we expect growth of 3.5% this year while inflation will be 4.5%. That is 8% and 2% on top of that comes to 10%. We could get away with 12% for this year, but already spending has climbed to 14.4%. Given what we saw in the figures for January and February it is going south and that is not a nice legacy to leave to an incoming Government after the tremendous time we have enjoyed over the past seven or eight years. In fact, we have enjoyed tremendous years since 1987, as the economy began to turn in 1985, so I appeal to the Minister and the Government to take such steps as are necessary to ensure that, at the least, the budget projections are not exceeded. That is not unreasonable. It would mean coming back from the present projection of 14.4% to 12%.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see Deputy McDowell in the House as I heard him go out of his way to criticise me on radio recently. He thinks it is right wing and conservative to manage one's finances well. The reason a Labour-Fine Gael Government has never been re-elected is that there is a perception that we do not manage things well, even though that is not true. The perception is that there is an urge to spend, regardless of whether we have the money. There is lots of money to spend and there will continue to be. Under our projections there will be &euro;11.5 billion in today's money to spend every year from 2006 onwards and there are lots of things that can be done with that money, but if we spend more than that we will crash and cause inflation. If we get inflation we will not get value for money and if we spend twice what we project will be available, as the Government did last year and may do this year given the figures for January <Col N="1550" /> and February, we will be heading for serious trouble.</P>
    <P>The Government is spending &euro;13 billion more per year than when it came into office and if the original budget figures are adhered to, there is an underlying deficit of about &euro;1.1 billion. Chicanery with the books has permitted the forecast of a nominal surplus of &euro;170 million, but that will not be there given the figures for the first two months of the year. Bloxham Stockbrokers and another economic commentators are now saying that there will be a minimum real deficit of &euro;1 billion this year, which is on the conservative side, unless there is corrective action.</P>
    <P>The Government is projecting a deficit next year of &euro;3 billion, assuming we keep to our budget targets this year, and for the year after next it is already projecting a deficit of &euro;3.8 billion. I highlight the fact that when this Government took office in 1997 it continued with the good economic management of the previous Administration into 1998 and 1999. I pay tribute to Deputy Quinn who, as Minister for Finance, managed public moneys to provide significant growth in expenditure and improvements in public services at a rate which was less than the growth in income. That meant we could afford what we spent while reducing the national debt, which was still a serious problem five years ago. This Government continued with that pattern during the first half of its tenure and it managed the Exchequer very well. It did the same thing Deputy Quinn and Deputy John Bruton did whereby the growth in expenditure was significant, but was less than the growth in income. Overall, Exchequer and national finances were much better and the national debt was much less.</P>
    <P>In 2000, 2001 and this year, assuming the budget projections are adhered to, the Government will have allowed expenditure to grow by £7.9 billion more than income and that cannot be sustained. That is the Government's own figure. The growth over the five years of the Government's term of office has been £13 billion anyway and if one allows expenditure to grow to £7.9 billion more than income in three years one is in serious trouble. That represents overspending of approximately £2.6 billion each year. One could get away with that for one year, but one cannot continue to do it. There is a very, very serious problem and, as the House will know, once one gets on a trajectory of spending it is as difficult to change course as it is to turn a ship at sea quickly. Things can go wrong very quickly.</P>
    <P>I compared the current scenario to that which pertained in 1977. The Government that year was returned by the greatest majority ever, but within two years it ruined the economy. Within two years the Government was hammered in the local and European elections and a couple of months later it was beaten in two by-elections, whereupon Jack Lynch was thrown out for wrecking the economy with one bad manifesto, which is what is happening again here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" />It is the duty of the Opposition to point out that there is scope for significant growth in public expenditure. There is also great need for it. Despite the already huge expenditure, there is much deprivation. Children in school are waiting ten years for orthodontic treatment. They are not getting their assessments. Nearly 20% of primary school students are leaving school with no assessments and with avoidable learning difficulties. There is also the example of the widow living on £96 per week and who cannot afford to get her hair done, the disabled who cannot get out and <Col N="1552" /> about because they do not have personal assistants and the person on &euro;130 per week who does not have a medical card. Can the Minister explain this?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>3.&ndash;Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the Minister shall not make an order appointing a day to be the appointed day for the purposes of this Act until legislation has been enacted providing for &ndash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>(a) </i>comprehensive accountability of the Commission and other public enterprise regulators to the Minister and to Dáil Éireann, and</P>
      <P>

      <P>We had what could be described as a major debate on this issue on Committee Stage. I thought it would be correct to table the amendment again on Report Stage. The Bill should not proceed beyond this point because we have not thought it through. I am not blaming the Minister in particular in that regard, but the House has not thought through the effect of transferring authority from the House and the Minister, who is accountable, to regulators who are I feel are not accountable. We have not got the capacity to make them accountable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>As Deputy Stagg said, we divested a huge amount of our own powers of scrutiny and the powers of Parliament to agencies that are absolutely unaccountable. While, on the surface, the principle of regulation is good in terms of ensuring a fair, open and competitive marketplace, we have given away all our responsibility in respect of our overview and oversight functions and the absolute necessity for people to be accountable in respect of their actions.</P>
      <P>We have three regulators. We have the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and we had the experience, rather early on in the term of office of Ms Doyle, of her refusing to come before a committee of this House when asked to do so. She did so only after a great deal of persuasive arm twisting. Ultimately, when regulators come here, they come here as a matter of courtesy.</P>
      <P>We had the Commission for Electricity Regulation &ndash; CER. This Bill will extend the powers, scope and remit of the regulator, Mr. Tom Reeves. Again, when Mr. Reeves comes before the committee of the House to answer, as he is obliged to do, he does so as a matter of courtesy and he is not open to the powers of persuasion or any kind of amendment that we may put forward in respect of policy issues.</P>
      <P>Mr. Bill Prasifka is in charge of looking after the management of the whole airline sector. When the Aviation Regulation Bill was passing through this House, we predicted that a major problem would arise in respect of how airport charges would be fixed. Both the Labour Party and Fine Gael tabled amendments and proposed, supported and justified them very doggedly. We said a major problem would arise in regard to airport charges and we were proven right. For some reason, best known to himself, the regulator for the aviation sector has decided to pitch the airport charges for Cork and Shannon airports at ridiculously high levels way above those being charged for Dublin airport. It is manifestly wrong and unjustifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a throughput of 14 million passengers per year in Dublin airport. The prediction is that it will blossom by another 5 million to 6 million in the next three to four years, bringing the throughput to 20 million. The figure relating to Shannon airport is 2 million and that relating to Cork airport is 1 million. How anybody can justify pitching the charges for Dublin airport, which has a huge volume of passengers and is barely able to cope with the capacity, at a lower rate than those in Shannon and Cork airports is questionable. Shannon airport was hit hugely by the events of 11 September and the misfortunes of Aer Lingus. To pitch the charges of that airport at <Col N="1555" /> a scale much higher than Dublin airport is beyond comprehension.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>What Deputy Stagg said is correct. There is a need to look at the legislation and the next Government will have to do so. We have given away far too much power to the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Roads Authority and the regulators I have instanced here in the House. Deputy Stagg has a very strong case. The matter will certainly have to be revisited by the next Government, whatever the composition of that Government may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>I empathise with what Deputies Stagg and Jim Higgins have said, particularly with regard to giving away our powers in this House. I do not think there are many colleagues in the House who would disagree with those sentiments. Deputy Stagg, who tabled this amendment, articulated those points very forcefully and at length on Committee Stage. My problem is that the amendment before us would have the effect of delaying the coming into effect of the provisions of this Bill for a considerable time, perhaps indefinitely. I have already explained the reasons for the urgency in introducing the Bill at this time.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the amendment is an appropriate way to address the issues being raised. The removal of any possible conflict between the Minister's role as regulator and shareholder in Bord Gáis Éireann has to be achieved. The establishment of independent regulation achieves this, while at the same time promoting confidence in the market. That latter point is important.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's amendment addresses two general issues &ndash; accountability of the commission and other regulators and the State's shareholding in Bord Gáis and other State-owned utilities. These issues are far broader than the scope of this Bill. This Bill is not the appropriate forum for dealing with them.</P>
      <P>This Bill seeks to deal with matters that need to be addressed urgently and expeditiously. The framework established by this Bill and the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, ensures adequate and effective accountability on the part of the commission. This accountability is achieved by the obligations on the commission in regard to the publication of its annual report, the audit of its annual accounts by the Comptroller and Auditor General and its ability to answer to the appropriate Oireachtas committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues raised by Deputy Stagg, supported by Deputy Jim Higgins, ought to be dealt with in a fashion that addresses in a general way and simultaneously the regulatory frameworks for all sectors, as well as other related issues such as the proper resourcing of Oireachtas committees. I am <Col N="1556" /> aware of the reservations that exist in regard to certain aspects of the consultation on regulatory reform recently initiated by the Taoiseach. I am of the firm view that this is the correct forum in which to address these matters.</P>
    <P>On the question of shareholding, the idea being put forward of having a public holding company that would act as shareholder of all State utilities is interesting. I certainly agree with Deputy Stagg in that regard. However, the effect of the proposed amendment in delaying the transfer of regulatory responsibility for the gas sector to the commission until such time as this holding company is set up is problematic. The delay would only have the effect of continuing in existence the conflict of interest between the Minister's function as regulator of the gas sector and shareholder of Bord Gáis that this Bill is designed to address. For those reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the amendment before the House, during the earlier stages of this Bill I spoke about my disappointment regarding what we are allowing to happen in this House. The Minister of State will agree that the degree to which power is being taken from this House and therefore from the people is alarming. I am taken aback by what we are allowing to happen. No sane government would allow so much power to be removed from the parliament. Ms Etain Doyle is the regulator of telecommunications, Mr. Tom Reeves is the regulator of electricity, Mr. Bill Praviska is the regulator of aviation and Mr. Michael Tobin is chief executive of the National Roads Authority. I have attended a number of meetings on the question of roads where the people asked their public representatives to make sure a fair balance is struck when new roads are built. When a public representative or an election candidate is forced to admit he or she has no power in this regard the people begin to wonder if they are living in a democracy.</P>
      <P>Ms Etain Doyle was asked to appear before a committee of this House. She eventually came, but very reluctantly. The power of the House, which comes from the people, is vested in the Department and the Department must continue to have some say.</P>
      <P>The Government is proceeding with the new national stadium. The money being spent on Sports Campus Ireland amounts to a monumental mess and is costing the taxpayers a fortune. Today's proceedings of the Committee of Public Accounts is even more laughable. The Tánaiste has said no decision will be made on the so-called Bertie Bowl until after the next general election. If the Tánaiste and Taoiseach return to power&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach wants two Bertie Bowls the Tánaiste will willingly agree. Power is <Col N="1557" /> being taken away from the representatives of the people. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation may say corners were cut or that a certain individual lacked caution but a debate on this matter is not allowed in the House.</P>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Stagg said recently with regard to the regulator of electricity. Decisions are already being made by Bord Gáis with regard to the areas to be served but I presume the regulator will make such decisions in the future. For a long time I have campaigned for a gas supply to Birr, Tullamore, Clara, Portlaoise, Portarlington and Edenderry in counties Offaly and Laois. Bord Gáis has announced it will provide gas in Clara and Tullamore, and I welcome this. However, if the Minister retained power I would be able, in the future, to go to his office and to make a case on behalf of a particular town. Public representatives and the people they represent could, after carrying out the necessary research, make such representations but it is unlikely such representations could be made to a regulator. The people and their representatives will be kept at arm's length. Our letters will receive a standard acknowledgement stating their contents have been noted we will await replies <i>in saecula saeculorum.</i>What is happening is wrong. The Minister should retain the power to make decisions. I hope the next Minister and his officials will ensure gas is provided, not alone in Clara and Tullamore but also in Birr, Edenderry and Portarlington. There have been major job losses in Birr and I am particularly interested in the provision of a gas pipeline or spur to that town. I call on the Minister to provide that.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Stagg said is common sense. I fully agree with him and I support his amendment.</P>

      <P>I sense empathy, sympathy and almost support for my proposal to hold off from doing any more until we have thought through matters. We are rushing like lemmings over a cliff and it will be too late to reverse if we do not call a halt now. I am satisfied the Minister is accountable within the democratic system and I am not satisfied the regulator, to whom we have transferred the Minister's power, will be so accountable until we have given this matter more consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State says he is taken with the idea of a holding company holding the shares of State companies. This is very interesting and I am delighted to hear it. If that were done the Minister could remain as regulator because there would be no conflict and this Bill, which transfers <Col N="1558" /> the power given to us by the people out of this House, would not be necessary.</P>

    <P>(7) Where a member of the Commission fails to make a disclosure in accordance with this section the Minister shall decide the appropriate action (including removal from office) to be taken.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage to put in place a code of ethics for anyone connected with decision making in the gas sector. Where people are in decision making positions it is important that a standard of ethics be set down and accepted by such people, whether advisers, consultants, members of the commission or its staff.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes that the commission, following consultation with the Minister for Public Enterprise, shall draw up a code of conduct in respect of the control of the interests of staff members to ensure a proper ethical standard is applied by the people concerned. This would apply to staff, members, advisers and consultants of the commission. They would be required to make a statement giving a full declaration of their interests. If there were a change in their interests, they would amend the statement. The statement and any amendments should be made public. The form should be agreed between the commission, the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister for Finance. Where a person to whom subparagraph (1) applies failed to make a declaration in accordance with that subparagraph, specific penalties would be put in place.</P>
    <P>The amendment also sets out what would be regarded as declaratory interest. Such a declaration must be made where the person holds shares in, bonds or debentures of, or other like investments, where such holdings are in excess of &euro;10,000, in any undertaking related to the gas or electricity industries because the regulator will have charge of both. If a directorship or a shadow directorship was held even within the previous <Col N="1561" /> two years, a declaration should be made to that effect. Where there were benefits in kind, for example, holidays, gift vouchers, transport provided etc., to a value in excess of &euro;500 a declaration should be made. If there was a pecuniary interest or other beneficial interest, which would be material to a decision by the commission, again a declaration should be made. Attempting to have an influence on a decision would be addressed by the fact that a person would have to make a declaration of interest to the commission and would have to give a guarantee not to seek to influence a decision. If a decision was being made the person involved who had a possible beneficial interest should withdraw from the meeting.</P>
    <P>It would not only apply to the staff members, members of the commission, consultants or advisers, but also to members of their households who would have any possible beneficial interest. That is why I tabled this amendment. I thank the Minister of State for accepting the spirit of my amendment on Committee Stage. The Bill as amended on Committee Stage contains section 9 covering declaration of interest. That gives effect to the spirit of what I proposed. As I said on Committee Stage, I was at a loss to know why this matter was not addressed in the original text of the Bill. It seems glaringly obvious that disclosure of interest has to be of fundamental importance to ensure everything is transparent and above board. I rest my case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already discussed these issues. The matters covered by this amendment are fully dealt with in sections 8, 9 and 10 of the Bill, which deal with a code of conduct, declaration of interest and disclosure of interest. Having examined in detail the text proposed by Deputy Higgins and his colleague, Deputy Stanton, I put forward my proposal on Committee Stage, which met the spirit of what he proposed. This is now incorporated into the body of the Bill.</P>
      <P>While this provision largely mirrors that tabled by the Deputies, there are a number of improvements. These relate to the reporting relationship between members of the commission and the Minister on the one hand and members of the commission and staff of the commission on the other. They also relate to the publication of declarations of interest. Sections 8, 9 and 10 of the Bill have been written so that they are more in line with existing provisions contained in legislation already in force, for instance those contained in the Aviation Regulation Act, 2001. Sections 9(5), 9(6), 10(6) and 10(7) make it clear that where there is a breach of rules regarding the declaration or disclosure of interest by a member of the commission staff, or a consultant or adviser employed by the commission, it is the duty of the commission, not of the Minister, to take appropriate action. In the case of a breach of the rules by a member of the commission it is up to the Minister to decide what action to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1562" />Section 9(4)(<i>a</i>) ensures that the declarations of interest of members of the commission are published in the proper forum, that is, in the annual report submitted by the commission to the Minister, which is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I again thank Deputy Higgins and his colleague Deputy Stanton for making their very useful proposal. While I cannot accept the text they proposed, I am sure Deputy Higgins will agree that all the issues he has sought to have addressed are now being dealt with in the Bill.</P>

        <b>: </b>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>d</i>) by the substitution for subsection (5) of the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(5) In the exercise of its functions under this Act and without prejudice to subsections (3) and (4), the Commission shall encourage and secure adequate energy supply in the interests of all users in a manner that promotes economic efficiency and gives the maximum benefit to users and in doing so shall have regard to&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)the need to ensure a satisfactory supply of gas and electricity for users and in particular the need to take account of the needs of rural customers, the disadvantaged and the elderly,</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) the need to stimulate a competitive market in the provision of gas and electricity,</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>) the need to take account of the protection of the environment,</P>
      <P>(<i>d</i>) the need to encourage the efficient use and production of energy,</P>
      <P>(<i>e</i>) the need to encourage research and development into&ndash;</P>
      <P>(i) methods of generating electricity energy using renewable, sustainable and alternative forms of energy and combined heat and power; and</P>
      <P>(ii) methods of increasing efficiency in the use and production of energy;</P>
      <P>(<i>f</i>) the need to require that the system operator gives priority to generating stations using renewable, sustainable or alternative energy sources when selecting generating stations,</P>
      <P>(<i>g</i>) the need to co-operate with regulatory authorities in other Member States,</P>
      <P>(<i>h</i>) the principles of non-discrimination (including equal access) and proportionality, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(<i>i</i>) the need to impose, maintain and develop public service obligations in accord<Col N="1563" /> ance with <i>section 20</i> of the <i>Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act, 2002</i>.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 6 essentially deals with the functions of the commission, which are to advise the Minister on the development of the electricity and gas industries, as appropriate, and on the exercise of the functions of the Minister under this Act. The Minister and the commission will ensure that they exercise their powers in a manner which, in relation to electricity, does not discriminate unfairly between holders of licences, authorisations and the board or between applicants for authorisations or licences.</P>
    <P>In relation to gas the same principles apply that there should be no discrimination unfairly between holders of licences, consents and Bord Gáis or between other applicants for consents or licences, and the Minister or the commission, as the case may be, protects the interests of final customers of electricity or gas or both, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>The functions are listed as follows: to promote safety and efficiency on the part of electricity and natural gas undertakings; to promote the continuity, security and quality of supplies of electricity; to promote the use of renewable, sustainable or alternative forms of energy; to secure that there is sufficient capacity in the natural gas system to enable reasonable expectations of demand to be met; and to secure the continuity, security and quality of supplies of natural gas. That list of requirements seems to be rather threadbare and my amendment seeks to add considerably to it. There is need to ensure satisfactory supply of gas and electricity for users and in particular to take account of the needs of rural customers, the disadvantaged and the elderly. That should be inserted even though it is in the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999.</P>
    <P>I point to the need to stimulate a competitive market in the provision of gas and electricity. This should be clearly stated in the Bill because the whole basis for regulation is to ensure there is competition, the marketplace is opened up and everything is seen to be fair, above board, transparent and equitable.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The numbers of redundancies notified to my Department in 2000 and 2001 were 13,316 and 19,828, respectively. In the months of January and February 2002 a total of 4,025 redundancies were notified. With regard to anticipated job losses, one indicator of this is the number of collective redundancies notified to my Department under the Protection of Employment Act, 1977. These are the numbers of employees that companies have indicated they propose to make redundant after the statutory minimum notification period of 30 days. A total of 2,217 collective redundancies was notified in the first two months of 2002.</P>
      <P>I share the disappointment of Members about the number of job losses in recent months at locations throughout the country and I recognise their impact on the lives of workers and their families. In attempting to devise a comprehensive response to these developments, it is necessary that we understand and address the underlying causes giving rise to difficulties. It is standard procedure that, where we become aware that certain companies are experiencing competitive difficulties or where major job losses are likely, the full services of the agencies of my Department are made available to work closely with the companies involved in addressing the difficulties arising and to provide whatever assistance possible to the workers affected.</P>
      <P>It was inevitable that Ireland would be affected by the current worldwide economic downturn, the most severe slowdown since the 1973-74 oil price shock. The information and communications technology sector has been especially hard hit by the recent downturn, with a loss of more than 200,000 jobs worldwide in 2001. The manufacturing component of the ICT industry represents about 10% of Ireland's GDP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also necessary to see recent job losses in the context of our recent record level of job creation. The number of people in employment has increased dramatically in the life of the Government. The latest quarterly national household survey shows that, in November 2001, 1.75 million people were at work compared with 1.38 million in April 1997, an increase of 370,000. While the record breaking levels of job creation of the late 1990s have ended, overall economic prospects are encouraging. According to preliminary statistics, more than 29,000 new jobs were created in IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development supported companies during 2001. <Col N="1565" /> This was a strong performance considering the state of the global economy. In any comparison with other European economies, the economy still performs well.</P>
    <P>While there is still uncertainty about the short-term, economists forecast that a recovery in the global economy will be under way later this year. As a result of the policies this Government has pursued and continues to pursue, the fundamentals necessary for Ireland to take advantage of this recovery are in place. It is necessary, however, that we continue to address those factors which impact on our competitiveness in areas such as the cost environment for enterprise, infrastructure, education and training, and research and development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that the position has become serious and that, almost every day, we are greeted in the news with job losses or warnings about them. Some 4,000 job losses have already been posted this year and only job losses in their hundreds attract national publicity.</P>
      <P>With specific reference to recent changes in the Industrial Development Authority practices and promises and commitments supported by the Government that 50% of new starts would be in the Border, midlands and western region, will the Minister report progress on the number of IDA supported jobs in this region in the past nine months?</P>
      <P>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the recent difficulties and slowing down of the economy &ndash; many economists have said it is over &ndash; this economy continues to be the best performing economy in Europe. We will experience growth at between 4% and 5% this year. To put that in context, approximately 1% of the workforce became redundant last year; in the late 1980s and early 1990s we had redundancies at an annual rate of more than 2.5% of the workforce. We are losing too many jobs but relatively speaking we are not losing as many as we were losing a decade or so ago.</P>
      <P>In the midlands in particular, the number of people in employment has increased by 16% since this Government took office. The rate of unemployment has decreased by 56%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister supply the House with a little supportive evidence for her proposition that the downturn is over? Will she tell the House on what she basis a growth level of 4% to 5% for the current year? There is no growth at the moment. What basis have we for assuming that it will reach 5% in a full year? Is the Tánaiste saying that because more people are at work now it is not too bad to have a ratio of 1% of them being made redundant as compared to 2% in the bad days of deep recession? Will she tell the House whether the early monitoring unit still exists in her Department and if so, in what work is it engaged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1566" />
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The growth forecasts are not mine alone, they have been made by many independent commentators such as Mr. Colin Hunt and Dan McLoughlin. Mr. Hunt, an economist with Goodbody Stockbrokers, in recent commentary said the recent recession is over. It is also evident in the forecasts from IBEC and other companies for the remainder of this year, including the Pipeline from the IDA. Although things are not as they were a couple of years ago &ndash; I do not wish to fuel false expectations &ndash; companies are beginning to expand their operations.</P>
      <P>I accept that every redundancy is bad news. Nobody wants to see any worker being made redundant. We have seen an unusually high number of redundancies in what I would broadly call the traditional sector, particularly in Wexford, Cork and Tullamore. Although the jobs in Tullamore were of recent origin that company decided to make its workers redundant when it lost a single contract from Dell in Limerick. It is often the case that some of our companies have a single source for their supply base and when that contract is lost, we lose jobs. The challenge is for us to seek to find areas where workers can be up-skilled for sustainable jobs in Ireland. Some of the decisions being made are affected by what is happening to the economies in the Czech Republic, Mexico, Morocco and Central and Eastern Europe which is now becoming increasingly attractive for FTI. Where wage levels are much lower, we have to make up the gap with a higher skills base, greater productivity, greater use of technology and so on. That is the challenge. I accept it is a major challenge to find new skill-sets for older workers who have been accustomed to doing a particular job for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with much of what the Tánaiste has said but I put it to her that there is a real failure of management involved in this and that there is no forward planning at Government level to deal with the type of infrastructural deficit which exists or the bottlenecks that are restrictive to industrial and commercial development and that that is the real problem? For example, the national spatial strategy and the national development plan have fallen behind simply because there is no proper management system or structure at Government level.</P>
      <P>The Minister cited difficulties with wages and pressures from Eastern Europe. I put it to her that that is only half the story and the other half of the story relates to costs. Costs for industry and commerce are ever increasing. The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy, could tell the Minister about the increases in insurance and transport costs. Fuel initiatives, promised to business by this Government, remain unfulfilled. Costs are rising at an enormous level giving rise to the type of pressures which result in redundancies. This is happening as a result of the failure of management, failure of planning and no clear thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that costs are rising <Col N="1567" /> at an alarming rate in some respects. Wage levels for some sectors have risen enormously in recent years. That is why the strategies are focusing on tax reductions as a way of increasing take-home pay. The social partnership model has delivered unprecedented prosperity to workers generally, way beyond what would have been achieved had we been in a period of free bargaining.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Flanagan that the infrastructural deficit is a cause of great concern. I accept that. We have set up a Cabinet sub-committee chaired by the Taoiseach. We have made some progress but progress has been too slow in many respects. Everybody acknowledges that. We have to find a way of encouraging greater private sector involvement in the development of our infrastructure because with private sector involvement comes private sector speed and perhaps private sector efficiencies. Telecommunications is, perhaps, the most important piece of infrastructure. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, recently announced the Government's intention to roll out broadband to 19 towns. Over the next couple of years a number of other towns will also be given the necessary broadband infrastructure to ensure they can compete for key investment, whether foreign or Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether the Minister replied to my question regarding the early warning unit. Is the Department in consultation with any companies who anticipate problems down the line?</P>
      <P>The Minister quoted one or two economists and one could quote one or two back to her. One of the more prestigious stockbroking firms say growth will be approximately 1.5%. With job losses at a rate of almost 1,000 a week over four months, one does not have to have good arithmetic to know what they would be in a full year if the trend were to continue. I would like the Tánaiste to assure the House that she has some tangible evidence that it is not likely to continue at that rate? Deputy Richard Bruton referred earlier to the real danger of our reverting to public squalor in the midst of private wealth. Some of the job losses are focused on certain areas. There is regional imbalance involved. They are being shaken out for more traditional industries and the prospect of them being replaced is so slim that the picture is not a very happy one. The gap between those at work and those threatened with redundancy is widening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The early warning unit continues to exist in my Department. However, as I said before, no early warning system can detect if a board meeting in the United States makes a decision to close its Irish operation. We are, from time to time concerned about particular companies. Even in the very good days when we were generating a substantial number of new jobs each week, there were always companies in difficulty. That is a fact. Some companies go under even <Col N="1568" /> in buoyant times. They are not competitive and cannot survive. That is why it is important that we remain focused on competitiveness.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the age profile of many of the people losing their jobs. Generally speaking, younger people even where they have a low skill level, are perhaps more adaptable and inclined to avail of training options and acquiring a new set of skills. The situation is much more difficult for older workers in regional locations. That is the concern and the challenge. To have balanced regional development, it is important to have infrastructure in place so that we can get key investment in those smaller locations.</P>

      <askee>Tánaiste</askee>
      <Quest>and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment if she is satisfied that, under the company law code, the true identity and beneficial ownership of companies trading here may remain secret, unidentified and unidentifiable; and the proposed changes she has in mind in this regard.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 125 of the Companies Act, 1963, a company is required to file, once at least every year, an annual return with the Companies Registration Office. This return must include a list of the past and current members of the company and details of the number of shares held by each member. Section 123 of the Companies Act, 1963, provides that the identity of the persons entered in the register of members kept by the company and as notified to the registrar of companies must be the legal owners of the shares and not the beneficial owners where these are different from the legal owners.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these provisions is to create legal certainty for a company in its dealings with the registered owner of the shares and means that the company is able to treat the registered shareholder as owner of the shares for all purposes without regard to any contract or agreement that may exist between the legal owner and third parties.</P>
      <P>There is a legal requirement, under section 59 of the Companies Act, 1990, for the beneficial interest in a company's shares to be disclosed by a company's directors, including shadow directors, and by the company secretary. This information must be recorded in a separate register kept for that purpose by the company and be publicly available. Failure to so disclose is an offence. There is, however, no provision under company law for the disclosure of interests by a third party where the third party is not a director, shadow director or secretary of a company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 14 and 15 of the Companies Act, 1990, empower the Director of Corporate Enforcement to investigate and inquire into the ownership of a company, while section 16 empowers the director to impose restrictions on the transfer of shares where he encounters difficulty in his inquiries being made pursuant to sections 14 and 15. Fur<Col N="1569" /> thermore, the beneficial interest in shares may be required to be disclosed on foot of a court order under section 98 of the Companies Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>It is important that the legislative provisions relating to the ownership of shares be re-examined. Accordingly, I have requested the company law review group to examine the whole area of shares and share capital as a priority topic in its current work programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the earlier part of the Minister's reply, there is a real problem which I hope will be addressed by way of legislative reform. The point to which I refer is topical in so far as the State deals with or approves certain contracts with certain companies that are unidentifiable. This is of great importance in the context of the current debate over the national aquatic centre. How could it be possible for the Government to approve a contract with a company the beneficial ownership of which is actually unknown and, worse than that, unidentifiable?</P>
      <P>I refer the Minister to another case that is in the news concerning the Jackson Way company. Does the Minister consider it desirable and satisfactory that the State could be engaged in a lucrative compensation deal with a company the beneficial ownership of which we do not know? In spite of the various sections of the Companies Act to which she referred, it appears there is no way of tracing the labyrinthine connections of many of these offshore companies. There must be a public interest argument for lifting the veil of secrecy surrounding such companies, particularly in cases where the State is involved. I have cited the examples of Waterworld UK and Jackson Way. Given the legislative base to which the Minister referred, why is it not possible for the State to determine with whom it is dealing? It is a banana republic type of situation.</P>

      <P>The problem that Deputy Flanagan outlined is one facing countries around the world. I know of no country that has a set of laws whereby such difficulties can be dealt with quickly. Even here, where we have had various inquiries with full court powers, it has on occasion been difficult to establish who the beneficial owners might be. Due to the deficiencies of the law in this area, the company law review group is now operating on a statutory basis and has just presented its first report. We recently agreed the second programme with the group which includes examining the issues of shares, securities and related matters, including beneficial ownership. Where there are deficiencies in the law, they must be rectified. It would be wrong of us to assume, however, that the type of problems outlined by Deputy Flanagan can always be resolved satisfactorily.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the legal proceedings to which Deputy Rabbitte is referring and also of the fact that one of the parties concerned was willing to accept, for the purpose of those proceedings, that he controlled the Master Meats Group in 1987.</P>
      <P>I take it the Deputy is referring to a merger notified to the Minister on 14 September 1988 under the Mergers Act, relating to the acquisition by Master Meats Anstalt, a Liechtenstein company, of Mr. Pascal Phelan's 50% shareholding in Master Meats. In the 1988 notification it was stated that the acquiring company was backed by &ldquo;Middle Eastern interests&rdquo; but no further information was given as to the principals behind the company. The proposal was cleared by the then Minister that same day.</P>
      <P>It subsequently came to light that Mr. Phelan's business partner, Mr. Taher, had previously sold his 50% stake in Master Meats to another Liechtenstein company, Taros Anstalt, in April 1987. It also emerged that the shareholders of Taros Anstalt were Mr. Schneider, Mr. Mansur and Mr. Hardman and that negotiations on their behalf were conducted by Mr. Larry Goodman.</P>
      <P>The take over of Master Meats and related issues was the subject of an investigation by the Fair Trade Commission in 1989. In giving evidence to the commission, Mr. Goodman stated that he was not a beneficial owner of shares in Master Meats and that the Minister had been made aware of the identities of the three shareholders before the 1988 transaction was notified. However, my Department has no record of any meetings between the Minister and Mr. Goodman in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more recent history regarding these matters is that on 14 November 2000, Mr. Paschal <Col N="1571" /> Phelan initiated proceedings in the High Court against Mr. Goodman and Mr. Taher claiming a conspiracy to force him out of the company. During a preliminary court hearing Mr. Phelan's lawyers lodged a notice of motion for discovery of certain documents held by my Department relating to the 1988 notification. Mr. Goodman's counsel then said he would be willing to assist the court in accepting, for the purpose of those proceedings, that Mr. Goodman controlled the Master Meats Group in 1987. I am concerned about the implications of this matter and my officials are taking legal advice as to what further action should be taken.</P>

      <P>According to Mr. Goodman's evidence to the Fair Trade Commission, he said &ndash; I am quoting from memory &ndash;&ldquo;I didn't own it. I never owned it and I can put my hand on my heart and say that.&rdquo; On that basis, the beef tribunal did not consider the matter of Master Meats, despite claims to the contrary in this House by myself and a number of other Deputies. On the basis of her reply, the Minister now agrees that it transpires that Mr. Goodman did own and control Master Meats. Was the evidence given to the Fair Trade Commission sworn evidence and, if so, will her Department be taking any action in that regard? In terms of a breach of the relevant Mergers and Monopolies Act, does the Minister have any advice from her Department concerning the feasibility of its taking appropriate action at this late stage? Will the State be initiating action to recover at least part of the huge sums of taxpayers' money paid to Mr. Goodman to discharge his fees at the beef tribunal?</P>

      <P>I understand it is not clear that the evidence to which the Deputy refers was given on oath. With regard to the other matters, if false information was given in the context of a merger, that merger could be made null and void. We are discussing something that happened 14 years ago and, therefore, I am not sure about the legal implications. That is why we are awaiting advice from the Attorney General. We were advised, during the proceedings, that we were not free to become involved in this matter. We were awaiting the outcome of those proceedings which concluded a month or so ago. Since then my officials have been examining the matter and consulting with the Attorney General's office in relation to the legal implications that now arise. Given that what was said during the court case is contrary to what emerged when the Fair Trade Commission examined this matter, it is my opinion that a number of serious issues now arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies. EU law prevents the Department and I from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of the risks insurance companies are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on the provision of cover based on their assessment of the particular risk involved.</P>
      <P>The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors, both domestic and international, to explain these increases, including the high cost of settling claims, the general reduction in investment returns, recent court decisions regarding the calculation of compensation losses in personal injury cases and the effects of the 11 September attacks in the United States. Representations being made to me suggest that many businesses seek insurance cover from sources outside Ireland. Availability from these sources has contracted, as capacity in the international market has been impaired following the events of 11 September last.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by businesses in getting cover, even at very high premiums. I am again arranging to meet the Irish Insurance Federation and representatives of the main insurers here to discuss these difficulties. I will be encouraging them to develop, in consultation with their clients, innovative strategies for controlling risk. It is my hope that such strategies will contribute to a moderation of prices. Meanwhile, I await the final report of the interdepartmental implementation group, which was set up to progress the establishment of the personal injuries assessment board, PIAB, in order to ensure that the latter may be set up as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, I received a briefing from the chairperson, backed up with a proposed final draft of the report, last week. I noted the progress made, and the chair's plans to bring the matter to a speedy conclusion. The board met on Thursday last and formally ratified the final text. The report has now been sent for printing. I will be pleased to personally send the two Opposition spokespersons concerned a copy of the report, as printed, as soon as it becomes available.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Minister of State that his actions in this area have been quite poor and that his record during the Government's term of office &ndash; a period which is thankfully coming to an end &ndash; illustrate this. A colleague has brought to my attention a renewal notice from Quinn Direct Insurance Company in respect of a Volkswagen Golf valued at &euro;1,270. The company quoted a new annual premium of &euro;7,258.69 in respect of third party, fire and theft cover. What has the Minister of State to say about that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that Quinn Direct is quoting because many insurance companies are not issuing quotes and a number of such companies have gone to the wall. There is a crisis in the worldwide insurance industry and the major players within it, particularly the macro-intermediaries, have a crucial role to play going forward. In my opinion they will respond to sectoral opportunities in the next year or two.</P>
      <P>I fully accept that the premium to which the Deputy referred is astronomical. Car motor insurance is mandatory in Ireland and we are obliged to pay out in respect of a huge number of claims. I put it to the Deputy that of the &euro;800 million paid out in claims last year, over 40% was paid by the insurance companies in lawyers' fees. We all have a serious responsibility to address that issue and I hope I will have the Deputy's support as I try to tackle it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>On 6 March 2002, the US Administration announced its decision to impose new restrictions on imports of certain steel products into the United States. The application of section 201 &ndash; safeguard measures &ndash; on these steel products, by way of an additional tariffs on some products of up to 30%, will enter into force on 20 March and will last for three years, with some lessening of the tariff increases in the second and third years.</P>
      <P>The European Commission regards these measures as incompatible with US obligations under World Trade Organisation rules and has initiated appropriate action under the WTO process. In addition, the European Commission and EU member states are currently considering the possibility of other actions in response to the US announcement. In particular, the adoption of measures to address the possibility of sudden significant increases in imports into the EU following the imposition of increased US tariffs, is being considered. Following these deliberations, the final scope and nature of the measures to be taken by the EU will in large part determine the impact and outcome of this issue.</P>
      <P>Ireland considers it vitally important that every effort must continue to be made to resolve this matter through consultation. We also consider it essential that any action contemplated by the EU be fully in conformity with WTO rules.</P>

Does that statement imply that, from an Irish perspective, nothing will happen in this regard? Following the ISPAT situation, the Irish steel industry is past tense and the Government had to pick up the tab in the aftermath. I understand that that company made a generous donation to the British Government for its general election campaign. In the context of the world trade talks, does the Minister of State agree it is most extraordinary that President Bush could act in total disregard of reciprocal trade between the US and Europe? Why is this tariff for three years rather than three months? In relation to the statement by the Mini<Col N="1575" /> ster for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is our economy really in such a bad state that even a small row would damage it?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy has recognised, Ireland is not a steel producing country but rather a user. In a European context, the countries most affected would be Germany, the UK and France, which have large steel industries. In taking this action, I presume Mr. Bush has an eye to the congressional elections at the end of the year. The whole basis of the WTO is that it is a rules-based organisation. The EU has set its strategy in place and has made various proposals. One such proposal is the idea of a safeguard measure to ensure there will not be a flood of steel imports into the EU, which has to protect its own position. There is very specific structure in place for us to use in this context and the whole process will take some time.</P>

Having picked on steel as an electioneering factor to enhance his chances in the November elections, with such major implications for European trade, is it not possible he may pick some other product range which would involve similar repercussions?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 13 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>Independent Insurance Company Limited, IICL, is a UK authorised insurer, currently in provisional liquidation. The liquidation process will be dealt with under UK law. With regard to Irish policyholders of IICL, the Department has been in contact with the provisional liquidators of IICL and has sought information from them on a number of matters, including the amount of premiums paid to IICL, the overall value of claims made and details in relation to claims still outstanding against companies. Information has been received from them, most of it only in the very recent past and the Department is currently examining it in detail. It is not clear at this stage if the information is complete or whether it can be relied on to give the full picture. Indeed, it may be extremely difficult to obtain final comprehensive information in view of the timescale that can be involved in claims actually being made and in settlement amounts being arrived at subsequently.</P>
      <P>The Department has also been in contact with the UK insurance supervisory authority, the Financial Services Commission, and with the UK Treasury Department in relation to our concerns regarding Irish policyholders with IICL. Irish policyholders with claims outstanding against IICL are creditors of that insurance company and should pursue their case with the provisional liquidators. I am aware that some Irish businesses are facing difficulties as a result of the failure of IICL on 17 June last and I would be very concerned that any jobs would be lost as a result. However, I do not consider it acceptable to continue to burden Irish taxpayers with the inevitable cost that would be involved in meeting insurance claims resulting from the failure of another insurance company which is registered in another country.</P>

      <P>I am not ruling anything in or out. The situation pertaining to jobs is a matter for the State agencies and for the directors and investors in a particular company. This case relates to an insurance company registered in another country. It went into liquidation last June and the serious fraud office in the United Kingdom is currently carrying out a major investigation. In the past, Irish taxpayers have bailed out two registered Irish insurance companies. Since 1984, the supervisory regime in the Department has been able to manage the insurance industry, particularly the companies registered in Ireland, to avoid difficulty. We have done that in a very careful manner. It is a very complex area and we have come through some very serious difficulties in doing that job. I am very proud of the record of the Department, including the insurance, supervisory and provincial units within it. At this stage, it would be unfair to expect taxpayers to fund another insurance company, particularly one registered outside Ireland.</P>

Apart from describing the horror involved for people who lost their premia and had to go out into the marketplace at greater cost, having regard to the scale of difficulty being caused for small companies and to what the Minister of State described as a worldwide crisis in insurance that is now threatening employment, is he doing anything about this?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte said that I have come into the House for a number of years with the same story. This issue did not arise until last June so I could not have had the story before <Col N="1578" /> that time. I have answered this question for the Deputy before and if he insists on repeating the question, he must surely allow me to repeat my answer. As to what action I have taken, the collapse occurred on a bank holiday in June, we were notified the following day and I had consultations within the Department on the following day. Two days after the collapse, on a Wednesday, there were threats to major companies in this country which could not continue to trade due to the risks involved in the absence of insurance cover. In very strenuous negotiations, over 48 hours, between various sectors of industry and the Irish Insurance Federation, we were able to persuade the federation to provide alternative rapid cover for these companies in order to protect them and their employment. Some of these companies had left Irish insurers previously and had paid premiums for up to three years in advance to the company that is currently in liquidation. I am very pleased we were able to get alternative cover as quickly as we did.</P>
      <P>There is a demand being placed on the Government and on me as the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to refund the premiums that were paid forward and underwrite the liabilities that may accumulate as a result of claims against companies who were insured by IICL. I have met the various sectoral professional organisations and told them I want hard information. To date I have received very little information and, until I do, I cannot arrive at a conclusion. I can assure the House that I am doing my best in a difficult situation.</P>

      <P>We were seeking details regarding the financial situation pertaining to the company, its liquid resources, fixed assets, liabilities and what the expected outcome might be. We successfully negotiated a deal whereby policy holders, particularly motor policy holders who had claims pending would be looked after. We have not been able to negotiate for commercial policy holders but they will be eligible as creditors for whatever percentage of claims that the liquidator may eventually pay from the companies' assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question was asked by Deputy Rabbitte or Deputy Belton regarding the situation in the EU. Immediately on the collapse of this company the senior team from the insurance division of the Department met with the European Commission. The records show that when the third European directive was being put forward in 1994, this country was the only one to object to the directive on the basis that it did not have the full force <Col N="1579" /> of law across the EU. We were assured by the Commission and by the other member states that they were satisfied it had. As a result of the collapse of Independent Insurance Company Limited, it is now accepted by all that Ireland was right on that occasion. That is not much consolation but at least we have been assured that the matter will be rectified in the next directive that will come forward.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State outlined the action he took in the wake of the collapse of Independent Insurance Company Limited and I commend him for that, but I am afraid he is missing the point. There are many small companies who either cannot get insurance at all in the market place or who are paying inordinately high premiums to get insurance. What is the Minister of State doing about that?</P>
      <P>I am not inquiring about the actions he took immediately in the wake of the collapse. I commend him for that, but that was nine months ago and premiums are coming up for renewal. Companies lost their premiums and went out into the market place to get new ones and now are faced with savagely high quotes or, in some cases, they cannot get cover at all for certain kinds of activity. What is the Minister of State with responsibility for this area doing about it?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We have worked very hard in this area. There is only one company in the world providing commercial insurance cover. That monopoly is creating a major problem as the company appears to have a &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; attitude. I heard of a case where there was a fleet to be covered and a call was made to the insurance company headquarters in the United States and the investment manager offered two options, yes or no. It is as serious as that. To try to rectify that situation we have looked at the sectors and niche areas. We are trying to group the different sectors in an effort to create an alternative opportunity to provide cover through the insurance industry in a different way. It is complex and will take time to resolve. If I had the solutions I would be <Col N="1581" /> delighted to outline them, and if other people have them I would like to meet them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 30, 49 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>In the absence of State enforced price control, movements relating to prices of goods and services are an ongoing aspect of the market economy. I am aware of reports of increases in the price of some goods and services in the recent past. I am also aware that some prices have fallen, for example, public transport costs.</P>
      <P>The official consumer price index and relative inflation figures published by the Central Statistics Office do not support suggestions that there were widespread, or excessive, increases in prices during the period of the changeover to the euro.</P>
      <P>The latest figures published by the Central Statistics Office for the month of February this year record that annual inflation has fallen to 4.7%, down from 4.9% in January last. The rate of increase in consumer prices recorded this February was 0.7%, compared to 0.9% in February 2001.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence to suggest that the rates of increase in prices during the period of the changeover are any greater than would otherwise have been anticipated. However, I have asked Forfás, as part of the study I have commissioned on price differentials among euro zone countries, to analyse consumer price inflation figures for 2001 and 2002 and to assess whether or not it is possible to attribute price changes in that period to the introduction of the euro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1582" />I have contended for some time that the introduction of the euro should not, of itself, have required any trader to increase prices. However, it can be legitimate and justifiable for suppliers of goods and services to increase prices as a consequence of increased costs. In this sensitive time of transition it is in their trading interests to invest some time and effort in explaining the rationale for any such increases. Equally, I urge consumers to be assertive in seeking explanations for price increases they feel are unjustified and they should exercise the power to take their business elsewhere if they are not satisfied with the explanations provided.</P>
    <P>While I have seen reports of the survey undertaken by the Consumers' Association of Ireland, I am not aware of the methodology employed or the survey techniques used to conduct it. The findings of this survey have been given high visibility, but it is not possible to scientifically sustain some of its conclusions on upward price movements. Such conclusions cannot exclusively be attributed to the introduction of the euro as the study maintains. In addition, the consumer price index for this year records some comparative prices decreasing while the study suggests the opposite. I am disposed to rely on the official findings of the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he has commissioned Forfás to analyse consumer price inflation. Has he received a report yet and is Forfás commissioned to conduct this analysis on an ongoing basis? When does the Minister expect to hear from Forfás? Why did the Minister ask Forfás to do the job and was there any other organisation he could have asked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked Forfás to carry out this work because it has a very good reputation for carrying out research, which most Members of the House will appreciate. PricewaterhouseCoopers has been selected to undertake this study on behalf of Forfás. There are two dimensions to the study. One is comparative pricing among countries in the euro zone and the other is an examination of any price rises which took place in the changeover period. I expect a report before the end of April. It will be good, solid work which will be of use to the next Government and in that sense it will be ongoing.</P>
      <P>The study will be scientifically produced and all Members of the House will I hope, appreciate that it is necessary to do this work. Many surveys have been carried out by newspapers and other media as well as by the Consumers' Association of Ireland, to which the Government has provided some funding, but we need scientifically conducted research and that is what this study aims to provide. I hope it will be of help to whomever is involved in the next Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that it is not fair to make price comparisons across Europe as there are different start-up costs <Col N="1583" /> and price surveys may be carried out by unscientific means? Such surveys do not accurately reflect the differential in prices across the euro zone. In light of the fact that restaurant owners and publicans in Dublin have been highly criticised for price increases, has the Minister of State met the Vintners Federation of Ireland and the Restaurants Association of Ireland to discuss this matter with them and to get their reactions? Such criticism can be unfair as, by and large, retailers have operated according to the code of conduct established by the Minister prior to the euro changeover. I speak as a retailer. Based on the inquiries of his Department, in what areas has the Minister of State found the greatest price increases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>The evidence produced by the Consumers' Association of Ireland has given it cause for concern in relation to medical fees and prices charged by restaurants and public houses. Some of the prices referred to in the CAI's report are not recorded in the consumer price index.</P>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's point regarding the detailed work being done. If Deputies are anxious to obtain further information, I refer them to the answers to Questions Nos. 25 and 26, which we may not get to in the Chamber. They refer to the Forfás study. I described the detailed terms of reference, one of which is to discuss fully the factors that determine and influence price differentials, in particular differences in incomes, wage costs, input costs, taxation regulations, logistics and levels of competition. The Deputy is right about this being a very complex area and it is necessary to make the terms of reference quite extensive. There are actually five are six terms of reference.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned public houses and restaurants and, for some time, I have been expressing concerns about those areas. While I have introduced a price freeze in the past, I have ruled out such an approach in this instance. The Deputy's suggestion of contact with the Vintners Federation of Ireland and the Restaurants Association of Ireland is one that I am considering.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 15, 17, 18 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has been reviewing how the operation of the statutory redundancy scheme could be made simpler and more efficient. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions and SIPTU have developed proposals to enhance the levels of payments made under the scheme. I met the ICTU on 6 March last and its proposals were outlined to me. I am currently consulting the other social partners &ndash; the employers &ndash; and I will bring proposals to Government next week for a comprehensive review of the scheme by a group representing employers, unions and the relevant Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the Redundancy Payments Acts are in urgent need of revision given the resurgence in the scale of redundancy, which we addressed at the outset of this question time? Does she agree that a half week's pay per year of service for workers under 41 is paltry compensation for losing one's job? It is far out of line with good practice as freely negotiated by employers and trades unions and the law needs to be brought into line with something approximating average good practice.</P>
      <P>The Minister will know of a company about which she and I have had discussions where workers were made redundant and are awaiting their minimum statutory entitlements from the fund. That entitlement, of one half week's pay per year of service, plus one week, for those under 41, will have to be discharged by the Exchequer. If one is over 41 one is entitled to one week's pay per year of service plus a week on top. That is a miserable, paltry severance for any worker confronted with the trauma of losing his or her employment. Does the Minister not consider it time to give statutory support to average, decent settlements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The redundancy payments legislation has been under review since last summer. <Col N="1585" /> This matter falls within what are broadly termed &ldquo;the social partnership agreements&rdquo; because those do not just deal with levels of pay, but with many other aspects of how employees are remunerated. I accept that it is the case that someone who is totally reliant on statutory redundancy, particularly someone on low wages, gets a paltry sum. The aim is to avoid redundancies where possible as no compensation compensates for the loss of a job, particularly for an employee in the 40 to 50 age group. Thankfully, most of those made redundant are paid compensation far above the statutory minimum and five or six weeks pay has not been unusual in recent times.</P>
      <P>The Government has made changes in this area and last year it increased the weekly ceiling from £300 to £400, which came into effect on 1 April last. In the recent budget we hugely increased the tax-free element of redundancy payments. There was a once-off tax-free allowance available to those who were made redundant once. We are now experiencing situations where people have been made redundant for a second time and, in certain circumstances, a person can get &euro;20,000 tax free.</P>
      <P>However, the issue of the rate of remuneration has to be dealt with in the context of discussions with the social partners. The reason is that although statutory redundancy is paid out of the social insurance fund, the employers are refunded 60% and must carry the other 40%. We are trying to keep costs down and to remain competitive, as we discussed in the context of an earlier question, so any increase in the weekly rate has implications for the cost of employment and for competitiveness. Any change can only be made on the basis of agreement. After next week's approval by the Government, I hope to put the review group in place to report within the next couple of months. It will have to run alongside a successor to PPF.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to reforming the redundancy Acts and the amount of payment, will the Minister accept that as well as dealing with payment it might also be important and prudent to deal with training and up-skilling Perhaps the changes could include training and up-skilling courses and the provision of State aid in this regard to ensure replacement employment. Second, in cases where companies default in meeting the statutory redundancy entitlement &ndash; I suspect it is a small number &ndash; and those companies have parent companies abroad, is there a system or mutual arrangement which allows the State to recoup from a parent company in another jurisdiction, particularly in the EU, any amount paid from the social insurance fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the answer to that question; I will have to check it. Obviously, where the employer for whatever reason does not meet the payment, it is paid from the fund by the State. Deputy Rabbitte mentioned the age differential. In some areas we need to examine if the age dif<Col N="1586" /> ferential is still relevant. I presume the age differential was introduced because it was more difficult in the past, and that might still be the case, for people over 40 years of age to get another job. Those people, therefore, were given an additional half week on top of the bonus week to provide a higher sum because of their more difficult circumstances. We need to examine if that is still relevant.</P>
      <P>There is also the age limit of 66 years and the qualification period of two years continuous employment. The unions have raised that issue and have asked that the qualification period be one year. There are also issues relating to employees abroad and the multiple of the weekly amount in terms of whether it should be a half week, one week or more. There are a number of other reforms required, I understand, in the technical way the scheme is administered. There is need for greater simplification in the administration of the redundancy payment scheme and that has to be part of any reform package.</P>
      <P>It comes down to this &ndash; at a time when there are pressures in the economy, such as the pressures we are experiencing at present, do we, in response to that pressure, increase the statutory entitlement? If we do, does it mean employees who would up to now get a great deal more than the statutory requirement might get less? In other words, if we were to increase the statutory requirement, will that reduce the amount that is paid by some employers at present? These are issues which need to be addressed in the context of agreement.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister indicate, on the basis of her formal meetings with IBEC and the employers and any informal contacts she might have with IBEC, what the employers are saying about this? The employers do not have a vested interest in the lowest common denominator disadvantaging workers in this fashion, where workers have to resort to the fund or where they are dependent solely on statutory redundancy, which is such a paltry amount. Have the employers given any indication, in the discussions that have taken place so far, of their attitudes to these questions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to admit that my contacts are informal but not with the person the Deputy suspects. I have not had a formal meeting with IBEC on this matter but I have spoken to the Director General informally about it. The employers make two points. First, they say there are enormous pressures at present. Wage costs are rising to a high level in the economy. Sixty per cent of the amount is refunded from the social insurance fund but 40% is carried by the employer. There are many cases where a relatively small group of employees might be made redundant to make the company competitive but 40% of the cost of that redundancy has to be carried by the employer during a time of pressure. They suggest that if we increase the amount that <Col N="1587" /> has to be paid, we will put further pressure on that employer and, perhaps, cause more people to be made redundant.</P>
      <P>They also say that any increase or change, such as that suggested by ICTU, is outside the PPF agreement, particularly part 1.3 of that agreement in relation to workplace relations and work environment. They strongly make the point that these are matters which should more appropriately be discussed in the context of a successor to the PPF, not as a parallel unilateral matter that could be decided between two of the parties to the social partnership, that is, the Government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. They believe it is central to the partnership process and that any change would have to come in the context of other matters being discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 20 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>Sixteen investigations into company law related matters have been initiated by me since I came into office. In respect of three of these, on an application by me, the High Court appointed inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990. These three inquiries are continuing. I am not in a position to say when the reports of the High Court inspectors will be completed or published in any of these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One investigation under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990 was completed in 1998. The report on this has been passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Eleven investigations were initiated under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990. Four of these have been concluded. Of the <Col N="1588" /> four investigations completed, two of the reports were passed to the DPP. The file in one case was returned and a number of summary prosecutions have since been successfully concluded. One report provided an input into the successful application to the High Court for the appointment of inspectors under section 8 while the fourth report was passed to the relevant High Court inspectors.</P>
    <P>Five investigations under section 19 are ongoing. Reports in respect of two of these are at an advanced stage of completion, with the remaining three reports expected to be completed during the course of 2002. Two investigations were held up in legal appeals; certain legal matters are still outstanding. It is a matter for the Director of Corporate Enforcement to decide how to proceed on these latter investigations.</P>
    <P>One investigation was undertaken under section 59 of the Insurance Act, 1989. This report has been completed and referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions as well as to the inspectors undertaking the section 8 investigation into that company.</P>
    <P>The costs incurred since 1997 on company investigations initiated by or on behalf of my Department currently amount to &euro;8.267 million. This amount does not include the salary costs of Civil Service staff working on a number of these investigations. Similarly, the major proportion of the legal costs relating to the investigations is being borne by the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor. Most of this &euro;8.267 million derives from the costs to date of the High Court inspectors appointed under section 8, that is, the NIB/NIBFS which is &euro;4.5 million and Ansbacher, which is &euro;2.5 million.</P>
    <P>The question of recovering costs from the section 8 investigations does not arise until the inspectors have completed their investigations. Section 19 as originally enacted did not provide for recouping costs. This has now changed with the enactment of the Company Law Enforcement Act, 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief, although it has to be said this is the last opportunity in this Dáil that we will have to seek information on this matter from the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. In 1997, she came into office waving this flag quite overtly and vigorously. Five years later, could she quantify her legacy in terms of achieving what she said she would achieve on the occasion of her initial announcements. Particularly in the Ansbacher cases, does she now concede that the long awaited report will not be published before the dissolution of this House? Specifically on consequent action on the publication of the report, whenever that might be, <Col N="1589" /> does she envisage a major problem with prosecution due to the statute of limitations?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Flanagan, the recent changes in company law mean that prosecutions can be forthcoming. It is no longer the case that one must detect the wrongful behaviour within three years of it occurring &ndash; that restriction has now been lifted.</P>
      <P>On the legacy, if he wants to call it that, I did not come into office claiming to do all these things. I did not anticipate that I would be involved in so many inquiries. They all flowed from the McCracken report, which did not come to hand until the autumn of 1997, and one inquiry led to another.</P>
      <P>The more important legacy is that there are now procedures in place. The company law has been radically reformed and there is a new independent officer, the Director of Corporate Enforcement. The resources applied to this area have been greatly enhanced with appropriate staff &ndash; accountants, lawyers and members of the Garda Síochána. Instead of one and a half officials being responsible for enforcing the law in this area, there is now a properly resourced office.</P>
      <P>The Company Registration Office has been working extremely efficiently and effectively. To his credit, Deputy Rabbitte provided the change in resources for that office. Most people would recognise that it is performing with such success that it is often the source of great complaint from companies that they must fulfil the most basic requirement.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Rabbitte, I am not aware of the source of that article. I understand it was quoting Revenue sources. The list which came to light in my inquiries included about 120 names. I am aware that additional names were added to that but I have no evidence to suggest it exceeds 600, which, I think, was the content of the story on Monday. I do not have that information.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P Just="Center">In page 6, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;(<i>d</i>) by the substitution for subsection (5) of the following subsections:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&lsquo;(5) In the exercise of its functions under this Act and without prejudice to subsections (3) and (4), the Commission shall encourage and secure adequate energy supply in the interests of all users in a manner that promotes economic efficiency and gives the maximum benefit to users and in doing so shall have regard to&ndash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>(a) </i>the need to ensure a satisfactory supply of gas and electricity for users and in particular the need to take account of <Col N="1591" /> the needs of rural customers, the disadvantaged and the elderly,</P>

    <P Just="Center">(<i>i</i>) the need to impose, maintain and develop public service obligations in accordance with <i>section 20</i> of the <i>Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act, 2002</i>.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;(Deputy Higgins, <i>Mayo</i>).</P>
    <P>Mr. Higgins <i>(Mayo)</i><b>: </b>The purpose of section 6, and the amendment which I want to attach thereto, is to set out the functions of the commission. The functions set out in the Bill, as I pointed out, are rather Spartan and extremely threadbare. Earlier I was making the point that the purpose of regulation is to stimulate a competitive market in the provision of gas and electricity, and that that has not happened. It certainly has not happened in the electricity sector, where many companies, which came in with great enthusiasm and appetite, have walked away from the market because the opening of the market simply has not happened. The experience has been the same in the telecoms sector and in the gas sector the experience has been no different.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am trying to expand the functions of the commission. They need to stimulate a competitive market in the provision of gas and electricity; to ensure a satisfactory supply of gas and electricity for users and in particular to take account of the needs of rural customers, the disadvantaged and the elderly; to take account of the protection of the environment; to encourage the efficient use and production of energy; and to encourage research and development into (a) <Col N="1592" /> methods of generating electricity energy using renewable, sustainable and alternative forms of energy and combined heat and power, and (b) methods of increasing efficiency in the use and production of energy.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that there is huge potential to develop sustainable energy and we have not realised it. For example, we have not got into the wave power sector at all. It is recognised that the potential of wave power is enormous. It is available off our coastline, it is ready to be harnessed and yet it has not happened.</P>
    <P>While there have been the AER III and AER V programmes in the area of wind energy, at the same time the Minister still has not given out the licences. We have been very slow into the field and tardy in determining the conditions. At the end of the day we do not have anything like the yield from wind power which we could have.</P>
    <P>The development of combined heat and power has been extremely slow. This sector generates only a very small percentage of our power.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides that the commission shall have regard to the need to require that the system operator gives priority to generating stations using renewable, sustainable or alternative energy sources when selecting generating stations, and the need to co-operate with regulatory authorities in other member states. It is important that we would work, liaise and co-ordinate with other member states. The amendment also provides that the commission shall have regard to the principles of non-discrimination, including equal access, and proportionality, which is a fundamental principle of regulation and the need to impose, maintain and develop public service obligations in accordance with section 20 of the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act, 2002.</P>
    <P>The amendment has to do with how the power should be distributed and who should get the power. Yesterday many people were amazed when for the first time, other than an indication that the Corrib gas would go to Letterkenny via Ballina and Sligo, they heard an announcement to the effect that on the east-west pipeline Enfield would get the gas. I pass through Enfield twice a week and sometimes three times a week. Tullamore, Clara, Athlone, Ballinasloe and Oranmore are getting the gas. It is no coincidence that Enfield happens to be in the constituency of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. It is no coincidence that Clara and Tullamore happen to be in the constituency of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is no coincidence that Athlone happens to be the home town in the constituency of the Minister for Public Enterprise. It is no coincidence that Ballinasloe and Oranmore happen to be in the constituency of another senior Minister. It is no coincidence that all of these are catchment areas in constituencies of senior Ministers. Nevertheless, we have been only able to extract positive commitments in respect of other towns along the Corrib line. In Mayo, for example, all we have is a definitive <Col N="1593" /> statement on the gas going via Ballina. We have had no indication that Ballina itself will get the gas. These decisions are being made on an arbitrary basis without any planning.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister of State this morning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;. When he was questioned by the interviewer, I heard him say clearly and categorically that no representations were made to him by any of the Ministers involved. Was he approached at any stage by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, or his senior Minister, the Minister for Public Enterprise? We have said, and it is quite obvious, that there are ministerial fingerprints all over yesterday's announcement.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State says the decision was made entirely by An Bord Gáis, but I have asked him clearly and categorically to clarify if any of the aforementioned Ministers approached him in regard to having access to the gas pipeline for the towns in question. In terms of the east-west pipeline, will the gas be Corrib gas? In other words, will it be flowing from the west to the east or from the east to the west, because a gas pipeline is not a dual carriageway &ndash; it either goes one way or the other? Does it mean that by the time Mayo gets the gas, it will have gone around the entire country.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister offer clarification on the very specific questions I have asked about the very contentious announcement yesterday? I have no problem whatsoever with towns being included, but what is needed is a comprehensive plan, a definitive statement and a clear indication at this stage as to what the official thinking is on who will get the gas in the short term. The Minister of State spoke about a short term strategy and a long term strategy. What we need is a final strategy. We need a clear, definitive statement and we need to know exactly what towns will be included. We know where the pipelines are, where they will be and what the plans are, but we want to know what towns are included at this stage.</P>

      <P>This morning on the Order of Business I asked the Tánaiste a question on the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Bill. I know the Ceann Comhairle ruled me out of order but, unfortunately for the Tánaiste, she will have to answer the question tomorrow when she goes to Longford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins, asked the Minister of State if he was lobbied by some Ministers as regards the destination of the pipeline. Was he lobbied by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in respect of bringing the gas line to Longford, because both of those men gave commitments when they were in Longford, the Taoiseach three weeks ago and the Minister for Finance one week ago? The Minister for Foreign Affairs was there about six or seven weeks ago and he gave a commitment that the gas would <Col N="1594" /> come, but he obviously had Clara and Tullamore in mind. He was not thinking about Longford.</P>
    <P>The Bakerloo line in London was one of the first underground lines. It differs to modern underground lines because it was inter-crossed. It was laid to suit the stations overhead. The modern lines are built before the stations are built. The particular line about which the Minister of State made his announcement yesterday will always be known as the ministerial line, not the gas line.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will answer my question on whether he was lobbied by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance as regards bringing the gas line to Longford. Not only do I want to know the answer to that question, but so also do my constituents. There are very angry people in Roscommon, Leitrim and everywhere else because we were totally and utterly ignored. It is a disgrace and a very sad day for us.</P>

      <P>Good luck to the Deputies. To respond, I will also digress if I am permitted. With regard to the wind energy issues raised by Deputy Jim Higgins, I am pleased that fantastic improvements have been made. The position on wind energy has changed. It has recently been accepted by the public, which was, heretofore, very concerned about noise and the visual impact etc. That is no longer the case. Therefore, as a result of that change of attitude by the public, it is much easier to get planning permission.</P>
      <P>I made a recent announcement regarding successful applicants for AER V. The competition pertaining thereto had a mandatory requirement that planning permission be in the possession of applicants. That means we have some 350 megawatts of renewable energy to be produced by wind, for which all applications have planning permission. That will virtually ensure that those projects will go ahead, unlike earlier competitions which fell at that particular fence because of the failure to secure planning permission later.</P>
      <P>The announcement is the most significant ever in terms of renewable wind energy production. It means I have trebled the target in terms of energy being produced by renewable sources. The net result is that, by 2005, which is just a short time from us, 12% of our energy production will come from renewables, primarily wind energy. Wind energy technology is most suited to Irish conditions. That is very satisfying for me, as the one responsible for driving that particular part of Government policy. I am sure it will be welcomed by all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened yesterday was that contracts were signed by BGE with their contractors for <Col N="1595" /> the expenditure and the investment of &euro;250 million in the midlands and west. That is the most significant investment ever for that particular area. It is to be very much welcomed and positively received. It will have huge implications for areas heretofore unserviced by such hugely important infrastructure. It has taken us 22 years from the time that Kinsale gas first came ashore to get as far as we have in terms of the infrastructure that is <i>in situ</i>. Yesterday's activities in terms of the signing of those contracts heralded, in one fell swoop, a 50% increase in infrastructure on this island. The fact that the Government has already decided that the gas infrastructure will go to the north-west is significant, and plans are afoot to ensure that this will happen to important towns &ndash; gateway towns, as termed in the national spatial strategy &ndash; like Sligo and Letterkenny. That is what the plans aim to achieve. It is all very positive.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, An Bord Gáis announced that ten towns have been selected and it selected them according to commercial criteria. There is a statutory requirement on BGE to select towns for connection to the gas infrastructure on the basis of economic and commercial viability.</P>
    <P>The chief executive of BGE said yesterday that this is phase one and that no town is being excluded. The Government wants to see the west, the midlands and the north-west of the country taking advantage of the infrastructure which is being provided to those regions and as many towns as possible connected to it. It will be the responsibility of BGE and, when deregulation comes, whichever developer is involved to select the towns and areas for connection.</P>
    <P>I met delegations from many parts of the country and I spoke to many colleagues in the House. However, the Ministers whose names have been mentioned would have known it was a waste of time to talk to me about the selection of towns for connection to the gas grid because they would have known that was not my call. That is the truthful answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle has allowed me latitude to respond. If the Deputies will allow me to respond I will do so.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided that gas infrastructure will be extended to the north-west notwithstanding the fact that it is not financially or economically viable to do so. Subject to EU State aids and so on, it is planned to take gas to Sligo via Ballina and to take gas to Letterkenny via Derry. To that end the Government has granted &euro;12.5 million to the Northern Ireland authority for the purpose of subventing the gas line from Belfast to Derry and to bring gas to County Donegal. The Government is resolved that the north-west is facilitated by this important piece of infrastructure. I am proud to have driven that part of Government policy.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Higgins's question, gas will be going from east to west because the indigenous supplies will not be available for some time. The infrastructure which is now being put in place will initially take gas from the east to the west via Galway to Limerick. In the future the traffic will be two-way.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed by Deputies Higgins and Staunton attempts to set out certain duties for the regulator and describes a number of matters to which the regulator should have regard when carrying out his duties. I have no difficulty with any of these duties or with other matters raised in the amendment. My difficulty is simply that the amendment is not necessary.</P>
      <P>The duties and other matters proposed in the amendment are almost all taken care of in section 9 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, as amended by section 6 of this Bill. The existing section 9 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 describes the functions of the commission, the duties of both the Minister and the commission in respect of their functions and a range of issues which must be taken into account in discharging those duties. The section also places additional duties specifically on the commission in discharging its functions. This is being amended by section 6 of the Bill in the light of the commission's proposed additional functions in relation to natural gas.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to prolong the debate longer than is necessary and I do not, therefore, propose to go into a lengthy exposition of where each of the matters raised in the amendment before us is dealt with in the Bill. Suffice to say that each and every issue mentioned in the amendment is already covered, either implicitly or explicitly, in the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 or in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Higgins feels that certain matters that are already mentioned in the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, should be restated in this Bill. While I would like to accommodate the Deputy, such a restatement is neither desirable nor possible. Except in the case of one or two provisions, <Col N="1598" /> section 1 of this Bill is to be construed to mean that the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, and the Bill are to be taken as one. Therefore, if I were to agree to the inclusion in the Bill of a provision that is already contained in the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, I would be simply duplicating that provision. This could lead to considerable complications and confusion. While I recognise the suggestion before us is being made with the best of intentions, I cannot accede to it.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to deal with matters already covered in one way or other by the Bill or by the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. If I chose to accept this, there would be one additional difficulty. Inserting this text into the Bill would change fundamentally the manner in which the commission's duties are already set out in the Act. The text would replace the precise list of duties of the commission as described in section 9(5) of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, with a duty described in the first paragraph of the proposal. This would effectively eliminate as duties the matters described in the existing section 9(5)(<i>a</i>) to 9(5)(<i>e</i>).</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, has been constructed in a very particular and logical way that makes clear the commission's precise functions and duties and the matters the commission must take into account in carrying out its duties. Section 9 has been constructed in this way to ensure that any action taken by the commission, including any decision made, has a clear and objective justification based on the matters set out in that provision. The amendments to this section proposed in the current section 6 of the Bill do not seek to tamper with this construction and simply seek to amend the text in light of the extension of the commission's responsibilities in the area of natural gas.</P>
    <P>The amendment being proposed would unfortunately change significantly this carefully constructed provision. This change would not be for the better and the incorporation of this text into the Bill will only lead to a lack of clarity in a provision that, because of its fundamental importance to the way the commission acts as regulator, could not be countenanced. I am therefore not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>

        <b>: </b>I am disappointed the Minister cannot accept my amendment. As the Minister said, my amendment basically restates many of the provisions of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. If it is simply restating what is already in the existing legislation, I cannot see the danger referred to by the Minister. I am endeavouring to enshrine in the legislation what is already in the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, and slightly expanding thereon with no danger in terms of further implications by way of interpretation or otherwise.</P>

    <P>In relation to the contentious announcement of the towns to be supplied with gas, it is obvious that was a political decision. The Minister has <Col N="1599" /> contradicted himself this afternoon. Earlier in his reply, the Minister said that Bord Gáis Éireann makes the selection. In reply to my very specific questions as to whether he was approached by all or any of the four Ministers I mentioned, Deputies Cowen, O'Rourke, Dempsey and Fahey, the Minister of State said it would be &ldquo;a waste of time&rdquo; for them to talk to him.</P>

The problem we have in Mayo is that for the first time in the history of the State we do not have a senior Minister. If we had, places like Belmullet, Castlebar, Westport, Ballinrobe, Swinford, Charlestown, Claremorris, Ballyhaunis and Crossmolina would be supplied with gas.

That still stands and the Government is resolved that will happen, notwithstanding the major difficulties <i>vis-à-vis</i> the economics, State aid requirements etc. Let us not confuse selection of towns on a pipeline with Government policy.

    <P>On Committee Stage, I was very brief on this amendment and I will be equally brief this afternoon. This goes back to the basic principle of accountability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob:</NameTxt>
      <P>When this amendment was debated on Committee Stage, I explained to Deputy Higgins that I could not accept it because the legal advice available to me was that the proposed text was too open to subjective interpretation to be acceptable in the Bill. That advice still stands and as a result, my position on this amendment remains the same. In the context of the way the regulatory framework for the electricity and gas sectors is constructed, this amendment is not a suitable text for inclusion in this Bill.</P>
      <P>In his contribution on Second Stage, Deputy Higgins spoke at length about what he saw as the ineffectiveness of the regulator and in particular the telecommunications regulator at ensuring that the benefits of competition were reaching the consumer. In my response to the Deputy, I stated my belief that the framework set out in this Bill, when taken with that provided in the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, gave more than adequate powers to the regulator to ensure competition took place in the market.</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to undermine the regulator's ability to do his job. This text is so open in the way it can be interpreted by different people that it could be used as a tool by anybody seeking ways to disrupt the work of the regulator in ensuring that the rules governing the market are being enforced. It would lead to the regulator being subject to countless legal suits, questioning the validity of his every action. It would be irresponsible of me to accept an amendment that could have that kind of effect.</P>
      <P>At first, I found the text of Deputy Higgins's amendment very attractive in that the principles it expounds are ones with which we can all generally agree. However, my initial reaction was that of a layman and not a lawyer. If one proposes inserting such a text in primary legislation, one must take into account the effects of the text on the particular framework into which it is being inserted. Similar texts have been used in other legislation. I am aware that a similar text is used in the Aviation Regulation Act, 2001. The context in which it is used in that Act, however, is completely different from the context in which it is now proposed to be used. As I have stated, what is acceptable in one Bill is not necessarily acceptable in another. That certainly applies in regard to this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that I was initially keen to accommodate Deputy Higgins's proposal, but <Col N="1601" /> I regret I am unable to accept it for the reasons I have outlined.</P>

      <P>In page 6, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.&ndash;The Act of 1999 is amended, on the appointed day, by the insertion of the following section after section 9:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;9A.&ndash;(1) The Commission may in relation to gas distribution agreements&ndash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>(a) </i>set conditions which the Commission may specify as a condition precedent to the conclusion of a gas distribution agreement in the areas listed in Part I of Schedule 2 which said conditions shall be published by the Commission in accordance with section 9B, and</P>

      <P>(2) The Commission may, from time to time, intervene on its own accord and shall intervene if requested by any party concerned in order to specify issues which shall be included in a gas distribution agreement or to lay down specific conditions to be observed by one or more parties to such an agreement and the Commission may direct that those issues or conditions be included in the gas distribution agreement and it shall be an offence to fail to comply with a direction of the Commission under this subsection.</P>
      <P>(3) In exceptional cases the Commission may direct that changes be made to a gas distribution agreement in order to ensure effective competition of services for users and it shall be an offence to fail to comply with a direction of the Commission under this subsection.</P>
      <P>(4) The conditions set or changes directed by the Commission pursuant to subsections (2) and (3) may include, <i>inter alia</i>, conditions designed to ensure effective competition, technical conditions, tariffs, supply and usage conditions, conditions as to compliance with relevant standards, compliance with essential requirements, protection of the environment or maintenance of end-to-end quality of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5) The Commission may, at any time on his or her own initiative or if requested by either party, set the period within which negotiations on gas distribution shall be completed and if agreement is not reached within that period the Commission shall take steps <Col N="1602" /> to conclude an agreement under procedures to be laid down by the Commission.</P>
    <P>(6) The Commission shall establish and maintain procedures in order to procure the agreement referred to in subsection (5) and the procedures shall be made available to the public in accordance with section 9B.</P>
    <P>(7) In the event of a dispute between organisations in relation to gas distribution the Commission shall, at the request of either party, take steps to resolve the dispute within six months of that request being made and the resolution of the dispute (in these Regulations referred to as a &ldquo;finding&rdquo; of the Commission) shall represent a fair balance between the legitimate interests of both parties.</P>
    <P>(8) In seeking to resolve a dispute under this Act the Commission shall take into account, <i>inter alia</i>&ndash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) the user interest,</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) regulatory obligations or constraints imposed on any of the parties,</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>) the availability of technically and commercially viable alternatives to the gas distribution requested,</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>) the desirability of ensuring equal access arrangements,</P>
    <P>(<i>e</i>) the need to maintain the integrity of the gas distribution network,</P>
    <P>(<i>f</i>) the nature of the request in relation to the resources available to meet the request,</P>
    <P>(<i>g</i>) the relative market positions of the parties,</P>
    <P>(<i>h</i>) the public interest (including but not restricted to the protection of the environment),</P>
    <P>(<i>i</i>) the promotion of competition, and</P>
    <P>(<i>j</i>) the need to maintain a public service obligation.</P>
    <P>(9) The Commission shall make any finding under subsection (7) available to interested parties on a request being made to the Commission and the parties to the dispute shall be given a full statement of the reasons on which the decision is based.</P>
    <P>(10) An organisation which fails to comply with a finding of the Commission under subsection (7) shall be guilty of an offence.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment refers to the role of the commission in overseeing gas distribution agreements. It seeks to set down in clear detail what the role and powers of the commission would be in such circumstances. Subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) states that the commission may specify as a condition precedent to the conclusion of a gas distribution agreement in the areas listed in Part I of the <Col N="1603" /> Schedule which said conditions shall be published by the commission in accordance with section 9B, and encourage coverage of the issues listed in Part II of Schedule 2. What we are saying here is that the commission may intervene to specify the issues which should be included in a gas distribution agreement or it can lay down specific conditions to be observed by one or more of the parties. In addition, it may direct that those issues or conditions be included in the gas distribution agreement and it shall be an offence to fail to comply with the direction of the commission under this subsection.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) is in the national interest, to borrow a phrase from the much lamented &ldquo;Bull Island&rdquo;. It states that the commission may direct that changes be made to a gas distribution agreement to ensure effective competition of services for users and it shall be an offence not to comply with the direction of the commission in this regard. In other words, it shall ensure that a gas distribution agreement is in the spirit of providing effective competition for services, in other words, that the consumer or user will at the end of the day be the net beneficiary of such competition. The amendment seeks to ensure effective competition, technical conditions, tariffs, supply and usage conditions, conditions as to compliance with relevant standards, compliance with essential requirements, protection of the environment or maintenance of end-to-end quality of service. Again, from the point of view of the timeframe within which an agreement can be reached, it shall set a period within which negotiations on gas distribution shall be completed. It will take steps to conclude an agreement under the procedures laid down by the commission.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) states that in the event of a dispute between organisations in relation to gas distribution the commission shall, at the request of either party, take steps to resolve the dispute within six months of that request being made and the resolution of the dispute shall represent a fair balance between the legitimate interests of both parties. We are talking here about the regulatory arbitrary refereeing role of the commission in relation to overseeing gas distribution agreements. Where a dispute arises, it shall ensure the dispute is resolved within a six month period and not be allowed to drag on interminably. The amendment seeks to try to resolve the dispute to ensure it happens within the six month period.</P>
    <P>The issues to be taken into account by the commission shall be the user interest, the regulatory obligations or constraints imposed on any of the parties, the availability of technically and commercially viable alternatives to the gas distribution requested, the desirability of ensuring equal access arrangements, the need to maintain the integrity of the gas distribution network, the nature of the request in relation to the resources available to meet the request, the relative market position and the relative strength of their market share, the public interest, including but not <Col N="1604" /> restricted to the protection of the environment, the promotion of competition and the need to maintain a public service obligation. The commission shall make any finding under subsection (7) available to interested parties on a request being made to the commission and the parties to the dispute shall be given a full statement of the reasons on which the decision is based. An organisation which fails to comply with a finding of the commission under subsection (7) shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>This amendment which seeks to set down a set of guidelines or rules under which the gas distribution agreements will operate and the role of the commission in overseeing and arbitrating in such circumstances and in resolving disputes is a sensible one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob:</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments seek to deal with gas distribution agreements. While this term is undefined in the amendments, I can just assume it refers to arrangements between customers and distribution network operators for the transportation and delivery of natural gas by the network operator on behalf of the relevant customer. The main reason I am not able to accept the proposed amendments is that the issues they seek to address are already covered in detail in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 14 of the Bill addresses the issue of third party access, that is, the transportation of natural gas by pipeline operators on behalf of other persons. It does not matter whether the transportation of natural gas takes place over transmission or distribution pipelines or networks. This section covers all pipelines and networks of pipelines. I am aware Deputy Higgins is particularly concerned that there should be a dispute resolution role provided for the commission. I assure the Deputy that this has already been done in subsection (8) of the amended section 10(<i>a</i>) of the 1976 Act as set out in section 14 of the Bill. Under this section the commission has the power to impose a resolution on the parties involved in a dispute and can, if necessary, apply to the High Court to ensure compliance. There is also a direct obligation on the commission to resolve such disputes expeditiously.</P>
      <P>This obligation derives from the EU gas directive. It recognised the importance of a quick resolution to ensuring competition in the market is effective. By not specifying a precise time period for the resolution of such disputes, it also recognised, however, that certain disputes are more complex and require more time to resolve than others. The imposition of a clear obligation on regulators to resolve disputes expeditiously means that each individual dispute is resolved within the shortest time period relevant to the particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among its powers under this section the commission has the power to make regulations to provide for the matters to be covered by such agreements, including the terms and conditions in regard to price. The regulations may also provide <Col N="1605" /> for the methods for determining the proportion of cost to be borne by each of the parties involved and the terms and conditions covering the manner in which applications are made and the period of time within which an offer or refusal must be made. The commission also has the power to provide for any other matters it considers necessary or expedient in regard to this issue.</P>
    <P>A further major issue affecting the detail of such agreements is what is contained in the relevant operators code of operations. These codes set out in detail the technical, operational and certain financial aspects of pipelines and other network facilities. This issue is dealt with in section 13. Again the commission has full powers to direct operators to amend their code as necessary. I should point out that agreements in this area between Bord Gáis Éireann, the network operator, and relevant suppliers and customers have been in operation since 1995 when third party access rights were first introduced. BGE's code of operations has been drawn up by agreement between the company and major users and suppliers. The system has worked without major difficulty during that time, and the commission has ample powers in the Bill to ensure this continues to be the case.</P>

      <P>&lsquo;9B.&ndash;(1) With regard to the information referred to in section 9A, the Commission shall ensure that up to date information is published in an appropriate manner in order to provide easy access to that information for interested parties.</P>
      <P>(2) The Commission shall publish a notice in <i> Iris Oifigiúil</i> as to the manner in which the information referred to in subsection (1) is published.</P>
      <P>(3) The Commission shall ensure that the information referred to in sections 9, 20 and 22 is made available from its office on request to interested parties free of charge, during normal working hours.</P>
      <P>(4) The Commission shall publish a notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> as to the times and locations at which the information referred to in subsection (3) shall be available.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be brief because I elaborated on this amendment at length on Committee Stage. It concerns the publication of the necessary data in <Col N="1606" /><i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>. From the point of view of making the information available to relevant and interested parties, it is vital the information to which I referred on Committee Stage is published and notices duly published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said, we had a good interchange on this amendment on Committee Stage. While I will not accept it, I certainly see the merit in having a provision in the Bill dealing with the provision of information by the commission. As I said on Committee Stage, I have in mind the publication of information aimed at ordinary electricity and gas customers telling them what they are entitled to under legislation.</P>
      <P>At present, approximately 75% of the gas market and 45% of the electricity market are open to competition. This means that large users of electricity and natural gas are allowed to source their own supplies. In terms of gas, this covers about ten large companies, and in terms of electricity, it covers about 1,600 users. Upon enactment of the Bill the number of eligible customers in terms of gas will increase immediately to about 100. In the main, we are talking about large undertakings, many of which have energy managers and advisers to tell them their rights in this area and how to exercise them.</P>
      <P>As liberalisation of the market increases, however, the benefits will begin to reach larger numbers of smaller users, such as local pubs and even domestic users. As most, if not all, of this category of consumer will have had little or no experience of changing supplier, except switching their mobile phone provider, it is important that they are adequately informed of their rights and how to exercise them, if they wish to do so.</P>
      <P>As I promised on Committee Stage, I have considered this matter further and tabled amendment No. 9 to deal with it. The amendment differs from that tabled by Deputy Higgins and his colleague, Deputy Stanton, in that it does not seek to impose a direct and immediate obligation on the commission regarding the provision of information. Instead, it seeks to provide the Minister with the power to issue guidelines to the commission detailing the type of information the Minister considers it should provide as well as the manner in which it should provide it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have chosen this approach because it is neither appropriate nor necessary to impose the type of obligation amendment No. 6 seeks to impose on the commission. The independence of the commission must be respected to the greatest extent possible in this matter. It has a clear set of duties set out in the legislation, including a duty to ensure the interests of final customers are met. It fully meets this responsibility which includes the area of information provision. One only has to examine its website and view the extent of the information provided and the number of consultation and information workshops being undertaken to see that this is the case. We need to be pragmatic, however, and recognise that, while the commission fully meets its obligations and more <Col N="1607" /> than likely will continue to do so into the future, it is prudent that the Minister should have the type of power proposed in my amendment should the need arise at some future date regarding the provision of information.</P>
    <P>While my primary focus is on the needs of small customers, the provision allows the Minister the flexibility to identify any category of person in the guidelines as well as flexibility in terms of how the information should be provided. This specifically includes the possibility of electronic publication. In this regard, I have already mentioned the useful website the commission has in place. While publications such as <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, as mentioned in Deputy Higgins's proposal, have their useful place, in this instance we need to be able to ensure the information is accessible in the easiest way to those who require it. I thank the Deputy for his useful suggestion regarding the inclusion in the Bill of a provision of this nature. He will understand that I cannot accept the suggestion made by him in this instance, but I am sure he will see the merit in the alternative I have put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill has its genesis in the findings of the High Court in a case entitled Thomas Redmond <i>v.</i> Minister for the Environment, Ireland and the Attorney General. In that case, the High Court held that the provisions of sections 47 and 48 of the Electoral Act, 1992 and section 13 and rules 8 and 9 of the Second Schedule of the European Parliament Elections Act, 1997 &ndash; which required candidates to pay a deposit to be placed on the ballot paper for elections to the Dáil and European Parliament &ndash; were repugnant to the provisions of Article 40.1 of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The net impact of that judgment is that the requirements for deposits at Dáil and European elections are no longer valid and there is, in effect, no test of the bona fides of a prospective candidate in existence in terms of their entry onto the ballot paper. The Bill before the House seeks to address this issue, post-Redmond, by providing for alternative arrangements.</P>
      <P>Before outlining the details of the Bill, it might be useful for Members if I briefly sketched the historical background to deposits. The deposit requirement followed the practice in the UK where a deposit of £150 was first introduced as part of the Representation of the People Act, 1918. It was intended as a means of restoring the cost of candidature which had been eroded since the middle of the 19th century and to reduce the number of &ldquo;freak or propaganda&rdquo; candidates, as they were referred to, which had emerged during the war years and whose interventions were thought to threaten the smooth running of parliamentary elections. The deposit in the UK was increased to £500 in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deposit provision has been part of our electoral law since 1923 when the Electoral Act, 1923 provided for an amount of £100 for Dáil elections and that figure was increased to £300 under the Electoral Act, 1992. It is interesting to <Col N="1610" /> re-read the debates when that Act was making its way through the Houses. The original proposal was for an increase in the deposit from £100 to £500 and there was, at that time, a variety of views expressed. These ranged from maintaining the requirement at £100 to requiring a deposit of £100 plus 30 signatures to having no deposit at all and 1,000 signatures. Eventually, the deposit was set at £300 and it has remained at that level up to the High Court judgment last year. The deposit for European elections was set at £1,000.</P>
    <P>The arguments in favour and against deposits are well rehearsed at this stage and were examined in detail in the Redmond case. In essence they are that, on the one hand, deposits are a necessary restraint to protect the integrity of the electoral system from non-serious candidates to, on the other, the need to have an open democracy with no financial penalty on any person wishing to stand as a candidate. Whatever the arguments and their respective merits, deposits, up to the Redmond case, were a well established and accepted feature of our electoral system. It appeared to be the simplest and, at the same time, the most satisfactory way of establishing the serious intent of a candidate.</P>
    <P>However, while it may well have established the earnestness of a candidate, it must be said that there is no evidence that the deposit requirement deterred many would-be candidates at a Dáil election. In reality, because of the lack of increases in the amount, the real value has fallen dramatically since it was originally introduced and the statistics on the number of candidates standing at elections would seem to support that contention. At the last three general elections 370, 481 and 484 candidates respectively were nominated. The number of candidates increased by 30% in 1992 after the deposit was increased from £100 to £300.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, the question of the constitutionality of deposits was signalled as far back as the 1980s in the late John Kelly's book <i>The Irish Constitution</i> when he remarked: &ldquo;The constitutional permissibility of the requirement must be in doubt.&rdquo;  The judgment in the Redmond case has now confirmed that view. It was not the first time that John Kelly was before his time. Limiting access to a ballot paper is a common feature of most parliamentary democracies to prevent an overly large number of candidates from contesting an election. In Ireland, the purpose of any general election is to elect members to Dáil Éireann in accordance with the Constitution and, subsequently, to form a Government. It follows that for such a process to take place, there must be a consensus among a majority of the members of Dáil Éireann. General elections must have some structure and predictability in the sense that a voter must reasonably foresee what the impact of their vote will be on the eventual composition of the Dáil, if they are to exercise a meaningful choice. Where there is a very large number of candidates in a constituency, the outcome could depend more upon chance than the reflection of <Col N="1611" /> the preference of voters. Having an overly large number of candidates could impact on the democratic right of voters to play a meaningful part in the political process.</P>
    <P>There are generally three procedures used to limit access to a ballot paper. The first method is the cash deposit system as used in the United Kingdom and, up to now, in Ireland. The second is one whereby a candidate is required to obtain the signature of a number of registered electors and the third system of filtering candidates applies in countries with PR-list electoral systems. In those countries, there is generally a requirement to be a candidate of a registered political party and to be included on the party list to get on the ballot paper. While it is possible for independent candidates to stand, there is a requirement for signatures, which can be as many as 500 in some cases. This is a serious restriction on independent candidates and one which, in practice, results in a small number of such candidates actually contesting elections.</P>
    <P>Where the number of signatures is set as high as 500, the impact will vary depending on the type of candidate. For example, it would be easier for an organised political party to obtain 500 signatures and this could discriminate against independent candidates. Disabled candidates would also find it harder than, say, the payment of a deposit. Wealthier candidates may also find it easier to attain 500 signatures. There is no national ID system in Ireland, unlike mainland Europe where the system of obtaining the support of registered electors is commonly applied. The absence of an ID system and a requirement for a very large number of signatures raises the issue of verification and the possibility of corruption. Furthermore, the entire electoral process would become much more cumbersome if a period was required, after nominations had been received, to allow for the verification of a large numbers of nominators' signatures.</P>
    <P>As always in these matters, there is a balance to be struck between providing for a reasonable test of the earnestness of a prospective candidate but not setting that test so high as to unduly restrict people from seeking election or creating administrative difficulties. Having considered the issues, the Government has proposed the measures provided for in the Bill. Candidates at a Dáil election, not in possession of a certificate of political affiliation, will have to have their nomination papers assented to by 30 Dáil electors registered in the constituency. As Members are aware, a certificate of political affiliation confirms that a candidature is authenticated by the relevant officer of a political party registered in the Register of Political Parties.</P>
    <P>The reason such candidates should not require 30 assentors is clear. Firstly, it can be safely assumed that if a political party authenticates a candidate they will have the support of at least 30 people. In the revised section 25 of the Electoral Act, 1992, which became operative from 1 January 2002, new <Col N="1612" /> political parties will be required to have at least 300 registered members. Secondly, a party candidate will normally have to undergo a selection procedure at the local branch level which also would normally involve more than 30 members, most of whom would be from the constituency concerned. Support for the approach being adopted in the Bill came from the expert witness for the plaintiff in the Redmond case who made the following points. A system of nomination with additional assessors or supporting signatures would be just as effective, if not more effective, as a deposit. No European or other accepted democratic system permitted an entirely open access to the ballot paper &ndash; all had some provisions designed to protect the system from abuse. Apart from the deposit requirement, the Irish system was exceptionally open. Some form of deterrent to the abuse of the electoral system was desirable.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the detail of the Bill which is short and contains six sections. Section 1 provides, in paragraph (<i>c</i>) that the nomination form for a candidate without a certificate of political affiliation will have to be assented to by 30 registered electors for the constituency excluding the candidate or their proposer. Paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) contain consequential amendments relating to the procedures for details to be entered in the notice of election and in the notes on the nomination form.</P>
    <P>The new section 46(4B) sets out the procedures for the assentors to assent a nomination form and these can be summarised as follows: each candidate without a certificate of political affiliation or their proposer will lodge a nomination paper in the prescribed local authority offices, generally the principal offices of the local authority, for assenting to by 30 electors; each assentor will be required to sign the nomination form in the presence of a local authority official and produce one of the prescribed photographic identification documents; the local authority official will then enter on the nomination paper the elector's number on the register of electors, the nature of the identification document produced, including any number on it, the time and date of the assentor's signature and the official's signature.</P>
    <P>Where constituencies extend over more than one county or in the case of Dublin and Cork, I will prescribe more than one local authority office where the nomination paper can be lodged. Local authority offices, rather than the office of the returning officer, are a more suitable location as they are generally better known and the persons involved will have ready access to the register of electors details. This will be important where an assentor may not be on the published register but has applied for entry in the supplement as such information may only be available at the local authority offices.</P>
    <P>I also intend to prescribe the acceptable photographic identification in regulations after the Bill is enacted. The documents I am considering include a passport, driving licence, travel pass, work or student identification. If Deputies have <Col N="1613" /> other documents in mind, I am open to considering their suggestions.</P>
    <P>The candidate or proposer will be responsible for ensuring that the completed nomination paper, with the 30 signatures, is delivered to the returning officer before the closing time for receipt of nominations at the election concerned. Section 18 of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2001, reduced that nomination period from nine to seven days after the issue of the writs to provide necessary additional time for the printing of photographs and party emblems on ballot papers. Candidates and political parties should take careful note of the reduced time period. There is no statutory or other responsibility on the local authority in this matter &ndash; the responsibility to deliver the nomination paper in time to the returning officer is entirely that of the candidate or the proposer.</P>
    <P>The procedures I have outlined may appear bureaucratic but I consider that if the system is to have any credibility it must be thorough and certifiable. The extra work for local authorities should not be too onerous as the average number of non-party candidates per constituency at the 1997 general election was 2.5. The average per constituency in the Dublin area, where there are four major local authorities, was just over four.</P>
    <P>A further change in the law is contained in paragraph (<i>e</i>) which provides that a returning officer will not accept as a valid nomination a nomination paper that is not accompanied by a certificate of political affiliation, without the 30 signatures correctly witnessed by the local authority. It is important for candidates or their proposers to allow sufficient time to have the 30 assentors sign the nomination form and have it delivered to the returning officer. Paragraphs (<i>d</i>), (<i>f</i>) and (<i>g</i>) are consequential amendments.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 provide for similar regimes for nominations for European and local elections, except that the number of assentors required will be 60 and 15 respectively reflecting the different types and scale of election involved. The provision for direct elections for local authority cathaoirligh will be dealt with in regulations to be made under the Local Government Act, 2001. A draft of those regulations will have to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 provide that the travelling expenses incurred by a candidate or an assentor in meeting the requirements of the Bill at Dáil, European and local elections will not be regarded as an election expense in the same way that the cost of an election deposit was deemed not to be an election expense. Section 6 provides for the normal Short Title collective citation and construction of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I wish to refer to an issue which I know has been causing concern to Members and that is the question of electoral abuse. I am concerned that the procedure for applying for entry in the supplement to the register of electors may be open to abuse arising from the lack of a minimum residential period for <Col N="1614" /> entry. For example, any person over 18 years who is ordinarily resident can apply to go on a register. Despite the fact that a registration authority can seek supporting evidence of information contained on the application form, it is difficult to disprove that a person is not &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;, even if only for a few hours. A person could claim that he or she is residing with another person while seeking accommodation and looking for employment.</P>
    <P>In addition, in some cases, bulk applications are received by registration authorities close to the closing time for receipt of applications, thus making it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the registration authority to properly consider the application forms in time for the poll in question. In such circumstances, there is extreme pressure on the registration authority to approve the applications on hand for the poll, which may lead to unqualified applicants being included in the supplement.</P>
    <P>I will be moving three amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage. The first two provide that the provisions in the Electoral Act, 1992, relating to applications for entry in the supplement be strengthened by requiring that each such application be signed in the applicant's local Garda station in the presence of a member of the Garda Síochána. The garda will have to be satisfied of the person's identity and then sign, date and stamp the form. Similar procedures apply to other official forms such as a passport application, certain road vehicle forms relating to motor taxation and licensing of trailers, and voting by certain postal voters.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of maintaining the integrity of the electoral system and notwithstanding the extra work that may be created in Garda stations in the run-up to a poll, I consider that the supplement application procedure should be strengthened. The closing date for receipt of an application for entry to the supplement is 15 days before polling day.</P>
    <P>Where an applicant for entry to the supplement cannot attend his or her local Garda station, the amendment will provide that the application form can be signed in the presence of an official of the registration authority, if the applicant states in writing the reason he or she is unable to get the form witnessed in the local Garda station. If a person, because of a physical illness or disability, cannot attend either his or her local Garda station or registration authority offices, the application form can be accompanied by a medical certificate, in the same way that an application for entry to the postal voters or special voters lists is accompanied by a medical certificate.</P>
    <P>The amendment will also provide that an application for entry in the supplement must be made directly by the applicant to the registration authority. There has been some concern in recent years about canvassers and others collecting supplement application forms and delivering them in bulk to the registration authority. This will no longer be permitted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1615" />The third amendment will provide for three changes to the Electoral Act, 1997. The first of these will clarify that if a political party raises funds at an event, such funds or part of them can be used for supporting that party's candidates at an election, notwithstanding that this may not have been referred to in the notice of the event. This can arise if the fund raising is held before the candidates are selected and some concern has been expressed that the total sum raised might be regarded as the amount for donation purposes rather than the individual net contributions.</P>
    <P>The second amendment will provide that expenses, other than money, by a political party on behalf of a candidate of the party at a Dáil or European election, a Member of either House of the Oireachtas or an MEP are not political donations. The source of funds to meet such expenses will have to be disclosed by the political party if it receives a donation over the specified limit and any individual donation must not exceed the limit set out in the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2001.</P>
    <P>The third amendment will provide that the appropriate officer of a political party or the responsible person in relation to a third party, or an accounting unit will have a defence to a prosecution for the receipt of a prohibited donation or donation exceeding the disclosure limit if they did not know and could not reasonably have known of the receipt of such a donation. Similar provisions are provided for election agents in Parts 5 and 6 of the Act. The need for this amendment arises from the new provisions on the prohibition of certain donations provided in the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2001.</P>
    <P>Elections are fundamental to the operation of our democracy and it is incumbent on us, as legislators, to ensure that they are conducted in a fair, orderly and open way. During the High Court case that has given rise to the Bill, the distinguished expert witnesses who gave evidence for the plaintiff and the defendant agreed that a test of bona fides, provided it is fair and reasonable, should be imposed on prospective candidates at elections. They also agreed that a nomination and signatures system could provide an alternative to the deposits system. The Bill provides for such a system. The requirements provided in the Bill are not onerous and represent a reasonable and proportional response to the High Court judgment. The additional requirements for applying for entry in the supplement of the register will strengthen the security aspects of the supplement procedures and are a necessary change to assist in deterring bogus applications. I am also reviewing the list of specified identification documents which can be produced by voters at the polling stations and the number of electors who may be asked to produce an identification document. A revised list will be included in the regulations which will be required following the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister stated, this legislation emanated from a High Court decision to the effect that the £500 deposit which was previously required could act as a barrier to potential candidates. He provided an extremely interesting history of the deposits system and I had not realised that history was so chequered. I was not aware of having an interest in politics as a child, but I recall listening to election results on what was then termed the &ldquo;wireless&rdquo; and wondering why so many people were so careless as to lose their deposits. It has never come to my attention that a potential candidate was prevented from standing due to their inability to produce a deposit. One would have thought that a person with a groundswell of political support would have been able to raise the required amount. If someone does not have such a level of support, if they are pursuing a personal campaign on a particular issue or if, as the Minister stated, they are merely a &ldquo;freak&rdquo; candidate, they should not be involved in a general election because the latter involves the serious issue of choosing a Government.</P>
      <P>I completely agree with the High Court judgment in that money should never be a barrier to anyone interested in seeking election to parliament. However, I do not believe this has ever proved to be the case. I feel obliged to state that with so many other pressing issues and important outstanding legislative proposals which must be dealt with this week and next and which are of far greater relevance to the vast majority of the population, it is a shame we are devoting precious time to debating this measure in the dying days of the current Dáil. I accept this is an issue of principle, but I do not believe it is the most pressing issue for the vast majority of the electorate. However, the judgment has been made and it is our responsibility to legislate in respect of it as best we can.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael supports the approach the Government is taking on this matter. However, in abolishing the need for a financial commitment on behalf of a candidate I do not believe we can, at the same time, abolish the need for any commitment. People must demonstrate that they have such a commitment. The election of a Government is a serious matter and should be treated as such. It is reasonable for the public to expect that all candidates should in some way be able to demonstrate that they do have seriousness of intent and are genuinely committed to the process. We must balance the need for reasonable accessibility to the system with reasonable precautions to protect its integrity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of deciding on the conditions and qualifications for potential candidates, there will always be those who consider that the bar is set too high while there will be others who consider that it has been set too low. We have had a number of discussions on this matter in which suggestions on acceptability have varied. There are almost as many views about this matter as there are people. However, given the nature of the <Col N="1617" /> court decision, the Minister's approach is probably as good as any other.</P>
    <P>Requiring the assent of 30 electors for qualification to be a candidate in a general election is not an onerous condition. I do not believe this will prove a barrier to anyone's participation. On the other hand, a minimum effort will be required on the part of a potential candidate to find 30 electors to support them. He or she will also be obliged to encourage these people to appear at local authority offices to verify their support for them and to provide proof of their agreement to be assenters and of their residency in the constituency. I understand that the 30 electors must present with photo IDs and that neither the prospective candidate nor the proposer can be one of their number. I accept that it will take a good level of organisation to manage this within the tight timeframe provided. It is reasonable that the assent of only 15 electors will be required for local authority elections and that the assent of 60 will be required for European elections.</P>
    <P>I hope the outcome of this court decision will be to genuinely increase the choice of candidates for the electorate and not to produce some sort of anarchic situation where there will be such a profusion of candidates that confusion among voters will result. On a purely practical level, if voters were faced with ballot papers that ran to pages and pages which made voting an onerous task it would actually diminish rather than increase their ability to make choices. This outcome would be totally contrary to what was intended and would prove counter-productive.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the minimum commitment which will now be required will be open to potential abuse. The obvious abuse would be commercial interests using it for advertising purposes. Anyone seeking to market themselves will be able, with very little effort and no financial outlay, to have their name and photograph appear on every ballot paper in a particular constituency. More significantly, they will be able, at taxpayers' expense, to have an advertising message sent to every home in a constituency via a litir um toghcháin. They could do this in every constituency in the country if so desired.</P>
    <P>The other possible abuse which might arise will be practised by those who may simply wish to make a farce of the system by putting either themselves or other candidates forward with no seriousness of intent other than to amuse themselves. The Minister will recall that this happened previously, even when deposits were required and there is a possibility that such behaviour could become more commonplace. We all regard the Monster Raving Looney Party in Britain as somewhat of a joke, but at least it is one of a kind. If the effect here would be to produce dozens of such candidates in each constituency, we would regard it as much less of a joke. The holding of general elections is a serious business and it would demean the process and diminish our democracy if people try to make a joke of it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1618" />In recent years we have discussed on many occasions the disrepute into which politics and politicians generally have fallen and how, if we do not restore public confidence in the system, it will become increasingly difficult to encourage young people in particular to enter politics. It is against this background that we must strike a balance between putting in place the mechanisms necessary to protect the integrity of the system and minimising the number of barriers to entry.</P>
    <P>Lack of money for a deposit should never inhibit genuine candidates from participating in elections. I am of the opinion that political parties offer the best chance of forming stable Governments and of providing continuity of policy. Nevertheless, independent and single issue candidates have an important role to play in the system because they increase the range of choice for members of the public and act as a balance in the system in terms of providing a warning to political parties that they ignore important single issues at their peril. It is a healthy sign that when people feel strongly enough about political issues, they are willing to put themselves forward and become directly involved in bringing about improvements in society.</P>
    <P>At present, there are adequate numbers of quality candidates willing to come forward and offer themselves to the public. If there is a threat to our democracy it is not the shortage of candidates, it is the shortage of voters. At a time of peace, stability and relative prosperity, when there is no apparent threat to democracy, there is less incentive for people to bother voting. However, just as much as wars or military dictatorships, apathy is also a threat to democracy.</P>
    <P>During the recent referendum, I thought the best of all the posters was the one issued by the Referendum Commission which said &ldquo;If you do not vote, somebody else will decide.&rdquo;  That conveyed a salutary message to all of us. The most worrying feature of our electoral process is that fewer people are deciding the results. Many say they do not vote because they are disillusioned. The converse could equally be true, that people are disillusioned because they do not vote. A greater danger than being disillusioned by politics is to be disenfranchised, which is a possible consequence if people do not participate in democracy. Perhaps we need to concentrate more on providing voters than providing candidates. We must give people every incentive to vote, remove barriers they may be experiencing in going to vote and address aspects of our society that may be acting as a deterrent to voting.</P>
    <P>Certain recent trends and developments have worked against participation, apart from the many scandals that have put people off politics in many ways. With regard to the ban on posters and canvassing near polling stations, which has been partially reversed recently, I suggest, in retrospect, it was not a positive move. Perhaps one good reason for rowing back on it was that people had difficulty finding polling stations. God knows, if people bother to go out to vote, we <Col N="1619" /> should at least make it possible for them to find their polling station. By playing down elections, as the initial restrictions did, one loses that sense of excitement and occasion of the event. It is, indeed, an occasion and a privilege to have a democratic process and the ability to cast one's vote, and we should not play it down by making it seem less important.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency for people to suggest we should not have election posters at all, but I do not agree with that view. There is also a politically correct attitude emerging that canvassing, campaigning and political activity is slightly grubby, distasteful and not something in which to engage. In reality, there is nothing grubby about politics, as such. Why should we not be political? It is not something we have to be ashamed of &ndash; indeed, we should celebrate it. It makes no sense to hide the fact that we have elections. That is a dangerous step nearer to making it possible for us not to miss elections if we do not have them at all.</P>
    <P>The main reason for posters is to provide information. Those of us directly involved in politics and obsessed by it may find it difficult to accept that many people do not even know when there is an election coming up. I recall knocking on doors during previous elections only to find that people were totally unaware of the event &ndash; not only in referenda or local elections but even in a general election. People are unaware of an election until the posters appear. I believe if posters were abolished, the voter turnout would plummet. It is true that, in the past, posters caused litter but the quality of posters nowadays is such that they are much too expensive to allow them to become litter. Furthermore, the new litter fines, which are very rigorously enforced, ensure that the posters are down within seven days after the election. On reflection, I had better check that before the next election.</P>
    <P>There are other issues which are barriers to voting. In relation to the electoral register, although there have been several electoral Bills, the system is still not properly organised for collecting names and putting people on the register. It is an appallingly archaic system. With all the technology at our disposal in this information age, the system should be improving rather than getting worse, as is the case. The increase in the number of people entitled to vote is just one factor. Perhaps this is not the occasion to deal with this issue. At another time when we can give it more consideration, we should look at how the responsibility might be placed on people to ensure they are registered rather than sending local authority officials from door to door to contact them. It should be possible to check on-line whether one is on the register. The whole system is out of date and cannot really cope with the increased mobility of the population, the increased employment levels whereby people are not at home during the day and the inaccessi<Col N="1620" /> bility, especially in Dublin, of apartment complexes.</P>
    <P>All this makes it very difficult for local authorities to update their registers. Problems also arise with polling schemes and perhaps I can make a plea for my constituency &ndash; I notice from the Minister's speech that it is also an issue in Cork. There is a problem where constituency boundaries transcend county boundaries and there was a particular fiasco in my local authority area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown &ndash; it was an accident waiting to happen. In a number of areas, people were sent to the wrong polling station and had to be redirected. In some cases, people were disenfranchised as a result. I believe the problem arises from the fact that local authorities prepare their registers on the basis of local electoral areas. It is exacerbated where people vote at different polling stations in local and national elections so that, even if they get the right polling card, there is still confusion. I suggest to the Minister, if he is still in charge at the next review, that the Boundary Commission should be mandated to observe county boundaries more closely to avoid the present chaotic situation.</P>
    <P>The choice of election day is another key issue which has been discussed in previous electoral Bills and, as the Minister said, almost every day of the week has been tried at this stage. The choice of Wednesday for the recent referendum poll was a disaster in terms of facilitating or encouraging people to vote. We need to change our electoral system to take account of changes in society. There are many more people at work and people are commuting to work over much greater distances than before. For example, for somebody commuting from Mullingar to Dublin, the difficulty in getting to vote during polling hours is obvious. Even for shorter distances, commuting times have become much longer. Perhaps the second generation, so to speak, of electronic voting could allow a person to vote at any polling station in any constituency. In those circumstances, the problems associated with particular days of the week would be greatly diminished.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, serious consideration should be given to voting on a Saturday. Although it was tried at one of the by-elections, the south Tipperary one, that may not be the best basis for drawing conclusions. By-elections are very important to individuals but they have not got the same attraction for people as the election of a Government through a general election. Fridays have also been tried, including at the last general election, but that is a very bad day for many people as it is the end of the working week. People are either anxious to get home or to socialise and voting is probably the last thing on their minds. Saturday should certainly be considered, although it may become problematic during the summer months when people go away for the weekend. No doubt there will be some problems anyhow, regardless of the day of the week.</P>
    <P>In relation to the general election, while the Minister may or may not know the day and date <Col N="1621" /> at this stage, if it is to be on a weekday, I urge him to provide for greatly extended opening hours. I suggest that 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. is not adequate in a general election. From this week, RTE's &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; radio news programme starts at the earlier time of 7 a.m. in recognition of the fact that people are leaving home earlier in the morning. Extended opening hours at polling stations may present staffing difficulties and we may have to move to a shift system but we need to make it easier and possible for people to vote.</P>
    <P>I have probably wandered from the provisions of the Bill. I do not intend to deal with these issues by way of amendment because of the time constraint. They require thoughtful debate and no doubt the forthcoming election will throw up other issues. We will have to constantly update and adapt our electoral system to reflect the changes that are happening in society to ensure we make it as easy and as attractive as possible for people to vote to maximise participation in the democratic process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm seans a bheith agam labhairt sa díospóireacht seo ar an mBille (Leasú) thoghcháin. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation. In general terms the Labour Party supports the Bill. It is a sensible and rational approach to take in the wake of the Redmond <i>v</i>. Minister for the Environment and Local Government judgment which ruled that financial deposits should have no place in the electoral system.</P>
      <P>Having reflected on the matter, I welcome that judgment and am glad to see the back of financial deposits. An important principle was elucidated in the Redmond judgment, namely that a citizen's eligibility to stand in an election should not be linked to his or her ability to pay. That was apparently not a view shared by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government &ndash; the supposed champion of electoral reform. When Mr. Redmond, a man of limited means, took his High Court case the State and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government defended tooth and nail the system of financial deposits. Wisely the arguments put forward on behalf of the State were rejected out of hand by Mr. Justice Herbert.</P>
      <P>A press report of 1 August outlines the State's line of defence in this case. The State argued that without deposits elections would be overrun by spurious candidates and democracy would be undermined. The State similarly claimed that voters would be confused by the increase in the numbers of candidates that might result from the abolition of deposits. Neither of these arguments support the retention of financial deposits. They are arguments in support of criteria that candidates should comply with before putting their names on the ballot paper. However, nothing in the arguments put forward by the State back up the need for financial deposits. The judge rightly rejected the case put forward on behalf of the Minister and found in favour of Mr. Redmond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1622" />That judgment has led to the Bill before the House and I welcome this development. The Bill specifically refers to people, not members of registered political parties, who wish to stand at a general, local or European election. As the Minister has outlined the Bill will replace the system of financial deposits and introduce a system whereby 30 assenting electors, for the purpose of a general election, will be required to enable a person stand. This is a rational and sensible approach and it has the support of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I also support the three main conditions attached to this process. It is reasonable and proper to expect a person assenting to an individual's candidacy to live in the constituency and to produce some form of photo ID. I also agree that a person should be allowed to support only one candidate in an election. This is simple and straightforward legislation. Why the State had to take a court case to be forced into producing this relatively short electoral amendment Bill is beyond me. I will be the first to admit the Labour Party may never have urged the abolition of electoral deposits, in fact many of us in organised political parties may never have questioned the process. However, when Mr. Redmond lodged his case, and highlighted an inequity in our electoral law, the Minister should have acknowledged the value of his argument, thanked him and brought forward amending legislation. Unfortunately, Mr. Redmond was brought through the courts as the Government sought to cling to this discredited system. That said, I am pleased the Bill has been brought before the House.</P>
    <P>On the wider aspect of electoral reform I would like to use this opportunity to raise a very serious issue with the Minister. Along with many of my colleagues, I have received numerous complaints from people about the fact that the recent referendum was held on a Wednesday. This decision disenfranchised thousands of potential voters. To make matters worse the polling booths were open from only 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. One would not have to be of a cynical disposition to question the motives of the Minister in making these arrangements.</P>
    <P>As an example of just how difficult it was to vote, I will tell the Minister about a constituent of my colleague, Deputy Wall. The young woman in question lives in south Kildare and travels to work in Dublin every weekday. The polling booths were not open at the time she left for work. In addition to working she attends a night course in an institute of technology on a Wednesday evening. Due to a decision taken by the Minister this person was deprived of the opportunity to have her say in the referendum. At a time of declining voter turnout it is nothing short of outrageous that these nonsensical voting arrangements were employed. The Minister's decision has been roundly condemned by the Union of Students in Ireland. However, it was not just students who were disenfranchised, thou<Col N="1623" /> sands of workers around the State were also prevented from casting their ballot.</P>
    <P>The time has come to open polling stations at 7 a.m. to ensure people working and travelling can use their votes. It is time to realise that midweek voting has the potential to disenfranchise many voters. I also suggest to the Minister that it is high time the electoral register was available on-line so that people can check if they are on it. The day of expecting people to turn up at Garda stations to check the register are long gone and we should use the opportunities presented by information technology to make it easier for people to exercise their democratic voice. I have always taken seriously Minister Dempsey's interest in electoral reform. However, I will cast a cold eye on his future pronouncements given his record in relation to the recent referendum and his record in this Dáil in general.</P>
    <P>Another issue in regard to elections about which I am concerned also relates to students. I understand that in the Waterford constituency there were 16 students able to cast their votes at the centres where they were attending college. The elector must apply to his or her local authority to be accepted as a postal voter and when the vote is being cast it must be done in the presence of a member of the Garda. These provisions have been in place since 1997 and I put it to the Minister that they have not been sufficiently promulgated. On certain days it may be difficult for students to get to Garda stations. Is it not possible for a member of the Garda to attend at the institution on the day in question? Every effort should be made to make it easier for our citizens to exercise their franchise. There is a great need to make this aspect of voting more clear.</P>
    <P>Issues also arise regarding the register. The conversion of the register to an electronic format would be very welcome as people's names currently disappear off registers for no apparent reason even when they have been living in an area for a long time. I urge the Minister to continue to look at this area with a view to coming up with fail-safe systems to ensure that people are not inadvertently removed from registers and that people are informed of the process in every way possible. The process of getting on the register for the first time and of transferring votes should be simplified.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the support of the Labour Party for the principle behind this Bill, though we may table amendments on Committee Stage to improve aspects of the legislation. I conclude by stating my appreciation of the stance taken by Mr. Redmond who believed he was right, took on the forces of the State and won.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's proposals and hope that the Bill has a speedy passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas. Most Deputies, Senators and other candidates are thinking of the forthcoming election and will be <Col N="1624" /> interested in what the Minister has said in relation to the supplementary register. I welcome the proposed changes which will bring a degree of propriety and order to the supplementary register scheme. The clarification the Minister is effecting is necessary. I ask him, however, to look at the provisions which apply to disabled and elderly voters. At present the supplementary register system and the postal vote system provide fit, able-bodied people who cannot attend polling stations due to work or study with the opportunity to vote. Unfortunately, elderly people and the disabled can only register once a year and that is unfair. We cannot stand over the fact that fit, able-bodied people who cannot vote at polling stations can obtain a postal vote up to the last minute, while the elderly and the disabled have only one opportunity to register per annum.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to examine this and to bring a degree of fairness into what is an unfair system. It is not beyond the Minister's remit to introduce a suitable amendment to provide for the inclusion on the postal vote register of people who can certify that they require a postal vote due to illness, infirmity or old age. It is necessary to bring about that change and to give those people a fair chance to exercise their franchise.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's clarification of the other Electoral Acts as they apply to spending limits. This will be the first general election in which the spending limits apply and the vast majority of candidates will end up spending much less than the maximum allowed. There has been much confusion about such issues as the use of Oireachtas postal facilities, offices and telephone equipment. The Minister is aware that there appears to have been confusion about what we, as Oireachtas Members, interpreted the legislation to mean and the interpretation of the Public Offices Commission. Every issue which needs to be clarified must be clarified as a matter of urgency, but while the proposals in this Bill will help, certain issues remain obscured. All candidates intend to comply fully with the provisions of the legislation and with the orders the Minister has introduced. There are still a number of areas, however, which cause concern and confusion and these need to be addressed. Oireachtas Members were issued with a rather helpful bulletin last week in which the issues affecting candidates were outlined, but a number of issues still need to be clarified. I encourage the Minister to effect that clarification in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the run-up to the campaigns which will take place over the coming weeks, it is important that the House sends a strong message to the electorate to urge that every voter uses his or her vote in the forthcoming election campaign. It is only a few weeks since the constitutional amendment referendum for which the turnout was extremely disappointing. It was somewhat better than the appalling turnout for the referendum on the Treaty of Nice last year, but we still have to address the issue urgently. I support what Deputy O'Shea has said regarding the need for voting to <Col N="1625" /> take place at the weekend to maximise turnout. It is disappointing so many people take such little interest in politics and have no wish to vote. There are thousands who are unable to exercise their franchise because of the day chosen for the election or the limited number of hours available for polling. The Minister and the Taoiseach have been asked on quite a few occasions over the past few weeks to indicate that weekend voting will be introduced. I hope that is given the most serious consideration.</P>
    <P>An excellent suggestion was put forward by the President of the Union of Students in Ireland, Mr. Richard Hammond, which proposed that voting should take place over a two-day period. Polling booths would open on a Friday evening at 5 p.m. and close at 10 p.m. and then remain open all day on Saturday. Of course, we could come up with reasons that would be costly or difficult from an administrative point of view, but on an occasion on which we ask the electorate to choose the Government and to chart out the course of the State's business for the next five years it is incumbent on us to allow the maximum number of people to participate in the poll.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's constituency and the other two where electronic voting is being introduced more people may come out to vote due to the interest generated by the novelty of the new system. However, in the vast majority of constituencies we have seen a fall in the numbers participating in elections over the past decade. The last general election, in 1997, produced the lowest ever turnout and we must ask ourselves what we in this House can do to facilitate the democratic process by encouraging increased voter turnout. I ask the Minister to look at the question of weekend voting with a very open mind.</P>
    <P>I have heard a number of commentators make the point that the Government will ask itself what is the advantage of holding the election on any particular day. There is no advantage to be gained by any particular party, but it is important for democracy and participation that we maximise turnout. A turnout in a general election of 60% to 65% means up to 40% of the people are saying no to all of us and we all lose. I appeal to the Minister to put measures in place to increase turnout and to facilitate voting. The case has been made for weekend voting and for Saturday voting, with which a certain number of people have difficulty on religious grounds, as they do with voting on Sundays. The suggestion by the USI of Friday evening voting, with polling on Saturday, should be considered. We need to take a dramatic step to ensure that people turn out in large numbers in the general election to be held in a few weeks.</P>
    <P>This is probably the last opportunity I will have to speak on an issue for which this Minister has responsibility. The Minister brought many ideas to the Department and I was disappointed he did not succeed in implementing all of them. I was particularly disappointed he was unable to implement his views, which I support, on the dual <Col N="1626" /> mandate. The Minister also has strong views on, and proposals in relation to, electoral reform and the system whereby we choose our public representatives. I hope the next Dáil, regardless of which parties form the Government, will look at those issues in a mature fashion.</P>
    <P>It is easy to be comfortable with the system that elected us to this House but I do not believe it serves the country as well as it should. I endorse what the Minister tried to do to reform politics. I am not making a political point but the Minister was not supported to any great degree by his colleagues, which was most disappointing. I hope the next Government will not be dependent on a few people who can simply hijack good policies and have them put aside.</P>
    <P>I support this legislation and I hope the Minister will take our comments on board, particularly in relation to the registration of disabled voters and weekend voting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague has dealt with one of the points I wished to make on this legislation, the need to facilitate students and young people voting in elections. In recent years many of our students and members of our workforce have had to move to the cities, especially Dublin, which means that if voting takes place on a Thursday, they are unable to vote for the people they support and know best. That applies across party lines. I hope this issue will be addressed in the last few days of this Administration.</P>
      <P>If possible, an election should be held on a Friday or Saturday. There was a trial of Saturday voting in Tipperary but that generated more questions because many young people were away playing sports and so forth. Friday is probably the best choice, aside from Deputy Bradford's suggestion of holding an election over two days. Friday would suit many people, provided the polling stations stay open until 10 p.m. to facilitate those who have to travel long distances to, for example, Kerry or Donegal.</P>
      <P>I urge people to look again at the electoral register before the election is called. It is surprising how many people found they were either unable to vote or did not receive voting cards in the last referendum. I am heartened by the number of parents and young people who come to my office, as they do to other public representatives, to find out why they are not on the register and how they can be included in it at this stage. The rules have been changed so that in the first two days after the election is called names can be put on a supplementary register. It is vital to convey to the public that people who are not on the register but who want to participate in deciding the next Dáil should ensure they are put on the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Students who attend college in this State have the right to apply for a postal vote. Unfortunately, however, students attending college in Northern Ireland do not have that right. If the Good Friday Agreement is to mean anything, the many students from Border areas who have to <Col N="1627" /> attend colleges in Northern Ireland should be allowed to cast their votes. Last night I talked to one family about this. They have two adult children in college in Northern Ireland and one in college in Dublin. The student in Dublin has the right to vote but the two attending college in Northern Ireland will have to travel home, regardless of whether that suits them. Given all the talk about a peace dividend, the people who live in the Border areas and who, for many reasons, have to go to college in Northern Ireland should be able to vote. I am aware it is dangerous to widen this facility to other areas but over the years we have provided these students with grants and so forth so it should not be too difficult to facilitate them in this regard too.</P>
    <P>Cavan-Monaghan was one of the constituencies with a high turnout in the last general election. Indeed, the turnout was one of the highest in the country so we cannot complain about that. However, I am anxious to ensure that all those who vote in the next election are entitled to vote and that those who are entitled to vote are facilitated in every possible way.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill. It is the result of a legal judgment with which we must comply. It is the reason so many independent candidates are coming forward in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency. They are entitled to do that. We must accept the legal situation and the Bill provides for that. I urge the Minister to ensure that the next general election is held on a day when as many young people as possible will have the opportunity to vote in their home constituency for their preferred candidate. It is vital that we encourage them to be part of the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their positive and constructive contributions to the debate. I have noticed that debates on electoral legislation are similar to debates on county roads at parliamentary party meetings in that one always gets good, constructive contributions.</P>
      <P>The Deputies raised the issue of what day the next election will be held. I can assure them that no decision has been made on that. Furthermore, no decision has been made not to have the election at a weekend. The decision is at the discretion of the Taoiseach. A good deal of comment in the media over recent weeks appeared to indicate that a decision has been made to rule out a weekend poll. I will convey the Deputies' views to the Taoiseach that there is a strong feeling that the election should be held nearer to the weekend rather than midweek.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am from the school of thought that it does not matter what day of the week an election is held &ndash; there will be advantages and disadvantages no matter what one does. There is a great onus on Members of the House to make the election as interesting as possible, to put forward the best possible candidates and policies and to give <Col N="1628" /> people a real choice. That will contribute more significantly to turnout in the election than the day of the week it is held. Having looked at the figures for both elections and referenda over the years, the polls have been held on every day of the week except Sundays and Mondays, and I see no connection between the day of the week and the turnout. There is a connection, however, with how much people are exercised at the time about the issue before them or the election.</P>
    <P>However, I accept that some people feel strongly about this. I accept there would be a number of advantages to weekend voting. It would certainly facilitate electors who are normally outside their constituencies during the week. That would include students, commercial salespersons and people who work outside their constituencies. An increasing number of people work abroad and return home for some weekends. Weekend voting would also facilitate them. It would also eliminate the need for school closures, although the pupils might not like that.</P>

      <P>It would give a wider choice as to the time of day at which people could vote because more people would not be working. It would obviously suit people who work shifts.</P>
      <P>Weekend voting also has its disadvantages. There is a strong feeling among the Churches in this regard. When my predecessor, Deputy O'Shea's colleague, raised the issue of Sunday or weekend voting with the Churches in 1996 there seemed to be a degree of consensus, even among the two larger Churches, that Sunday voting would be acceptable. In 1999 or 2000, however, I checked again and a number of the Churches had changed their attitude because of the changes in society since 1996. They took the view that Sunday was becoming less and less meaningful as a day of rest, religious observation and so on because shopping centres were open and they were becoming like churches.  While they did not veto it and we can make the decision to vote on a Sunday, the Churches certainly expressed a strong preference that voting should not take place on a Sunday. Obviously there are other religions which observe the Sabbath on Saturday and they also have views on this matter, but the Catholic Church has changed its view since 1995.</P>
      <P>When I nominated Saturday as the day for the south Tipperary by-election, the first question I was asked on a radio programme was, &ldquo;Do you not realise the Munster final is on the following day and the problems that will create?&rdquo; There will be a problem no matter what day we choose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that there is postal voting and that a person who may be ordinarily resident in more than one place can choose the place of registration and voting, and for a number of other such reasons, the argument for weekend voting is not as compelling as it was. However, the general consensus among Members of the House is that, as with the <Col N="1629" /> Tipperary South by-election where the turnout increased by 3% in 12 months, it is worth experimenting in a general election to see if it will have an effect. I have taken on board that view and I will convey it to the Taoiseach in the context of the forthcoming general election.</P>
    <P>I am not slow to take responsibility. Deputy O'Shea criticised me harshly for pursuing the Redmond case and congratulated Mr. Redmond for seeing it through. I also congratulate him in that regard. It is great that the citizens of this country can take on the State and win. It did not necessarily suit, but I would agree with the process. I must tell the Deputy, however, that the case started when his colleague was Minister for the Environment. The lead-in to this case began in 1992 and eventually the case was taken. I do not believe it is significant that Deputy O'Shea's colleague and Mr. Redmond are from the same constituency. He was trying to contest the election in the then Minister's constituency.</P>
    <P>I accept the point about the longer opening hours at polling stations. In the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2001, we provided, with the agreement of all parties, for the opening of polling stations for any 12 hour or longer period from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. It is my intention that the polling stations will open as early as possible and for as long as possible for the forthcoming general election. Those of us who commute will understand my reasoning. When I started coming to this House in 1987, I left my home at 8.10 a.m. and arrived here around 9 a.m., without breaking any speed limits. I hope I still do not break any speed limits but I now hear the cars whizzing past my door at 6.15 a.m. That is when the traffic starts heading for Dublin. The hours I mentioned would give people an opportunity to vote earlier and if they cannot vote in the morning, it would give them an opportunity to vote in the evening. That is a suggestion I will take on board for the forthcoming general election. While I do not have discretion in the calling of the day, I can influence the opening hours at the polling stations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bradford made a number of points. I regret we are discussing this matter at this stage but it is something which has been at the back of my mind. I agree with what the Deputy said about older people and people with a disability who get one chance per year to join the special voters' register. We need to facilitate people who become ill during the year and to make it much more convenient for them to join the special voters' register. We should make it as easy as possible for people to qualify. I am told the requirement that certain categories of postal voters must register annually is necessary to ensure the condition which gave rise to their eligibility still exists. There is a certain validity in that argument. In the case of disabled voters, my predecessor brought in the requirement that a medical certificate was required only for the first registration and that goes some way towards making it convenient. We must examine this to make the pro<Col N="1630" /> cess of registration easier for people, particularly people with a disability or older people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bradford will be pleased to learn that I have already examined the possibility of introducing two-day voting. It is something I would have liked to have tried, but the advice I received is that the introduction of two-day voting would require a referendum because the Constitution indicates that we vote on one day. We have received the report on parliament, etc., from the constitutional committee and in that context two-day voting is something we should consider in the future.</P>
    <P>Regarding some of the other amendments we are introducing to the Electoral Act on the spending limits and expenditure, and the confusion which is evident, now is the time for anybody who is in any doubt about the helpful clarification which the Public Offices Commission put forward in the past week or so to clarify it with the commission as far as possible. I have stated previously in regard to this Bill that I have a fear, because of the complicated nature of provisions of the Electoral Act, that a large number of Deputies elected to this House in May will be answering questions to the Public Offices Commission. These will be people who will genuinely try to abide not just by the letter of the law but also by the spirit of the law. They will have to answer questions because of the confusions and contradictions we have incorporated into the Electoral (Amendment) Act &ndash; I am not blaming the Public Offices Commission in this regard. Most Deputies in the House know that when one has to answer questions of this nature, one is automatically assumed by everybody outside the House to be guilty until one proves oneself innocent.</P>
    <P>In light of the amendments that were tabled, if a Member of the House is in any doubt and needs clarification, he should go to the Public Offices Commission because it is the body from which clarification is received. By raising questions with the Public Offices Commission, in the context of its guidelines document, one may be bringing matters to its attention that need clarification and that may be of assistance to other people who have not even thought of these questions.</P>
    <P>I know everybody in this House who will be a candidate in the election will not try to do anything illegal or wrong. They will try to abide by the spirit of the law, but there is a danger because it is so complicated. People outside the House and maybe some Members of the House do not realise how complicated it is and they will end up answering questions and will be branded as having done something wrong.</P>
    <P>All the parties should decide, either before or after this election, that they will at least give the benefit of the doubt to anybody asked questions by the Public Offices Commission after the election. Instead of making a political football of it in this House, we will assume that a person made a mistake until the Public Offices Commission produces a report saying that the candidate deliberately breached the Electoral Act and should be <Col N="1631" /> dealt with, rather than the other way around. Certainly, if any of the representatives of the other parties are interested in sitting down to talk about that now or in the run-up to the election, we should do so. Perhaps it will not be as easy after the election. We should agree among ourselves that we will leave that business to the Public Offices Commission. If somebody has to be dealt with then, we will deal with it here in the House and not go down the route we have tended to go down in the past, that is, automatically concur with the public perception or media perception that somebody is guilty just because a question is asked of him. Taking the route of hanging, drawing and quartering people before they are proved guilty of an offence does Deputies and politics a disservice.</P>
    <P>I will respond briefly to the point raised by Deputy Bradford on electoral reform. Again, a report was published today by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution which states that the system we have is the best one. If we are to look at alternatives, the one I have been proposing for some time is probably the best. We still need to look at electoral reform and the electoral system. We should try to do that on a non-partisan basis. If we want to do a lot of the things we talk about doing here in the House and making them more relevant to the public, we need to examine seriously the electoral system. This is a good start by the committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Olivia Mitchell and others raised the point about students, keeping them informed and making them aware of the elections and the register. We co-operate as much as we can. We encourage and help groups such as the USI to produce a brochure on registration. We inform, and co-operate fully with the USI to inform, students. We put all the details on registration on the Department's website. We have an annual advertising campaign, which we will continue to carry out.</P>
    <P>The other point Deputy Olivia Mitchell raised was the register of electors. Again, we dealt with this in the 2001 Bill. The Deputy contributed strongly at that time as well. I share the Deputy's concern that the register of electors should be prepared to the highest standards of accuracy. I am not satisfied that is the case at present. There are too many errors in and omissions from it. We have made some changes which I think will be of help. Under the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2001, we made provision for the inclusion of electoral lists in some registration authority areas as a pilot measure. That list will make much easier the task of updating the register by addition and deletion of names. It will provide for the register to be on-line, as has been suggested by a number of Deputies.</P>
    <P>I will be arranging for the preparation and maintenance of a national register of electors, which will assist the registration authorities to note the changes, especially in terms of electors moving from one part of the State to another.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1632" />I made a proposal, which was supported and accepted on all sides of the House, to investigate if bodies such as the ESB, the telephone companies or An Post were interested, on their own or in partnership with the registration authorities, in compiling and maintaining the register. This is because they are in regular contact with every house in the country. We will be pursuing this objective. In the meantime, registration authorities should make improvements in terms of their efforts to ensure the register is accurate. The fact that there was a recent referendum is some help. If I remember correctly, the figure pertaining to changes in the register and extra people being added to the register was about 11,000 in the run-up to the referendum. People spotted they were omitted from the register etc., and it will probably be a little more accurate than before.</P>
    <P>Deputy Olivia Mitchell also raised the point about the prohibition of canvassing and other activity in the vicinity of polling stations. With regard to urban areas, she made the point that the absence of posters outside polling stations in urban areas meant that people did not know there was a station there or even realise there was an election taking place. I have no argument with this. We had an argument, however, when we tried to make a change in this regard in the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2001. We have reduced to 50 metres the distance within which posters may be displayed. I asked my official when the Deputy raised the point again if we could draft a quick amendment to abolish that clause, but he did not agree with that. We should look at the matter again. Posters will not make much difference to anybody but perhaps they add a little to people's interest.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the major points and I am sorry if I left out any. The point raised by Deputy Crawford concerning students from the Republic in universities in Northern Ireland is worth adverting to. I will ask my officials to investigate the matter. Obviously, nothing can be done in the short-term before the next general election. This is something we should re-examine. We often talk about including the entire island of Ireland and this would be worth considering again.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed. The points they made deserve attention and I thank them for making them. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;<i>(a)</i> in section 15(2) by inserting &lsquo;to the procedure for making applications under subsection (1) and' after &lsquo;shall apply';&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a textual amendment arising from amendment No. 2. Amendment No. 2 will provide that an applicant's declaration on the form of application for entry in the supplement to the register of electors will be witnessed by a member of the Garda, who when satisfied with the applicant's identity, will sign, date and stamp the form. I referred to this on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>This kind of procedure is found in the Road Vehicles Registration and Licensing (Amendment) Regulations, 1992, which deal with the refund of motor tax, the Road Traffic Licensing of Trailers and Semi-trailers Regulations, 1982, which concern a replacement trailer licence card and, of course, in passport application forms. Section 68 of the Electoral Act provides that certain postal voters, that is, students and those in certain occupational categories must sign their voting identification documents at Garda stations. Where people are unable to attend at their local Garda station there is provision for facilitating them to register.</P>
      <P>I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. We must strike a balance between making it easy for people to vote and protecting the integrity of the system. This is yet another argument for a national identity card system. It may not be politically correct to say this but society has become too complex and sophisticated not to have one. We demand a level of participation which can be facilitated only by the most sophisticated technology available.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) of the amendment refers to an applicant for inclusion on the supplement to the register and who is unable, &ldquo;due to physical illness or physical disability&rdquo; to go to the Garda station or local authority office. I assume this refers to a temporary illness, that the person will be able to vote at a polling station and does not wish to be included on the list of special voters. I see the Minister is indicating that this is the case.</P>

    <P>(vii) in the case of a contribution made by a person in connection with anevent organised for the purpose of raising funds for a political party, the proportion attributable to that contribution of the net profit, if any, that is derived from the event and that, although not specifically raised for the purpose of supporting one or more of the political party's candidates at a Dáil, Seanad or European election, is used for the latter purpose;',</P>
    <P>
      <i>(b)</i> in section 22(2)(<i>b</i>) by substituting the following subparagraph for subparagraph (vi):</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(vi) expenses incurred by a political party on behalf of a candidate authenticated by the political party at a Dáil or European election, member of either House of the Oireachtas or representative in the European Parliament, other than a donation of money.',</P>

    <P>&lsquo;(2A) It shall be a defence to a prosecution of&ndash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>(a)</i> the appropriate officer of a political party or the person deemed to have been appointed as the appropriate officer under section 71, or</P>
    <P>
      <i>(b)</i> the responsible person of a third party or of an accounting unit, for an offence under subsection (1)<i>(a)</i> or <i>(b)</i> that he or she did not know and could not reasonably have known of the receipt of a donation acceptance of which is prohibited by section 23 or 23A or a donation the value of which exceeds the relevant amount specified in section 24(4).', and</P>
    <P>
      <i>(d)</i> by substituting the following for subparagraph (d) of paragraph 2 of the Schedule (inserted by the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2001):</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1636" />&lsquo;<i>(d) </i>necessary travelling expenses incurred by a candidate or an assentor in meeting the requirements of section 46(4A) and (4B) of the Act of 1992 and section 12(1A) and (1B) of the Act of 1997,'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides for three amendments to the Electoral Act, 1997, in addition to the amendment to section 4. The first amendment, in paragraph (iv) provides clarification that where a political party raises funds at an event such funds or part of them can be used for assisting party candidates at an election, notwithstanding the fact that no such reference is made in the notice of the event. This can occur if the event is held before the candidates are known and because one of the main functions of a political party is to support candidates at elections.</P>
    <P>While the Standards in Public Offices Commission has indicated in its guidelines for election expenditure at the upcoming general election that it agrees with the above, it is desirable to put the matter beyond doubt. Otherwise, one might argue that instead of the net individual contributions from the event being taken into account for political donations purposes the total net contribution should be used. This could have implications for candidates who cannot accept a donation exceeding &euro;2,539.48 from any one source in any one year. This issue was raised by a number of Deputies from different parties and has been clarified by the Public Offices Commission. The new section will put the matter beyond legal doubt and the interpretation of the commission will be in primary legislation.</P>
    <P>The second amendment clarifies the fact that expenses other than money incurred by a political party on behalf of a party candidate at a Dáil or European election, a Member of either House of the Oireachtas or an MEP is not a donation. The source of funding for such expenses will have to be disclosed by the political party if a donation is over a specified limit and any individual donation must not exceed the limits set out in the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001.</P>
    <P>This was raised by Members from different sides of the House. Money spent by political parties, which exist for political purposes and to have candidates elected at local, national and European level, on behalf of their candidates should not be treated as a donation. This does not affect the expenditure limits, which remain in place.</P>
    <P>The third amendment provides that it will be a defence for an appropriate officer of a political party or the responsible person of a third party or of an accounting unit, to a prosecution for the acceptance of a prohibited donation under section 23 or 23A or a donation over the specified amount in section 24(iv) or the non-remission of such donations or part of them to the commissioner, if he or she did not know and could not reasonably have known of the receipt of such donations. Similar provisions exist in Parts 5 and 6 of the 1997 Act in relation to election agents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1637" />It is necessary to extend this defence in relation to the receipt of donations after the new provisions in the 2001 Act prohibiting donations. This particularly applies in relation to the larger parties where, despite the best efforts of the appropriate officer, some branch or official may not keep the appropriate officer fully informed, even if no malice is involved.</P>
    <P>The fourth amendment repeats section 4 of the Bill, which provides that the cost of necessary travelling expenses incurred by a candidate or an assentor in meeting the requirements of sections (1) or (2) will not be regarded as an election expense. That is in line with existing provisions which provide that election deposits are not regarded as an election expense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak about the refurbishment of two schools in my constituency. The schools concerned are St. Killian's junior and senior schools in Kingswood, Tallaght. It is a very long saga. Successive Governments have failed to respond since 1986 to urgent requirements for refurbishment and facilities. All the work has been done by the local community. The professional fees have been paid. The local charge of £25,000 has been raised and as long ago as 21 February 2002, the Minister told the House:</P>
      <P>A project to extend and refurbish the schools referred to by the Deputy is included as part of the Government's programme and is currently in architectural planning. The project will continue to the invitation of tenders as soon as possible under the expanded building programme.</P>
      <P>For some reason that has not happened. The tender is on the Minister's desk waiting for sanction. The shape and condition of these schools is very poor indeed. There is fear that if this work is not sanctioned in advance of the general election, it will not be sanctioned. As this is a marginal constituency, there is a reasonable expectation that it will be done, but it would be great comfort if the Minister would confirm that.</P>
      <P>The senior school was built in 1986 and has classrooms only. There is no hall and there are no specialist facilities. The junior school was built in 1979 and is in a sad state of disrepair. The entire roof, which is made of asbestos, needs to be completely replaced. There are few gutters remaining on the buildings due to vandalism. All guttering and windows need to be replaced and the entire building needs to be rewired. The senior school requires a general purposes room, servery, equipment store, library, resource area and storage, a multipurpose room, a general office, a principal's office, WC and shower facility suitable for disabled use and general utility storage. The entire building requires suitable perimeter fencing to provide security from vandalism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a hugely populous area that has lost out for historical reasons, that I will not discuss now, in having a second level school provided. All the children from this hugely populous area are shipped out of the estates concerned and the primary schools are the only facilities providing education. To have them in the sad state of disrepair and so deprived of basic facilities in 2002 is scarcely acceptable. The architectural work is done. The tender is on the Minister's desk. Why is it <Col N="1639" /> not being approved? Will there be a deluge of such tenders in the next few weeks? If so, I hope this one will be included. I would be obliged to the Minister if he would confirm that to me tonight and I will pass on the information without fear or favour or in any partisan fashion to all the local parents who are so distressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>

I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the current position regarding the provision of improved accommodation at St. Killian's junior and senior schools, Castleview, Dublin 24.</P>
      <P>The junior school has a staffing level of a principal, 13 mainstream class teachers, a learning support teacher, a resource teacher and a teacher for refugees. The enrolment on 30 September 2001 was 361 pupils. The senior school has a staffing level of a principal, 13 mainstream class teachers, a learning support teacher and two resource teachers. The enrolment at the senior school on 30 September 2001 was 390 pupils.</P>
      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates the Government's commitment to improving accommodation in primary schools, such as St. Killian's junior and senior schools, under its expanded school building programme.</P>

      <P>Because of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary school building area since the Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction. This has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity. The Minister assures me that a project to refurbish St. Killian's junior and senior schools will proceed to the invitation of tenders as soon as possible under the expanded building programme.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that the Department of Education and Science is fully committed to the provision of improved accommodation at St. Killian's junior and senior schools. Again, I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position to him and to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this very important issue on the Adjournment this evening and I thank the Minister for coming here to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanatory document sent by the North-Eastern Health Board to all home help and home care assistants stated that people with only one client will not qualify for payment of a travel <Col N="1640" /> allowance and will no longer receive transport expenses from the board. That sent shivers and shockwaves through the entire caring community, those who provide this essential and invaluable service and those who benefit from it. Those people with more than one client would receive payment for those clients but not on the initial journey from home to the first client or from the last client home. To claim payment, employers using a private vehicle must get their motor insurance company to indemnify the North-Eastern Health Board. In some cases that may cost &euro;100.</P>
    <P>The document clearly stated that home carers who attend only one client will not be entitled to payment of travel expenses regardless of the number of times they call to a client on any given day. It also stated that home care assistants currently in receipt of mileage allowance to attend one client are no longer entitled to claim for this journey. This journey is effectively a journey to work for such employees. Where such an arrangement exists they should cease with immediate effect. Can anyone explain how one can classify a one hour call to an aged or handicapped person as a full-time job? This is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that in the past 24 hours senior health board officials have assured me that the 15p per mile allowance will not be taken away from these people and that no one will be worse off as a result of the new regulation. That change is welcome. However, the 15p per mile is not sufficient to cover anyone's costs and few, if any, receive mileage allowance at this level. It is very wrong for the Government to take away cash from these caring people. They provide a service not just for their clients but also for the State by allowing elderly and disabled people to remain in their homes rather than in hospital or a home for the elderly. Many carers told me they have great trouble obtaining their pay and allowances for which they must often wait for months. Most people receive their pay per week so why is that not the case with carers? </P>
    <P>I am aware of the case of two handicapped adults who are looked after by their mother. They used to be able to get two weeks respite care for the handicapped. They have now been advised this is no longer available but their mother has been assured they will receive two weeks in St. Davnet's Psychiatric Hospital if necessary. Their brother died last year and their mother is over 80 years of age. Given the Celtic tiger, is this the sort of treatment these people deserve?</P>
    <P>I have been contacted by the Rehabilitation Institute whose budget has been severely cut. I am sure my colleagues also received this letter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, I wish to address the question raised by Deputy Crawford in relation to the withdrawal of mileage allowance for carers and home helps in the North-Eastern Health Board region.</P>
      <P>The mileage allowance has not been withdrawn from these categories of staff. What has occurred is that the structure of mileage allowance for these categories of staff has been altered. This alteration has occurred as a result of the Part-Time Home Helps Agreement, 2000. The agreement which was negotiated between management and employee representatives conferred full employee status on home helps and home care attendants.</P>
      <P>In accordance with this agreement, the rate of pay for home helps and home care attendants was increased from £4.40, &euro;5.59, per hour to approximately £7, &euro;8.89, per hour. In addition, both were awarded all associated premia, including holiday pay, unsocial hours premium, overtime, Saturday premium and Sunday premium. In general, the home helps agreement was of great benefit to both home helps and home care attendants, improving their working conditions and terms of employment and, in some cases, leading to a doubling of wages for these employees.</P>
      <P>With respect to travel, the agreement increased the amount payable per mile from approximately 15p, 19 cent, to an average of 50p, 64 cent. In line with normal health service practice, no mileage allowance is payable for travel to the first client and from the last client as this is deemed to be the same as a normal employee's journey to and from work. Consequently, home helps and home care attendants are not paid mileage to their first client and from their last client. The agreement, however, makes allowance for adjustments in the context of &ldquo;special local needs and requirements&rdquo;. This permits local management to negotiate deviation from the terms of the home helps agreement on a personal basis with these categories of staff. This will help to ensure any unique case may be judged on its merits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me this opportunity and I thank the Minister of State for coming here to reply to my question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue which has beset those of us who have represented parts of rural Ireland for some considerable time represents what I consider a serious clash of interest, a contradiction in terms of the application of the planning Acts, how they apply and how they are supposed to apply equally as between all members of the public. In my constituency, automatically and without reference to <Col N="1642" /> anyone, An Taisce or its agents examine each planning application for one-off houses in the countryside and lodge objections with An Bord Pleanála. When it does so it is guaranteed success. All that is required is that it submits the objection, quotes planning law, which may or may not be relevant, quotes the spatial strategy outlined by the Minister and quotes the development proposals for the greater Dublin area, all of which serves to reject the planning application on the basis that people who are indigenous to the countryside, who have lived all their lives in the countryside, whose sons and daughters want to live in the countryside and who are able to afford a home on the free sites they will get from their parents in the countryside are deprived of doing so.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to An Taisce for the excellent work it has done in the area of preservation of buildings. However, it has overstepped its authority and responsibility. The Minister makes a small annual subvention to that body. That is an indirect subsidy to facilitate it to do the type of work to which I have referred and to which I strongly object.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to a recent radio programme when the chairman of An Taisce outlined his plans for rural Ireland to the effect that people in the countryside need not be concerned because they would be catered for by compulsorily purchasing land adjacent to towns and villages on which suitable housing would be built for them. A similar policy was carried out in eastern Europe after the communists took over in 1945. The stated grounds for this were economic. It was more economical to keep people in high density locations and remove the possibility of having to provide services for them in the countryside. What services have ever been provided for people in rural areas in any event?</P>
    <P>I find it objectionable that there are bodies acting as agents for An Taisce which are in receipt of the benefits bestowed on that body by the Minister as a consulting body in respect of planning permissions and by a direct subsidy, and which at the same time operate as community objectors and come forward allegedly on the basis of deep and overwhelming concern about what they see as unnecessary and undesirable planning in the countryside.</P>
    <P>It is time we came to a conclusion on this issue. People in the countryside have an entitlement to live there. We still live in a free country. I hope we do not see a scenario where people will be ordered where to live. Unless the Minister takes action on this soon, I fear we are heading down the road of the areas to which I have already referred. This is not the first attempt at the depopulation of the countryside. It was done in the highland clearances in Scotland and it was also done in central and eastern Europe in another time.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister either amend the legislation to reconstitute An Bord Pleanála to ensure the self-serving exercise is not repeated on an <Col N="1643" /> ongoing basis, or remove the consulting role from An Taisce, or will he do a combination of both?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. Under planning legislation, each planning authority is obliged to prepare a development plan setting out the overall strategy for the planning and development of its area. Such plans, in the case of rural planning authorities, include the policy of the authority on the provision of one-off single houses. Decisions on individual applications are a matter for each local planning authority in accordance with its development plan, or for An Bord Pleanála in the case of an appeal.</P>
      <P>Regarding a possible organised campaign of objection to rural housing, all planning appellants are by law required to state the subject matter and full grounds of their appeal and the reasons, considerations and arguments on which these are based. An Bord Pleanála has absolute discretion to dismiss any appeal from whatever source where it is of the opinion that the appeal is vexatious, frivolous or without substance or foundation.</P>
      <P>Rather than maintaining a polarised debate around the issue of one-off housing, I would prefer to see a broader approach being adopted and developed to guide how rural economic and social development opportunities can be realised and rural communities strengthened as well as developing appropriate policies to respond to developmental pressures. There are threats to the rural environment other than one-off housing and the planning system must also address these.</P>
      <P>Regarding single houses in rural areas, it is a long-held policy that it is essential that the farming community and those working on the land or involved in rural-based activities, or people who have local ties, should be able to live in the country. However, on balance, a continuation of the current exceptionally buoyant trends in one-off rural housing would pose challenges in terms of a range of issues such as the viability of public transport, the possibilities for strengthening many of our towns and villages, landscape and tourism and protection of ground and surface waters. All these issues will be considered further in the context of the national spatial strategy which is being finalised.</P>
      <P>While I, as Minister for the Environment and Local Government, have not had any direct discussions with An Taisce regarding housing in rural areas, it made a submission in response to the recent consultation process on the national spatial strategy. The submission included comments on development in the countryside, including the issue of one-off housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness:</NameTxt>
      <P>I preface my remarks by saying that Kilkenny city has played its part in housing asylum seekers and refugees. This issue has nothing to do with racism or the housing of refugees. Indeed, there have been 100 asylum seekers or refugees in Kilkenny for some time and the broader community of Kilkenny city has supported their accommodation as well as individual cases. Furthermore, the community has placed a request before the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to have the appropriate State agencies provide the type of support necessary at the centre in the Ormonde Hostel. Father Willie Purcell and others in Amnesty International have supported this plea because to date the State has not given the necessary appropriate support to the people in Kilkenny. Some 90 to 100 refugees <Col N="1645" /> are housed in the Ormonde Hostel so it is clear Kilkenny city is playing its part.</P>
      <P>This issue concerns the local community. A new site has been obtained on a four year, nine month lease and no consultation has taken place. By sleight of hand, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has engaged with a local landowner and has established a lease on a site. The local community simply wants to be consulted. It wants to understand what is happening and to be part of what is taking place in Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>I have just come from the picket lines in Kilkenny city where the local community feels abandoned by the democratic process. While we discussed openness and transparency at county council meetings, officials from the Department contacted Kilkenny County Council on 7 March and asked for information in connection with a fire safety certificate for the site. They asked that official not to divulge any of that information. Public representatives were not informed until 8 March so the democratic process was totally bypassed. Neither members of the county council nor Members of this House were informed. To this day, I have not yet been officially informed of the interest the Department has in this site or the plans it has for it. I have not been given the right to know by the Government or by the Department and I demand that right for myself and for the local community.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that this order is withdrawn until proper meaningful consultation has taken place with the local community, a community which is constructive and responsible and which has played its part. All it asks is that the democratic process and the mechanisms around it acknowledge that it too has rights. It is a deeply frustrated community at this time. The chairman, Mike O'Brien, is doing his best to ensure that the consultation process is put in place and that people are given the opportunity to have an input, but they are outraged and feel cheated by the system. I have been in touch with the officials yesterday and today and I ask that the contractor, who seems to be assembling the equipment on a site close by, is informed that all activities are suspended.</P>
      <P>There is misinformation in relation to this issue. No information is being given to county council officials or to local public representatives and, given the background of community in Kilkenny city and the constructive, meaningful and caring role it has played to date in its response to human beings in difficulty, public representatives and the Government have a responsibility to ensure that this consultation process is entered into, that no construction is carried out on that site and that no entry is given to the site. I understand through the Office of Public Works that the contract is not yet signed, yet the contractor is in Kilkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much greater clarification is required in this case. I ask that clarification be provided and that, over a period of time, the consultation process is <Col N="1646" /> entered into, that the rights of the local community are understood and that we have a meaningful engagement so we can achieve a constructive end to what has started out as a very sad situation. People turn to their public representatives in a case like this and in this instance we have not been able to help. If I was asked to comment on the help we have received to date from various officials, I would say it has been less than helpful. On behalf of my local community, I demand that we answer the constructive call that has been made to us and that we insist, through this Chamber, on the rights of the local community and fulfil the request for consultation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, I point out that the reception and integration agency is responsible, <i>inter alia, </i>for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers under the system of dispersal and direct provision which was introduced in April 2000. The Reception and Integration Agency is currently providing full board accommodation for close on 5,000 asylum seekers in 81 centres which are situated in 24 of the 26 counties. Some 89 asylum seekers are currently accommodated in one centre in Kilkenny on a full board basis under the system of direct provision.</P>
      <P>In accordance with Government policy on the dispersal and the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers the Office of Public Works, Office of Public Works, arising from a public advertisement, recently secured a four year, nine month lease, effective from the completion of construction, for a site at Leggettsrath, Dublin Road, Kilkenny, on behalf of the Reception and Integration Agency. The site will be used for the purpose of developing a centre for the provision of accommodation and certain ancillary services for up to 250 asylum seekers, including children.</P>
      <P>An order under section 181(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, was subsequently signed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I understand from the Reception and Integration Agency that arrangements are being made to put in place the contract for the construction of the facility. I am advised that the Reception and Integration Agency is making arrangements to meet representatives of local residents prior to the commencement of the site works and no development work will take place until these discussions have been completed.</P>
      <P>The facility in question will be a low-rise accommodation centre, modelled on similar facilities used extensively throughout Europe. It will be similar to other system built centres at Knockalisheen, County Clare, Cork and Dublin and it is anticipated that the centre could come on stream at the end of this year or early next year. Following its completion, placements to the centre will be made on a phased basis over a number of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1647" />The centre will cater, in the main, for families and will incorporate dining, communal, recreational, health and welfare facilities and appropriate landscaping works. In accordance with normal practice, representatives of the Reception and Integration Agency have met representatives of Kilkenny County Council, the South-Eastern Health Board and local residents and will liaise with support service providers, including the South-Eastern Health Board, schools and voluntary groups to facilitate the development of support structures for asylum seekers to be accommodated at the centre. The current rate of new applications for refugee status is approximately 800 per month, and the provision of accommodation and ancillary health and welfare facilities for them continues to be a major challenge for the State. The development of an accommodation centre at Kilkenny is in line with Government policy to meet this challenge and is part of the overall strategy for the provision of up to 4,000 places in system-built accommodation throughout the State, over time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>Data compiled by Forfás for 2001 shows that new full-time jobs created in firms supported by development agencies, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development, Údarás na Gaeltachta and Enterprise Ireland, amounted to 29,791, while job losses in these firms came to 33,353 for the year, giving an overall reduction of 3,562. Job losses were concentrated towards the latter part of the year after strong growth in the first part of the year.</P>
      <P>Information on the numbers of jobs created since the start of 2002 to date is not yet available. In January and February 2002 a total of 4,025 redundancies were notified to my Department. The 2001 outcome reinforces the need for firms in Ireland to increase their competitiveness and re-position in market sectors with greater potential for profitable growth. The strategies of the enterprise development agencies are now firmly fixed on building, and providing the infrastructure for high value-added and knowledge-intensive industries. In addition, the Government will continue to focus on enhancing the country's skills base, improving our infrastructure network, shaping the regulatory environment and encouraging companies to move up the value chain.</P>
      <P>There will continue to be challenges in the year ahead, but many vacancies still exist in the economy and I am confident that, going forward, the Government's policies will be successful in minimising the effects of the difficulties experienced in 2001 with new jobs continuing to be created across a wide range of sectors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no plans to change the role of the Labour Relations Commission. What is envisaged, however, is a refocusing of the activities of the commission to comprehensively embrace all the aspects of its <Col N="1650" /> role. Under the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, the Labour Relations Commission was given general responsibility for promoting the improvement of industrial relations. The Act sets out the detailed functions of the commission including the provision of conciliation and advisory services, the preparation of codes of practice relevant to industrial relations, the conduct or commissioning of research into industrial relations matters and to review and monitor developments in the area of industrial relations.</P>
      <P>In the years since its establishment, the Labour Relations Commission has become an important part of Ireland's industrial relations landscape. It has worked hard to promote good industrial relations in the economy and has provided first-rate conciliation and advisory services to its clients. The environment in which the Labour Relations Commission operates is undergoing a period of rapid and significant change. In such an ever-changing environment it is important for an organisation like the Labour Relations Commission to take a long hard look at how it carries out its role and to examine the services it provides to ensure that they remain relevant to its clients.</P>
      <P>In this context, the commission embarked last year on a comprehensive review of its strategy and direction for the period 2002-04. Following this review, the commission published its strategy framework 2002-04 earlier this year. The key points addressed by the strategy framework are the identification of challenges for the future and a set of strategic actions which the commission will take over the next three years to ensure the effective fulfilment of its remit. I fully support the commission's strategy and, together with the Department of Finance, my Department has agreed terms of reference with the commission for a review of its staffing and operations which will commence shortly. The terms of reference cover: functions of the Labour Relations Commission; industrial Relations Act, 1990; providing a conciliation service; providing an industrial relations service; preparing codes of practice relevant to industrial relations after consultation with unions and employer organisations; offering guidance on codes of practice and help to resolve disputes concerning their implementation; appointing equality officers of the commission and provide staff and facilities for the equality officer service &ndash; service transferred to the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations in 1999; selecting and nominating persons for appointment as rights commissioners and providing staff and facilities for the rights commissioner service; conduct or commission research into matters relevant to industrial relations; reviewing and monitoring developments in the area of industrial relations and assisting joint labour committees and joint industrial councils in the exercise of their functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Key points of the Labour Relations Commission strategy framework are that it identifies the following major strategic challenges for the <Col N="1651" /> future: continues to deliver effective service; needs to anticipate and adapt to change; corrects positioning in the industrial relations sector; maintains and effective and committed workforce; maintains support from principals.</P>
    <P>In order to meet the challenges identified earlier, the commission outlines the key responses that will be needed: a clear, focused goal and mission; fast, effective dispute resolution; focused, relevant and timely inputs to develop and improve Irish industrial relations; focus on client needs and service levels; adapting to change; communications and education; management, resources and organisation.</P>
    <P>On the strategic action programme the commission has decided on a number of actions designed to meet the challenges it faces. With regard to dispute resolution &ndash; conciliation service it will continue to provide and upgrade conciliation service; publish deadlines for making hearings available; clarify prioritisation policy and contact points; encourage appropriate use of rights commissioners; review and revise policy on post-Labour Court involvement and investigate provision of mediation and arbitration services.</P>
    <P>With regard to dispute resolution &ndash; rights commissioners it will review the future organisation, resourcing and management of the rights commissioner service; encourage use for individual and small group disputes not involving wider policy issues; encourage Government as employer to use the rights commissioner service and will consider the need to structure guidelines, standards, procedures and accountability.</P>
    <P>On development and improvement of industrial relations it will review scope and value of services and modify if needed; upgrade frequent user initiative and feedback results; execute further sector reviews in selected areas; carry out focused research to agreed annual programme; confirm effectiveness and upgrade efficiency of diagnostic audits; evaluate codes of practice and propose future policy; consider means to increase effectiveness of code on essential services; review impact and response to non-compliance with established procedures and evaluate operational effectiveness using client surveys.</P>
    <P>On client needs and service levels it will implement feedback system on client experience with LRC; develop and publish client service charter; programme annual meetings with major users; organise focused workshops on specific issues; further develop education programme and extend website and database co-operation.</P>
    <P>On relationships in the industrial relations sector it will maintain good relationships with primary agencies and client groups; win active support and backing for LRC's future role; ensure early involvement in development of new legislation; participate in development of Irish inputs to EU directives; organise annual meetings with specialist agencies and finalise and implement autonomy agreement with D/ETE.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1652" />On range of services it will confirm and strengthen the LRC's two core roles &ndash; dispute resolution and dispute avoidance; develop voluntary mediation package for small claims; consider offering selective arbitration service and investigate future role in and lessons from new growth economy.</P>
    <P>On communications and education it will publish comprehensive quarterly bulletin; consider optimum image for effective communication; encourage reportable focused research outputs, often jointly executed; it will hold regular meetings with key players; investigate joint organisation of national forum; enhance website and consider e-business role and implement a comprehensive education programme.</P>
    <P>On management, resources and organisational issues it will upgrade top management focus on external relations, organisation, systems, resourcing and delivery of priority action programmes; create new senior position responsible for upgrading information services and day to day management; back up operational staff with improved executive support; maintain full current services staffing with experienced personnel; appoint senior information officer with back up; broaden recruitment base to whole public sector; implement formal training and development programmes for staff; further develop innovative resourcing for specific tasks and complete the review of staffing levels-grades with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no immediate plans to change company law in relation to the disclosure of ownership of shares in a company. However, it is important that the legislative provisions relating to the ownership of shares be re-examined. Accordingly, I have requested the company law review group to examine the whole area of shares and share capital as a priority topic in its current work programme.</P>
      <P>Under section 125 of the Companies Act, 1963, a company is required to file, once at least in every year, an annual return with the Companies Registration Office. This return must include a list of the past and present members of the company and details of the number of shares held by each member. Section 123 of the Companies Act, 1963, provides that the identity of the persons entered in the register of members kept by the company and as notified to the registrar of companies must be the legal owners of the shares and not the beneficial owners where these are different from the legal owners.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these provisions is to create legal certainty for a company in its dealings with the registered owner of the shares and means that the company is able to treat the registered shareholder as owner of the shares for all purpose without regard to any contract or agreement that may exist between the legal owner and third parties.</P>
      <P>There is a legal requirement, under section 59 of the Companies Act, 1990, for the beneficial interest in a company's shares to be disclosed by a company's directors, including shadow directors, and by the company secretary. This information must be recorded in a separate register kept for that purpose by the company and be publicly available. Failure to so disclose is an offence. There is no provision under company law for the disclosure of interests by a third party where the third party is not a director, shadow director or secretary of a company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1654" />Sections 14 and 15 of the Companies Act, 1990, empower the Director of Corporate Enforcement to investigate and enquire into the ownership of a company while section 16 empowers the director to impose restrictions on the transfer of shares where he encounters difficulty in his inquiries being made pursuant to sections 14 and 15. Furthermore, the beneficial interest in shares may be required to be disclosed on foot of a court order under section 98 of the Companies Act, 1990.</P>

      <P>The company law review group, in its first report, published 28 February 2002, recommends the establishment of a commercial division within the High Court to deal with business-to-business and business-to-State litigation. I was pleased to see that almost exactly at the same time as the company law review group made its recommendations in this area, the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure recommended to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that a commercial court should be established on a pilot basis. That report also proposed consideration of an arbitration centre to service the commercial court. I fully support the principle of establishing a more specialised approach to commercial cases with a view to concentrating expertise and increasing the efficiency of dispute resolution and thereby diminishing costs. I have asked my Department to pursue with the Courts Service how best this can be achieved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>I have asked Forfás to commission a study to analyse relative price levels and changes in Ireland and other euro zone countries. PricewaterhouseCoopers has been selected to undertake this study. The objective of the study is to compare the absolute prices of a balanced subset of the products covered in the consumer price index and to explore the factors that determine and influence price differentials. These include incomes, wage and other input costs, taxation, regulation, logistics and the level of competition. The study will also analyse the consumer price inflation figures for 2001 and early 2002. It will seek to ascertain whether the rate of increases in prices coinciding with the introduction of the euro was of a higher order than might have been anticipated and compare the rates of increase that occurred in Ireland with other euro zone countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked that a report on the preliminary findings be submitted to me by mid-April. As the terms of reference are comprehensive and lengthy, I propose to circulate them directly to the Deputies and in the form of a tabular state<Col N="1657" /> ment with the Official Report of these proceedings.</P>
    <P>Terms of Reference</P>
    <P>
      <i>Part A:</i>1. Analyse relative price levels and changes in Ireland and other euro zone countries using all available existing data, including data on computer price indices, purchasing power parities, and underlying exchange rates, where relevant. Address issues of convergence and divergence over time.</P>
    <P>2. Where data is available from national statistics institutions and/or other sources, make direct comparisons of the price levels of individual goods and services and baskets of goods and services, harmonised and weighted to maximise international comparability.</P>
    <P>3. Ideally the objective would be to compare the absolute prices of a balanced subset of the products covered in the consumer price index across a selection of euro zone countries. However, at this stage, no primary research is required. The consultant should indicate the availability and scientific robustness of data available to this end.</P>
    <P>4. Discuss fully the factors that determine and influence price differentials, in particular differences in income, wage costs, input costs, taxation, regulation, logistics, levels of competition, etc.</P>
    <P>5. Produce a report, presenting the findings of the exercise, drawing out implications for competitiveness and standards of living, and making policy recommendations where appropriate.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Part B:</i>6. Within the context of 1 and 2 analyse the consumer price inflation figures for 2001 and 2002 to ascertain whether price rises coinciding with the introduction of the euro were of a greater extent than would have been anticipated from the current trends and particular circumstances. In doing this, focus on particular categories and types of goods and services where appropriate. Compare consumer price inflation in the changeover period in Ireland with inflation in other euro zone countries over the same period, again with reference to current trends and particular circumstances. Incorporate findings in report as above.</P>

      <P>Decisions on the underwriting of insurance risks and the setting of premiums are matters for judgment by individual private insurance companies and EU law prevents either me or my Department from intervening, directly in the matter. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover, based on their assessment of that particular risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the transposition into Irish law of the EU Third Framework Insurance Directives in 1994, insurance companies authorised in any one member state may provide insurance cover throughout the EU on the basis of their home country authorisation. This has opened up the Irish market to competition from insurance providers in other <Col N="1659" /> EU countries. I have encouraged such competition. In addition, I believe that the removal of the cap on brokers' commission will encourage further competition in the Irish market. The decision of the Government to establish a Personal Injuries Assessment Board seeks to address the issue of the high cost of settling claims, by achieving a reduction in the delivery cost of personal injury compensation. This should make the marketplace more attractive and encourage more entrants.</P>

      <P>Following the announcement on 28 February 2002 of the closure of the glass container manufacturing facility in Ringsend, Dublin, the Labour Relations Commission invited both unions and management to exploratory talks. The LRC met with the parties on 7 March 2002, and put a proposal to both sides with a view to securing the future of the plant in Ringsend. Both the company and the trade unions agreed to the proposal and formal talks are now taking place under the auspices of the LRC. The talks are ongoing. I understand the parties are working steadily and constructively and that progress is being made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, known as the Health and Safety Authority, is the State body charged with overall responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace safety and health. Matters arising from this responsibility are, therefore, a day-to-day function of the authority. Statistical information concerning the number of fatalities and injuries in any work sector is collected by, and obtainable directly from, the authority.</P>
      <P>I have, however, been informed by the authority that there were 22 construction-related fatalities in 2001, of which 14 were workers in the construction sector, four were members of the public and four were workers in other sectors involved in construction activities. The number of accidents in the construction sector, resulting in more than three days absence from work, reported to date to the authority, for 2001, is 1,200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The management of health and safety standards in the construction sector, as in all sectors of employment, requires the fulfilment of their <Col N="1661" /> respective responsibilities and duties by all parties concerned. There is already in existence a strong occupational health and safety legislative code, including detailed regulations dealing specifically with the construction sector. A partnership approach to safety, as embodied by the Construction Safety Partnership, is crucial in underpinning ongoing improvements in safety standards in the construction sector. The CSP, which is composed of representatives of the CIF, ICTU and SIPTU as well as the HSA and other relevant Departments and agencies, is working to a detailed three-year plan to improve safety, health and welfare standards in the construction industry. The plan contains a range of measures to improve safety consultation and safety representation, safety training and the introduction of safety management systems.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment the CSP has overseen significant progress in a number of areas including, most recently, the development of amendments to the construction regulations. These legislative amendments took effect on a phased basis from the 1 January of this year. They are extremely significant in that they introduce, for the first time, the concepts of mandatory safety training and mandatory safety representation while also providing for better on-site welfare facilities. A further full review of the construction regulations is also under way under the auspices of the CSP.</P>
    <P>In addition, legislative proposals to amend the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, are presently being developed at departmental level. These legislative proposals focus, in particular, on the issues of offences, penalties, safety representation, safety training and safety management and the introduction of a range of penalties to a graduated range of offences, both for summary prosecutions and for prosecutions on indictment is being proposed.</P>
    <P>The proposals will shortly be submitted to Government for approval and following legal drafting, it is expected that a Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill, 2002, will be published later this year. A strengthened and updated Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, will of course be of benefit to all sectors of employment, including the construction sector.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of the revised construction regulations the State continues to play its role in the effort to improve health and safety standards in the construction sector, through the provision of a strong legislative base and the provision of the associated training, advisory, inspection and enforcement services.</P>

      <P>While employers' liability insurance is not compulsory in Ireland, surveys carried out indicate that approximately 90% of companies were covered, either by commercial or self-insurance. The introduction of a statutory requirement for limited liability companies to have certain minimum levels of insurance cover in place, while trading would be a radical departure from existing practice. The Deloitte &amp; Touche management consultants' report on insurance costs in Ireland back in 1996 pointed out a number of possible disadvantages to having compulsory employers' liability insurance: distortion of the market; special arrangements being needed to insure bad risks, as in the case of motor insurance, possibly increasing premiums overall; companies that currently do not have insurance are unlikely to have the highest safety standards; difficulties with restrictions on market capacity; and possible negative effect on safety in the workplace.</P>
      <P>There is also the possibility that general insurers in other EU member states might be discouraged from writing business in the Irish market, if employer liability cover were compulsory, since they would have to participate in arrangements designed to ensure that all risks could receive a quote. They would also have to contribute towards an uninsured employers fund. While I accept that there are also possible advantages to having compulsory employers' liability insurance, I believe that any such proposal would need very careful consideration and would involve detailed consultation with the social partners.</P>

      <P>Gifting schemes have some of the characteristics of pyramid selling. Pyramid selling is covered by the Pyramid Selling Act, 1980. However the Office of the Attorney General has considerable doubts as to whether gifting schemes are covered by the Act. The gardaí who enforce the Act take the view that these schemes are not covered by the Act. We are still exploring the legislative option as well as administrative steps which might be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main difficulty with any legislation seeking to deal with a complex problem of this kind is to steer a course between making very specific provisions which may be circumvented by future developments of the targeted schemes and, on the <Col N="1663" /> other hand, catching bona fide arrangements such as savings and spending schemes. One of the options which I am looking at is the possibility of dealing with gifting schemes under gambling legislation. I have asked my officials to explore this possibility with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In the meantime I would repeat my previous warnings that people should be extremely cautious in investing their money in schemes which appear too good to be true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest quarterly national household survey, QNHS, for the fourth quarter of 2001 shows that the unemployment rate increased to 4.0%, or 72,600 persons, from 3.9% in the same quarter in 2000. This compares with a rate of 10.3% in 1997. Long-term unemployment remained static at 1.2% or 21,300 persons in the fourth quarter. A a year earlier the rate was 1.4%, while in 1997 it was 5.6%. The latest seasonally-adjusted live register total for February 2002 is 160,800. This compares with 137,900 a year earlier and 260,800 in February 1997. I should also point out that employment increased by 42,600 in the year to the fourth quarter of 2001. The latest employment figure of 1,752,900 compares with 1,379,900 in 1997, that is, an increase of 373,000 in the number of people at work.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the increase in unemployment has taken place since September 2001. The recent increase is due in the main to the global economic slowdown, particularly in the technological sector. There is a general view that unemployment will rise in 2002 but that good economic and employment growth will return in the medium term. The Department of Finance in its stability programme forecasts an unemployment rate of 4.75% in 2002 and employment growth of 1.4%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As notified in Ireland's employment action plan, 2001, the main elements of the Government's employment policy are to promote employment growth and employment for all who seek it; to mobilise labour supply, including through increased female participation, equal opportunities and a balanced increase in immigration, in order to contribute to a consistent, strong, sustainable and non-inflationary level of economic growth; to enhance labour quality through education, training and in particular lifelong learning in order to strengthen the employability of individuals and to promote competitiveness and adaptability in firms; and to promote the economic and social inclusion of excluded <Col N="1664" /> persons, eliminate long-term unemployment and prevent future drift into long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>The EAP also gives details of the many programmes and measures which implement this policy approach. The employment action plan is prepared annually in response to guidelines agreed by the European Union under the EU's employment strategy. The 2002 EAP is currently under preparation. Given the positive medium-term outlook I do not envisage any significant change to the Government's overall employment policies as outlined in the 2001 EAP.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that there will be challenges in the coming year as jobs are lost and workers seek new employment. FÁS, which has a budget of &euro;870 million in 2002, will continue to work to ensure that anyone who is seeking employment will have the opportunity and skills to do so. In particular, FÁS will continue its approach of intervening with those facing redundancy to put them in touch with job or retraining opportunities.</P>

      <P>FÁS currently provides a comprehensive service to workers who are threatened with, or affected by, redundancy. The service typically involves engaging at an early stage in intensive interviews with workers to identify their needs and provide information on the supports and services available from FÁS. Redundant workers are referred to available jobs, training courses or other options appropriate to their individual requirements. Where necessary, FÁS will establish special or customised training courses for workers to address their up-skilling needs, either through direct provision or through external training providers. Flexible approaches may include evening and Saturday courses, e-learning options and customised training. FÁS is also developing broader personal supports to people affected by the trauma of redundancy, including advice on personal and financial matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the services offered directly by FÁS, the implementation of a strategic framework for lifelong learning will be essential to ensure that workers develop a portfolio of transferable skills which will enhance their capacity to move between jobs in response to economic and technological change. Key elements of such a framework should include the development and implementation of a national framework of qualifications; development of basic skills, especially literacy, numeracy and IT skills; improved infor<Col N="1665" /> mation and guidance; and specific measures to address training in the workplace.</P>
    <P>My Department has written to a range of social partners and training providers seeking proposals for initiatives which might be included in a new measure on in company training being developed under the employment and human resources development operational programme. I would welcome proposals for the retraining of workers as part of that measure.</P>

Analysis of how the system has been operating, together with changes in the wider economic environment, has led to the introduction of the new procedures for recruitment of non-EEA personnel introduced with effect from 2 January last. The objective of the new arrangements introduced in January, which require employers considering seeking a work permit to first engage with FÁS placement services, is to ensure that a genuine attempt is made to source personnel from the domestic and or wider EEA area. The experience of this new procedure will help inform future policy in this area.

      <P>Prior to these acquisitions, Scottish Radio Holdings owned four regional newspapers and held a 24% stake in Today FM. SRH has no other interests in radio or other media in the State. As a result of the acquisitions they now control Today FM and five regional newspaper titles. In clearing the proposals under merger law, I recognised the fact that the newspaper sector continues to be dominated by a single player and, despite increasing levels of competition from radio broadcasters, RTE is still the main radio operator. Given the fact that Today FM and these relatively small regional newspapers would become part of a larger group, I believed that the acquisitions were positive developments in relation to competition in the media sector generally.</P>

      <P>In accordance with EU law, we cannot require insurance companies to notify us of increases in insurance premium rates. Accordingly, our Department does not have authoritative statistics on premium increases. However, we are very much aware of increases generally in insurance premiums for most types of cover and of the difficulties that this is creating for some businesses and for some people seeking motor insurance. I would be very concerned that any business might consider it necessary to reduce employment levels, due to such difficulties.</P>
      <P>I am arranging to meet the Irish Insurance Federation and representatives of the main insurers here, once again to discuss these difficulties. I will be encouraging them to develop, in consultation with their clients, innovative strategies for controlling risk. It is my hope that such strategies will contribute towards a moderation of prices. Meanwhile, I await the final report of the interdepartmental implementation group, which was set up to progress the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, so that the board may be set up as quickly as possible. The Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, has finalised its report and arrangements for its printing and subsequent publication are now being made. Further work to improve health and safety standards in the workplace is also in progress.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern at the increase in the level of job losses here in recent months. These events are a consequence of the slowdown over the past year or so in the world economy, the most severe in almost 30 years. The situation has been exacerbated by the increased uncertainty following the events of 11 September in the US.</P>
      <P>Where closures or major job losses occur, the services of the agencies of my Department are available to work closely with the companies involved in addressing the difficulties arising for them and to engage directly with those facing redundancy to find alternative employment or training. These agencies, which include IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development, FÁS and the county enterprise boards, also work closely with the county development boards and county councils as well as local development and other interests in areas affected by job losses in order to facilitate an integrated development approach and to promote a favourable environment for business.</P>
      <P>As regards the impact on rural areas, the Government is committed to a policy of a more even geographical distribution of investment and job creation. Figures for 2001 show an improved regional balance of job creation by the State development agencies, with the BMW region accounting for 25% of gross job gains, compared with 20% in 2000 and 17% in 1999.</P>
      <P>It is also necessary to see recent job losses in the context of our record level of job creation over the past few years. Over the life of this Government, the number of people in employment has increased by over 300,000. I believe that, because of the policies this Government has pursued, the necessary fundamentals are in place for Ireland to take advantage of a recovery in the world economy when it occurs. It is necessary that we continue with these policies, and that we address those factors which impact on our competitiveness, in areas such as the cost environment for enterprise, infrastructure, for example, telecoms, transport and energy, education and training, and research and development. How we manage these issues will be critical to future success in attracting investment and in job creation. This in turn will largely determine our continuing ability to provide replacement employment where job losses occur.</P>

      <P>My Department co-ordinates and oversees the early warning system for companies in difficulty. Apart from formal notification procedures under the Protection of Employment Acts and the Redundancy Payments Acts, the early warning system is operated through my Department in co-operation with the State development agencies, which notify it of firms experiencing difficulty, including potential job losses. The procedures for identifying jobs at risk are monitored on an ongoing basis with a view to ensuring that the system is operating as effectively as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim is to ensure, as far as possible, that information is available on companies in difficulty, and to enable the agencies to assess what, if any, supportive action might be appropriate. The effectiveness of the early warning system depends on the willingness of firms to inform the agencies of their <Col N="1671" /> difficulties. However, despite the best endeavours of the Department and the State agencies, responsibility in the final analysis for decisions on employment rests with the firms themselves.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of the difficulties being experienced by young people in obtaining motor insurance. The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies. EU law prevents both me and our Department, from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels, or in respect of the risks insurance companies are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk.</P>
      <P>The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors, both domestic and international, to explain these increases, including the high cost of settling claims, the general reduction in investment returns, recent court decisions regarding the calculation of compensation losses in personal injury cases and the affects of the 11 September attacks, in the United States of America.</P>
      <P>The work of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, has included an examination of the cost of motor insurance for young people. I received a briefing from the MIAB chairperson, backed up with a proposed final draft of the report, last week. I noted the progress made, and the chair's plans to bring the matter to a speedy conclusion. The board met on Thursday last and formally ratified the final text.

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>The labour mar<Col N="1672" /> ket situation has changed dramatically in Ireland in recent years. Since 1997, employment has grown by 25.6% and unemployment has fallen to 4% from 10.3% in 1997. Long-term unemployment is currently recorded at 1.2%. This represents a tight labour market characterised by vacancies in all sectors and at all skill levels. The recent rise in unemployment has been brought about mainly by short-term factors such as the global economic downturn, particularly in the technological sector. There is a general view that unemployment will rise in 2002 but that good economic and employment growth will return in the medium term.</P>
      <P>In the context of relatively low unemployment, a tight labour market over the foreseeable future and the need for continuous upskilling of those in the workforce, I believe that the future strategy of FÁS should be based on greater mobilisation of labour and skills, particularly from at home, to meet the needs of a developing economy; more training for jobseekers and people in work to ensure that they remain employable in the face of change; continuing to improve outcomes for unemployed people and marginalised people, including early intervention to counteract the risk of long-term unemployment; and a new emphasis on services to employers to maintain skills and competitiveness.</P>
      <P>In response to the changed labour market conditions and taking account of the foregoing concerns FÁS engaged in a strategic review and published its new strategy in December last. The key elements of the new strategy are a significant emphasis on services to employers and employed people; a greater focus on mobility and flexibility, through the upskilling of the workforce; further development of the standard-based apprenticeship programme, including further educational-training options for craft persons; the provision of portable skills for employees; the promotion of employment through greater mobilisation of labour supply, from all available sources; and more assistance to help people to move from unemployment into employment.</P>
      <P>It should also continuing to improve services for unemployed people, particularly those who are marginalised with an emphasis on a focused approach, tailored to individual needs; using the employment service as a gateway to all labour market services; and a guarantee of service to unemployed people. This shift in focus will be supported by an increased commitment to quality and standards in all FÁS activities; regular review of FÁS services and programmes, to assess their continued relevance in a rapidly-changing environment and to identify changes that may be required; putting in place a best practice human resources strategy, and the necessary organisational structures and systems, to ensure the flexibility to implement change rapidly, efficiently and effectively; and openness to alternative delivery systems and the building of working partnerships and alliances with other service providers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1673" />FÁS has and will continue to play a major role in the meeting the labour and skills requirements of the economy and in tackling unemployment. The FÁS budget remains significant. In 2002 its total operating budget is over &euro;870 million and it has the capacity to engage with up to 100,000 people on training or employment programmes.</P>

      <P>Large-medium scale projects by their nature have special requirements in relation to infrastructure &ndash; in particular they are a large user of utility services such as power, water, gas, waste disposal.

      <P>IDA Ireland is examining the long-term infrastructure requirements necessary to be put in place at Belview to service the needs of large-medium scale industry wishing to locate there, and has appointed consultants to report on the extent of the services required and the cost implications for the provision of these special services. Preliminary indications are that there is a substantial investment required in providing the required power, gas and water supply necessary for the type of large-medium scale industry envisaged for the Belview Port area.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the legal proceedings to which the Deputy refers and <Col N="1674" /> also of the fact that one of the parties concerned was willing to accept, for the purpose of those particular proceedings, that he controlled the Master Meats Group in 1987. I take it that the Deputy is referring to a merger notified to the Minister on 14th September 1988 under the Mergers Act relating to the acquisition by Master Meats Anstalt &ndash; a Liechtenstein company &ndash; of Paschal Phelan's 50% shareholding in Master Meats.</P>
      <P>In the 1988 notification it was stated that the acquiring company was backed by &ldquo;Middle Eastern interests&rdquo; but no further information was given as to the principals behind the company. There was a considerable amount of urgency associated with the notification as the company was in financial difficulties and the proposal was cleared by the Minister that same day. It subsequently came to light that Mr. Phelan's business partner, Mr. Taher, had previously sold his 50% stake in Master Meats to another Liechtenstein company &ndash; Taros Anstalt &ndash; in April 1987. It also emerged that the shareholders of Taros Anstalt were a Mr. Schneider, Mr. Mansur and a Mr. Hardman and that negotiations on their behalf were conducted by Mr. Larry Goodman.</P>
      <P>The takeover of Master Meats and related issues was the subject of an investigation by the Fair Trade Commission in 1989. In giving evidence to the commission, Mr. Goodman stated that that he was not a beneficial owner of shares in Master Meats and that the Minister had been made aware of the identities of the three shareholders before the 1988 transaction was notified. However, my Department has no record of any meetings between the Minister and Mr. Goodman in that regard.</P>
      <P>The more recent history regarding these matters is that on 14 November 2000 Paschal Phelan initiated proceedings in the High Court against Messrs Goodman and Taher claiming a conspiracy to force him out of the company. During a preliminary court hearing Paschal Phelan's lawyers lodged a notice of motion for discovery of certain documents held by my Department relating to the 1988 notification. Mr. Goodman's counsel then said he would be willing to assist the court in accepting, for the purpose of those particular proceedings, that Mr. Goodman controlled the Master Meats Group in 1987.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the implications of this and I have asked my officials to examine all the issues involved and to take legal advice in pursuing the matter.</P>

      <P>The Competition Authority has been provided with adequate resources and its current authorised staffing levels correspond to the outcome of a review by the consultants, Deloitte &amp; Touche, of the structure, operations, resource requirements, business processes and IT systems in the authority. The central recommendation of the review was that the staffing complement of the authority be increased to 44, a level which I am satisfied will be sufficient for the authority's statutory responsibilities going forward. Prior to the review, the authorised complement was 24. The 20 additional posts cover a range of grades and the process of filling the vacancies is now almost complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The authority's budget in the period 1998 to 2002 has increased from a figure of &euro;1.111 million to &euro;3.33 million representing a recognition of my commitment to ensuring that the authority has <Col N="1676" /> adequate resources to discharge its statutory responsibilities. I have received a copy of the Competition Authority's strategy statement which refers <i>inter alia</i> to the need for the authority to have adequate resources to discharge its statutory responsibilities. References to adequate resources are natural in any planning or strategy statement and I will continue to keep the resources requirement of the authority under review in the light of any additional responsibilities which it is undertaking.</P>

      <P>There has been considerable interest in the social economy programme since its launch in September 2000. To date, there have been 575 applications received from community and voluntary groups for business plan grant support. A total of 446 business plan grants have been approved. There have also been 173 social economy businesses approved for full grant funding. These comprise grant contributions towards the recruitment of a manager and employees, training, capital, accountant and auditor services and overheads.</P>
      <P>The social economy enterprises approved are located both in urban and rural areas around the country. There are several examples where complementary supports from other programmes have been sourced which will help enhance the viability of the social economy enterprise. A total of 115 social economy enterprises had commenced operations by the middle of March 2002. These employ 556 grant supported employees. The range of activity which enterprises have been approved for includes management of community facilities, cultural and heritage services, transport services for the disabled, community child care and parental support, support services for the elderly and recycling services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the expectations to the end of 2002 the budget for the social economy programme for 2002 is &euro;20.5 million. In addition to the 115 enterprises, which have commenced operations, there are a further 60 enterprises which have been approved for start up funding and are due to commence operations over the next few months. In line with the budget available for the year FÁS regions will then be considering the number of current business plan proposals which may be approved for full grant start up. Such business plans will be assessed by the local working groups and then FÁS on the basis of the objectives set out in the social economy programme framework document, programme guidelines and criteria, locally agreed priorities <Col N="1677" /> and the funding available. FÁS will also seek to ensure a balanced regional uptake.</P>

      <P>The job initiative programme is an active labour market programme for persons unemployed for five years or longer and over 35 years of age. The primary objective of JI is to assist long-term unemployed persons to prepare for work opportunities available in the open labour market.</P>
      <P>The maximum number of places available on the programme has remained constant since 1999 at 2,875 per annum and will remain at this level for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>Access to JI is currently somewhat restricted as a number of participants still remain on JI having completed their full three-year entitlement. However, a new high supports process which will target persons with employability barriers has recently been developed by my Department in consultation with the social partners, and should assist such persons to make the transition to work in the open labour market. I hope to be in a position to announce details of this process very shortly.</P>
      <P>I recently approved the introduction of a new team leader position on the JI programme, which will provide essential management, administrative and operational support for these projects. This will facilitate more effective training and development structures, and improve the overall service to participants. I am confident that this in turn will improve participants' prospects to progress to employment or to other positive outcomes, following their term on the programme.</P>
      <P>As provided under the PPF, an overall review of active labour market programmes is to be undertaken, and discussions in this regard have recently commenced under the PPF Standing Committee on the Labour Market chaired by my Department. The future policy direction of active labour market programmes, such as JI, will be further informed by the outcome of this process.</P>

      <P>The sale of the former Irish Steel Limited to Ispat was finalised on 30 May 1996. As part of the sale agreement, the following were the main commitments given by Ispat: to maintain the business for a period of five years &ndash; this commitment was adhered to; to employ an annual average of 300 permanent employees for a five year period &ndash; this commitment was adhered to; to invest £5 million working capital &ndash; this was carried out on 30 May 1996; to carry out a capital expenditure programme amounting to £20 million over a six year period, that is, until 30 May 2002 &ndash; this capital expenditure programme was still under way at the time of the closure of the plant in June 2001 and my Department was notified that expenditure was on schedule, with an amount of at least £17 million having been spent at the time of the closure of the company; to spend an amount of at least £2.36 million on environmental works &ndash; these funds had been included in the cash injection by the State and my Department was notified that the works had been carried out.</P>
      <P>Ispat also undertook to repay two State guaranteed loans which had been taken out by the former Irish Steel Limited, one from the European Coal and Steel Community of which $14 million remained to be paid at the time of the sale, and one from the ACC Bank of £10 million. The ECSC loan was fully repaid in 1999. However, the ACC loan had not been due for repayment until 2003, but on liquidation of the company, the full amount outstanding became payable. The State has paid the ACC Bank an amount of £8.37 million in settlement of its claim under the guarantee, but the State will be fully reimbursed this amount from counter cover which was put in place at the time of the sale. This counter cover included a letter of credit for £4 million which was put in place by Ispat. Also, as part of the State aid package at the time of the sale, the State had deposited £4.617 million in a joint Escrow account with Ispat on condition that this was to be held on deposit until both the ACC loan and the ECSC loan were repaid. The funds in the Escrow account could be withdrawn by the State if it was called upon to pay out under the loan guarantees. The State has now withdrawn funds from the Escrow account in the amount of £5.56 million and is now claiming the balance of its outlay under the guarantee from the letter of credit. It is expected that the amount paid by the State on foot of the guarantee will be fully recouped in the near future.</P>
      <P>Matters in relation to the leasehold arrangements do not affect my Department but are being examined by a group of officials from the Departments of Finance, Defence and Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the conditions set by the State, European Commission Decision 96/315/ECSC of 7 February 1996 authorising state aid for the former Irish Steel Limited linked to the sale process to Ispat, also set certain conditions. As part of the <Col N="1679" /> conditions under which the aid was authorised, the European Union imposed certain restrictions on production and sales by the company until June 2000. The EU also imposed a restriction on capacity increasing investment by the company until May 2001, whereby the liquid steel capacity could not be increased above the existing level of 500,000 tonnes per annum, and the existing hot rolling capacity of 343,000 tonnes per annum in finished products could not be increased, other than resulting from productivity improvements. The European Commission monitored the compliance of the company with these conditions over the five year period to May 2001 and was satisfied that the company complied with these conditions.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State's statement was based on information provided by the IDA and was correct at the time it was made. The question of withdrawing his statement or correcting the record does not, therefore, arise.</P>
      <P>The company was approved grants in January 2000 towards a major expansion of the operation with investment in additional building, plant and equipment which would lead to total employment of 500 people, that is, an additional 240 jobs. The investment would allow the company to become an integrated manufacturer capable of handling large scale orders and successfully compete in the automotive sector. Since its start up in 1964, the company has been approved research and development, capital, employment and training grants. The company has met all its commitments to the IDA. Total grants paid to date by the IDA are &euro;3,269,697 or £2,575,096.</P>
      <P>The company also received training support grants from FÁS, totalling &euro;974 &ndash; £767. In December, 2001 the expansion of the facility was well under way, with employment of 655 people &ndash; 525 permanent and 130 temporary employees &ndash; ahead of target. The company continues to employ approximately the same numbers as in December, 2001. IDA Ireland has advised that the company is currently in an over-manning position in the short-term following the recent downturn in the automotive industry. It is seeking to retain as many jobs as possible and has put in place a three day five day rotation to ease the situation. It is confident of brighter prospects later in the year. IDA Ireland is closely monitoring the situation.</P>

      <P>The work permits section is currently processing applications received approximately ten weeks ago, compared with an average waiting period of eight weeks in late 2001. The processing time for work permit applications has risen due to the unprecedented number of applications that continue to be received in the Department. The number of work permit applications increased from an average of over 350 per week in 2000 to over 825 per week last year. The level of applications continued to climb during the year and in December alone an unprecedented 5,690 applications were received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the beginning of January 2002 the backlog of applications awaiting decision was 7,000, but this has now been reduced to under 2,400. New FÁS procedures were introduced from the beginning of this year and this has resulted, at least temporarily, in a reduction in the number of applications received in my Department. In January 2002 the figure was down to an average of 325 <Col N="1682" /> complete and valid applications per week while in February 2002 the figure was averaging 487 per week. Increases in staff resources and overtime facilitated the issue of over 36,000 work permits last year compared with 18,000 in 2000. Already this year, over 8,400 permits have been issued. The Department is continuing to examine options for significantly reducing the processing time for the issue of work permits.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69, 71, 72 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies. European Union law prevents both me and the Department from intervening on the matter of premium levels or in respect of the risks insurance companies are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk.</P>
      <P>While the Department does not receive official information in relation to insurance increases, I am very much aware of the increases that are currently taking place. The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors, both domestic and international, to explain these increases, including the high cost of settling claims, the general reduction in investment returns, recent court decisions regarding the calculation of compensation losses in personal injury cases and the effects of the 11 September attacks in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1683" />Representations being made to me suggest that many businesses seek insurance cover from sources outside Ireland. Availability from these sources has contracted, as capacity in the international market has been impaired following the events of 11 September last. I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by businesses, including the transport industry, in getting cover even at very high premiums. I am arranging to meet the Irish Insurance Federation and representatives of the main insurers here once again to discuss these difficulties. I will encourage them to develop, in consultation with their clients, innovative strategies for controlling risk. It is my hope that such strategies will contribute towards a moderation of prices.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, I await the final report of the interdepartmental implementation group, which was set up to progress the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, so that the board may be set up as quickly as possible. Further work to improve health and safety standards in the workplace is also in progress.</P>

    <P>Job creating investment also arises from those overseas companies which are already in operation in Ireland and which expand their operations here. There have been successive record numbers of new jobs created in 1998, 1999 and 2000. The year 2001 was the toughest for a long time for many companies in the ICT sector, but some companies continued to grow. The 13,145 new jobs created during 2001 showed a strong performance considering the state of the global economy and is better than anything achieved before 1996. Ireland continues to perform <Col N="1684" /> strongly when compared to other European economies.</P>

    <P>The K2 subhead funds training for those in employment and those seeking employment. The main FÁS programmes associated with the K2 subhead are apprenticeships, training support scheme, business training, evening courses, specific skills training, traineeship, community youth training, local training initiatives, return to work, community training workshops, local employment services and specialist training providers for people with disabilities. It is expected that FÁS will have a throughput of 46,000 trainees on all training programmes in 2002 compared to 44,951 in 2001.</P>
    <P>The K3 subhead funds FÁS employment schemes. The community employment programme is by far the largest of these with nearly 31,000 participants on the programme at the start of 2002. The number of participants on CE has been falling in recent years due to the mainstreaming of certain essential services which had been provided through the CE scheme, for example, caretakers and classroom assistants in schools, and because of the tightening conditions in the open labour market. It is expected that participation on the scheme will fall to 24,000 by the end of 2002. During the year total throughput on the scheme will be of the order of 44,000. Other programmes include job initiative, the social economy programme, the supported employment <Col N="1685" /> programme and the pilot employment programme. The latter two programmes are for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The FÁS budget has been broadly maintained in recent years. In the light of the labour market situation, where unemployment has fallen from 10.3% in April 1997 to 4% in the final quarter of 2001 and long-term unemployment has fallen from 5.6% in April 1997 to 1.2%, I consider the budget for FÁS to be adequate. More recently, FÁS has been very active in assisting companies and employees facing closure or lay offs. In such circumstances it engages directly with employees facing redundancy and offers alternative employment or training. The budget for 2002 will allow FÁS to continue to intervene if it proves necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland conducts some trade with virtually every country in the world, even if it is at an extremely low level in some cases. The Government, through Enterprise Ireland, supports the development of Irish exports by working with individual companies to move into markets where they are not already active, even if other Irish companies are already active there, by working with companies to improve their market penetration in markets where they are already active and seeking to encourage companies to take advantage of opportunities in markets where Irish industry generally has not had planned, strategic activity previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For exporters, it is important to take a strategic approach to market development and as a Government it is important for us to take the same kind of strategic approach. While Enterprise Ireland has worked with many companies individually to develop their market strategies, it has also worked to ensure that the level of activity of Irish companies in some key markets is developed. Examples of such activities in some of our key overseas markets include the fact that the UK market is our largest overseas market accounting for 44% of indigenous exports or &euro;4.6 billion in 2001, a 4% increase on 2000. This is a credible performance in difficult world trading conditions, particularly in the later part of 2001. First time and emerging exporters continued to provide a feedstock of companies for intensive in-market development. Some 77 companies exported for the first time in 2001 and 32 companies doubled their 2000 export performance. More than 250 companies participated in 58 in-market activities and a further 315 carried out in-<Col N="1686" /> depth market assessment to focus on long-term marketing strategies for the UK.</P>
    <P>The sharp downturn in the US economy in 2001 slowed the rate of sales growth by Irish companies doing business in the market. However, many of them are performing much better than had been expected and a positive outturn is anticipated. The number of offices established by Irish companies in the US, primarily in the high tech sectors, increased by 20% during 2001 to a total of 249. Enterprise Ireland is stepping up its marketing support for client companies in the US in response to market challenges to help improve the positioning of the companies and their business solutions. An office has been opened in Washington DC to assist new market entrants to that region.</P>
    <P>Asia is growing in importance as a market for Irish companies. During 2001, 50 companies participated in the largest ever trade mission to Japan and more than 80 itineraries were organised in China involving 50 companies. The eur:opp 2003 strategy to develop opportunities for Irish companies in continental Europe was intensified in 2001. In addition to in-market action, extensive work was carried out with 120 companies in a highly focused way to increase their level of business. Some new presences were established in the form of sales offices, distributors and assembly operations.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland established a Europe wide network of market experts to provide companies with specific sectoral intelligence and to develop high level contacts and networking. This activity generates critical sales leads and speeds up market entry. Enterprise Ireland is also building on its overseas incubator network which facilitates the establishment by Irish companies of a market presence which keeps them close to their customers. It started this year with 11 incubators worldwide incorporating 36 units compared with two this time last year with ten units.</P>
    <P>In the United States, Enterprise Ireland has successful incubators in Silicon Valley, New York and Boston and has recently established a new office in Santa Monica with a particular focus on digital media companies. Enterprise Ireland participated in an exploratory mission to Argentina and Brazil in the latter half of 2001 and continues to explore export opportunities in South America. Across Europe, it has established incubator space in Paris, Munich, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Vienna. This year it will open new business accommodation in Dusseldorf and Madrid. In Asia, incubators are already in place in Singapore, Tokyo and Shanghai, with one in Beijing about to be established. What this means is that at any one time right across the globe, 36 Irish companies will be able to use these offices on a rotating arrangement as a base from which to develop the markets.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is committed to increasing the flow of start-ups through a strong, aggressive promotional focus to sourcing entrepreneurs via <Col N="1687" /> targeted marketing strategies aimed at various segments.</P>

      <P>The most recent assessment carried out by the European Commission, the European Competitiveness Report, 2001, ranks Ireland first in the Community in terms of real GDP growth, as well as under headings such as employment growth and labour productivity during the period 1995 to 2001. Overall, Ireland scored higher over a range of competitiveness indicators than most other member states.</P>
      <P>The National Competitiveness Council has also ranked Ireland's competitiveness under a number of headings. The indicators under the heading, non-labour enterprise costs, in the annual competitiveness report, 2001, include telecommunications, energy and property costs and are identified by the council as areas where cost increases have been evident. In respect of telecommunications and energy costs the Government is committed to a policy of market liberalisation, competition and deregulation which will lead to lower costs for both industry and the consumer.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the contribution which these cost increases make to the overall competitiveness of the enterprise sector. However, the level of charges in these areas is now the responsibility of independent regulators, who operate under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise. I understand that, in arriving at their decisions, the regulators must take into account the likely effect of such costs on Irish business.</P>
      <P>In so far as commercial and residential property costs are concerned, I understand the rate of increase in residential property prices has moderated recently, albeit from the extremely high rates recorded in 1998 and 1999. Our competitiveness determines our success in winning markets, investment and maintaining and improving living standards and overall prosperity. There are many factors that impact on our competitiveness. Maintaining and improving our competitiveness will continue to be a key priority of Government policy.</P>

The main recommendations requiring State action include the designation of the Health and Safety Authority as the central co-ordinating State agency, the establishment of an advisory committee on workplace bullying within the Health and Safety Authority, the introduction of three codes of practice on workplace bullying and harassment under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, and the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the development of a dignity in the workplace charter.</P>
      <P>Progress to date includes the establishment of the advisory committee and a bullying response unit within the Health and Safety Authority and the development and launch of the dignity in the workplace charter which has been endorsed by the ICTU, IBEC and CIF and widely distributed to individual businesses. In addition, all three codes of practice on workplace bullying and harassment have been completed and will be publicly launched next week. They will be administered by the Health and Safety Authority, the Equality Authority and the Labour Relations Commission. The codes will act as a reference point for the agencies in offering advice and assistance to both employers and employees in relation to workplace bullying. They will be an invaluable source in providing guidelines on arrangements, procedures and best practice in tackling workplace bullying and harassment at enterprise level.</P>

      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency report, Water Quality in Ireland 1998-2000, presents an overview of the quality status of the State's surface and groundwaters for the <Col N="1689" /> period under review. The report states that of the 164 lakes examined in the west, 158 were classified as oligotrophic or mesotrophic while the remaining six showed signs of nutrient enrichment. In this classification Lough Cullen is oligotrophic and Loughs Mask, Carra and Conn are mesotrophic. In relation to the latter three lakes the report notes that fluctuations in angling returns and excessive growths of shoreline plants and algae have suggested unsatisfactory levels of localised enrichment and led to widespread concern about their future welfare. However, the quality of the open waters of these lakes is consistent with mesotrophic or satisfactory conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland remains deeply concerned about the levels of debt in many developing countries. Before recent international debt initiatives, the level of public debt owed by the group of 41 poor countries classified by the World Bank as heavily indebted, HIPC, rose sharply in relation to gross national product, GNP &ndash; from under 50% in 1980 to more than 160% by 1995. Debt service consumed almost 30% of Government revenue &ndash; exceeding combined central government expenditure on health and education. At the same time, human development indicators were deteriorating in many countries, as a result of poverty and the impact of the HIV-AIDS pandemic. Aid flows were also stagnant or declining.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been a strong supporter of the heavily indebted poor countries initiatives, which have sought to help these countries achieve a sustainable exit from debt. In all, 38 of the 41 HIPCs are now judged as potentially eligible for HIPC relief and it is estimated that the other three could reach sustainability through traditional relief mechanisms. Total committed assistance is estimated at more than US$34 billion.</P>
      <P>The progress which has been achieved in securing debt relief would not have been possible without the powerful global campaign of such groups as Jubilee 2000 and its successor Drop the Debt. Such campaigns have brought together an effective coalition of NGOs, celebrities and international political figures in support of debt cancellation. The debt campaign has resulted in a much closer dialogue between Governments, international organisations, NGOs and other interested groups.</P>
      <P>Such powerful advocacy campaigns have also helped focus public attention on key development challenges. The debt campaign has been followed up by other important campaigns as the need to make sure that international patent law does not inhibit access by poor countries to life saving medicines. The campaigners have presented the concerns of poor countries clearly and have helped to interest the public in often complex development challenges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland Aid recognises the need for further debt relief, bilateral and multilateral. Ireland Aid's approach to the issue will be guided by a <Col N="1693" /> comprehensive debt strategy which will be published shortly. The Government has provided significant funding to help relieve the burden of debt on poor countries. Since September 1998 the Government has contributed £31.5 million to the World Bank, the IMF and national debt funds in Mozambique and Tanzania. Ireland has also paid a proportionate share of the EU contribution of over &euro;1 billion to debt relief. This has amounted to approximately &euro;6 million. In addition, Ireland Aid has recently made a contribution of &euro;5.71 million to the HIPC trust fund earmarked in favour of Ethiopia. Further and more substantial contributions are anticipated in the coming years in line with the expanded Ireland Aid budget.</P>

      <P>The person named initially applied for 200.41 hectares of forage land on his 2001 area aid application, but, on 15 May 2001, he amended his area aid application to reduce his claimed area to 69.95 hectares. His application has been processed on this basis. The person named was paid &euro;3895.61 on 25 September 2001 under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme in respect of 14.72 hectares of more severely handicapped land, lowland, at &euro;88.88 per hectare and 45.28 hectares of mountain land at &euro;57.14 per hectare, maximum eligible area in this case is 60 hectares. As a result of the amendment to his 2001 area aid application all his lands are now classified as mountain land attracting payments at a rate of &euro;57.14 per hectare up to a maximum of 60 hectares. As the grant payable on 60 hectares of mountain land is &euro;3428.40 he was overpaid by &euro;467.21 on 25 September 2001. This amount was recouped from the final instalment of the 2001 ewe premium scheme.</P>
      <P>Following a thorough review of the area-based compensatory allowance scheme, proposals were submitted to the European Commission for increased payment rates for farmers with mountain-type land. The proposals involve making a payment of &euro;101.58 per hectare on the first ten hectares of mountain-type land with a payment of &euro;88.88 per hectare on each remaining hectare subject to an overall payment ceiling of 45 hectares. However the environment directorate of the European Union have indicated that they are not willing for this increased payment to be approved by the Union's star committee until Ireland have made a formal decision in relation to the implementation of the nitrates directive. Ongoing discussions are taking place between the Department of Environment and Local Government and the farming organisations in this matter. Subject to securing the necessary EU approval it is intended that the revised payment rates will apply to the 2001 scheme.</P>

      <P>The provisions of the Control of Horses Act, 1996, allow for grant assistance to be given by my Department towards the costs incurred by a local authority in implementing the Act. This can be taken to encompass local authority involvement in and support for a horse project, where the local authority considers such involvement and support to be an integral part of its implementation of the Act within its functional area. My Department has already provided, via the relevant local authority, grant support of &euro;2.4 million since 1997 to the Cherry Orchard Horse Project. That project is by a very considerable margin the horse project which has received most funding from my Department.</P>
      <P>Where horse projects are concerned, funding is oriented towards capital costs, whereas I understand that the additional funding sought in this instance by the Cherry Orchard project relates essentially to current, running costs. Dublin Corporation, which is the local authority concerned, has explicitly accepted that the provision by my Department of financial support towards the capital costs does not commit the Department to meeting running costs. In this regard, any degree of reliance on the part of any horse project on funding from my Department in order to meet its running costs would be unsatisfactory from its own perspective, not least because the indefinite continuance of such funding cannot be guaranteed.</P>
      <P>The funds available to my Department to assist local authorities in their implementation of the Control of Horses Act are, in any given year, limited. In the current year, such funds are of the order of &euro;2.5 million. My Department must from within such a sum endeavour to meet demands from many local authorities throughout the country. Those involved in the Cherry Orchard project have already been informally advised that my Department is not in a position to provide the additional funding now sought.</P>

Kildare County Council had agreed to make a site available at <Col N="1698" /> Newtown House. However, an appeal was lodged with An Bord Pleanála against the demolition of Newtown House. The appeal was upheld.</P>
      <P>An advertisement was placed in national and local papers in October 2000 followed by a selection process from which a site adjacent to the local catholic church and the local gaelscoil was considered suitable. Negotiations on the acquisition of this site have proved problematic. While some of the difficulties that arose have been resolved, there remains the question of whether vehicular access can be made compliant with local authority standards. It seems unlikely that this issue can be resolved to our satisfaction.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that under section 888, of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, health boards are required to supply details to Revenue regarding payments of rent subsidies to qualifying tenants. These have been supplied since the legislation was introduced in 1995-96 via the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>It is accepted that when this legislation was first introduced the manner in which records were kept by the health boards meant the material supplied was insufficient for Revenue to ensure full tax compliance. Since these returns did not contain all the required information, they proved difficult to match with Revenue records. However, the returns received since 1999 have contained additional information that enabled Revenue cross check landlord details with Revenue records.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, discussions took place between Revenue, the health boards and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs officials in October 2001 with a view to further improving the transfer of information to Revenue. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the arrangements now in place with the health boards and the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs are adequate to enable Revenue to identify unregistered landlords and are a valuable source of information in ensuring tax compliance.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Finance, my recruitment responsibilities are essentially confined to the Civil Service. Such responsibility in other areas of the public service rests, in general, with the various employing public bodies, under the aegis of relevant Ministers.</P>
      <P>The buoyant economy and related demand for human resources mentioned in the Deputy's question have indeed posed significant challenges for Civil Service recruitment in recent years. These challenges have, however, been met with a vigorous and effective response, and the Civil Service is not now significantly affected by the &ldquo;service gaps&rdquo; referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service Commission, as the primary recruitment agency for the Civil Service, has held competitions more often where necessary, and produced a faster, more efficient throughput of suitable candidates by streamlining selection methodologies. This strategy, along with special targeted competitions, including competitions aimed at re-hiring former civil servants, has succeeded in removing previous shortfalls in the supply of personnel to Departments.</P>
      <P>The commission's strategy has been complemented by measures taken by my Department which should consolidate and enhance the attractiveness of Civil Service employment. These measures include substantial enhancements in family-friendly working schemes, and reforms which allow for faster promotion through general service grades.</P>
      <P>Against this overall background, it is important to affirm that persons aged over 60 years are a valuable and valued part of the Civil Service workforce. While most such persons were recruited at a considerably earlier age, the recruitment of persons aged over 60 years can occur through normal open competitions, for which an upper age limit of 65 years applies.</P>

      <P>Mr. Justice Morris has advised the Eastern Regional Health Authority that he will be unable to carry out this case review due to additional work commitments following recent government assignments which he has been asked to undertake.

      <P>The terms of reference of the case management review are: to carry out a review of the case history of the young woman concerned including the role of the Northern Area Health Board as the provider of health and child care services in the circumstances leading to the tragic death of the young woman; to review the nature and timeliness of the responses of the health and child care services to the welfare and needs, including developmental needs, of the young woman concerned; to examine the adequacy of the health and child care services provided to the young woman concerned by the Northern Area Health Board in the state including the services available to her after she reached the age of 18; arising from this review to make recommendations relating to the future management of such cases; and to prepare a report for publication on all of the above, acknowledging that the rights of privacy and confidentiality attaching to the young woman concerned and her family must be respected, and recognising that this may restrict the inclusion in such report of some material, ascertained during the course of the review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, a child is eligible for orthodontic treatment on the basis of defects <Col N="1701" /> noted at a school health examination carried out while the child is attending national school. There is no application process <i>per se</i> as children in specific classes in national school, usually in second, fourth and sixth class, are dentally screened and referred for orthodontic review as necessary.</P>
    <P>The historical difficulties encountered by the Western Health Board (WHB) in delivering orthodontic services were not inconsiderable. Its current backlog of cases is largely derived from staff losses incurred between 1995 and 1999. In mid-1996, the board lost its consultant orthodontist leaving it with no consultant cover until mid 1997 when one was recruited. Consequently, during that period, almost no patients were taken off the board's waiting list for treatment even though patients were still been added to it. This adverse staffing situation inevitably increased future waiting times for treatment.</P>
    <P>However, for 1997, the chief executive officer of the WHB reported that 3,035 persons were awaiting orthodontic treatment. The position at the end of the December 2001 quarter was that there were 1,605 category B persons waiting for treatment. This is a reduction of 1,430 and represents clear and unambiguous progress by the regional orthodontic unit there in addressing its waiting list.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the board has further informed me that at the end of the same quarter, there was no waiting time for category A patients &ndash; those requiring priority treatment &ndash; and that the treatment waiting time for category B patients &ndash; patients with less severe problems than category A patients &ndash; is 42 to 48 months. The corresponding figures for 1998 and 1996, reported by the chief executive officer to my Department, are 30-36 and 18 months respectively.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the WHB has also informed me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter, there were 1,511 patients in treatment in the board. This is an increase of 83 patients in orthodontic treatment in comparison with the corresponding figure at the end of the June 2001 quarter.</P>
    <P>Currently, two dentists from the Western Health Board are in training at the Dublin Dental School and Hospital for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. Both are due to qualify in June this year. Furthermore, the additional funding of &euro;0.628 million allocated to the Western Health Board in 2001 for orthodontic services, includes &euro;0.533 million for an orthodontic initiative in the board. The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has informed me that a specialist in orthodontics has been recruited and commenced working in the board's orthodontic unit in late November last year. The board has also engaged the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, I expect that these combined developments will further increase the number of persons in orthodontic treatment and reduce the <Col N="1702" /> number of category B persons awaiting treatment in the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The information supplied on foot of Parliamentary Question No. 158 of 9 May 2001 related to the turnaround time for processing smears in the Royal College of Surgeons at that time. I am advised by the Eastern Regional Health Authority that the average time, from arrival of a smear in the RCSI laboratory to the issuing of a report, is now 13 weeks. The ERHA further advises that urgent requests are at all times given priority treatment and that the average turnaround time from the arrival of an urgent smear in the laboratory to the issuing of a report is generally less than two weeks.</P>
      <P>If a smear test requires the expert opinion of pathologists, the processing of that smear may take longer, to ensure that the patient gets the benefit of opinion of a number of pathologists. The authority has stated that the RCSI laboratory receives an average of 40 to 50 smears marked urgent per week. Unfortunately the prioritising of so many smears can delay the screening of routine smears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ERHA has advised that the waiting time for the reporting of smears can vary throughout the year, as it is dependent on factors such as the number of specimens received in the laboratory, and the availability of trained and experienced staff to offset the workload. In February 2002 there was a 40% increase in the workload of the RCSI by comparison with February 2001. As the RCSI is the major service provider in Ireland using liquid based cervical cytology, enormous interest in its services has been generated from GPs who have been unable to utilise this new <Col N="1704" /> technology from other large cytology screening laboratories. In addition, the RCSI runs a training programme in an effort to increase the supply of trained cervical cytology technicians. The ERHA has further advised that it is continuing to try to recruit new staff, but due to a large number of vacancies at present in cervical cytology laboratories throughout Ireland, this remains a difficult task.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that 63% of all smears nationally are analysed within the eastern region and that this level of demand puts increased pressure on turnaround times and staffing. Additional funding has been provided by my Department in 2001 and 2002 to the ERHA to fund the introduction of liquid based technology in the processing of cervical cytology smears in the various laboratories within its functional area, the purchase of additional equipment and to employ extra staff. It is intended that the additional staff and improved technology will result in an increased capacity for processing smears for the region in the medium to long-term.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the implementation of pay awards rests with the health boards. However, I have been advised that the new pay scales have been implemented in full in all health boards to date other than in the East Coast Area Health Board. In the case of this board I understand that payment of the award will be made very shortly. My Department has, therefore, asked the chief executive officer of the ERHA to investigate the matters raised by the Deputies in relation to payment of the award in the ERHA region and reply directly to the Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Alternative medicines including herbal and trad<Col N="1705" /> itional medicines are distinct types of medicinal products. In many instances these medicines are used in conjunction with conventional medicine rather than as an alternative to it. In order to gain the most from medicines such as these, it is essential that they are licensed by an appropriate authority to ensure that, like all other medicines, they are of appropriate quality, safe for use, and can be expected to act in accordance with any claims made. It is clear that many of these medicines have a tradition of use that is indicative of potential benefit. The value of medicines such as these can best be realised when there is a formal mechanism for assessing them and a subsequent means of monitoring their use in order to clearly determine any potential benefit.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board has recently submitted to me a proposal for an interim national licensing scheme for traditional and alternative medicinal products including herbal medicines. This scheme is in line with proposed European legislation in this area and will assure consumers that the traditional medicinal products which they buy are produced to an appropriate quality and can be expected to act in accordance with any claims made.</P>
      <P>As a follow-up to the publication of its proposals for an interim licensing system, I have asked the IMB to organise a seminar for interested parties which will offer further scope to review the reports implications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned about delays being experienced by applicants for inter-country adoption assessment. Under the Child Care Act, 1991, each health board has responsibility for the provision of an adoption service in its area. Additional funding of &euro;2,101,000 or £1,655,000 has been provided over the last four years to reduce the time spent by couples on the waiting lists for inter-country adoption. I outlined to the House yesterday, 20 March 2002, in Question No. 350, the detailed measures which are being taken in this regard.</P>
      <P>Under the Adoption Act, 1991, the Adoption Board has responsibility for making declarations of eligibility and suitability to adopt a child from overseas, having regard to an assessment report carried out by an Irish health board or registered adoption society. Currently it takes the Adoption Board approximately eight to ten weeks to process first time applications and six to eight weeks to process second time applications, provided there are no outstanding queries in respect of the application.</P>
      <P>As regards medical reports I am advised that in some instances the Adoption Board may decide to seek the opinion of an independent medical or health professional. In such cases, the Adoption Board selects a suitable person to give an opinion on the case and the applicant is then invited to attend the individual concerned for examination. If an applicant had a particular difficulty with the independent medical or health professional selected by the board, their views would be considered by the board.</P>

      <P>The provision of health centres, including the prioritisation, planning and development of such centres, to meet the needs of local communities within its functional area, is a matter for the relevant health board or the Eastern Regional Health Authority. In the case of Ardara this responsibility rests with the North-Western Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been advised by that health board that a new primary care centre for Ardara has been included in its priorities for capital developments under the national development plan and will be progressed in line with available resources. It is intended that the project will be progressed in partnership with the local community, through the local conference of the Society of St. Vincent <Col N="1707" /> de Paul and Donegal County Council. It is hoped that the development will form a central element of a much larger development, encompassing a social housing scheme and community resource facilities-day centre for Ardara.</P>

      <P>A common list of reimbursable medicines was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme. This list ensures equity between the GMS and DPS in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. This common list is subject to ongoing review and amendment on a monthly basis as new products become available and deletions are notified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order for any item to be included in the common medicines list it must comply with a published list of criteria. These range from their authorisation status where appropriate, their price and in certain cases the uses for which the prod<Col N="1708" /> ucts are intended. In addition, the products should ordinarily be supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public. As the product referred to by the Deputy does not have product authorisation from the Irish Medicines Board it does not qualify for inclusion on the common list of reimbursable medicines.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be pleased to learn that a protocol, a copy of which is included, was drawn up to set out the circumstances and conditions in which a necessary unlicensed medicine may be reimbursed by the State, where lawfully supplied. Applications for reimbursement which meet the circumstances and conditions set out in the protocol should be made to the relevant agency, that is the General Medical Services (Payments) Board or the local health board.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be pleased to know that a 2.5 mg and 5 mg strength of the product referred to, as well as an elixir form, are included in the common list of reimbursable items.</P>

      <P>Bad debts relates to bills issued by the boards for provision of services which are known to be uncollectible. The provision for doubtful debts is made by reference to an age analysis of outstanding debts. The bad debts and associated provisions primarily relate to patient charges.</P>
      <P>The figures in the following table are taken from the annual financial statements for the relevant years and were audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Department of Health and Children's accounting standard for health boards set out the accounting treatment for bad and doubtful debts. Accordingly, there are no other written off debts in the annual financial statements not included in these figures.</P>

      <P>The Health and Safety Authority of Ireland has not been requested to report into the consequences of the fluoridation of public water supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I established a forum on fluoridation in May 2000. It is comprised largely of persons with expert knowledge spanning the areas of public <Col N="1710" /> health, dental health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, health promotion and representatives from the consumer and environmental areas. The forum held its first meeting in September 2000.</P>
    <P>Its terms of reference are to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies and the programme of research being undertaken on behalf of health boards in the area and to report to the Minister. The forum invited the public to forward their views on the issues under consideration and received in excess of 1,000 submissions, each of which has been examined. Its website is http://www.fluoridationforum.ie which gives details of the forum's progress.</P>
    <P>The forum's chairman has informed me that he expects to present its report to me in the near future. I will not pre-empt the outcome of its deliberations.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland requested its scientific sub-committee on additives, contaminants and residues to conduct a risk assessment in relation to the issue of infant formula reconstituted with fluoridated water. This report will be available in the near future.</P>

      <P>The information which the Deputy is seeking is not readily available in my Department. The HSEA undertakes a quarterly survey of nursing resources. The most recent survey was published in December 2001 and provides national data and analysis in relation to the nursing workforce on 31 October 2001.</P>
      <P>This survey indicates that the recruitment of nurses continues to run strongly ahead of the numbers leaving with a net increase of 1,896 nurses in the system. While all sectors reported that recruitment was well ahead of resignations-retirement, employers reported that 1,322 vacancies existed at 31/10/01. These circumstances arise where the volume of additional nursing posts being created outstrips capacity to recruit. The combination of utilising agency nurses and overtime working provides the equivalent of around 1,150 full-time nurses to the service to cope with difficulties arising in the provision of services while employers continue the recruitment process to fill vacancies.</P>
      <P>The figures for 31 January are currently being collated by the HSEA and should be published in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>The hospital in-patient waiting times and the numbers on waiting lists as at 31 December 2001, in the format collected by my Department, are being communicated separately to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The number of people on public hospital waiting lists in December 2001, the latest date for which figures are available, was 26,126. This figure represents a decrease of 1,731 or 6% on the comparable figure for December 2000. The number of adults waiting more than 12 months for treatment in the target specialties has fallen by 14% over the period December 2000 to December 2001. The number of children waiting for more than six months for treatment in the target specialties has fallen by 3% over the same period.</P>
      <P>The new health strategy which I launched recently, will provide a framework for the reform of the acute hospital system and improved access for public patients. It includes a plan covering the actions required to address the issue of waiting lists and particularly waiting times. The target set out in the strategy is that by the end of 2004 no public patient will wait longer than three months for treatment. A new dedicated treatment purchase fund will be used for the purpose of purchasing treatments for public patients, either from private hospitals in Ireland or, if necessary, from abroad.</P>
      <P>The single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. In this context a comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted in both the acute and non-acute sectors. I recently announced the commissioning of an additional 709 acute beds in public hospitals at a cost of &euro;65 million. This is the first phase of the provision of an additional 3,000 acute beds over the period to 2011, as announced in the health strategy.</P>
      <P>The strategy outlines further measures which are designed to address the issues of capacity and efficiency in the delivery of services. A strategic partnership will be developed with the private sector in providing services for public patients and a national hospitals' agency will be set up to plan the configuration of hospital services. I am confident that these measures will result in a more accessible and equitable acute hospital system for public patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. I have taken a range of important measures to improve the capacity of the public orthodontic services and place it on a sound long-term footing. Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service such as the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>Six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North-Eastern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training last October for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. My Department has provided &euro;0.541 million in 2002 for specialist in orthodontics training. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence this year are also under way. The grade of orthodontic therapist will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling a greater volume of treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Post Graduate Medical and Dental <Col N="1714" /> Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School, to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately &euro;1.27 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
    <P>In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. An additional six-surgery facility and five-surgery facility at the Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit and the St. James' Hospital regional orthodontic unit, respectively, have also been developed under the initiative. My Department is exploring with boards every possibility to expand the level of services in the short-term such as the use of private specialist orthodontic practitioners and the treatment of patients in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    <P>My Department has also funded the development of new regional orthodontic units at Dundalk and Navan &ndash; both of which are operational &ndash; and the recruitment of a consultant orthodontist for the Midland Health Board who was appointed last year. The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me of the following information on their orthodontic waiting lists as at the end of the December 2001 quarter:</P>

    <P>Patients in category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I announced a &euro;40.63 million investment package, in the winter of 2000-01, aimed at alleviating service pressures and maintaining services to patients, particularly in the acute hospital sector, over the winter period. The investment package was targeted at a number of areas, including the recruitment of an additional 29 accident and emergency consultants and 19 consultant anaesthetists. My Department has been advised by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and by the health boards that to date, 12 accident and emergency consultants and 11 consultant anaesthetists have been appointed.</P>
      <P>When I approved the additional accident and emergency consultant posts, I requested Comhairle na nOspidéal to undertake a review of the structures, operation and staffing of accident and emergency departments. Comhairle has undertaken a lengthy consultative process involving health boards and health professionals and their report, the publication of which I understand is imminent. This report not only deals with the staffing of accident and emergency departments at consultant level but also links reform of accident and emergency departments with the need to look critically at hospital processes and patient flows through the hospitals. The Comhairle report will provide valuable advice on the structures of our emergency services and the necessary linkages which will be required to eliminate the delays in emergency departments which we are all familiar with. I expect the Comhairle report to clear the way for the filling of the outstanding posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding was also provided for the contracting of additional private nursing home places by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. These places are for patients whose acute phase of treatment has been completed, but who require additional care in an alternative setting. The ERHA and the health <Col N="1716" /> boards contracted more than 700 beds under this initiative in the winter of 2000-01, and this helped to free up acute beds for patients awaiting admission to hospitals. Funding was also allocated to the ERHA and to each health board for the contracting of private nursing home places for the final three months of 2001 and up to end of March 2002.</P>
    <P>The provision of medical appliances and aids is essential in facilitating the discharge of older persons from hospitals and in reducing the level of hospital re-admissions. Additional funding was provided as part of the investment package for the provision of a range of supports including walking aids, wheelchairs and special beds.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Health Strategy &ndash; Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for you &ndash; recently published by this Government. The health strategy outlines a programme of investment and reform of the health services starting immediately and continuing up to 2011. As part of the preparation work for the strategy my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners, conducted a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs. On foot of the subsequent report entitled Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &ndash; A National Review, which I published in early January, the Government decided, in the context of the strategy, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. I announced, on 16 January, a &euro;65 million investment package in the current year for the commissioning of 709 of these 3,000 beds in acute hospitals and these will come on stream before the end of this year.</P>

    <P>There are no radiographer vacancies in the Mid-Western, North-Western and Western health board areas.</P>
    <P>While BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, was unable to screen women as quickly as anticipated due to difficulties in recruiting sufficient specialised radiographers, this matter has since been resolved and BreastCheck is currently on target for completion of phase one of the programme, covering the ERHA, Midland and North-Eastern Health Board areas, by the end of December 2002. The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and my Department's key objective to ensure that the programme is driven by international quality assurance criteria and best practice. BreastCheck is currently in consultation with the health boards concerning the roll out of the programme nationwide. My Department will continue to support BreastCheck in moving to national coverage as soon as is practicably possible, having regard, in particular to the experience gained in putting phase one of the programme in place.</P>
    <P>The national cervical screening programme requires no radiographer input. The chief executive officers of the health boards are currently examining the feasibility and implications of extending the programme nationwide.</P>
    <P>My Department, along with the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority are currently addressing the issue of radiography staff shortages within the public health sector in the context of the provision of additional places on existing radiography courses. This resulted in an increase of 150%, plus 15 places, in therapeutic radiography places in Trinity College, Dublin in 2001. The expert group report on radiography grades, published in July, 2001, endorses this important step and reaffirms the need the assess the requirement to further increase student places. The report also includes a number of key recommendations to improve career structure, boost retention and promote continuing professional development.</P>

      <P>The average waiting time for a driving test at the Dungarvan driving test centre is 15 weeks. This is generally in line with the average for the south east region which currently stands at 13 weeks. I understand the period referred to in the question is from 11 March to 5 April. This includes three short working weeks. Testers are not normally rostered outside of their headquarter centre during such weeks.</P>
      <P>Testers are assigned to the Dungarvan test centre having regard to the level of demand for tests there and in the south east region generally and takes account of the operational requirements of the service. Over the past year the equivalent of just under one tester per week has been scheduled for testing duties in Dungarvan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 714 on 31 January 2002. Statutory responsibility for the provision of drinking water supplies and for upholding the prescribed quality standards rests with sanitary authorities. Stringent quality standards are prescribed in the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988. The duty placed on sanitary authorities to ensure that drinking water meets these standards is performed under the general supervision of the EPA. Information on drinking water supplies in Kilkenny and elsewhere is contained in the EPA report on The Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland 1998-2000, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library. This indicates that, with some exceptions such as the Kilkenny City supply, the overall quality of public water supplies in Kilkenny was satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The upgrading of the Kilkenny City supply is amongst the projects approved under my Department's water services investment programme 2000 &ndash; 2002, at an estimated cost of &euro;8.25 million. Planning of the scheme is progressing. A brief for the appointment of a consultant to prepare a preliminary report has been submitted to my Department by Kilkenny County Council for approval and will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Deficiencies were identified in respect of approximately half of the group water schemes monitored in Kilkenny in 2000. The major drive under way to tackle quality problems in this sector is detailed in the reply to Question No. 714 of 31 January 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 143 and 144 together.</P>
      <P>Rathcroghan is the name given to an area comprising several townlands in which there is a significant complex of ancient monuments. For several centuries it has been equated with the celebrated royal site of Cruachain of early Irish epic literature. Rathcroghan today comprises a collection of several different types of monument &ndash; enclosures, burial mounds and other earthworks &ndash; scattered over some 1,000 hectares, four square miles, of elevated ground. It is the combination of certain monument types in an elevated position which distinguishes the Rathcroghan complex and which affords comparison with sites such as Tara, County Meath.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the contents of the information note, prepared in January 2002 by the National Roads Authority for the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure which identified the area between Bellanagare to Strokestown as being very rich in archaeology particularly near Rathcroghan and this would pose a significant constraint in relation to upgrading of the N5 Longford to Westport route.</P>
      <P>I understand that in March 2001 Roscommon County Council and the NRA commissioned a study of the Roscommon section of the road. The aims of the study were: to determine an overall strategy for the route and to formulate a five year restoration programme to quantify the remedial works required to restore the N5 to satisfactory condition.</P>
      <P>This report is nearing completion but it will clearly identify that the area in the vicinity of Rathcroghan &ldquo;contains an extremely dense network of important archaeological features&rdquo; and that this area &ldquo;is a no-go area from a road development point of view&rdquo;. While no formal exclusion zone has been designated in this area, my Department would be obliged to have full regard to the contents of this report. My Department would have serious concerns with any major development in the Rathcroghan area notwithstanding any mitigation strategy, such as extensive archaeological excavation, that might emerge. Indeed, the code of practice that I agreed with the NRA in 2000 has the objective of undertaking very early planning so as to avoid this type of development impact on our archaeological heritage.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the code of practice is working well and my Department is still in discussions with the NRA with regard to options for the N5 in the Rathcroghan area. These discussions are expected to be concluded in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 145 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's overall policy on the protection of the archaeological heritage is set out in the publication Framework and Principles for the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage. Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, has responsibility for the protection of some 120,000 archaeological sites and monuments included in the record of monuments and place under The National Monuments Acts, 1930-1994. In practice, Dúchas works in close liaison with the land use authorities, mainly the local planning authorities, in helping to protect these sites and monuments arising largely from development impacts. Where development proposals are deemed likely to impact on a monument, Dúchas will usually propose a buffer zone of 20 metres width, measured from the outer edge of the perimeter of the site. In other cases, such as ecclesiastical sites or national monuments in State care a buffer zone of 50 metres may be recommended to allow for the visual amenity of the monument.</P>
      <P>In principle, Dúchas would not support proposals for development within a buffer zone. However, all development proposals are assessed on a case-by-case basis and where it is shown that a development will not interfere with the archaeology of a site or, where satisfactory mitigation is to be carried out, such as archaeological excavation, development within a buffer zone may not be opposed. In particular, archaeological sites and monuments situated in urban areas where there has already been extensive development over many years will often fall into this category. However, decisions in regard to planning applications are not, and cannot be, made by Dúchas but are the responsibility of the relevant planning authority and An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the work of planning authorities in devising policies for the protection of the archaeological heritage under the various development plans. In a number of cases where sensitive archaeological complexes are concerned, such as at The Boyne Valley and Loughcrew in County Meath, zones of archaeological interest have been included in the plan with the objective of controlling inappropriate development within these zones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1726" />In recent times, I have also entered into codes of practice with a number of development bodies including Bord Na Móna, the NRA, Bord Gáis and the Irish Concrete Federation. The aim of these codes is to provide for early planning so as to avoid impacts on archaeological sites and monuments so that effectively such sites have agreed buffer zones established well in advance of development work.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that an application for a Garda CCTV system in Swords has been received by the advis<Col N="1728" /> ory committee that was established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate applications for Garda CCTV systems. The application from Swords is currently under consideration &ndash; together with applications from other cities and towns throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Applications for Garda CCTV systems are assessed by the advisory committee on the basis of Garda operational needs and include the following criteria: crime-public order statistics in the area; population and level of activity there; the recommendation of local Garda management and any special circumstances/needs that exist and the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system on that area. Co-funding is a feature of Garda CCTV systems and this is usually addressed when it has been decided to install a Garda CCTV system in an area.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that I announced late in 2000 that the number of Garda CCTV systems is to be extended. As part of the first tranche of this expansion, CCTV systems are to be installed in the following areas: Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. It is anticipated that these ten CCTV systems will be installed by the end of 2002. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course.</P>
      <P>Tenders have been sought and received in respect of the town centre CCTV systems for Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick. The evaluation process is in its final stages and I hope to announce the awarding of the contracts shortly, after which work will commence immediately to put the systems in place. The planning in respect of the town centre CCTV systems for Athlone, Clondalkin, Waterford and Tallaght is well advanced and it is expected that tenders will be invited via the EU Journal and the national newspapers within the next few months.</P>
      <P>I also plan to introduce a grant scheme to cater for those communities who would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. While it will be up to the local communities to install and monitor the CCTV schemes, grant assistance will be provided. The details of this new scheme are being finalised and full particulars including relevant conditions and grant levels etc. will be announced within the next four to six weeks.</P>

The current manpower strength, as at 20 March 2002, is 219 gardaí, all ranks. The Sheriff Street area is patrolled by the community policing unit. It is also included in the recently launched Operation Encounter, with a mobile patrol and additional personnel allocated to the area. Resources are augmented from within the division as required.</P>
      <P>I understand that the area is also patrolled by the district mobile patrols, district detective unit, crime prevention unit, divisional task force, divisional traffic unit and the divisional drug unit. All of these resources are given the task of providing high visibility policing in the area to deal with incidents of public disorder and anti-social behaviour. Frequent offenders have been and continue to be identified and targeted.</P>
      <P>I am assured by the Garda authorities that local Garda management is satisfied that the arrangements currently in place in the Sheriff Street area are adequate to meet the present policing needs of the area, and that the gardaí will continue to appraise the policing and administrative strategy employed in the Sheriff Street area, with a view to ensuring that an effective Garda service is maintained. The situation will be kept under review and when additional manpower next becomes available, the needs of the Store Street district will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of the Garda districts throughout the country.</P>
      <P>With regard to the request for the installation of CCTV cameras, I have been informed that at present there are currently four cameras covering the area in question. They are strategically located to give the optimum coverage. The cameras are monitored on a 24 hour basis from the Garda Office, O'Connell Street.</P>
      <P>The CCTV advisory committee has requested the DMR north central division to prepare a comprehensive report outlining the projected CCTV requirements in that division. On receipt of this report, the CCTV advisory committee will submit its recommendations to the Garda Commissioner.</P>
      <P>I have also been informed that the Sheriff Street area is part of the RAPID programme, and that the gardaí are actively engaged in this programme with other agencies. In addition, plans and funding from the local drugs task force are at an advanced stage to extend the community policing forum in the Sheriff Street area.</P>

      <P>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Religious Society of Friends jointly manage, on behalf of the Prisons Service, visitors centre waiting rooms which are attached to a number of prisons, including Cloverhill Prison. Their work is in support of prisoners' families as they wait to meet the prisoner in the relevant prison. The Prisons Service fully recognises the work being undertaken at the visitors centres. In that context the following support funding was or is being provided from official funds as follows: in 2000, £250,862.00; in 2001, £395,948.00 &ndash; the original amount granted was £275,848 &ndash; and in 2002, &euro;571,382.13 or £450,000.00. The Deputy will appreciate that, from the sums mentioned, sizeable amounts of money have been made available to manage the visitors' centres. However, there is a need to ensure that these centres are managed properly within agreed budgets.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these centres is to provide refreshments, a child minding service during the course of visits and very limited counselling or referral services to prisoners' families. I understand that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Religious Society of Friends are currently reviewing their operations at these centres, including Cloverhill, from a financial and management perspective. The Prisons Service is contributing towards the financial costs of that review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Officials of my Department held discussions with the representatives of the managerial authorities in the second level sector in order to ensure that schools would remain open when the ASTI directive to its members to withdraw from voluntary supervision and substitution duties took effect on 4 March 2002. Arising from these discussions a contingency plan was prepared and agreed between my Department and the managerial authorities. As part of the contingency arrangements, my Department undertook to resource schools in order that they could employ staff to provide supervision and thereby remain open. In addition, my Department under<Col N="1734" /> took to recoup the cost to the management authorities in advertising for, recruiting and training appropriate personnel to provide supervision services in schools on a temporary contractual basis.</P>
      <P>Supervisors who contracted for delivery of supervision services are being remunerated at a daily contract rate of &euro;68.56, £54, based on a minimum of two hours supervision. Where further supervision above these two hours is required this is being remunerated at &euro;34.28, £27, per additional hour. This is the equivalent to the hourly rate offered to teachers. To put schools in funds for the purposes of the contingency arrangements, an initial payment was made to schools by my Department on 28 February 2002. This was based upon six weeks of the annual grant, calculated on the basis of &euro;1,270, £1,000, per whole time equivalent teacher post per annum, with a stipulation that further payments of the grant will be made to schools at the appropriate stages of the contingency. In addition, funding was provided to cover employers' PRSI, holiday pay and administrative costs. In aggregate, the sum dispersed to schools was approximately &euro;7 million, £5.5 million.</P>
      <P>The contingency plan acknowledges that supplementary allocations may need to be made to some schools at a later stage if their approved outgoings are greater than the amount of the grant. Accordingly, the final costs are not yet available. The joint managerial body, JMB, placed advertisements on behalf of the managerial authorities in the national media over the weekend of 16-17 February. In addition, the JMB organised training on a regional basis and operated a telephone helpline for schools. My Department has recouped &euro;114,258.47 to the JMB to offset the cost of providing these services to date. Information concerning the number of people recruited and the number of schools in which they are working is not readily available at this stage, as these personnel are recruited directly by the school authorities. The contingency plan does not specify a pupil to supervisor ratio, as the plan recognised that the number of persons required would vary from school to school depending on the layout, both internal and external.</P>

      <P>The present training for speech therapists involves a four-year programme in the School of Clinical Speech and Language Studies at Trinity College, Dublin. The Department of Health and Children commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists. The report was launched in July 2001 and it concluded that a major expansion in the numbers of therapy professionals was essential over the next fifteen years. In relation to speech and language therapy training places, the report recommends an annual increase of 75 training places over the previous level of 25 training places.</P>
      <P>As an interim measure my Department and the Higher Education Authority agreed to increase the annual intake to the speech and language therapy course at the University of Dublin, Trinity College to 29 from the 2000-2001 academic year. An interagency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Higher Education Authority to pursue the issues arising from the report. The Higher Education Authority invited institutions to submit proposals for the expansion of existing courses and the introduction of new courses, including graduate entry programmes for the three disciplines. The proposals received are currently being considered. In the meantime, because of the critical importance of speech and language therapists in education I have sanctioned an increase of 75 in the number of places for the education and training of these professionals. This will ensure that those in need will have access to the therapists who will help them get the education they deserve.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, a record level of funding which demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving accommodation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997.</P>
      <P>Due to the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is being extended-refurbished as part of the Government's programme and is currently in architectural planning. The project will continue to the preparation of tender documents and the invitation of tenders, as soon as possible, under the Government's expanded building programme.</P>

      <P>The unit to which the Deputy refers was established in August 2001 to operate for a three year period. The overall operating cost of the unit, which can cater for 12 children with autism, is being funded by my Department. The unit is using the comprehensive application of the behavioural analysis system in the education of the children. The operation of this pilot unit will be evaluated by my Department before any expansion is considered. Children with autism <Col N="1740" /> have access to a range of special support services. To date, some 90 special classes dedicated to children with autism have been established within the primary sector. Each such class operates at a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 and each class also has the support of at least two special needs assistants. Further such classes are being established on an ongoing basis in response to assessed needs. In addition, the project to which the Deputy refers is one of three projects which are delivering an applied behavioural analysis model of response to children with autism.</P>
      <P>The task force on autism, which I established in October 2000, has presented a comprehensive range of proposals for the future development of services for children with autism. This report, which is currently being considered in my Department, will make an important contribution to the further development of services in this area.</P>
