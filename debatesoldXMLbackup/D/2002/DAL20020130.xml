    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 13 together.</P>
      <P>I met the president of Sinn Féin, Gerry Adams, on 10 January and we reviewed matters relating to Northern Ireland. A principal concern and focus of our discussions on that occasion was the ongoing violence in north Belfast. As part of ongoing exchanges on Northern Ireland, I will meet Deputy First Minister, Mark Durkan, and an SDLP delegation in Dublin tomorrow. I have also had contact with David Trimble and hope that both he and Mark Durkan as First Minister and Deputy First Minister will together visit us in Dublin in the coming weeks. I will meet the Prime Minister Mr. Blair in London later in the month and I also expect to meet the Alliance leader, David Ford, in the near future.</P>
      <P>I express my support and solidarity for the initiative of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in organising rallies across Northern Ireland which provided a platform for people to demonstrate their opposition to paramilitary attacks and sectarianism. I take the opportunity to extend my sympathy and the sympathy of the Government to the family and friends of Daniel McColgan who was cruelly murdered. All of us, especially church and community leaders and political representatives, have a duty to work to combat the sectarianism and violence which is becoming endemic in parts of Northern Ireland. It is also vital that the authorities act to improve the security and protection of individuals and communities and bring to justice those responsible for perpetrating acts of violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards policing, both the Ombudsman's report, which raised serious concerns about the conduct of the investigation into the Omagh bombing, and the Chief Constable's response, now deserve the most careful and reflective consideration. Our thoughts are with the families of <Col N="4" /> the victims of the bombing. This is a traumatic time for them. We must not ever lose sight of the fact that those responsible for the terrible loss of life and the horrific injuries were those who planned and perpetrated the bombing. This has been a period of intense debate in light of the Ombudsman's report and the Chief Constable's response, but it is essential that we do not lose sight of the real goal, namely, to bring the perpetrators of this despicable outrage to justice and bring a measure of closure for the families. It is a matter now for the Policing Board to assess these reports and take the matter forward. Its task is obviously a difficult and challenging one and a significant early test of its ability as a board to address sensitive policing issues. I understand the board will meet the Chief Constable and the Police Ombudsman on 5 February. The board will also get the views of the families. We await these deliberations with interest.</P>
    <P>The office of the Police Ombudsman, the Policing Board and the new Police Service of Northern Ireland are all central elements in the policing arrangements for Northern Ireland. It is important that this matter now be taken forward in a manner which does not damage the new beginning to policing which is such a vital element of the Good Friday Agreement. On this the 30th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, I acknowledge the work the Saville inquiry has done and hope that its deliberations will achieve what we all want, the truth of what happened on that terrible day.</P>
    <P>I met Ambassador Haas on 15 January and our discussions centred on the continuing sectarian violence in north Belfast and elsewhere in Northern Ireland, as well as a range of other issues, including the current situation relating to Afghanistan. We discussed the situation regarding prisoners' conditions and Ireland's contribution towards reconstruction in that country.</P>
    <P>The programme for my visit to the US has not yet been finalised. I will depart for Chicago on Monday, 11 March. I expect to speak that evening at the North West University and to fulfil a number of engagements in Chicago before departing on the afternoon of Tuesday, 12 March for Washington. On the following day, I will attend a meeting of the Economic Advisory Board. Arrangements for other possible meetings in the morning and afternoon will not be finalised until closer to the time. That evening, I will attend the America Ireland Fund dinner and will depart Washington on Thursday morning for the European Council meeting in Barcelona.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, provision was made in my Department's Estimates to allow for the contingency of its meeting in 2002. Following the successful relaunch of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and our expectations that they will function effectively up to the Assembly elections scheduled for May 2003, it is probable that disbursement from this allocation will not be required. Assuming our confident expectations <Col N="5" /> are fulfilled, it may be appropriate to have a formal closure of the forum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach receive a report from the gardaí who attended the meeting of relatives of the victims of the Omagh bombing or from the commissioner? Was he informed in advance of the Garda's intention to have a presence and has he discussed the meeting, either before or since, with the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not discussed the matter with the commissioner. The gardaí attended the meeting as an operational matter. I was informed in advance by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the row between the chief constable and the police ombudsman of Northern Ireland has a negative influence on the prospect of young Catholics joining the police force? Will he state whether the Government has made its position known to either the First Minister of Northern Ireland or the British Government on this controversy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it has the potential to create difficulties. The three arms &ndash; the police service of Northern Ireland, the Policing Board and the ombudsman &ndash; are important aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and it is important that they all work together to ensure that policing functions properly. The board will consider both the ombudsman's and the chief constable's reports next week. I hope the matter will be dealt with in a sane and sensible manner.</P>
      <P>I made my views known to the British Government publicly, that is, that the ombudsman has an independent role and the chief constable has a right to state his case. However, it should be done in a calm way with both cases examined by the Policing Board without damaging the early stages of the new beginning. If it does not happen in that way, it could pose a difficult problem for policing in Northern Ireland with a negative influence on not just the Catholic community but also the wider community there. It must be handled delicately.</P>
      <P>The record so far of the Policing Board indicates that it is sensitive to the views of both individuals and that it is determined to deal with these issues in a constructive way. We were careful that the gardaí, in their operational work and in the effort to bring to justice the perpetrators behind the Omagh bombing, would not get drawn into other matters. On 5 February there will be an attempt by the policing board to resolve what clearly are conflicting issues. I have seen both reports and have read the main sections of the reports of the Ombudsman and the Chief Constable report. There are conflicts in some areas but it would seem they can be resolved and I hope that will be done by 5 February or within the next couple of weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The central issue in the controversy, and it is of the greatest concern to the relatives, is that it is suggested that the RUC had information prior to the bombing which, if acted on, could have prevented the tragedy. Does the Taoiseach have a view on that? Has he been advised by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether this is so? Will he inform the House if he has taken this issue up with the British Government at any level and will he communicate the Government's view on this issue to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the issues. The Ombudsman believes a third party or an outside police force should conduct an investigation into these aspects and that neither Northern Ireland or the Irish jurisdiction should be involved. The Chief Constable has already appointed somebody in the UK to look at these matters and the Ombudsman disagrees with that. On that issue, and based on what the Ombudsman's report says, we have said we support the Ombudsman and that somebody from outside should examine this. I have read the sections where Ms O'Loan has given the details of her case and have also read the rebuttal of that. I accept that it is not easy to examine these differences. The British Government is aware that our view is that a third party should look at this. It would be wrong of us to press that view until the policing board has had its opportunity to examine the issue. It represents both communities so should have that opportunity. My view is that the Ombudsman's report seems fair and we believe it deserves support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach share my view that the commemoration of the atrocity of Bloody Sunday, 30 years on, is something we should mark and in so marking recognise the other atrocities that have occurred since? Does he agree, that in calling for the Saville Inquiry to complete its report as quickly as possible so that we can have the facts, he should call upon all of those involved and those who have knowledge of the events that took place around that time to co-operate fully and comprehensively with the inquiry so that we can get the full facts of what happened 30 years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Quinn. We should remember what happened 30 years ago today and also all of the other terrible events since then. The Saville inquiry is doing excellent work. It has moved on apace over recent months and its work is rewarding. It is certainly helping many people in Derry, the families involved and the people who fought so hard for this inquiry. It is going to take some considerable time because there are a large number of witnesses and a large volume of evidence to be examined. Everybody should co-operate with the inquiry. It is a very costly inquiry and the resources required have caused quite a pull on the British system. I am sure there will be co-operation with the inquiry <Col N="7" /> even though there have been some legal arguments to do with some of the issues. If people do not co-operate fully with the inquiry it will not get to the truth. I hope the inquiry will be comprehensive and that people with information will come forward. I hope many of the issues that have been raised over the past 30 years in one form or other will be put before the inquiry so that it can make its judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach had a meeting with special Ambassador Haas, did he refer to Ambassador Haas's recently quoted comments about the need for people on this island and on the other island to have some understanding of the sense of alienation within which sections of the Unionist and loyalist community find themselves at present? If so, did the Taoiseach indicate what the Government's attitude was to the speech and the comment made not just by Ambassador Haas but also by Secretary of State Dr. John Reid in relation to the same matter? Has the Taoiseach a comment to make on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have all said on many occasion in this House that we must be conscious of everybody's position and the sense of alienation and exclusion on both sides. I agree we must always take account of both sides in any issue. We are all aware that if you speak about one side's point of view people from the other side are very quick to correct you. Both Ambassador Haas and Secretary of State Dr. Reid said that the Protestants in Northern Ireland should not be left out in the cold. My view and that of all of us in this House in dealing with all the parties in Northern Ireland is that we always try to be as inclusive, fair and reasonable as possible. We try to direct our initiatives as best we can to include everybody. We try to be as inclusive as possible when talking about parades, emblems and sectarian violence. It is always dangerous to take sides. We all know that when sectarianism gets too hot it inevitably leads to violence, and violence leads to deaths. That has always been so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke to Ambassador Haas since his statement and I agree with the broad thrust of it. However, it must be put in a broad context. There was quite a reaction to that statement by Ambassador Haas from the parents of children at the school in Ardoyne and people in the area. It must be explained to them that he was not excluding that. We have seen that there is still community tension, particularly in north Belfast. Sectarianism is still active and people still move from area to area, the Glenbryn estate being a typical example. A few years ago the make-up of the Glenbryn estate was very different. The problems which arose in the lower Shankill a few summers ago caused people to move from that area, and that increases tension. We must try to adopt an inclusive approach so that anything we say is reflective of both communities. If we do <Col N="8" /> something for one side we must also try to do something for the other side. We must try to bring both sides with us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a number of questions arising from the replies given by the Taoiseach to those 13 questions. What is the purpose of the 52,000 provided for in the Estimates for this year in relation to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation? It seems to be more than merely a contingency sum. In relation to discussions the Taoiseach may have had with the British Government or its officials, has there been any development arising out of the negotiations that took place in Weston Park for the provision of an international judge to make inquiries into the murders of Pat Finucane, Rosemary Nelson and others? Since the House has not met since December, what is the Government's understanding of the process of decommissioning? Has General de Chastelain been in contact, formally or informally, with the Taoiseach or Government officials with regard to progress in that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first question about the peace and reconciliation fund, other than some small outstanding costs, it is a provisional sum. If things move on during this year, by the end of the year or in the autumn there should be an examination of whether there should be a final round of discussions to conclude the report. Provided there is some sense of normality in Northern Ireland going into 2003, prior to their elections, there may be an opportunity to complete the report and publish the remaining documentation. However, there is no other reason for the money.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Quinn said, at Weston Park both Governments agreed to appoint a judge of international standing from outside both jurisdictions to undertake a thorough investigation of the allegations of collusion by the security forces in either jurisdiction in the two cases mentioned of Rosemary Nelson and Pat Finucane. That was extended to look at the cases of Superintendent Harry Breen, Superintendent Bob Buchanan, Lord Justice and Lady Gibson, Robert Hamill and Billy Wright. These are all to be included in the examination. The investigation of each individual case will begin as soon as the current investigations and subsequent proceedings are completed. In any event they must begin by the end of April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What does that mean? The investigations will begin as soon as the current investigations are completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are live investigations into a number of them. If they are concluded quicker, the examinations could start quicker but they will start no later than the end of April 2002, unless it would be clearly prejudicial to some forthcoming prosecution at that time. Concern has been expressed because some people believe that could keep going forever. Some definition is <Col N="9" /> required to avoid the possibility of a prosecution coming out of the blue, which might not have any real substance. I hope that does not happen. We have made our opinion clear on that. If any of the cases were not started by the end of April, there would need to be some very hard evidence and not merely hearsay evidence. I am not saying that might happen but others have said so. The appointed judge will have detailed terms of reference. He will be asked to review all the papers, including the records of any previous investigations, complete or under way. He will report with recommendations of further action that he believes should be taken. In the event that a public inquiry is recommended in any case, the Government will implement that recommendation.</P>

      <P>I extend that sympathy to all victims, especially as we are today thinking about the victims of Bloody Sunday. I also think of those who have been terrorised and traumatised, particularly those at Holy Cross national school. My question may sound somewhat hollow as it refers to the peace dividend to those we remember as victims of the Troubles. People have asked me about the progress that has been made with the cross-Border institutions and the positive outcome of the Good Friday Agreement, especially the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, An Foras Teanga, Waterways Ireland and other groups whose activities will hopefully increase. They can give us a lot of hope for the future. Will the Taoiseach detail the progress that has been made on the institutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did the Taoiseach discuss a truth commission with special ambassador Haas? Does he foresee a time when the grievances of victims on both <Col N="10" /> sides can be addressed given that a number of Unionists have indicated they feel there is an imbalance in what someone termed &ldquo;the parity of victimhood&rdquo;?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered this question before. There has been an international experience of this, particularly in South Africa. In any discussions I have had either in or on Northern Ireland there has not been much interest in the concept of a truth commission, either as operated in South Africa or elsewhere. People feel that would not be the most helpful way to deal with the years of atrocities. Having said that, members of all communities would like to see closure on a number of important and high profile cases that continue to be very important not only in the media but within the communities. There is a number of these cases &ndash; probably no more than ten &ndash; and the Saville Inquiry is clearly the biggest one, but for loyalists the case of Billy Wright is very important while for Unionists the cases of Lord Justice and Lady Gibson, Bob Buchanan and others are important. People want investigations into those issues. I hope that can happen and, as I said to Deputy Quinn, the sooner they are dealt with the better. It will take a few years for those issues to be concluded satisfactorily and that is probably a better idea than a truth commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the report of 30 November, which shows the enormous number of positive developments that are taking place through a range of work in cross-Border institutions. The institutions are all up and running and have chief executives, staff and boards. They have extensive agendas between now and summer 2003 and there is a good atmosphere surrounding them. They are working away quietly without causing offence to anyone. There is a changed attitude in Northern Ireland across all communities. I hope I am not being over optimistic in saying that, but from contacts that appears to be the case, even among those who perhaps were not as positive in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may recall that on 30 November the First Minister, David Trimble, and the Deputy First Minister, Mark Durkan, made the case that many of the issues were not formally the work of the implementation bodies or the North-South bodies but that those bodies have got involved in them and there is co-operation, and they welcomed that. That is in line with what I said in the week leading up to the Good Friday Agreement, that everything did not have to be written down and that there were other areas where we could informally co-operate. That momentum is there and I think it will continue. I do not think anyone should feel threatened by that. The progress, work and co-operation among <Col N="11" /> officials inside and outside the bodies is excellent and very beneficial. I refer anyone who has an interest in this matter to the report of 30 November, which gives details of all the work that has taken place in the past year to 18 months.</P>

      <P>What undertaking has the Taoiseach received from his meetings with the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, on British co-operation with Mr. Justice Barron's inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings? Did he receive a commitment from the British Prime Minister that the British authorities would co-operate fully from this point forward not only on Mr. Justice Barron's examination of the facts regarding the Dublin and Monaghan bombings but on other matters? Did the Taoiseach ask why there has not been such co-operation heretofore? Does he agree that this is an initial preparatory inquiry and that it is disturbing that there has not been such co-operation to date which, in effect, has hampered and delayed the project moving forward?</P>
      <P>When will the next report of the all-party Committee on the Constitution be published? Will it deal with the issue of representation in the Oireachtas for citizens of the Six Counties? Will it also deal with the need for fundamental reform of the Seanad, including the widening of the franchise with regard to third level graduates, as provided for by Article 18.2º of the Constitution? Will the passing of referenda be required on foot of implementation of this report and, if so, when might they be held?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Deputy's second question, I have not seen that report, but I understand the all-party committee is to report on this matter. I know that prior to Christmas and since then, it has been working on the report and that representation is one of the issues with which it is dealing. I am sure that, as always, the committee will forward us an excellent report.</P>
      <P>On the reform of the Seanad, I am not aware if that is included in the report. It may be, but I cannot confirm that. I know the first issue the Deputy raised regarding the report is included in it. Depending on the recommendations the committee bring forward, I assume their constitutionality would have to be examined. Until the report is brought forward and we know what recommendations are made, it is not possible to make a judgment on that matter. It was reported last November that the committee would report in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the first issue, a meeting took place two weeks ago between Mr. Justice Barron, the Ceann Comhairle and Sir John Reid. I understand that was a useful working meeting and that Mr. Justice Barron made it clear what he requires and what he thinks should be available. The Secretary of State has undertaken over the next number of weeks from that date to provide those reports. I understand that has been communi<Col N="12" /> cated to the Police Service of Northern Ireland with regard to the records he would like to get and there has been a promise of co-operation from the police service. Hopefully, the files Justice Barron has been seeking for the past year or so will be provided in a relatively short period.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach confident that the commitments he reports he received from the British Prime Minister will translate into real and effective delivery and co-operation with Justice Barron? In relation to Article 18.2 of the Constitution, an amendment to the Constitution was made some decades ago to facilitate the widening of the franchise to other third level colleges. We have seen huge growth in third level education in the State yet we have not seen the extension of the franchise for the Seanad election, a reform which I believe does not go far enough in itself. Does the Taoiseach not agree that legislation should be introduced as provided for by an amendment to the Constitution to widen the franchise to include colleges other than those that hitherto have been accommodated?</P>

    <P>Will the Taoiseach join me in welcoming the statement by leading members of Sinn Féin that they now fully support the defence forces of this State, the Army and the Garda? However, it is causing me slight concern. Has the Taoiseach any idea when this happened or in what circumstances it happened? I do not recall an Ard Fheis <Col N="13" /> resolution or anything of that nature. Be that as it may, it is welcome.</P>
    <P>On the next occasion the Taoiseach meets the leadership of the republican movement, will he insist that its members do what Pat Doherty and others, including the Sinn Féin Member of this House, have refused to do, which is to give information in their possession to the Garda on their former colleagues who were involved in the atrocity at Omagh? Does he agree it is hypocritical for a Member of the House to ask the Taoiseach to put pressure on the British Government to provide information on people responsible for murders in Dublin and Monaghan while, at the same time, refusing to call for similar action in terms of giving information on former colleagues who were responsible for the murders in Omagh?</P>

      <P>People should assist in any way they can in bringing forward evidence. It has been well documented in newspapers for a long time that the Garda and the Police Service of Northern Ireland have a virtually complete picture of what happened in Omagh. Their difficulty is evidence. It would be surprising, as it is in all such cases, if there were not people, wherever they are or with whoever they are associated&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the arrangements at Weston Park. Since those meetings a serious development has taken place. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commissioner said in a significant statement that, in his opinion, there was significant and direct collusion between the British security forces and those who perpetrated the killing of Pat Finucane. Has the Taoiseach been in contact with the British Government since Brice Dickson made that statement? As far <Col N="14" /> as the Pat Finucane case is concerned, there is now an overwhelming case for a full and separate public inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That will follow from the detailed investigations, interviews and examination of the facts which will be undertaken in the judicial process. Whoever undertakes this task, which is due to begin at the end of April, will make recommendations on whether an inquiry is likely. The Government has called publicly for a report on and a full independent judicial investigation into the Pat Finucane case. I spoke to Mrs. Finucane recently and have spoken to her a number of times previously. The legal group that supports the family and other groups accept this is the proper way.</P>
      <P>I hope we will get to that position and, as I have said previously, there is evidence, whether it stands up under investigation, that there was collusion in this case. That is a deeply held fact according to an enormous number of people. The sooner this information is examined by an eminent member of the international judiciary the better and then we can get to the point of holding a tribunal.</P>
      <P>Whatever about other cases, the Pat Finucane case leads one to believe that serious events took place that are very worrying. Others hold the same view about the Robert Hamill and Rosemary Nelson cases but I have not heard anything in regard to them that would make me feel the same way. They are terrible cases but many of the things I have head regarding the Pat Finucane case, which I put to the British Government long ago, make one very concerned, if not downright suspicious, about what happened. The only way to prove that is through a judicial inquiry.</P>

Both Gerry Adams, President of Sinn Féin, and Martin McGuinness, the party's chief negotiator and Minister, have said on many occasions that it is a position they hope to achieve in time.

        <b>: </b>Does the Taoiseach agree the strongest answer to the sectarian bigots on all sides was on Friday, 18 January when tens of thousands of workers, Catholic and Protestant, demonstrated together against death threats and sectarian intimidation, many being on strike to emphasise their purpose? Will he join me in congratulating the postal workers who stood shoulder to shoulder for days while taking industrial action in protest at the murder of their colleague?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach appreciate the importance of this new development in recent times given that we know from reports that the physical separation of the communities has intensified significantly while the peace process has supposedly been in place? This is a process implemented by politicians who are members of political parties based on sectarian lines. The structures of the Good Friday Agreement equally institutionalise sectarianism.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach join with me in hoping that the working class on all sides in Northern Ireland takes further initiatives to sideline the sectarian bigots through an exercise of its power in this way and perhaps even move beyond the sectarian based political parties as well?</P>

In a very short period, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions did an excellent job of mobilising people on what was a very bad day weather-wise in Northern Ireland. It received huge support and that was a welcome development. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has endeavoured in recent years to build on its campaign to stop sectarianism. It has many projects in operation in this regard and it should be strongly supported, as should the increasing number of groups which are doing their best to fight sectarianism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The tourism industry suffered its first major setback in a decade in 2001 with the impact of the foot and mouth disease crisis in the spring and the fall off in business arising from the events of 11 September. While official Central Statistics Office statistics for 2001 will not be available for some months, the number of overseas visitors in 2001 is estimated by Bord Fáilte to have fallen by 7% or approximately 500,000. However, preliminary indications are that the reduction in overseas revenue earnings may be appreciably lower. Also on a positive note, domestic holiday business remained buoyant last year, with expenditure rising by 16% according to latest Bord Fáilte estimates. CERT estimates employment losses in the tourism and hospitality sector in 2001 at about 2,000 permanent jobs, with a reduction of 6,000 in part-time jobs.</P>
      <P>There is little doubt that 2002 will be a challenging year for Irish tourism. Tourism Ireland Limited, the new all-island tourism marketing company which was successfully launched in Dublin and Belfast in November 2001, has estimated that the best case scenario for 2002 is a return to 2000 business levels. This is equivalent to 6.1 million overseas visitors to the Republic of Ireland and associated foreign earnings of close to 3.8 billion.</P>
      <P>A number of initiatives are being progressed during 2002 as part of the most radical shake-up of tourism policy in recent decades. These include the establishment of a new national tourism development authority to follow on from the operational start-up of Tourism Ireland Limited, the roll-out of robust and focused tourism marketing plans for 2002 together with a fundamental reappraisal by the new company of our overall overseas marketing strategy, ensuring the appropriate development of tourism products and facilities through the launch of a new tourism product development scheme, and working to ensure that a broad and competitive network of access links by air and sea to Ireland is in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key challenges for 2002 and into the future is to ensure that delivery arrangements for <Col N="17" /> those tourism functions remaining with Bord Fáilte and CERT are the most effective in helping Irish industry to achieve the optimum position for itself in the international market place, and so derive maximum economic benefit from the work of Tourism Ireland Ltd. Bringing together the product and human resource development functions in one agency will provide the best delivery model for achieving this objective.</P>
    <P>Following high level discussions with Bord Fáilte and CERT, the Government approved last November the creation of a national tourism development authority to promote the development of sustainable tourist facilities and services, including the promotion of training, human resources and marketing skills. I have since then, established an implementation group which is due to report back to me by the end of March, to progress this matter with a view to the new authority being operational in 2003.</P>
    <P>Following consultation with industry interests, Tourism Ireland Ltd and Bord Fáilte have recently launched comprehensive marketing plans for 2002 designed to address the new market situation with a view to recovering as much business as possible. Tourism Ireland's programme budget of 27 million for 2002 for the international marketing of the island of Ireland is the largest ever annual budget allocated for such a purpose and is supplemented by substantial niche-product marketing funding by Bord Fáilte. Tourism marketing funding was enhanced by a further 11million in the recent budget.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>Tourism Ireland has already launched a new and exciting TV and print international advertising campaign for the island of Ireland, developed at a cost of approximately 5 million. The board of the new company has made it clear that its marketing plans for 2002 will be responsive and flexible in nature, with an emphasis on tactical marketing to take account of the changing circumstances arising from the events of 11 September. The focus on Britain, our nearest and largest market, will be particularly strong. The board sees a particular opportunity in the short break and additional holiday markets as Ireland is well positioned as a destination that is easily accessible by sea, particularly for the own car segment. Tourism Ireland is also targeting a revival of the holiday market from continental Europe during 2002 through prioritising geographic markets, by selectively encouraging and supporting new access gateways and routes into Ireland and by getting an increased number of operators to feature Ireland in their promotional activities.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte, which will operate in partnership with Tourism Ireland, has also recently launched its own complementary programme of activities for 2002 which it will undertake on behalf of and in partnership with the industry. This will include:</P>
    <P>an extensive promotion campaign in the Ireland market, both North and South, partic<Col N="18" /> ularly from February to May and September to November, to encourage season extension;</P>
    <P>marketing niche and specialist products such as golf, angling, heritage, walking-cycling, equestrian, watersports, conference and English as a foreign language;</P>
    <P>implementing the sports tourism initiative which is designed to win major international sporting events for Ireland into the future, and utilising the promotional opportunities arising from the positive media coverage associated with such events being in Ireland. During 2002 these will include the world cross country championships, the Smurfit European Open, the American Express world championships, and the ITU triathlon world cup series;</P>
    <P>developing guidelines and implementing the recent Government initiative to expand regional tourism though festivals and cultural events; and</P>
    <P>providing a promotional platform for media and journalist visits from the various markets.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte attaches particular importance to the partnership approach with industry and there has been very extensive consultation, including a number of meetings of its tourism marketing partnership, in the drawing up of these plans.</P>
    <P>Following State aids approval by the European Commission, I was pleased yesterday to launch the new tourism product development scheme, which will be administered by Bord Fáilte and involves some 130 million of public sector funding under the BMW and southern and eastern regional operational programmes of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>The overall objective of this scheme is the development of the tourism product in a sustainable way, that widens the spatial spread of tourism, diverts pressure from highly developed areas and increases the under-performing regions' share of overseas tourism revenue. The scheme includes three categories as follows:</P>
    <P>the development of major attractors and clusters of attractors;</P>
    <P>the development of special interest pursuits; and</P>
    <P>tourism environmental management.</P>
    <P>The first two of these categories are targeted specifically at regions that are currently under performing in terms of tourism development and are designed to help such regions to achieve their tourism potential. The successful realisation of the measures is, however, dependent on and directly related to the delivery by relevant local and other authorities of the necessary infrastructure, facilities and controls.</P>
    <P>A very critical component for regaining business in 2002 will be maintaining a broad network of competitive access links by air and sea to Ireland. We are particularly well served by the levels of investment in recent years in sea access, <Col N="19" /> which has seen the emergence of a high quality and competitive route network, in particular across the Irish sea and to France. My Department has been working closely with the Department of Public Enterprise to safeguard as much of the air access route infrastructure as possible so that, as traveller confidence is restored and as the recovery comes, we will be best placed to avail of it.</P>
    <P>The Government is also anxious to promote new air route development, in particular from the large continental European market which has not performed up to expectations in recent years. The extension by Aer Rianta of its incentive scheme for new routes to Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports is very encouraging and I welcome recent announcements of new air services for 2002 which will go some way to compensating for the loss of services arising from the shake out of the airline sector arising from the events of 11 September.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and including representatives of my Department, has been established to look at the interaction between access transport, particularly by air, and tourism with a view to identifying further possibilities for increasing the flow of visitors to Ireland. The work of that group is very substantially advanced and I hope the Government will consider its report very shortly.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry has matured greatly in recent years and has built up a tremendous product base that makes Ireland a very attractive international tourist destination. I welcome the response of many businesses in the sector that are already readjusting their marketing and pricing strategies to secure extra businesses in the current difficult climate. I cannot emphasise strongly enough the continuing need to maintain competitiveness and keep prices as attractive as possible. I am confident the recent attractively priced offers from the air and sea carriers, accommodation providers and others, will play a key role in helping the industry to work its way out of current difficulties.</P>

        <b>: </b>I thank the Minister for the information he has given the House but he has not answered my question. I asked if he was satisfied as to the accuracy of the tourism figures. Does he accept that the figures are grossly distorted and that what would be classified as tourists in Bord Fáilte figures includes business people who have been out of the country for a day or two, returning football fans and people who have been away for a weekend or are returning from holidays? Does the Minister not accept that there is a major question mark regarding all the figures relating to tourism numbers and the revenue which is supposed to accrue from the tourism industry?</P>

      <P>I read three pages of a six page reply which included the answers to much of what <Col N="20" /> the Deputy has asked. However, this issue has been raised on a number of occasions in the past. I cannot imagine a more comprehensive way of gathering figures or a more competent organisation to do so than the Central Statistics Office. There are five areas in which we gather statistics. The Central Statistics Office conducts a country of residence survey &ndash; CRS &ndash; and a passenger car inquiry. Bord Fáilte compiles tourism numbers and revenue, and conducts a survey of overseas tourists &ndash; SOT. The United Kingdom tourism survey &ndash; UKTS &ndash; and the Irish travel survey &ndash; ITS &ndash; are also used.</P>
      <P>Day visitors, football fans, business travellers and other categories referred to by the Deputy are dealt with separately. In 1997, for example, 497,000 were surveyed and these figures were broken down by category. We use the term visitors and all of these visitors spend money in Ireland. All foreign visitors, in whatever category, bring funding into the Irish Exchequer.</P>

        <b>: </b>How many of these can be classified as genuine tourists. The Minister's figures include people returning having seen Manchester United play in Old Trafford or Liverpool in Anfield, people who have been out of the country on a one day business trip and people returning from holidays in Spain or France. I travel through Dublin, Shannon and Knock airports regularly and no one has ever confronted me with a questionnaire or asked me how long I have been out of the country, where I went or when I intend to come back. How can the Minister come up with the global figure of 6 million tourists and billions of pounds in revenue on the basis of hit and miss surveys carried out by a variety of agencies.</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply underpins the point which Deputy Stanton and I have been making repeatedly, having met the various segments of the industry, that the Minister's figures are grossly inflated and unscientific.</P>

      <P>I could go through the document from which I have been quoting but I would prefer to give it to the Deputies and allow them to read it because this is an interesting question which I have asked many times. We categorise visitors as people travelling for business, people travelling for holiday and leisure and people visiting friends and relatives. In the year 2000, for example, 1.85 million people were business visitors, 3.4 million came for leisure and recreation, 1.6 million were visiting friends and relatives and 350,000 were in other categories. This made a total of 6.1 million people. I know the point the Deputy is making. Last night I read the document from which I am quoting and it deals with the figures very comprehensively. It would be helpful if the Deputy would read it also.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that I have always been a supporter of low cost access and I have been working on this issue for a number of months. It is hoped an announcement will be made soon with regard to further low cost access facilities. It has been shown in the past that low cost access helps to bring visitors and the setting up of a low cost base in a particular area stimulates people in that area to come to Ireland. When we set up a low cost base in Frankfurt, for example, it was estimated that more than 70% of the people coming from that area were German. Low cost access increases the number of people coming into the country. I am a full supporter of providing facilities which lead to low cost access.</P>

      <P>A joint delegation from the Scottish FA and the Scottish Executive met Department officials on 17 December last to discuss their proposed joint bid with the FAI to host the European Football Championships 2008 and the requirements set out by UEFA for hosting that tournament. The Scottish delegation subsequently met Bord Fáilte and the Football Association of Ireland &ndash; FAI &ndash; on the same day. The chief executive of the FAI conveyed to my Department officials at a meeting four days later on 21 December, 2001 his association's strong support for a joint Irish-Scottish bid to host the tournament.</P>
      <P>On Friday, 25 January I had a preliminary discussion with the Scottish Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport on this matter and we arranged that officials of our respective Departments should meet without further delay. This meeting took place yesterday 29 January 2002, with officials of the Scottish Executive, and a meeting with the FAI has been arranged for Friday next. In addition, I have arranged to meet Mr. Mike Watson, Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport in the Scottish Executive on 5 February next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government supports in principle the proposed joint bid but there are still issues to be considered before it can proceed, for example, <Col N="22" /> UEFA requirements in terms of stadia, policing, security, accommodation, transport and other infrastructure and services needed in organising this major international tournament. At any rate, football associations must confirm by 28 February to UEFA that they intend submitting a joint bid by 31 May, the closing date for the submission of formal bids.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the independent consultants, High-Point Rendel, have completed the overview of the cost of the stadium and sports campus Ireland project and the steering group appointed by Government to oversee the work submitted its final report to me in early December. Since then a Cabinet sub-group has been considering the options open to the Government in light of the recommendations of the HPR report. I do not intend to make further comment until the Government has completed its considerations of the report and the implications, if any, for the current plans for the Campus and Stadium Ireland project. No discussions have taken place with the IRFU in regard to the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. Will he assure the House that the joint bid for the European championships in 2008 is not just a cynical political exercise whereby, on the one hand, the Scottish First Minister wants to get off the hook in terms of commitments made by his predecessor and, on the other, it suits the Taoiseach to push forward his pet project? The Minister is on record as saying that he favours the publication of the High-Point Rendel report. Will he recommend to Cabinet that the report be published and, if so, when does he anticipate it will be published? Will he explain to the House why the Campus and Stadium Ireland Bill, which in the autumn was promised for early in 2002, has been postponed to mid-2002? Effectively, this means the Bill is unlikely to be ready before the general election? </P>

The Deputy mentioned that this will suit the Taoiseach, but that is not the case. We were continuing to progress the Campus and Stadium Ireland project throughout the year &ndash; it has taken up all our time throughout January. It has absolutely nothing to do with our intention in regard to the stadium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should outline for the Deputy the steps that have been taken in this regard. First, the High-Point Rendel report was commissioned in June or July. Second, a steering group was set up to oversee the report and it accepted it on my behalf in early December and presented it to me on 12 December. Third, a Cabinet sub-group was set up. This consisted of myself as chairman, the Minister for Finance, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, and the Attorney General. Fourth, officials from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste's <Col N="24" /> adviser, officials from the Attorney General's office, the Department of Finance and my Department assisted the sub-group. These meetings took place throughout the Christmas period and in January.</P>
      <P>While this is the Dáil's first day back, we have been going through the report in great detail during January when we took on board all the issues. There have been three meetings between officials and two meetings between the Attorney General, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and myself to discuss aspects of the High-Point Rendel report. While there are positive issues in the report, there are also issues of concern to us. It takes some time to go through the report in its entirety so that a satisfactory conclusion can be reached. I hope to bring the matter to Cabinet shortly. While I would like to discuss the matter with the Deputy, I am sure he will appreciate that I cannot do so until I first discuss it with my colleagues. I assure him the matter is at an advanced stage and I hope we will be making a decision on it shortly.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have always been a supporter of the stadium and the entire campus idea because I believe it is futuristic and an indication of where this country is going at the beginning of this century and millennium. However, we must take on board the concerns regarding the stadium and the recommendations in the High-Point Rendel report. We have taken on board all those considerations and we have been discussing every part of the High-Point Rendel report, which is the reason for the delay until now. I have always been a supporter of the stadium. Deputy O'Shea indicated that something mischievous was going on concerning the European Football Championships in 2008. I have always maintained, however, that without the proper infrastructure, the country will never be able to attract major international events. If we had this stadium, or even a glimpse of two proper stadia, we would have been flying for 2008.</P>

      <P>The requirements for hosting the 2008 championships are such that for a group match a stadium capable of seating 30,000 people is needed. A 40,000 plus stadium is required for a quarter-final or semi-final, and for an opening match or the final a 50,000 seat stadium is needed. I would remind the Deputy of the economic benefits of these matches. For example, the English international rugby match brings 20 million into the economy of Dublin every time it is held here. The Welsh match brings in 15 million, while the French and Scottish matches bring in 12 million each. This means that over the two year period involved, some 70 million is spent in Dublin when it hosts those four matches alone.</P>

      <P>In July 1999 I established the Irish Sports Council, under the Irish Sports Council Act, 1999, as the statutory body with responsibility, <i>inter alia</i>, for the promotion and development of sport.</P>
      <P>Last week, the Sports Council announced grants totalling 7.2 million to 56 governing bodies of sport, which allows them to carry out their core activities of administration, planning, coach education, and international training and competition.</P>
      <P>This year's NGB grants will bring to 30 million the total investment in NGBs since the Irish Sports Council was established. It is the third successive annual increase in their grant allocations. This is targeted and strategic investment based on the needs of the sports bodies and their athletes and which is fundamentally transforming the way sport is administered in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council is working closely with the national governing bodies in helping them to improve their organisational capacities and structures, to enhance their administrative systems and to <Col N="26" /> introduce more effective planning processes within their organisations. In the past few years a number of individual governing bodies in sports, such as gymnastics, hockey, basketball and athletics have all merged, resulting in more effective, focused organisations. The council will continue to facilitate the amalgamation and rationalisation of smaller organisations who consider that their structures and sports would benefit from such mergers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most parliamentary questions that we table concerning sport are now referred to the Sports Council and they are not being answered by the Minister. That is wrong because the Minister should be answerable to the Dáil for the actions of the Sports Council. We are told, however, that such questions are the responsibility of the Sports Council, not of the Minister. Today, for example, some five questions were not allowed.</P>
      <P>Despite his announcement, is the Minister aware that a number of the small sports federations find it impossible to employ full-time administrators? Due to a lack of funding, some of the better athletes with Olympic potential cannot receive proper coaching from experts, either here or abroad. If we want to produce Olympic athletes, the Minister must provide funding for the small sporting federations to ensure they have adequate training programmes in place. In addition, they need to have proper administrative structures to provide coaching, be it here or abroad, for athletes and prospective athletes at national and international level. The Minister may not be aware of it, but the feedback I am getting is that most of the smaller sporting organisations are starved of cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the Deputy's point. Every national governing body for sport believes it will bring back an Olympic gold medal. We have carried our research and have commissioned many reports on this issue. Through the Sports Council and the national governing bodies we are trying to target specific sporting areas where we have some hope of bringing home gold medals. Although it is essentially a matter for individual athletes and their sports' national governing bodies, we have assisted them with funding. In the 2000-02 period my Department has provided 8.7 million for the administration side of sport alone, which was not even heard about previously. Some 197,000 was provided in 2000 for new staff positions in six of the national governing bodies &ndash; badminton, rowing, basketball, canoeing, cycling and volleyball. If the national governing bodies come forward with relevant administrative plans the Department will consider them. In addition to the 140 million in capital funding, we have also made available 8.7 million for administration.</P>
      <P>Coaching is, of course, very important.</P>

An additional 11 million was given to me for Bord Fáilte by the Minister for Finance in the budget. We put 6.35 million into festivals and cultural events, which has been unheard of in the history of the tourism industry. We also increased the funding for the sports tourism initiative from 6 million to 7.5 million to attract major sporting events into the country. I could go on about what was done to try to deal with a difficult year in terms of access and of bringing in extra money for marketing and for events in the country. However, I have not heard it said before that a Bill to set up an authority has anything to do with the initiative or the problems of 2001.</P>

There was then a discussion at Cabinet to merge these two areas of Bord Fáilte and CERT. Meetings had to take place between the board of CERT and the workers in CERT and in Bord Fáilte. When we got the green light from both chairmen that it was possible, we brought the merger proposal to Cabinet where it was agreed. We are currently working on the Bill. I agree with the Deputy that we need to do everything possible to assist the tourism industry. The development authority will be responsible for tourism activities in 2003.</P>

      <P>As I have said, it is clear that this year will be a challenging one for all of Irish tourism. Last year the tourism sector and the general public willingly made great sacrifices to support the agricultural community. I hope this year will see tourism and farming interests working together to facilitate the maximisation of tourism potential in rural areas.</P>
      <P>In reply to earlier questions, I outlined details of the comprehensive marketing plans for 2002 launched by Tourism Ireland Limited and Bord Fáilte. These have been designed to maximise visitor numbers by targeting and attracting a broad mix of tourists of varying age, interest and country of origin. TIL's programme budget of 27 million is the largest ever for international marketing and it is supplemented by substantial niche-product marketing funding by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned that one of my top priorities is to facilitate a more balanced regional spread of tourism revenue, a policy that has obvious benefits for the agri-tourism sector. This is clearly in line with Government policy on regional development and with my Department's stated objective to facilitate continued development by the tourism industry of an economic and environmentally <Col N="30" /> sustainable and spatially balanced tourism sector. I also referred to the launch yesterday of Bord Fáilte's tourism product development scheme, which has been specifically designed to help less developed areas realise their potential and to stimulate new tourism growth areas.</P>
    <P>In addition to the tourism-related strategies implemented through financial support from my Department, a number of other Departments administer schemes of particular relevance to the agri-tourism sector, particularly the Leader programmes administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Earlier rural agri-tourism programmes saw significant public and private investment in rural tourism facilities. Under the current Leader programme, 30 million has been earmarked for sustainable rural agri-tourism projects in the period to 2006. I look forward to Leader groups and tourism development agencies developing a close working relationship in the implementation of these schemes.</P>
    <P>Specific questions about the rural agri-tourism programme can be addressed to my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>However, it goes without saying that, in the context of 40% of the population living in rural areas, the effective implementation of the rural tourism programme under the current Leader initiatives should provide significant opportunities for people to embark on sustainable income earning activity, both on and off-farm. I am confident these initiatives, which are designed to restore business levels to those achieved in year 2000 and return the industry to the 5% growth target envisaged under the NDP, will facilitate the tourism industry's recovery from the setbacks of last year and, in the process, boost rural agri-tourism.</P>

      <P>Has the Department or the Government carried out an analysis or an assessment of the impact of the foot and mouth crisis and the 11 September massacre on our tourism industry, particularly the agri-sector? Has the Minister or the Government plans to rationalise the different bodies which promote tourism in the State, given that they are often in competition with each other to the detriment of the tourism industry? Does the Minister agree there is duplication and overlapping of resources? What has he done or what does he plan to do in this regard? </P>

      <P>I cannot get the figures for how the agri-tourism sector was affected. It would be impossible to define the agri-tourism sector, which is dealt with by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. There has been an impact on the sector. It is estimated there will be a 500,000 deficit this year or a 7% decrease. Revenue has remained buoyant with a decrease of only 1%. I will make inquiries for the <Col N="31" /> Deputy about the agri-tourism sector. I agree there is a need for rationalisation because there are overlaps as people try to do their utmost for their specific areas. There is no co-ordination between the different groups involved. There is too much emphasis on printing lovely brochures. Unfortunately, approximately 80% of them end up in bins. I ask people to move away from print and to take advice from the regional authority to which they belong.</P>

Is he aware of a threat by farmers to close off the countryside in the next tourism season because of changes in REPS in terms of the provision of additional grant aid if walkers are allowed on their land? The Minister may not be aware of it, but he should take it up with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the farming situation which is why I included it in my response. The country did very much for the farming community last year and we succeeded in keeping foot and mouth out because of a national effort. The tourism industry paid an enormous price and, as I said, there will be 500,000 fewer visitors this year which will result in an economic downtown. It is estimated that the losses may be 250 million. Both sectors co-operated last year and I encourage farmers to reciprocate.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I launched the national product scheme and will do the same in Carlow on Friday and in Sligo next week. That includes funding for walking and cycling. We were delayed by two years in implementing a national plan over six or seven years but it has been reduced to five. There is huge potential for development as a result of product management.</P>
      <P>We will continue to do all we can with Bord Fáilte to fund the marketing of the agri-tourism sector, which is very important as many people are dependent on it because farming is not as buoyant as it used to be. We are aware of it and introduced schemes last year which were conducive to agri-tourism. We will work with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to help that sector.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation</askee>
      <Quest>the steps he plans to take to encourage greater recruitment of Irish nationals to work in the tourism sector, in view of the increasing dependency of the sector on employees from abroad; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2538/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The recruitment of skilled staff remains a key issue for the tourism sector, despite the economic slowdown, some slight increase in the labour supply and the tourism market difficulties experienced last year. Against this backdrop, CERT undertook specific recruitment campaigns in 2001 which increased by about 9% formal entry to the industry through training. CERT was also able to target its recruitment campaign at women returning to work and more than 1,000 women were trained. The school-leaver market fell slightly in line with expectations. Some potential to expand the domestic labour market remains but for the future it is likely to be confined to the more mature female segment.</P>
      <P>CERT addresses entry to the tourism and hospitality industry workforce by way of a comprehensive promotion and recruitment campaign aimed at specific target markets such as school-leavers, those wishing to return to work and the long-term unemployed. The campaign includes roadshows, attendance at all major exhibitions, 300 school talks and attendance at the AGM of career guidance counsellors.</P>
      <P>These activities are supported by the distribution of school packs for guidance counsellors and two career videos targeted at school-leavers and those wishing to return to the workforce. Last year, for example, the &ldquo;Go places in tourism&rdquo; roadshow confirmed its value as the industry's prime marketing tool. It visited 18 venues across Ireland and attracted more than 10,000 students and potential recruits who experienced the career campaign and took part in the ready-steady-cook presentations with top Irish chefs. The campaign also went into second level schools through the chef of the future competition which attracted 90 student teams.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional information.</i>Promotional plans for 2002 provide for an increased emphasis on direct communications with target groups via a roadshow and an expanded programme of exhibitions and school talks. For the first time, primary schools will be targeted when the new people and place programme is launched to raise awareness of the core values of the Irish tourism product among young people. A new careers advice centre will open in CERT House to provide a one-stop-shop to anyone considering a career in tourism and hospitality. The new CERT website allows students to access careers information and request further careers information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome these initiatives by CERT to recruit and encourage more Irish nationals to the industry. Nonetheless, a recent report by CERT showed that non-nationals account for over 20% of total industry employment. This is not surprising, given that the economy has been operating at virtually full employment in recent years. Future <Col N="33" /> growth in this area may not be as marked as in the recent past, but there can be little doubt that cultural diversity will remain a feature of the tourism workforce for the future.</P>
    <P>The recent changes to the work permit scheme as operated by my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, should also encourage greater recruitment of Irish nationals. I understand that from this month, new applications for work permits from employers will not be accepted unless accompanied by a letter from FÁS confirming that all reasonable efforts had been made to fill the vacancy through the domestic or wider EEA labour market. This new system should help control levels of unskilled workers being recruited into the industry and help ensure that the availability of a possible Irish employee will be checked before a permit is issued to a non-EEA national. This is being achieved by a formal consultation procedure between CERT and FÁS.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>The question was about the recruitment of Irish nationals to the tourism sector. While I accept what the Minister said about CERT, the difficulty is not with it but when people leave CERT and enter the industry. Is he aware that many people, who are well trained by CERT, last only six months in the industry because of long hours and low pay? The Great Southern Hotel group should be commended as its staff is unionised and they have no difficulty recruiting, but many other hotels exploit workers who were trained in CERT or elsewhere. The Minister ought to commission a survey to discover why many CERT students last less than a year in the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the industry had an image problem in the past, but I congratulate it on doing the utmost to improve that image in recent years. I believed that it was improving but I take note of the Deputy's comments and will inquire from CERT what is happening to the students and why they leave. The introduction of the minimum wage means that more people will enter the industry and they will have a great future. Tourism, like other sectors, has experienced difficulty in recruitment as many people went into the IT sector in the hopes of getting rich quick.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is exploitation in the industry, I hope that people, young or old, will come forward with information as there are agencies to deal with this. It may exist to a degree but nothing can be done unless people make it known. The minimum wage, which was introduced by the Government, is successful and policing it is not a problem in this industry. There are <Col N="34" /> other sectors where it can be argued that the minimum wage should apply, but it can easily be policed here.</P>

      <P>I was talking recently to Paul O'Toole the chief executive of TIL. He was in the United States over the past two weeks and he is upbeat about what the first quarter of 2002 will produce. Nonetheless, we must remember what happened on 11 September. However, because the industry has brought forward excellent packages, a number of people from the United States are availing of them. The Deputy is correct that US visitors are the large spenders here. While we had a 7% downturn in visitor numbers, there was only a 1% downturn in revenue. Much of that had to do with the new access routes opened in 2000 and 2001 from the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" /> I am more optimistic concerning the United States having spoken to the chief executive last week. It is important that we maintain the gateways that have been opened and that we do not lose any others. Hopefully, Aer Lingus will be able to open up Washington and Baltimore in the not too distant future. The US market is being managed by TIL and I will not have figures until later in the year with regard to the potential, but I am optimistic.</P>

Will the Minister expand on that statement and tell us when this can be expected? Does he agree that the lateness of this for the next tourist season is a matter of concern?

      <P>As the Deputy is aware from the newspapers, there has been ongoing discussion about whether a further terminal would be required at Dublin Airport. We commissioned a report from Mr. Douganis on that matter which favoured the building of a low cost access terminal at Dublin Airport. That was a recent report and the matter will come before Government now. We get such reports, examine them and find out what is in the best interest of the tourism industry, particularly in regard to infrastructural access. That is what we are doing. I agree with the Deputy that we need to act now for 2002 but we also need to be sure of what we are doing because the industry will remain long after we are gone. We want to ensure that the decisions we take now are in the best interest of the country and the tourism industry. We have been discussing the matter since the Douganis report became available. We are taking the issues on board and it will be discussed at Government level.</P>

      <P>Mark Clinton was a much loved member of Fine Gael who made an enormous contribution to Irish public life at local and national level and later at European level. His death is a great loss not only to his wife and family, but to the Irish public as a whole. He was first and foremost a hard-working representative of his constituents whether in Dublin County Council, Dáil Éireann or the European Parliament. For most of us Mark Clinton's major national contribution was within the period 1973 to 1977 when he was Ireland's Minister for Agriculture during the formative early years of our membership of the then EEC.</P>
      <P>His commitment to Irish farming, his very detailed knowledge of all aspects of farming, his ability as a skilled European negotiator and his sheer determination made possible what is now recognised to have been a golden period in Irish agriculture. Under his expert guidance milk output increased by 33%, cattle output by 11% and agricultural output by 15%. In the late 1970s, drawing on his European experience, he set his sights further afield and enjoyed a new lease of political life in the European Parliament where he passionately advocated the interests of Irish farmers and defended the European Common Agricultural Policy. The esteem in which he was held, particularly by the Irish farming community, was shown in his re-election to the European Parliament in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many aspects of Mark Clinton's life, however, that are not as well known as those I have mentioned. GAA fans will remember him as a gifted Meath footballer at all levels, including the senior team. He was an accomplished horseman and hunted as often as he could. He also owned a number of horses which won at many point-to-point meetings and won jumping compe<Col N="39" /> titions at shows all over Ireland. For many years he served on hospital boards and made a very important contribution to improving hospitals and the health services. This work was entirely voluntary and included membership and holding the chair of boards of virtually every major Dublin hospital south of the Liffey.</P>
    <P>That typified the generosity and community spirit of Mark Clinton; he rolled up his sleeves, got down to the job and did what he could for the wider community to which he belonged. On behalf of Fine Gael, and indeed of the wider public, I express our deepest sympathy to his widow, Dorothy, his sons, Joe, Mark, Richard and David, his daughters, Paula and Olivia and his sisters, Sadie and Olive. The community's loss is great; his family's loss is greatest of all. Go ndéanfaidh Dia trócaire ar a anam dílis.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil party and on my own behalf I extend my deepest sympathy to Deputy Noonan and the Fine Gael party on the death of Mark Clinton on 23 December 2001. Mark was born in Moynalty, County Meath in February 1915. He was the eldest son of a farmer and was educated by the Christian Brothers at Kells, at Warrenstown Agricultural College and at University College, Dublin, where he acquired his qualification in agricultural science. He worked for a time in England with the Harry Ferguson company on the development of the famous Ferguson tractor. He returned to Ireland and was appointed as farm manager in the Peamount estate in Newcastle, which is where I first remember him. He developed a large dairy herd there. Mark was also a very keen footballer and he played in the 1939 All-Ireland Final against Kerry.</P>
      <P>I wish to acknowledge his long and distinguished career in the public service. He became a Dublin county councillor in 1955 and served on many committees and boards up to 1973. He was elected to the Dáil on his first attempt in 1961 and was re-elected in successive general elections until he stood down in 1981 to concentrate on a career in the European Parliament. He was one of the first directly elected representatives. He retained his seat in 1984 and served as an MEP for ten years. He became Vice President of the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>He was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in the 1973-77 Government. He served with distinction as a Deputy, a Minister and latterly as an MEP. As Minister for Agriculture he was widely regarded as having played a key role in the development of Irish agriculture at the beginning of our period in the EEC. He was a guardian of Irish interests in Europe at a critical time in the evolution of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with Deputy Noonan and the Members of the House in extending our sympathy to his wife, Dorothy, his sons, Joe, Mark, Richard and David, his daughters, Paula and Olive and his sisters, Sadie and Olive.

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I wish to extend to the Fine Gael party and to the Clinton family our sympathies and condolences on the death of Mark Clinton. I remember Mark Clinton in this House. I came in as a Senator in 1976 and I recall him until he retired from this House, though not from politics, in 1981. He was an old-style traditional gentleman politician, very courteous and very considerate of new Members. He was very attentive to the lack of experience that new Members had in this House. That gentleness concealed a toughness and a breadth of knowledge that he brought to the service of his party, his constituents and in particular to farmers. Deputy Noonan is correct in saying that he presided over a golden age for Irish agriculture. It moved from a period of very low prices because of the common food policy, or the cheap food policy, of the United Kingdom into which we had been locked for so many decades. The opening from that to the Common Agricultural Policy transformed the face of rural Ireland. Many farmers, and in particular many farming homesteads, can point to the dramatic improvement in the quality of their housing during that period. For the first time since the 1920s rural life in particular and agriculture in general experienced a wealth of productivity and high prices never previously enjoyed. Mark Clinton will be forever associated with that period. To his wife, Dorothy, and to his large family, I extend our sympathies on this sad occasion.</P>

      <P>I wish to join with the Taoiseach and with Deputies Noonan and Quinn in extending my sympathy and that of the Progressive Democrats to the late Mark Clinton's wife, Dorothy, his family and the Fine Gael party. I have known Mark Clinton for a considerable length of time. He was a neighbour of mine in Newcastle, he was the farm manager of Peamount Hospital and he was a Deputy and a member of Dublin County Council for many years. He was widely respected and had enormous integrity. As Deputy Quinn said, he presided over the Department of Agriculture during one of the most successful periods for farming. Following our entry to the European Community, Mark Clinton was the Minister for Agriculture. On one occasion he withdrew from a Council of Ministers' meeting when he found that he could not agree to a proposal. To his credit the proposal was subsequently withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mark Clinton died after a long illness. He had been ill for the last number of years. He was well regarded in the community even by those of a different political persuasion. To his wife, Dorothy, his sons, Joe, Mark, Richard and David, and his daughters, Paula and Olivia, I extend my sympathy. He will be sadly missed not just in Newcastle, Rathcoole and south-west Dublin, but also as a loss to Ireland and to Irish politics. At <Col N="41" /> one time he was mooted as a possible successor to Liam Cosgrave. He was highly regarded and despite his toughness he was a very gentle person. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

I have no doubt that many people will remember the name Clinton as being synonymous with Irish agriculture. Although I did not know Mark Clinton personally, I recall that when growing up I heard the name Mark Clinton on the radio in debates and campaigns dealing with farming and agriculture. For many of us growing up at that time, the name Clinton was as well known as many of the names of farming products being advertised on the radio. His name goes into the vocabulary of Irish farming, representing an era in the 1970s of Ireland becoming a part of the European Community. For those who knew him personally, his death is a much greater loss, and I extend my sympathy to them. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasal.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to add to the recital of Mark Clinton's qualities. I remember him principally as one of my closest personal friends in politics. He was somebody who looked after my interests in the early part of my political career, even to the point of coming to public dances in the old hall in Dunboyne. One would not usually expect a member of the front bench to do that for somebody who was not even elected to anything at that stage. I am proud to say as a Meath Deputy that he was proud of his Meath roots. He was on the first Meath team to make it to the All-Ireland Final of 1939. He was a truly great and courageous footballer and his character was shaped on the football field. He was a man who played fairly but with great strength. He was steeped in the political tradition of north Meath. His uncle, Justin McKenna, was a Sinn Féin Deputy at the time of the foundation of the State. His brothers and family have continued to serve the people.</P>
      <P>He was a spokesman on various subjects for his party besides agriculture. He was a spokesman on defence at one stage and one of his sons joined the Army, inspired by his father's sense of the importance of those services to the nation. As Deputy Noonan has said, he was a man who led many different lives in the course of one lifetime. In addition to being a very successful politician, he was an extremely effective manager of an important part of the health services. He was not simply a farm manager in Peamount; he actually managed Peamount in all its non-medical aspects. Because of his effectiveness he won great respect for that work and standards achieved in Peamount were imitated elsewhere. With the help of his family he bore a very long illness with great dignity. It is important that he has been remembered so eloquently by so many on this occasion.</P>

      <P>I would also like to be associated with the expressions of sympathy for Mr. Mark Clinton's widow and family and also their extended family in north Meath. Mr. Clinton came from the village of Moynalty seven miles from Kilmainhamwood. Uniquely, both he and my father were elected to this House on the same day in 1961 where they worked on behalf of the people of Ireland, County Meath and the constituency Mr. Clinton represented in Dublin. When he went to Brussels he did so as an Irishman with negotiating skills of distinction. Everyone in Ireland remembers the authority he had over his brief as Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Later, when I became a Member of this House in 1981, I had the opportunity to visit the European Parliament as a member of a number of delegations. As a Member of the European Parliament, Mr. Clinton was able to enlighten us on how to get the best possible results from our negotiations. The people of Ireland, particularly the agricultural community, will remember him as the person who laid the foundation of the most strident development that has taken place in agriculture since the 1940s or even earlier through his excellent negotiating skills.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil and the people of County Meath lost a great friend and servant with the death of Mr. Colm Hilliard with whom I had the pleasure of serving during all his years in this House. On behalf of Fianna Fáil and the Government, I express my sincere condolences to the Hilliard family, his widow, Margie, and children, Kevin, Fergus, Ursula and Dara. I also extend my sympathies to his many friends and supporters in the Fianna Fáil organisation and beyond in County Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Hilliard was a dedicated public servant whose life was all about helping his constituents and being involved in the things he enjoyed. During his 15 years as a Member of the Dáil and many years as a member of Meath County Council he set an example of public service. He was always a vigorous defender of the interests of his native county. He was especially concerned for Navan and its people. His constant lobbying <Col N="43" /> ensured the concerns of County Meath and Navan, in particular, were always heard.</P>
    <P>Mr. Hilliard was born into Fianna Fáil and politics. His father, Michael, had been a long serving Dáil Deputy and served as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and for Defence. It was a proud tradition that he inherited and upheld during his political life. Much of his political work was behind the scenes. He was a long-standing member of County Meath VEC and during the last Dáil was proud to chair the Joint Services Committee on which he worked hard on behalf of his fellow Members of the Oireachtas to modernise facilities in Leinster House to ensure staff and Members could do their jobs effectively.</P>
    <P>Mr. Hilliard was also very proud to be a long-serving secretary of the Oireachtas golf society, a role in which he continued after his retirement from the Dáil in 1997. Golf was one of his passions. Every time I met him in recent years he was either playing or about to play golf. It is not surprising to any of us that he played four times in the week he died. Out of genuine concern for the welfare of his fellow Members of the House, he always took the trouble to organise social events and golf outings, in particular, which won him many friends on all sides of the House. Like Mr. Mark Clinton, his other great interest was the GAA. His allegiance to O'Mahony Gaels in Navan was underlined by the fact that the club jersey was the only decoration on his coffin.</P>
    <P>Mr. Hilliard was a quiet and sincere man, but could be anything but quiet when he got annoyed as I remember from my period as party Whip. He worked hard for the people who elected him and earned the respect and affection of his colleagues, friends and all who mourn him. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>

He was a very well liked and respected Deputy who served County Meath and Dáil Éireann for 15 years. He also served on Meath County Council and many of its sub-committees, including the Meath committee of agriculture, on which he served with particular distinction. He died young, at 65 years of age, having retired in 1997. He did not have a long retirement, but I know he enjoyed it, by continuing as secretary of the Oireachtas golf committee and enjoying his GAA and other sporting activities. I pay tribute to him for his involvement in the retired Oireachtas Members association, in which he was one of the driving forces. His retired colleagues will remember his as much his colleagues still serving in Dáil Éireann. Ar dheis láimh Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

I served on the Joint Services Committee, which he chaired for a number of years and in whose work, as the Taoiseach said, he was very enthusiastically involved during difficult times. He had a great passion for this House and its Members. His engagement with the golfing society of the Oireachtas and also the retired Members association of the House was an indication of his concern for Members and the issues of interest to them. To coin a phrase, he did not get it from a stone. His father was elected to the House in 1943 and retired in 1973. Politics was, therefore, in his blood. On behalf of the Labour Party, I extend our sympathies to his widow, Margaret, and children.</P>

He seemed to be around Leinster House so much in recent years and on many occasions was in touch with my office in relation to matters in the Meath constituency. He had a great enthusiasm and energy for politics. He was a very warm and generous person. As others have said, he was a great golf enthusiast, having been secretary of the Oireachtas golfing society. His sudden death at a very young age surprised us all. I worked very closely with him when he first came into politics and he showed enormous courage in the early 1980s. As Deputy Quinn said, politics was in his blood, in his genes, but notwithstanding this he was a person of great integrity. May he rest in peace.</P>

      <P>I join with other speakers in expressing sympathy to the Hilliard family &ndash; Marjorie, Kevin, Fergus, Dara and Ursula &ndash; on this sad occasion. Colm retired from Leinster House while still young and had only been retired for a few years when he died suddenly following a game of golf. Many speakers have noted that he remained very involved in Leinster House through the golfing society and continued to come here after his retirement. Other Members have used words like &ldquo;courage&rdquo; and &ldquo;integrity&rdquo; to describe Colm which speak volumes about the man. As colleagues we found him to be extremely honest, honourable and very straight in all his dealings with us. He was our whip on Meath County Council and was very honest and fair to all of us. He spent 15 years in Leinster House and 20 years on Meath County Council and he served the people very well. He worked extremely hard for the people of Meath. I am saddened that he died at such a young age. May he rest in peace.</P>

      <P>Colm Hilliard was a politician who reached across the political boundaries in his constituency as well as here in Leinster House. That was very much in character with his father Michael who did not enter politics until the Civil War was long over because he did not feel it was something of which he wanted to be part. He was a reconciling figure, as was Colm. Colm was a warm-hearted person who felt things deeply. He felt pain when he was attacked but he also felt the pain of others although he could equally share in their successes. I speak from personal experience when I say he was a man of exceptional generosity. The words that have been spoken about him by his party colleagues and others are absolutely sincere.</P>

      <P>I would like to be associated with the vote of sympathy to Marjorie and the Hilliard family. Colm was elected to Meath County Council, of which I was then a member, in 1979 and to Dáil Éireann in 1982. He certainly served the people of County Meath without fear or favour. One thing for which we all remember him, especially in Meath County Council, was estimates meetings. He was the nightmare of every manager because he would often hold up meetings for up to two hours querying figures and changes. He was correct in doing what he did because he believed in ensuring that full accountability was the order of the day. I had an excellent relationship with Colm Hilliard as had many others in this House. He wore the Navan O'Mahony's jersey in both football and hurling and did so with the same enthusiasm with which he represented the people of Meath. Since his untimely death, many people have said to me that he was a decent man and that sums him up very well.</P>

Colm was an excellent and dedicated constituency politician who was deeply committed to those most in need. His honesty and integrity were second to none. He served the people of Meath with distinction at local and national level and will be sadly missed by his family, political and sporting colleagues and everybody in the county. To his wife Marjorie, his daughter Ursula, his sons Kevin, Fergus and Dara and his sisters and brothers, I offer my deepest sympathy.</P>

      <P>Polaiteoir céimiúil, croíúil ab ea Jim Tunney. Níor chaill sé ariamh an díogras a bhí aige chun obair go dian ar son na ndaoine a thogh é agus ar son Fhianna Fáil. Ba Ghaeilgeoir é a rinne a dhícheall ar son a theanga agus ar son dul chun cinn na Gaeilge. Nuair a bhí sé ina Aire Stáit sa Roinn Oideachais thosaigh sé ag obair chun ollscoil a bhunú i dtuaisceart na cathrach. Bhunaigh sé Cospóir, mar d'aithnigh sé freisin an pháirt lárnach a ghlacann spórt i saol na ndaoine. Ghlac sé páirt mhór i bhforbairt eacnamaíochta agus shoisialta Bhaile Átha Cliath agus na tíre go léir agus is ceart duinn ár mbuíochas a ghabháil leis, as ucht an tseirbhís a thug sé do phoball na hÉireann le linn a shaoil.</P>
      <P>Jim Tunney was a distinguished politician and parliamentarian who was deeply committed to the well-being of Finglas where he was born and reared. His devotion to his constituents was surpassed only by his devotion to and love for Kathleen, his wife and their four children, Seán, Jim, Angela and Orla. My thoughts and those of my colleagues are with them at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> Jim was born in Finglas, County Dublin in December 1923 and was first elected to this House in 1969 for the constituency of Dublin North-West. He served two terms as Leas-Cheann Comhairle. As a young civil servant he studied for a teaching degree at night and, subsequently, became the principal of Blanchardstown vocational school. Jim placed the highest value on education. I was lucky to work with him and be elected to this House with him in 1977. For Jim Tunney, politics, education, the Irish language and sport were a seamless whole. For him, politics was a continuation of the classroom and another means of reaching one's potential, either individually or as a country. From the 1970s, and when he was a Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, he championed the cause of Dublin City University and was proud that it became such a successful college.</P>
    <P>Jim was passionate about the Irish language. Whenever he was in this House, as he was before Christmas, there were many people here with whom he could converse fluently in Irish. He was always delighted to speak Irish here and outside this House, including at GAA matches.</P>
    <P>His interest in Irish culture did not stop with his love of the language. He was deeply involved in Gaelic games and played with Dublin county teams and was the holder of a junior All-Ireland medal. As Minister of State with responsibility for sport, he established Cospóir, a forerunner to the Sports Council. He was the first Minister with responsibility for sport to secure a capital budget of £5 million over three years. He was also deeply involved in Santry Stadium and in athletics. He was mainly interested in schools being able to use that facility to ensure young people would be able to play a part in athletics.</P>
    <P>His participation in public affairs continued until the very end of his life. He was a member of St. Vincent's Home on the Navan Road and worked with people with a disability. He gave an enormous amount of his time to that organisation. He was also a member of the outgoing Bord na Gaeilge and subsequently a member of Foras na Gaeilge and worked on North-South matters. Prior to that he was very involved in the parliamentary forums and worked with our colleagues in Westminster. He loved the contacts he made through that.</P>
    <P>Jim was a cosmopolitan. His dramatic speeches and sense of flair came from his days of working on the stage. He loved to emphasise his point. That made him one of the most recognised voices in politics on radio and television. His roles as Lord Mayor of Dublin, Leas-Cheann Comhairle and chairman of the Fianna Fáil Party meant that he was on his own world stage. He was chairman of the parliamentary party in difficult times &ndash; he did not have to do too much to get interviews and be on the national stage in those days.</P>
    <P>Having lived quite near him, having been involved with him in the constituency and sharing with him a great interest in the GAA, I was a <Col N="48" /> good friend of Jim Tunney. I was with him when he got ill on the Sunday before Christmas close to his home. We were having a cup of coffee when he became ill and was rushed to hospital, not to return home. He was a decent person. He loved this House. He loved politics. My last conversation with him was about this House, politics and hard work.</P>
    <P>While we have spoken of all our colleagues who have passed away in the past few years, Mark Clinton, Colm Hilliard and Jim Tunney shared many interests in common. They all actively participated in the GAA and were all hardworking politicians, but more than anything else when they retired from politics they continued to be involved in it and gave an enormous amount of their personal time to matters out of an interest for their community and for which they did not get any resources. They came from a good generation. The three of them were different ages. A sign of the quality of people who go through this House is that they maintained an interest and a huge commitment to what went on in the outside world. That is a sign of the quality of people who go through this House. We should be proud of all three former Members in respect of whom we are expressing sympathy.

Bhí cúlra sa mhúinteoireacht aige agus bhí an-spéis aige le linn a shaoil phoiblí ar fad i gcúrsaí oideachais. Bhí an-spéis sa Ghaeilge aige freisin. Ba chainteoir líofa Ghaeilge é agus bhain sé úsáid as an Ghaeilge go minic. Bhí an-mheas aige ar an teanga.</P>
      <P>Jim Tunney had a distinguished career as a Deputy, Lord Mayor of Dublin, Minister of State, Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Co-Chairman of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body. He had friends on all sides of the House. He served here with great distinction and was missed when he retired from the House. We are sorry he did not enjoy his retirement for longer.</P>
      <P>I would like to extend my sympathy to his wife, Kathleen, and to his family on behalf of myself and the Fine Gael Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I would like to extend my sympathy to the Fianna Fáil Party on the loss of a treasured member of that party, a former chairperson of the parliamentary party and also to the Tunney family whom I know &ndash; Kathleen, Jim, Seán, Orla and Angela.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Jim Tunney was a larger than life character. I served with him on Dublin Corporation and after the formal sessions we had many long chats about different aspects of Irish culture. He had a great interest in dramatics, particularly amateur dramatics, an interest he shared with Frank Cluskey, who once famously said he only went professional <Col N="49" /> in terms of the theatre when he got elected to this House. One would say that Jim Tunney also achieved that particular status. He will be immortalised in &ldquo;Scrap Saturday&rdquo;, if nowhere else.</P>
    <P>He was able to laugh at himself and at the vagaries of the human condition in which we all participate and share but, as the Taoiseach said and as was stated in the various obituaries, he made quite a considerable contribution to the development of this State in his periods in office. I have a personal reason to be grateful to him for the time he gave me when he was Minister of State at the Department of Education. He had cross-party respect and support and shared a sense of solidarity with people to whom he could be of help and assistance, which he certainly was in my case.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I would like to extend to the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, the wider Fianna Fáil Party and the Tunney family our deepest condolences on this sad occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to join the Taoiseach and the other party leaders in extending my sympathy to Kathleen Tunney and to the late Jim Tunney's family.</P>
      <P>Jim Tunney had an old style elegance and charm which was quite unique. My memory of his chairmanship of the Fianna Fáil Party was somewhat different from the Taoiseach's. We crossed swords on many occasions, but notwithstanding that it was never personal. He was someone of whom I was genuinely very fond.</P>
      <P>Shortly before Christmas I met him in a Dublin restaurant. He congratulated me on my new status and told me he had something he was going to send me. I expected to receive a publication that would tell me the duties of being a wife but instead I got a large orchid on Christmas Eve. It meant a lot because of Jim's association with flowers. The ever present flower in his buttonhole is something we will always remember. Unfortunately, I did not get a chance to thank him personally for that.</P>
      <P>At his funeral mass his son Seán said that his father was first and foremost a teacher and that he never stopped teaching. That is true. Even though he might not have had as many willing students as he thought, Jim never stopped giving one advice.</P>
      <P>It is hard to believe he is gone because like Colm Hilliard he was always around this House. To his family in particular, Kathleen and his children, and to the Fianna Fáil Party, I extend my sympathy and that of the Progressive Democrats. He is a huge loss to the Fianna Fáil organisation and to the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="50" /> It is important to say that Jim Tunney gave an enormous amount to politics and made politics very accessible to many people. He brought a duty and a sense of entertainment to his work. He would have been the first to say that when one stops enjoying life one has got a serious problem. He showed how life could be enjoyed in politics. He was always in the best of form any time I met him.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that his legacy here and on programmes such as &ldquo;Scrap Saturday&rdquo; will mean that he will be immortalised. I am sure there are not too many people around this House who have not, on some occasion, had a go at mimicking Jim Tunney because he was so distinctive, eloquent and unique and he had so much to contribute.</P>

      <P>I join in the tributes to Jim Tunney and the expressions of sympathy to his wife, Kathleen, and family. As a councillor, I shared a constituency with Jim, although our membership of this House did not overlap. When I was first elected a councillor, Jim Tunney was the Lord Mayor and, in everybody's opinion, he brought great style and dignity to that office. He was a much loved and respected public representative, particularly in the Finglas area of the constituency to which he was affectionately linked by the tag &ldquo;the yellow rose of Finglas&rdquo;. He will be sadly missed and our thoughts are with his family.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Ahern, I was elected to the city council in 1985 with Jim Tunney. He sometimes referred to me in endearing terms as his curate. He strode Finglas like a colossus. He represented the area superbly and made no secret of the fact that, all things else being equal, he looked after Finglas first. I last saw him in the Mansion House on the Saturday before Christmas and it was clear that he was not well. That night he recited the poem: &ldquo;Anois teacht an Earraigh beidh an lá ag dul chun síneadh is taréis na Féile Bríde ardeoidh mé mo sheol&rdquo;. Bhí sé ag súil le dul go Contae Mhaigheo chun cluiche nó dhó ghailf a imirt len a mhuintir a bhí thíos ansin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Jim took up golf with the same passion and enthusiasm as he followed Gaelic games. Unfortunately, as Kathleen said, he did not quite make it to Lá Féile Bríde. He espoused the cause of the Dublin City University or NIHE as it was formerly known. As vice-chairman of the Dublin <Col N="51" /> VEC, he and Paddy Donegan of the Labour Party, who was chairman of the VEC, outwitted many a Minister for Education to ensure that NIHE was located in Albert College where it grew to become the world class university it is now. Bhí suim ar leith aige i gcúrsaí Gaeilge. Labhair sé an Ghaeilge gach uair ar bhuaileas leis. Mar bhall de Bhord na Gaeilge rinne sé sár-obair.</P>
    <P>Jim was a superb co-chairman of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body. In the early 1980s, before the peace process had even been thought of, the Fianna Fáil organisation celebrated Jim Tunney's 21st year as a Member of the House. In the Regency Hotel that night, representatives of the Unionist and Nationalist communities in Northern Ireland attended the dinner. Jim travelled many a back road forging links with small groups in minority and majority organisations in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lawlor's antics at the tribunal are bringing the House into disrepute. His antics are a source of embarrassment to every Deputy in this House across the parties. I ask the Taoiseach, as Leader of the House, to table a motion of censure on Deputy Lawlor so that Members can express a unanimous view condemning his behaviour.</P>
      <P>It is time the Taoiseach acceded to Justice Flood's request to appoint judges to his tribunal, which he made last June. It looks as if he is deliberately delaying the work of the Flood tribunal because there is something he knows about that he is afraid will come out in public before the general election. I ask the Taoiseach to move immediately to make the appointments that have been sought for so long. There is no reason for further delay. He has delayed too long already.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier the High Court ruled against Deputy Lawlor's appeal in regard to his recent attempt not to co-operate with the tribunal and he has indicated that he will appeal the High Court decision to the Supreme Court, further frustrating and delaying the work of the tribunal. When the tribunal was established by the House &ndash; not by the Government as is frequently claimed outside &ndash; Deputy Lawlor did not oppose it and the Taoiseach called on all Members to co-operate fully with the tribunal. It is manifestly clear that Deputy Lawlor is in breach of his call. If his resignation from Fianna Fáil was not, as it appeared from statements last night, a resignation of convenience, I ask the Taoiseach to join Deputies Noonan, Sargent and myself in tabling a motion of censure on Deputy Lawlor for his failure to co-operate without preconditions with the Flood tribunal.</P>
      <P>I reiterate the comments I made outside the House last year and subsequently. Why is the Government consistently refusing to appoint, as only it can, the extra members whom Justice Flood sought in the middle of June last year? He requested the House before it rose on 6 July to appoint extra members who are required to enable him to do his work. One is forced to the conclusion that the Fianna Fáil Party in general and the Taoiseach in particular are fearful of what might emerge at the tribunal.</P>

      <P>I have not changed my view in relation to the first matter from what I said here more than 12 months ago. I co-signed a resolution then. If the Whips agree to table another one <Col N="54" /> now, I will certainly co-sign it again. When the motion was debated I stated:</P>
      <P>The High Court judgment, however, clearly amounts to a challenge and an opportunity to Deputy Lawlor to avail of its terms to put right the wrong that was done. It is fair to say, as the Government's motion suggests, that the challenge to Deputy Lawlor contained in the High Court judgment about him is one to which he must rise and if he does not intend to comply with the letter of the law and the spirit of the Constitution as laid down in the judgment, he would demonstrate such defiance of constitutional values as would justify the other Members of the House publicly and solemnly expressing the opinion that his role as a public representative was not tenable.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, a motion, such as the one proposed by the Government this evening, serves only as an expression of opinion and carries only such moral weight as the public attribute to it. In terms of fitness for office and sanctions for office holders, the people make the decision both at the beginning and in the final appeal.</P>

      <P>I reiterate precisely what I said a year ago and I have no problem co-signing a motion. A committee of the House is examining the legalities of censure rules for Members and that is also an important matter that should be kept in mind.</P>
      <P>On the second issue, I totally reject the inference in the comments of both party leaders. Justice Flood advised the Clerk of the Dáil on 13 June last of his intention to submit his final report to the Oireachtas in respect of certain matters &ndash; the payment of money to Raphael Burke and James Gogarty; the decisions taken by Raphael Burke in connection with Century Communications Limited; and the payments made to Raphael Burke by or on behalf of Thomas Brennan, Joseph McGowan and the companies with which they were associated. Justice Flood further indicated that he could not commence the taking of further evidence until he first rendered these reports to the Oireachtas. The reports were originally to be submitted by the end of September last. It is understood by the Office of the Attorney General that they are expected in March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Dáil resolution to amend the terms of reference of the tribunal was debated on 5 July 2001 the Minister for Defence, who was standing in for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, stated: &ldquo;In order to avoid any confusion between the work of the Sole Member and that of the three member tribunal, the instrument setting up the three member tribunal will be <Col N="55" /> made when the Sole Member has submitted his reports.&rdquo; The House passed the resolution on that basis.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General is actively pursuing the process of identifying candidates to become additional members of the Flood tribunal.</P>

It would be totally unfair if I was to utter the names submitted to the Attorney General by Fine Gael or the Labour Party or names whom he had sounded out, which for one reason or other were not acceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Long before there is pressure on the House to supply names to Justice Flood so that he can undertake a second module, we will have done so. As soon as we have names that are acceptable to Justice Flood and which have been checked with the Opposition we will certainly appoint those people. It is not easy to get such people. I assure Deputy Quinn in the nicest way, as I have always said to him, I am not afraid of anything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">

      <P>Will the Taoiseach table a motion of censure on Deputy Lawlor and present it to the other party leaders for signature so that the House can express its opinion unanimously or otherwise regarding his behaviour in not co-operating with the tribunal? I point out to the Taoiseach again that when Justice Flood sought additional members in June, he wanted them by July and he wanted &ldquo;extras&rdquo;, as he put it, before his report was finished. It is the responsibility of the Government to appoint and assign judges and that has nothing to do with the Opposition parties.</P>

      <P>I have no difficulty with the first matter. The Whips may discuss that. Deputy Noonan is incorrect on the second matter. When Justice Flood has finished with his first module and has reported, he wants to continue with the second module. Neither the Government nor the House has delayed him or in any way created an inconvenience for him. Long before he is in a position to take on the second module, the Government will, in consultation with the Opposition, appoint people. The Deputy can take it that what I am saying is factual. We have in no way created a difficulty for Justice Flood.</P>

The Bill to roll back that judgment was guillotined on the directions of the Fianna Fáil Party on 20 November last. I presume that was with the support of the Progressive Democrats. Committee Stage was guillotined on 29 November and the Report and Final Stages were pushed through, against the wishes of the Opposition, on 5 December.</P>
      <P>Since then we have had no indication from the Government when this abortion referendum will take place. The Tánaiste and recently returned Attorney General appear to think they can find some consensus on this issue where none existed before. We are given to understand that the date of this abortion referendum is linked to other matters for bargaining in some type of horse trading in the Cabinet.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the European Council in Laeken, Belgium on 14 and 15 of December last, accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
      <P>The Presidency conclusions and declarations adopted by the European Council have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The European Council marked the conclusion of a successful Belgian Presidency of the European Union. The Belgian Presidency in the second half of last year faced some considerable new challenges following 11 September and I pay tribute to the former Presidency. Very real progress was made in advancing the EU's agenda during its term and the effectiveness of the Union was enhanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also note the election of Mr. Pat Cox as President of the European Parliament. His election is a great achievement for Mr. Cox and for Ireland and demonstrates that the smaller member states can and do play a significant role in Europe, building a Union which is in tune with the best of <Col N="64" /> Ireland's aspirations and ideals. I look forward to Pat Cox attending European Council meetings in the future. His election as President of the European Parliament, together with recent appointments of Irish people to the highest level of the European Commission, shows that despite our small size we can punch above our weight through the talent and excellence of our people.</P>
    <P>At the European Council in December, we finalised plans for the introduction of the euro notes and coins; we adopted the Laeken Declaration on the Future of Europe; we examined the Union's efforts to restore stability and to bring aid to the people of Afghanistan; we reviewed measures taken or proposed by the European Union to combat international terrorism; we undertook to renew the impetus to strengthen the Union's area of freedom, security and justice; we reviewed progress on enlargement; we adopted a declaration on the operational capability of the European security and defence policy, and we looked at economic and social trends.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will focus on the range of external relations issues which were discussed at the Laeken European Council. I will concentrate for the most part on the internal EU agenda, and I will also mention the Laeken Declaration.</P>
    <P>The European Council looked forward to the launch of the euro notes and coins. At Laeken we noted correctly that preparations for the introduction of the euro should facilitate a trouble free transition to the new currency. Even though we were optimistic, no one could have foreseen the scale of the success. Nonetheless, it is a tribute to the great common sense of the Irish people and to the careful preparation for the change that preceded it, that the introduction of the notes and coins went so smoothly and that Ireland was in the first rank of countries in terms of a successful changeover. The introduction of euro notes and coins has brought the European Union tangibly into the homes and pockets of people all over the 12 euro countries. Such a positive and trouble-free introduction of the euro is likely to strengthen internal markets, reassure international markets and assist in the economic recovery of the euro-zone. It will be a challenge to all of us in this House over the coming months and years to ensure the significance of other vital aspects of European integration are made as tangible to our citizens as the euro changeover has been. I acknowledge the work of the Euro Changeover Board, the Central Bank and all those involved in the retail trade and other sectors who made it a success.</P>
    <P>At Nice in December 2000 we agreed the arrangements for the conduct of the Future of Europe debate would be decided at Laeken in 2001. The declaration we adopted at Nice called for a deeper and wider debate about the future of the European Union. We recognised that there was a need to improve and monitor the democratic legitimacy and transparency of the Union and its institutions in order to bring them closer <Col N="65" /> to the citizens of the member states. We recognised at Nice that a majority of the citizens of the European Union were not fully engaged with the institutions in Brussels and Strasbourg and did not always see connections between the actions of the Union and their own day to day lives. It was from this recognition at Nice that a number of member states established consultative bodies focused on the Future of Europe. In Ireland we established the National Forum on Europe which provides an additional channel for the national debate on the Future of Europe.</P>
    <P>We agreed at Laeken that we must work now to make the Union a true Union of the people of Europe. Engagement by the people with the Union is crucial. A real engagement can only be based on relevant and reliable information. As the Union enlarges and membership grows, it becomes imperative for all of us to explain to our citizens the who, why and how of the EU.</P>
    <P>We agreed at the Nice European Council that the following issues would be addressed in the Future of Europe debate: the separation of power between the Union and member states; the status of the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights; simplification of the treaties and the role of national parliaments. The Nice Declaration, having set out some of the issues that needed to be addressed, agreed that a new conference of the representatives of the Governments of the member states would be convened in 2004 to address them. At Laeken we explored these areas in greater detail. The Laeken Declaration sets out a series of questions on a broad range of issues. While we all agree on the questions, there will be a very wide divergence among the member states on the answers.</P>
    <P>In order to address these issues and to prepare for the next intergovernmental conference in 2004, the European Council in Laeken decided to establish a convention on the Future of Europe. This convention will be composed of one Government representative and two representatives from the national parliaments of each member state, 16 members of the European Parliament and two Commission representatives. The accession candidate countries will also be fully involved in the convention's proceedings. The Council agreed to the appointment of former French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing as Chairman of the Convention, and the former Italian and Belgian Prime Ministers, Giuliano Amato and Jean Luc Dehaene as Vice-Chairman.</P>
    <P>Detailed consideration is currently being given to who will represent Ireland at the Convention. While the exact rules of procedure of the convention will be established following its inaugural meeting on 28 February, members of the public throughout Europe will have an opportunity to feed into the work of the convention through national debates on the Future of the Union. Organisations representing civil society such as the social partners, the business world and non-governmental organisations will also be able to <Col N="66" /> contribute through a structured network of consultation which will be opened by the convention.</P>
    <P>Leaders agreed at Laeken that the convention will consider the various issues that arise and draw up a final document. This document may consist of options or recommendations. Where options are listed there will be an indication of the degree of support which they received. If there is consensus then a recommendation may issue.</P>
    <P>This report, together with the outcome of national debates on the future of the Union, will provide a starting point for discussions at the next intergovernmental conference. It will be at the Intergovernmental Conference where the ultimate decisions will be taken by the 15 member states as has been the case with every other European treaty and as we have agreed in the Laeken Declaration. Nevertheless, the convention will play a significant role and I am determined that Ireland will take a positive and active approach.</P>
    <P>The situation in Afghanistan was discussed at length and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will address this issue in more detail later. The European Council restated its commitment to restoring peace and stability in Afghanistan and encouraged the deployment of a UN mandated international security force. The member states are examining what contributions might be made to such a force. The Minister for Defence has since indicated that Irish forces may become involved in a peace-keeping mission in Afghanistan at some time in the future. As I have already indicated, any Irish participation in this or any future peace-keeping or EU-led crisis management operation will continue to be subject to a UN mandate, a specific Government decision and the approval of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Humanitarian aid is a priority in terms of the situation in Afghanistan and the Union has pledged 352 million to this cause. Last week the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced that Ireland would make a contribution of 12 million over three years. While on this topic, I should mention that the European Council also noted that each member state would examine the means and the time frame to achieve the UN official development aid target of 0.7% of GNP to official development assistance. I am happy to say that as Ireland is on course to reach this target by 2007, we are now in the front rank of EU member states on this issue. We are only behind the small group of countries that has already reached the target. All but one of these are members of the EU.</P>
    <P>The Council also discussed ongoing developments in the Justice and Home Affairs area as a result of the events of 11 September. As the House will be aware, the proposal for the establishment of a European arrest warrant was accelerated at the extraordinary Council meeting on 21 September, with a view to finalising the proposal at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 6-7 December. Ireland accepted the need to review current systems while ensuring the basic <Col N="67" /> safeguards to protect the individual's rights and liberties were adequately protected. We were also concerned to ensure that our existing bilateral arrangements with the UK could continue to apply under the new procedures.</P>
    <P>Following intensive negotiations in Brussels and interventions by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to secure important concessions for Ireland, we accepted the proposal. By the time of our meeting in Laeken all outstanding objections by other member states were withdrawn and the European Council was in a position to welcome agreement on the proposal. Since 11 September the EU has adopted a range of measures designed to combat terrorism, including measures to provide for the freezing of financial assets and or other financial resources of terrorist groups and their supporters, and additional measures on money laundering.</P>
    <P>The European Council invited the Commission and the Council to push forward the programme on improving co-operation between member states on the threats of biological and chemical weapons.</P>
    <P>As the House will recall, the Laeken European Council took place in the week immediately following the tragic discovery of the bodies of eight asylum seekers in a container in Wexford. We agreed that the European Union would adopt as soon as possible a common asylum and immigration policy. We agreed also that this policy would maintain the necessary balance between protection of refugees in accordance with the Geneva Convention and the reception capabilities of the Union and member states. In addition, we recognised that there was a need to improve external border controls to assist in the fight against terrorism, illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings.</P>
    <P>On the issue of enlargement, the Council noted the excellent progress in the accession negotiations with a number of the candidate countries. Up to ten candidates are all on course and at the current pace should have successfully concluded negotiations by the end of this year. These countries would then be in a position to take part in the European Parliament elections in 2004. We are also encouraged by the efforts being made by the other candidates. The recent meetings between the leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities were welcomed and the Council encouraged both parties to continue discussions with a view to resolving the situation in accordance with the resolutions of the UN Security Council. Turkey has made progress towards satisfying the political criteria for membership and has brought forward the prospect of opening accession negotiations. The Council encouraged Turkey to continue its efforts both in terms of the economic and political criteria, particularly in respect of human rights.</P>
    <P>The European Council at Laeken also discussed the European Security and Defence Policy and adopted a declaration on operational capa<Col N="68" /> bility. Following the events of 11 September, the extraordinary EU Council meeting in Brussels on 21 September last year reaffirmed the objectives of developing the common foreign and security policy and making the European security and defence policy operational at the earliest opportunity. Through the ongoing development of the ESDP, the strengthening of its capabilities and the creation of appropriate EU structures, the EU is now capable of carrying out some crisis management tasks. As the assets and capabilities at the disposal of the EU continue to develop, the Union will progressively be in a position to take on its full humanitarian and crisis management tasks. The declaration emphatically states that decisions on whether and when to make use of these capabilities will be taken in light of the circumstances of each situation.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to reaffirm once again to the House that Ireland's position on the involvement of Irish troops in any overseas operation remains unchanged. Irish troops will only become involved in EU operations where a specific UN mandate exists, where there is a Government decision and with the approval of Dáil Éireann. The declaration emphatically states that decisions on whether, and when, to make use of these capabilities will be taken in the light of the circumstances of each particular situation.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to reaffirm, once again, to the House that Ireland's position on the involvement of Irish troops in any overseas operation remains unchanged. Irish troops will only become involved in EU operations where there is a specific UN mandate, where there is a Government decision and with the approval of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>On economic trends since 11 September, it was noted that a gradual recovery in 2002 is expected. The stability and growth pact and the broad economic policy guidelines should have a positive effect by protecting the European Union from the worst effects of the global economic slowdown and providing confidence for renewed growth. The smooth and successful introduction of euro notes and coins should have a positive effect also.</P>
    <P>We also looked forward to our meeting under the Spanish Presidency in Barcelona in March where we will take stock of our progress towards making the European Union, by 2010, the most dynamic, knowledge-based economy in the world, with full employment and increased levels of social cohesion. Preparations for the March European Council in Barcelona are already under way across the relevant Departments. The Government is committed to making a positive contribution to the Barcelona European Council. It is to be hoped considerable progress on a range of issues will be made at Barcelona.</P>
    <P>The Laeken Council, unfortunately, did not reach agreement on sites for a number of EU agencies on this occasion. Overall, however, the Laeken European Council was highly successful and considerable progress was made on a range <Col N="69" /> of issues. Once again, the European Union demonstrated that it is working. We should never lose sight of the fact that it exists to protect the rights and interests of our citizens, to maintain freedom, security and justice, to promote prosperity and jobs, and to foster international peace, security and development. That is what we did at Laeken.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate especially the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr. Guy Verhofstadt. He, together with his Administration, in the aftermath of 11 September, successfully managed to steer the European Union through the negotiation and agreement of a number of significant measures which will promote international peace and security, and assist in the worldwide fight against terrorism.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the convention on the future of Europe is also particularly significant. I wish Monsieur Giscard d'Estaing and the participants every success in what should be an historic, challenging and important year's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Laeken Summit was important in a number of respects, not least in deciding to convene a convention with Monsieur Valéry Giscard d'Estaing as president, and also a forum to give structure to and broaden the public debate on the future of the European Union. Ireland's role, both in the convention and the forum, will be a particularly sensitive one given that the expansion of the Union hangs, at least to an extent, on how we move forward following the outcome of last year's referendum on the Nice treaty.</P>
      <P>I very much regret that the Taoiseach declined the Fine Gael offer last summer to work together in a short-term Irish forum which would have sought to find as much consensus as possible on how we might move forward against the background of the referendum. I am satisfied that sufficient consensus could have been achieved to develop and strengthen our position, particularly to strengthen the hand of the Government, no matter who leads it, as we move into one of the busiest periods since 1973 in relation to the future of the European Union.</P>
      <P>We now face into the European convention, the European forum and the intergovernmental conference without any clear national position and with continuing divisions within the Government on the future of Europe. This will certainly do nothing to strengthen the hand of Irish negotiators as we seek to protect our vital national interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has already been forced to concede that in future there will not always be an Irish Commissioner sitting around the table in Brussels. I wonder what he will concede next. Will he hand over decisions on Irish taxation policy to Brussels? Will he further erode Ireland's neutrality by delegating to Brussels decisions on European security and defence policy? As we approach the general election, will he promise the people another referendum on European security <Col N="70" /> and defence policy and then fail to honour the commitment, as he did at the last election?</P>
    <P>I wish to make three points. The first is to explain the reason I believe the future of Ireland's relationship with the European Union, and the future of the European Union itself, must be a general election issue. The second is to set out Fine Gael's vision for a much more democratic future for Ireland and the European Union. The third is to invite others, especially the Taoiseach, to set out their vision for the future of Europe in order that we can have a real, public debate on these crucial issues.</P>
    <P>The general election campaign will provide an obvious platform for a national debate on European Union issues. After the general election there will be a second referendum on the Nice treaty. The people voiced their concerns quite clearly in the first referendum. While I profoundly wish that the view expressed had been different, the people's view must he respected and listened to carefully. Most important of all, the view expressed must be acted upon. If there is no action to address the people's concerns, the basis for holding a second referendum will be undermined. Without action &ndash; a three year talking shop, no matter how often it travels around the country, is no substitute for action &ndash; there is a real possibility that the second referendum will be defeated. That would, to put it mildly, be unhelpful for our relationship with our European partners.</P>
    <P>Disquiet about the future of Europe is not uniquely Irish. European leaders have also noted the disquiet among many citizens of the Union. That is the reason, at Laeken, they announced the convention to consider the future direction of the European project. The convention will be a preliminary to the next Intergovernmental Conference and begins its work next month. The task of beginning to present an Irish vision of Europe must, therefore, begin without delay. That is the reason Fianna Fáil must now begin to set out its vision for Europe and not wait until the election is over or even until the forum comes to some conclusion, whenever that may be.</P>
    <P>Ireland's future in Europe is a major civic issue requiring leadership, vision and public debate. It is too important to park all these issues in Dublin Castle, as the Government has done. This was done because it was seriously divided about the future for Ireland in Europe. The Taoiseach must show leadership and seek to heal the divisions on Europe in Irish society.</P>
    <P>Currently, Fine Gael members are giving us their feedback on our October consultation document containing the party's vision for Europe. The bulk of our proposals flow from the belief that the Irish people demand a democratisation of the relationship between the European Union and Ireland, and that the peoples of Europe demand the democratisation of the Union itself. Democratising the relationship between Ireland and the European Union means implementing three democratic principles. First, democracy <Col N="71" /> requires that people should have enough information to assess the performance of those in authority. The people must be given enough information about European developments and measures in order that they can judge the Union's performance for themselves.</P>
    <P>In this context, I draw the Taoiseach's attention, yet again, to the Government's continuing failure to publish the six monthly report on Irish-EU developments in a timely manner. I drew attention to this last June, but there has been no improvement. Unbelievably, the latest report covers the first half of 1999. Is there any point in drawing the attention of the Taoiseach to these matters if he takes no action? Is there something going on in Europe that he wishes to hide from us, or is it just a further example of the incompetence of the Administration which cannot do anything on time or deliver on any promise? It is unsatisfactory that in the first quarter of 2002 the report on Europe published recently deals with the first half of 1999. That is totally unacceptable. I have raised the matter before and hope I will not have to do so again.</P>
    <P>Second, democracy requires that the people have the right to determine who has authority. The Irish people, together with all Europeans, must have the right to vote into and out of power those with the authority to bring forward European legislation.</P>
    <P>Third, democracy requires that power over an issue should be held at the closest possible level to the people. The European Union's powers should be limited to dealing with issues that, in a practical sense, can only be effectively dealt with at European level. In the Nice campaign it became apparent to me that people felt totally uninformed about what was currently happening in the Union, let alone what would happen after the referendum. Many voters felt a profound unease about authorising future developments when they lacked so much information. The perception was confirmed by a subsequent opinion poll with which the Taoiseach is fully familiar which indicated that by far the most prevalent reason given for not voting, or voting &ldquo;No&rdquo;, was a lack of information or uncertainty about what the proposals meant.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;no&rdquo; campaign slogan which seemed to strike a chord was, &ldquo;If you don't know, vote no&rdquo;. Many people, through no fault of their own, did not know not only about the Treaty of Nice but about the why and wherefore of the Union. Much smaller numbers of &ldquo;no&rdquo; voters gave concerns about sovereignty and neutrality as reasons for rejection. They too must be listened to. That is why in our October consultation document we suggested seeking a declaration to the treaty confirming that it will not affect Irish neutrality.</P>
    <P>While the Treaty of Nice's aims can be properly explained in a second campaign, many people will want to be confident that steps are being taken to permanently redress the information deficit which prevents them from begin<Col N="72" /> ning to exercise any real democratic control over the Union. Prior to the second Nice referendum, Fine Gael in Government will take practical steps to address this problem by quickly implementing the first of its democratisation principles. Fine Gael will establish a permanent Oireachtas committee which will publicly examine proposed European legislation, hear the views of the people on it and make submissions to the European institutions. It will then present reports on European developments for debate in the Dáil. European officials will be asked to attend the Seanad on a regular basis to explain the legislative programme of the Union. A Minister for European affairs will be appointed, as was the practice until this Administration, to co-ordinate and present Irish policy on Europe. These simple measures will bring the debate on European legislation closer to the people.</P>
    <P>In the European Union, unlike any form of national democratic Government, legislation is not proposed by a democratically elected Executive, but by civil servants of the European Commission. The existing democratic elements, particularly the European Parliament, fall far short of making up for the democratic deficit. The Commission is not in any practical way required, on pain of being voted out of office like other Executives, to account to the people for its legislative programme. If it was, I guarantee we would at least be kept as well informed about developments in Europe as we are about developments in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Among our European partners, both before and after the next Nice referendum, Fine Gael will argue clearly and confidently for its vision of a democratised Union. One of the issues which must be addressed in negotiating the design of the new democratic Commission is ensuring that the people of smaller countries will have sufficient input into it. Fine Gael will not allow democracy to be damaged by allowing power over those issues, which should be decided at local or national level in Ireland, to ebb away to the Union. We, in Ireland, have already moved too much power to the national Government from local communities, thus depriving people of a role in their local communities. While I do not believe the same mistake has occurred to date at European level, we must ensure it does not happen in the future. We will argue for a clear bottom up allocation of powers between nations and the Union.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government can see the sense of and share Fine Gael's vision for the future of Ireland in Europe. The European Union has brought great confidence and prosperity to the people of Ireland. Now is the time for Ireland to provide leadership by bringing democracy to the Union. I wish to share the remainder of my time with Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.</P>

      <P>The Government did not have anything of consequence to report to the Laeken Council on the steps it proposes to take to deal with its failure to have the Treaty of Nice approved in the referendum last June. It is now sleep walking its way to another defeat because it has not addressed the issues which clearly influenced the voters to reject the treaty in that referendum.</P>
      <P>The Laeken Declaration last month rightly proclaimed the European Union as a success story. Peace has been followed by prosperity and the Union is completing the final steps towards enlargement to incorporate many of the previously excluded former communist states of central and eastern Europe. According to the Commission report for the Laeken summit, it is likely that by the end of this year accession negotiations will have been completed with ten of the applicant countries. That means that upwards of 100 million fellow Europeans are ready, willing and able to join the Union. The Treaty of Nice provides the legal framework within which the Union can approach the institutional aspects of enlargement. The other 14 member states have ratified or will ratify the treaty within the coming months. Ireland stands in danger of being in a minority of one in Europe as the only country blocking enlargement of the Union. Ireland is staring into the abyss of European isolation and will bear sole responsibility for impeding or delaying the enlargement of the Union. If that occurs, we will face the most fundamental crisis in international relations to confront our country since we joined the EEC in 1973.</P>
      <P>I am increasingly concerned that we are being led towards a political and economic backyard. I do not intend to use my speech as a vehicle to engage in Fianna Fáil bashing over its botched handling of the first Nice referendum or the Tory like in-fighting between the various schools of thought &ndash; if that is not too strong a description of what passes for policy &ndash; on the European Union. The enlargement of the European Union to admit the dozen European countries cruelly quarantined for decades by the Soviets from their western neighbours will proceed with or without Ireland. There is only one vehicle for enlargement &ndash; the Treaty of Nice. It does not represent or import anything other than a vehicle for enlargement and to make the club work effectively with 27 members. Talk about militarisation, loss of sovereignty or abortion is either half baked or downright mischievous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will be isolated. The Government has not done anything to ensure that we will not be alone and isolated in impeding enlargement. Other than announcing its intention to put the Treaty of Nice back to the people again, the Government has not bothered to grace us with a date for the next referendum. It has not given us the conclusions it drew from the conduct of the June 2001 campaign or the plan of action it intends to put in place to achieve a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on the next occasion. Instead it has taken the momentous step of abdi<Col N="74" /> cating the issue to the National Forum on Europe.</P>
    <P>Despite the honourable and well intentioned submissions of various parties to the body in Dublin Castle, the forum has, not surprisingly, failed to grab the attention of the public. It cannot act as a substitute for proposals from the Government and a proper examination of those proposals in the Oireachtas. The forum, which is travelling around the country like Duffy's Circus to provide a platform for anti-European views, will not advance the issue. The noose of time is tightening.</P>

      <P>A new referendum must be held. If we have a replay of the last referendum, a further defeat is on the cards. The issues leading to rejection must be addressed. However, the past six months, during which that could have been done, have been wasted. At a minimum we must talk about the consequences of rejecting enlargement and we must look at our options thereafter, although I do not have time to explore them in detail now. Our options are limited and horrendous as far as the country is concerned. There is a major possibility that if we reject enlargement again in another referendum, the legal ingenuity of the European Union will be used to create a new structure to accommodate the other 14 member states which support enlargement and the applicant countries. That would leave us on the outer margins of the European Union without any type of power or influence on further developments in the Union.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that European Union enlargement can best be achieved through the adoption of the Treaty of Nice by all 15 members. However, it is critical that we learn the lessons from the rejection of the treaty by Ireland last June, particularly the concerns expressed about military neutrality and a perceived remoteness from the European Union. Fine Gael pointed out those issues some time ago and asked that they be addressed in good time to allow us to prepare for the next referendum. I am concerned because limited time is now available. The steps to be taken will take time and, in addition, large chunks of this year will be devoted to the general election and to the formation of a new Government. Time will also be required for the necessary legislation and referendum process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that although the Treaty of Nice did not have any impact on our neutrality, it affected people's thinking when voting. I was glad for some crumbs from the Taoiseach yesterday when he said in a newspaper interview that it might be an issue. That is not enough. Winks and nods are not enough. There should be a clear statement, an analysis of what happened like we produced last October, and a plan of action. A plan must include a declaration from the Council of Europe confirming as a minimum that the Treaty of Nice <Col N="75" /> will not oblige Ireland to join a European war or to introduce conscription. We can follow the Danish precedent regarding a possible protocolumn That is not a problem. However, any such declaration should be underpinned by domestic legislation. Has anything been done about that?</P>
    <P>I pointed out that the question of neutrality has to be addressed and clarified. The way to do that is to have a White Paper. The Taoiseach knows how long it takes to produce one and time is passing. The Fine Gael Party laid out its stall on all these issues last October. Our proposals were not meant to be prescriptive, but were in a consultation document. My main message to the Government is to stir itself out of its inertia and apathy and either to accept the Fine Gael proposals in whole or in part, or to propose an alternative. Time is not on our side and we need to put in place measures that will take time to arrange before we go back to the people. Let us use the time available.</P>
    <P>The Governments of the other 26 countries participating in the European convention have turned their attention to post-Treaty of Nice issues. It is not to our advantage that our Government has not turned its attention to the treaty, let alone the future of the Union and Ireland's place at the heart of Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Laeken Declaration. Inevitably there are gaps in it as we do have not a system which produces perfect results at European, national or local level. One gap is the failure to address issues of general economic interest such as the question of how public services should be dealt with at European level and the conflict between the provision of public services, particularly universal ones, and competition law. It is increasingly clear that public services are at risk from an overly neo-liberal interpretation of European Union competition law, which is something that this House, perhaps through the Committee on European Affairs, should address. It is an issue that should be put on the agenda of the convention by the representatives of this House. From my own knowledge, it is an issue that exercises almost every party in the European Parliament and is the concern of citizens in every member state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The convention, the task of which is to discuss and propose ways in which the European Union will do its business in the future, is groundbreaking. A big problem I have always had, as the records will confirm, is the way in which Intergovernmental Conferences were prepared and decisions made. I am not critical of the extraordinary work done by our public servants quietly in the background at national and European level or the work of different Ministers over the years. However, the chickens have come home to roost with the Treaty of Nice. It is obvious that the citizens of this and every other European state are dissatisfied with this way of doing business. That is why the convention is so important and must <Col N="76" /> be given weight by the national parliaments and a considered position taken by the representatives of the national parliaments in their contributions to it.</P>
    <P>It is important that the representatives whom the Government appointments &ndash; we do not know how they will be appointed &ndash; carry weight at European level. They must be people to whom other participants will listen. It is not enough to send individuals there because they have given long service to this Parliament or to our respective parties. They should have a track record and ability and something important to say. Ideas will be more important than services rendered.</P>
    <P>As a matter of urgency, the Government must tell us how it will select the representatives. The Government representative does not have to be a Member of the Oireachtas but whoever it is must have some political weight. There are many women who would do an excellent job and, preferably, it should be a woman to ensure gender balance at the convention. Also, the Government should make it clear that it will not take up one or both of the other places. One Government representative is sufficient and the other two places should go to representatives of the two main Opposition parties, the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I argue strongly in favour of the Labour Party having a role in the convention. We are a pro-European integration party, as are Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. I do not know the Green Party's position, or if it knows it itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that Sinn Féin is opposed to integration and sharing our sovereignty in Europe. We are a pro-European party with a distinctive view on how the Union should evolve, which will not be represented by Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats. I urgently appeal to the Government to clarify how the representatives will be appointed.</P>
      <P>Something that directly arises from the Treaty of Nice referendum debacle, as it must be described, is the concern over the accountability of Ministers to this House for work done at European level. I have criticisms of some Ministers but traditionally they have done an excellent job. However, this House rarely knows what they have done, what advice they received on the issues dealt with and rarely do they come here to tell us what decisions were made. They are not obliged to and I understand that, being busy people, they are reluctant to, but it is clear that the democratic deficit, about which we hear so much in relation to European matters, is as much a problem for this national Parliament as how institutions at EU level function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government must, therefore, dust down the Bill the Labour Party proposed last June, which it accepted in principle. It now languishes <Col N="77" /> in limbo while it awaits a committee, according to the Government's recently published legislative programme. It is not on the agenda for discussion here before the Easter recess and not listed at all in terms of proposals. The Government indicated that it was working on its own proposals. If it has better or even similar proposals &ndash; it does not matter if it is a Government or Labour Party Bill &ndash; then they should be brought before this House. The public perception ought to be that this House deals with European matters democratically and that its Members have a role in decisions at European level and in bringing Ministers to account for them. I do not seek that Ministers be mandated before going to Europe, as that would tie their hands unnecessarily, but it is important that the concerns of people we talked to last night in Ballymun, and other places recently, are addressed.</P>
    <P>People should see the Taoiseach and Ministers coming before the Committee on European Affairs to tell us what is going on, what they are being asked to agree to and to what they have agreed. Let us have our say on those matters. We are walking blindly into a disastrous situation if we do not take steps to reassure the public. These fears also exist in other European countries. There is a wariness among the European electorate which is increasingly driven by the fact that people feel they are losing control over decisions being made about their lives. By and large, the decisions being made are good and in their interests, but people are concerned about their lack of control over them. We have to put aside party and electoral concerns and bring forward these issues. We must demonstrate our concern to ensure that the project of constructing a democratic and socially just European Union is guaranteed.</P>
    <P>The second issue our Bill would have dealt with is the question of neutrality. I will not get into debating or defining neutrality because it would take more time than I have. However, a significant minority is concerned about neutrality as that minority defines it. If everyone here wrote down their own definition of neutrality I guarantee we would get 166 different definitions of Irish neutrality, but that is a debate for another day. What is essential, and this came through in both the Amsterdam and the Nice referenda and it comes through in every meeting of the forum, is that people want reassurance that this House has a say in what we do with our armed forces and our police service in terms of international Petersberg Tasks. People want to know that those tasks will be mandated by the United Nations. A simple amendment to the Defence Act would establish that. This House already has the right to approve actions being taken by our defence forces in international peacekeeping tasks. It would be a simple matter for the Defence Act to be amended to give the reassurance for which the people are looking. It is not the majority who wants this reassurance, but there is sufficient con<Col N="78" /> cern for the Government to act to reassure those who are concerned.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to make in relation to this issue is the general question of Dáil reform. I have seen the report circulated in relation to proposals for Dáil reform. There are aspects of it which I find weak and I have made suggestions to my own party, based on considerable experience of how this House works, about various ways in which it should be improved. Given my, at this stage, short-term dual mandate &ndash; I will no longer be a Member of this House come the announcement of a general election &ndash; I use this platform to urge the House to reform its relations with the European Parliament and particularly with the Irish Members of the European Parliament. It is inadequate and shows a clear misunderstanding of the role of the Members of the European Parliament to write into a reform document that Members of the European Parliament will be obliged to attend European debates in the Dáil and to sit in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery. I doubt that the Dáil can legally oblige an MEP to attend this House. An MEP has the same legal protection against being impeded from doing his European parliamentary duties as a Member of this House. The question of obliging an MEP to come here is probably a non-starter.</P>
    <P>That does not imply that Irish MEPs are not keen to be here. We want to be here and want to work in partnership with the House. We must end the notion that there is a competition between the European Parliament and national parliaments. National parliaments have the role of bringing to account the Ministers who serve the state in Europe and the European Parliament has the responsibility of bringing to account the Council of Ministers and the Commission. There should be a partnership between the European Parliament and the national parliaments to ensure that job is done effectively at every level. That can only be done on the basis of partnership, not competition.</P>
    <P>I welcome the forum. I probably initiated the idea for it within the Labour Party. I acknowledge that before the Nice referendum the Government indicated that it was favourable towards the idea but it delayed too long in taking up the idea and lost time and the initiative on the question of looking seriously at the future of Europe through the forum. Inevitably, once the Treaty of Nice was defeated, the forum's focus shifted to seeing how the situation could be rectified. The forum is beginning to gather momentum. Despite the criticisms of the Fine Gael Party, the tour of the country and the meetings I have attended outside Dublin Castle have been excellent. We listen to many of the same arguments we heard during the Nice referendum and party activists and NGOs promote their views there, but what is wrong with that? We are politicians and we are supposed to listen to the electorate and accept their concerns. Among the activists there are people who declare that they have no political affiliations. There was a curious situa<Col N="79" /> tion on Monday night in Tallaght where a Sinn Féin member, a local teacher, declared that he had intended voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; right up to the last day. He switched his vote at the last minute because he felt patronised in some way.</P>
    <P>What is important is that real concerns are being expressed at the forum. I regret the absence of the Fine Gael Party from it. Its absence has unbalanced it in a way. The document it produced on the future of Europe is good. It would not be my cup of tea in every respect but it is a serious contribution to the debate and should be heard in the forum where the people come to hear the politicians and to make their contribution. It is crazy for the second largest party in the State to opt out of one of the most important political debates about the future of the country and of Europe. We have not had a debate like this in our 30 year membership of the European Union. I offer this criticism in a friendly way and hope the Fine Gael Party will take it on board. It has made its protest and should now come in and make its contribution in the forum.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous degree of goodwill towards the European Union project but there are different views as to how it should evolve. I would not agree with how the Progressive Democrats see the European Union evolving nor do I agree with the Sinn Féin view, but we must be serious about the debate about what kind of Europe we want. There is a fundamental question to be answered on the degree of European integration people desire which, to a large extent, is a hidden issue. Should we have a federation or confederation of European states &ndash; states co-operating in a loose arrangement, which is largely free trade, or a closely integrated Europe with a constitution which guarantees the rights of European states and citizens and which outlines their rights and roles in the European Union? This is an important debate. Hopefully, when we overcome our current difficulty in relation to Nice, we can begin to open up that issue which will be fundamental to the discussion in the convention, just as the question of what kind of Europe we will have in social terms will also be a central issue.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, due to the involvement of so many states &ndash; taking the applicant states into account there are 27 states &ndash; and with the wide range of political views which will be represented from those states and the European Parliament, there will be a great diversity of views. With apologies to my colleague from the Green Party, I am not so green a politician as to imagine that all of this change can occur overnight. We are involved in a process which will take generations to complete and we can only proceed step by step. We certainly cannot proceed without the agreement of the people and we cannot obtain their agreement unless they understand what we are doing and why we are doing it. They must know that their opinions are being taken into account. Even if people's individual views are not taken on board, <Col N="80" /> they know that a very significant element of their society's views is represented. I do not resign from the European Parliament or from this House because some policy of mine is defeated. Neither should Ireland back off in its engagement with Europe because we feel a bit disconnected at the moment. We cannot work for a more just world unless we work for a more just Europe and we cannot work for a more just Europe if we isolate ourselves. We are already geographically peripheral; if we make ourselves economically and politically peripheral as well, there is no doubt but that we will lose out. The point was made that our concern should not be mere selfish concern and I would caution politicians about arguing purely on a selfish basis. People really do want to see a more just world and we will not have that unless we engage closely both politically and economically with Europe.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleagues for giving me time to speak. It is important that we hear a diversity of views in this House. I attended a Green Party summit in Brussels on the eve of the Laeken Summit. It was a very interesting occasion and I can answer my colleague, Deputy De Rossa, when he asked about the Green Party position. There is quite a diversity of views in the Green Party. The chairman for the evening was Danny Cohen-Bendit who is a federalist; many Greens in Europe are federalist in persuasion although the Danish, Irish, British and Swedish Green parties are not. It was noteworthy that we were not given an opportunity to speak on that occasion. That was regrettable because all of the views on the issue were not aired. There seems to be an elitist group in operation which is pushing a particular agenda. I say to Deputy De Rossa that we, in the Irish Green Party, are opposed to a centralised, bureaucratic, militarised, federal super-state.</P>

      <P>The Deputy could have fooled me at times. We are not a homogeneous grouping, rather we are an organic structure which does not believe in democratic centralism or Stalinist control. Only in that way can we get a proper debate in relation to Europe. It was interesting to note that protests took place in Brussels on the eve of the summit. Up to 70,000 people participated in a peaceful protest and a further 20,000 people took part in a protest march. These people were protesting for a different type of Europe. The vast majority of people want a different type of Europe. Young people are not interested in a Europe which is a vehicle for globalisation and is simply concerned with markets. They want something different and we, as politicians, have a duty to create that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> In many ways, the European Union has been good for this country in that it has broadened our cultural horizons. The direction in which we are heading now by way of the Nice treaty is quite wrong. The Taoiseach spoke in the House today about the need to inform people. We have an information deficit as well as information deficit. Last night's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; broadcast a lengthy interview with the Taoiseach but the other side of the debate was not heard. Two participants were interviewed at the end of the programme and that was supposed to offer balance. I hope that in the run-up to the second referendum on the Treaty of Nice that we will achieve that balance.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was asked last night about the question of neutrality and he said that there would be a declaration in relation to neutrality. I agree with the point made by Deputy De Rossa that we have not actually defined what is meant by neutrality. I am not sure how one can have a declaration about neutrality when there is no definition of the term. American troops have used Shannon airport and I ask whether this is compatible with our neutrality. I do not think so although the Deputy opposite thinks this is acceptable. We need to define neutrality. If we get a declaration which seeks to respect Irish neutrality, that will mean nothing as far as we are concerned.</P>

I think it would be a very &ldquo;green&rdquo; and naive person who would not see through these questions which are effectively saying that the Petersberg Tasks will be updated; that we will have a more integrated approach to police and criminal law co-operation and that economic policy co-ordination will be stepped up. We know now that those who are in charge of this are very much integrationists. The euro is now a reality and those who say that you can have an economic union without a fiscal union are living in cloud cuckoo land because one must naturally follow the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Green Party colleagues tell me the unvarnished truth of where we are heading. The Petersberg Tasks which include crisis manage<Col N="82" /> ment will be updated and we will then have our fully-fledged European army, make no mistake about it. That is where we are heading. Look at the Nice treaty and the military and security committee. People are quite rightly concerned about that. A European army must be paid for. We will have tax harmonisation and taxes will be used to pay for that army. The Irish people do not want to invest money in European armies but in areas such as health, education and the environment.</P>
    <P>We need integration in certain areas. My great disappointment is that the French and British managed to scupper an agreement on nuclear safety. We wanted to give the Commission powers to investigate and monitor nuclear plants but that was not agreed. If we are to have an integrated Europe, it should be at the level of the environment. This is clearly a trans-boundary phenomenon which requires further integration and, in the one area we wanted it, we did not get it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to report on some of the foreign policy issues dealt with at the European Council at Laeken. In replying, I am always mindful to pick up on some of the issues raised by speakers but the limitation of time constrains all of us. I would never question Deputy Gormley's sincerity about the European project but I fundamentally disagree with him. This evening he has spoken about the inevitability of the worst-case scenarios he predicts, yet he speaks about the ability of other states to bring down the issues he supports while suggesting we are incapable of preventing the vision about which he is concerned. There is a total inconsistency in his argument. He mentioned a scenario where two states could do something with which he disagrees in relation to nuclear safety measures. He had spent the previous eight minutes telling me all the things that will happen on the basis that we will not be able to stop them when, in fact, the Intergovernmental Conference process confirms that there must be agreement from 15 governments. Many compromises, which have emerged at Nice and elsewhere, can be regarded as being messy. However, they represent the political consensus of the 15 governments and that is what determines the pace of development and evolution of Europe, to which Deputy De Rossa referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gormley's analysis that the worst-case scenarios he fears will definitely happen is fundamentally incoherent when at the same time he tells us all the things that are not happening because of the intervention of various states. The Deputy has a sincere interest in these matters, but he must examine his reasons for continually adopting this approach. He cannot tell the Irish people that all of this will happen when it will not. I cite one point in the Nice treaty referendum which he would not accept. Every decision on participation by Ireland in European security and defence policy is based on the sovereign decision of Government, subject to full parliamentary <Col N="83" /> approval of this House and the requirement of a specific UN mandate. That is a pretty clear statement. The Deputy asked about neutrality and I can explain our position quite simply. We do not subscribe to any mutual defence pacts. That was always our position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing to do with mutual defence pacts. Please allow me to reply to the argument which was outlined. If I merely read this script, I would be criticised by people across the floor for not addressing the issues that were raised in the past hour. There is no point in Deputy O'Keeffe giving a facile and rather sterile response to the basic point I am making.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Gormley took neutrality to its ultimate logical conclusion, Ireland would not be a member of the United Nations. Issues can be explained and discussed and, while we may not reach consensus on certain issues, we should be fair to the citizenry and outline the factual position. The great paradox is that the Nice declaration for the first time began to look at the concerns of people like Deputy Gormley by saying we would have a structured discussion on issues such as competencies, the degree of federation or confederation or the <i>sui generis</i> nature of the European Union treaties. Pillar I is integrationist in terms of the need for the discipline of a single market and what that has meant for us. On objective economic analysis, the peripheral states have benefited to a far greater extent than those at the centre in every expansion that has occurred.</P>
      <P>We have all put our own side of the case to the exclusion of the other which does not help the public and does not serve the national interest. My approach is to take the balance sheet of pluses and minuses, pros and cons, and add them up. As Deputy De Rossa said, there are areas with which we might have problems, but when we consider the broad perspective of where our national interests lie, it is in our active participation in the European Union. If we want to influence and shape events, we have to be in there. It took Britain 20 years of Thatcherism to realise it was not possible to shape the Europe it wanted from the outside with a diktat. Even though Deputy Gormley comes from a totally different ideological position, his approach seems similar in saying that we will not have it and will opt out. That is not the way to work.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Gormley wants to be involved in democratic debate, he cannot disregard the consensus of 350 million people. His party has 3% or 4% of the vote, yet he regards me and my party, which now has 42% of the vote, as being part of an elite group. I represent people <Col N="84" /> just as he does and they all have equal rights.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gormley should not claim that I am part of an elite and that he represents the ordinary man. Deputies De Rossa and O'Keeffe also represent people. I have listened to the Green Party, others on the &ldquo;no&rdquo; side and some journalists talking about the political elite. It does not serve democratic debate in this country to suggest that the quality of nexus between Deputy Gormley and his electorate is different to that between me and my electorate. That is mere shadow boxing which does not deal with the substance which I want to debate. Ultimately we may not agree but I want people to hear both sides and come to an intelligent decision based on the overall national interest. This will help our democracy rather than hinder it. We have not had such a debate. There has been too much slogan shouting suggesting the Government is about to sell out the national interest.</P>
      <P>In my 18 years in this House, I never suggested a Government went out to sabotage the national interest on any question. On the Opposition benches, I may have disagreed with the Government's position and may have been quite strident in putting across my point of view. This Government is continually accused by elements of the &ldquo;no&rdquo; campaign as if its members are involved in the erasure of Ireland Inc. and our transformation into some super state where we will all go around with Kalashnikovs fighting an unknown enemy.</P>
      <P>Two papers came before the Council of Ministers on Monday on conflict prevention and I will forward them to Deputy Gormley who will find this is an area in which the EU is involved. We saw an intellectually dishonest campaign under the slogan &ldquo;No to Nice, No to NATO&rdquo; suggesting the EU is a proxy for NATO. That is fundamentally untrue and telling people it is true does not add to the debate. On demilitarisation in Europe, there was probably never a more demilitarised Europe than there is now in the aftermath of the Berlin Wall coming down. Deputy Gormley suggests that certain states will put all their money into a defence budget to build an EU army. The general secretary of NATO has complained to those member states and asked them why they are reducing their defence budgets. The juxtaposition of those two positions does not give an accurate picture. The European Union comprises member states, some of which are in NATO and some of which are not. We have no intention of joining NATO. I think that is everyone's view at the moment although it may change. To make that a central plank of a campaign when vital national interests are at stake does no service to this democracy.</P>

Are individual members of the party banned from attending the meetings? Did Deputy De Rossa see any Fine Gael members attending the forum in Ballymun?

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Bill 2001 completed all stages in the Seanad on 10 October last and I am now pleased to introduce the Bill to the Dáil. The Bill provides for independent regulation of the natural gas sector in Ireland through the transfer of certain powers and functions of the Minister for Public Enterprise to the Commission for Electricity Regulation. It contains no provisions dealing with the future shape or direction of Bord Gais Éireann. The Bill seeks to regularise and improve the existing regulatory regime through the removal of the current anomaly whereby the Minister is both shareholder of Bord Gais Éireann and regulator of the gas sector and <Col N="86" /> through the establishment of a framework within which the Commission can undertake its regulatory duties effectively. The Bill is an interim measure and uses the regulatory framework already established under the Gas Act, 1976, the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1987, and the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 to achieve its purposes. Further refinement of the regulatory regimes for both gas and electricity will be required when the draft EU directives, currently under discussion in Brussels, are adopted.</P>
    <P>The need to establish independent regulation of the Irish gas sector at this time is clear. The level of competition has increased over the past number of years and the number of players, other than BGE, becoming involved in the gas sector in Ireland is growing. Increasingly, decisions need to be taken on a range of issues where there is the potential for a conflict of interest &ndash; particularly in relation to pipeline consents and charges for access by third parties to the BGE network. While I have total confidence in the performance of my Department as regulatory authority, I believe that independent regulation needs to be established if confidence in the transparency and the fairness of the regulatory process is to be ensured.</P>
    <P>Competition was first introduced into the Irish gas market in 1995 through the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. This Act obliged BGE to offer access to its network to customers consuming 25 million standard cubic metres of gas per annum. The term normally used for this arrangement is &ldquo;third party access&rdquo; which allows consumers to source their own gas from any supplier, including BGE, and have it delivered through the BGE network on non-discriminatory terms and at a fair price. The existing threshold of 25 million standard cubic metres per annum gives a level of market opening in Ireland which is the fifth highest in the EU. The Bill provides for a reduction in this threshold to two million standard cubic metres per annum, resulting in the level of market opening rising from 75% to over 80%. The Bill also allows for the introduction of further market opening by order and it is my intention to have full market opening by 2005 at the latest.</P>
    <P>At present, the main consumers benefiting from third party access are operators of gas-fired electricity generating stations and a number of large industrial users. The reduction in the threshold will increase the number of companies that can benefit from these arrangements from under ten, at present, to nearly 100. The introduction of full market opening by 2005 will mean consumer choice, not just for industry but also for ordinary householders consuming gas. This proposal fully complements the latest liberalisation proposals from the European Commission. I intend adopting an orderly phased approach to full market opening by introducing at least one intermediate step between the enactment of the Bill and 2005 and I will be discussing the timing of this with the CER once the Bill is enacted. Such an approach <Col N="87" /> is essential if we are to succeed in the effective development of the gas sector.</P>
    <P>The development of the gas sector is intrinsic to maintaining and developing growth in the economy. Gas is now the fuel of choice for electricity generation and its share of the domestic and industrial energy markets is continuing to increase. This reflects a number of factors, including competitive gas prices, the relatively high conversion efficiency of gas and the fact that it is cleaner than other fossil fuels such as coal and oil. This growth in demand has, of necessity, led to a renewed focus over the past year on the issue of security of supply.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are no doubt aware, in February of last year the Government gave approval for BGE to proceed with its proposal to construct a second gas interconnector between Scotland and Ireland. This followed an independent assessment of possible new supply options to meet projected capacity constraints in the existing gas network. Following the events of September 11, my Department reassessed the supply and demand scenarios and I am satisfied that the need for the second interconnector to be in place for next winter remains critical. BGE is proceeding as planned and the project is on schedule for delivery in October of this year.</P>
    <P>The proposed second interconnector is only one of a number of large-scale gas infrastructure projects being undertaken or being planned at present. BGE is proceeding with its proposal to construct a new transmission pipeline between Dublin, Galway and Limerick. This will link in with the existing Limerick-Cork-Dublin pipeline to create a national transmission ring, thereby enhancing the security of the national system and bringing gas to thousands of new customers. This pipeline is on schedule for completion by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Members will also be aware of the Corrib partners' plans to land gas from the Corrib field located off the Mayo coast.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann, conscious of the promises made by the Government to cut crime down to zero-tolerance levels and mindful of the need for ordinary citizens to feel safe while going about their daily lives and the fact that many Irish people are living in fear of violent attack, borne out by the recently published Garda Annual Report which shows a dramatic increase in the incidents of violent crime and highlights the failure of the Government to <Col N="88" /> implement its promised zero-tolerance approach, condemns:</P>
    <P>&ndash;the attempts by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to portray Ireland as a place of falling crime rates by focusing on so-called &ldquo;headline offence&rdquo; figures which ignore the occurrence of assaults and woundings;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the failure of this Government to address the problem of violent assault which resulted in over 10,400 reported assaults to an Garda Síochána in 2000, and which includes a 131% increase in assaults causing harm;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the inaction of the Minister in combating the prevalence of rape, which now averages six per week, violent assaults causing harm that number 5 per day and serious drug offences, of which there are four every day of the year;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the way in which the present administration has allowed a situation to develop whereby only one in four crimes are reported to the Gardaí, thereby damaging the reputation of the force and diminishing their status within the wider community;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the refusal to publish preliminary figures for 2001 which would provide a more up-to-date picture of crime in this country but which are being withheld from public scrutiny for brazenly party political reasons;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the contempt with which the Government holds the business community, half of whose enterprises were victims of crime in 2000 and who have witnessed a 19% increase in crime since the Government came to power;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the lack of determination to address lawlessness which, in 2001, led to 5,000 people in Dublin needing overnight hospital care following violent attacks; and</P>
    <P>&ndash;the Government for failing to make our streets safe, for the dramatic escalation in violence and for betraying the promises it made to the electorate prior to the general election on this critical issue.</P>

      <P>During the Government's term of office there has been an unprecedented increase in street violence. The vast majority of people living in this State no longer believe they are safe if they walk alone in their neighbourhoods at night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> The report of the Garda Commissioner for 2000 records 10,933 instances of assault, excluding sexual assaults, and acknowledges that in 2000 there was a dramatic 133% increase in assaults causing harm or serious injury. In the same year the Garda recorded a 19% increase in murders and manslaughters combined and the reporting to them of 549 sexual assaults, more than ten sexual assaults every week. A total of 11,472 assaults, both physical and sexual, took place in 2000.</P>
    <P>We know that crime in this State is substantially under-reported. The 2001 report published by the National Crime Council and prepared by the Institute of Criminology in UCD acknowledges that a substantial portion of crime committed in the State goes unreported. A crime survey conducted by Fine Gael in nine Dublin constituencies in 2001, to which 4,000 respondents replied, recorded that 25% of crimes committed went unreported. That is a conservative estimate because the Institute of Criminology stated it believes that only one out of every four crimes committed is actually reported. As a consequence the total number of actual assaults which occurred during 2000 is substantially underestimated in the Garda figures. This is confirmed by information obtainable from Dublin hospitals. In 2001, 5,000 people attended accident and emergency units in Dublin hospitals alone seeking treatment for injuries suffered as a result of an assault.</P>
    <P>We are all entitled to lead our lives free of the fear that we or any member of our family, or any neighbour or friend would become the victim of gratuitous violence. We are all entitled to go about our daily business free of the fear that as a consequence of street violence we could suffer such serious injury as could destroy our lives. Those who visit this State are also entitled to know that if they spend time here, they are not at risk of the type of barbaric attack which left Guido Nasi, an Italian student, with permanent physical and intellectual disability and confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Those who come here of different ethnic origin are entitled to an assurance that they will not be bludgeoned to death on our streets and suffer the appalling fate of the young Chinese student who died so tragically last Friday.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Dublin crime survey records that 93% of Dubliners do not believe they are safe walking in the city centre at night and 71% do not believe they are even safe walking in their neighbourhoods at night. Some 90% of Dubliners worry that their son or daughter may be assaulted at night. It is the young people of this country who, in the past two years, have become targeted victims of gratuitous and mindless violence.</P>
    <P>The mantra of zero tolerance used by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as a clever sound bite during the 1997 election to attract support for the Fianna Fáil Party has been totally exposed and discredited as nothing more than self-serving, misleading and cynical election campaign rhetoric. Rather than stamping out <Col N="90" /> street violence, the Minister has sat idly by watching it spread throughout the country. He has failed to ensure the regular presence of gardaí on the beat. He has delayed the installation of CCTV cameras in cities and towns throughout the country and ignored requests from local street traders and local communities that they be urgently installed. He has failed to establish night courts to enable the Garda immediately bring before the courts the perpetrators of assault. He has failed to take the action necessary to ensure victims of assault and other crimes are provided with the help, services and information they require. He is deliberately concealing the Garda crime figures for 2001, which show a further increase in assaults and street violence, and pretending they are not available to him, although under the PULSE system they were readily available to him very shortly after the start of this year.</P>

      <P>In the past 18 months there has been an upsurge in incidents of racism in this State and in racist inspired assaults. Following the Minister taking up office, there was a substantial increase in the number of persons coming to this State claiming political asylum and seeking refugee status. It was not until the Minister's fourth year in office that he finally put in place administrative procedures and mechanisms to enable asylum applications to be efficiently processed. As a consequence, thousands of people have been here for many years awaiting a final decision on their asylum applications. They are people who wanted to work at a time when we had substantial job vacancies, which many Irish citizens resident here were unwilling to fill, but who are compelled by Government to remain dependent on housing provided by the State, so-called direct provision, and minimum social welfare payments. The extent of the State's expenditure on asylum seekers, in accordance with our international obligations, has fuelled resentment and negative public reaction from some people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we head down the road to a general election, racism is being scandalously and disgracefully fuelled and contributed to by statements made by Fianna Fáil members of this House and by Fianna Fáil election candidates and councillors. It seems that Fianna Fáil has decided, as a political ploy, to play the racial card. I will give one example of this. Last weekend the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and other newspapers reported <Col N="91" /> Deputy O'Flynn as saying, enough is enough, he has no problem with genuine refugee and asylum seekers being allowed start new lives here, but the overwhelming evidence is that the bulk of people arriving on our shores are economic migrants and nothing more. Deputy O'Flynn went on to claim that the country was being held hostage by spongers, wasters and con men. Obviously for local political reasons Deputy O'Flynn feels this type of language and statement will benefit his re-election campaign.</P>

      <P>If Deputy O'Flynn has such a serious view on this issue, why in 1997 or 1998 did he not publicly propose new laws and mechanisms to officially process asylum applications and to provide for a proper visa system such as the American green card system, which would enable those who are not truly refugees but who wish to work here to legally come here to do so? Has Deputy O'Flynn given any thought to how many innocent citizens of this State, visitors to this State and those awaiting decision on asylum applications may be put at risk by his inflammatory and ill-considered remarks which encourage incidents or racist and mindless violence? Violence on our streets must end. Statements which incite violence should not be tolerated. There must be more emphasis on community policing, a more visible presence of gardaí on the beat and new structures created to enable local communities, in dialogue with the gardaí, influence local policing priorities to ensure the real crime problems affecting their areas are properly addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> The Minister has proved himself incapable of doing what is required. He is even incapable of acknowledging the true extent of the escalating problem of street violence which must be addressed. He is past his ministerial use by date. In order to reclaim our streets and make them safe, the implementation of new policies by a new Government under a different Minister is essential and it is in the national and public interest.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. I thank Deputy Shatter for tabling this motion. This is not the first time I wish to challenge the Government and its record on street crime and violent public disorder. At the beginning of this week in Cork, we witnessed another vicious attack on a young man from Togher in my constituency. It happened in the early hours of the morning while he was walking home to catch a taxi. That young man is in hospital fighting for his life. Is this yet another extreme example of the results of the zero tolerance policy on crime of the Government, a policy on which it was elected?</P>
      <P>Anyone affected by or any of the bodies involved with victims of street crime or public disorder will say that the problem has got steadily worse in recent years. Groups such as Victim Support will confirm this. Consultant doctors in accident and emergency departments will point to a significant increase in the numbers accessing A&amp;E wards, particularly at the weekends, following violent incidents.</P>
      <P>The fact that these assaults have become more and more vicious over the years is equally worrying. The official figures from the Garda report for 2000 show that serious assaults rose by an astonishing 131%, from 737 cases in the previous year to 1,703 cases in 2000. These are only the reported cases. Many people would claim that the increase in real terms is far more startling. As Deputy Shatter has pointed out, many incidents are unreported. Will the Minister explain this? I believe that the assault figures for the year 2001 will show an even more dramatic increase. I appeal to the Minister to publish these figures immediately. I understand that they are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rise in street crime is a challenge facing policy makers. We are failing in that challenge because the policies are failing. We must be more effective in combating the underlying causes of thuggery, intimidation, racism and disorderly behaviour and we must police the streets to ensure the safety of our citizens. I spoke about this issue on local radio this morning and, to my astonishment, a 75-year-old lady from Bandon in County Cork telephoned to describe how she had been beaten up by a group of 13-year-old boys in the last week, in a quiet rural town. It is time to introduce and resource a significant increase in the number of gardaí, particularly at key times and in populated areas. We must also expose and attempt to tackle the known causes of violent behaviour. The public are becoming almost con<Col N="93" /> ditioned to an acceptance of a more violent society and, with the resources available to the State, this is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>More effective policing with better resources is far from the only solution but it is an important start. Other measures can be taken, such as greater use of close circuit television across the country. This is a proven asset to the Garda in reducing their response time to violent incidents. There should be more gardaí on the beat at night to defuse problems before they arise. How many times has this Opposition called for a significant increase in gardaí on the beat? We need to re-assess the equipment available to the Garda to better protect themselves and the public.</P>
    <P>Alcohol and drug abuse or addiction among young people is often the main source of problems, particularly in Dublin. This Government has not introduced a policy which has had an impact on reducing the amount of alcohol consumed. Ireland, to our shame, continues to have the worst teenage alcohol problem in the EU. We need effective policies to support families and educate children into a change of mindset about binge-drinking and drinking to get drunk. We need to introduce a mandatory identity card scheme instead of the failed voluntary scheme introduced by this Government. I rest my case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity at the start of probably the last session of this Dáil to address this important issue of crime on our streets.</P>
      <P>As virtually every Member of this House will be able to testify, there is probably no issue other than crime that so concerns local communities. Those of us who have been listening to communities, in our constituencies and elsewhere, have heard the demands of ordinary people that this issue be addressed. There is no aspect of crime that concerns the public more than the issue of violence. Thefts from cars are a major irritant, having your house burgled is distressing, but these pale into insignificance when compared to the impact that violent assault can leave on an individual and his family.</P>
      <P>Despite all the lavish promises made by Deputy O'Donoghue when he was in Opposition, during his term as Minister the incidence of those most important crimes, violent crimes, murder, manslaughter, rape and assault has increased significantly. Last week there was another first that we hoped we would never see &ndash; the first apparently racially-motivated murder in this country. I have something else to say about this. I hope that the Minister has not volunteered to share his time in this debate with the Deputy who is sitting behind him.</P>
      <P>In the early days of this Government, the newly appointed Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, spoke on a motion on crime. According to the Official Report of 18 November 1997 he stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout the term of office of this Government, the same vigour, commitment and enlightenment which was a feature of <Col N="94" /> Fianna Fail's role in Opposition will be brought to bear on the fight against crime from the Government benches . . . The final test of whether the strategy was or was not implemented will be this: whether the people, following the completion of the term of office of this Government, feel safer in their homes.</P>
    <P>By the test the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform set for himself in November 1997 he has been a total failure. The sorry legacy of this Minister is that after his five years at the helm, most people feel less safe walking the streets and in their homes than they did when he came into office. Any objective analysis will show this. Despite the claims that he made about bringing crime back to 1950s levels, this is not the experience of life on the ground. People see themselves enduring an unending and unacceptable level of murder, gangland shootings, intimidation, drug dealing, joyriding and public disorder.</P>
    <P>When the crime figures for the year 2000 were eventually released, almost 13 months late, in the middle of this month, there was no surprise that the figures indicated an increase of over 130% in the number of violent assaults. The only one surprised was the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Like most of his ministerial colleagues he has grown increasingly smug and complacent in office, more inclined to pay attention of the smooth blandishments of his own spin-doctors than to listen to the concerns of real people. Figures mask cruel realities.</P>
    <P>I was a few minutes late for the debate because I received a call from someone who knew that the debate was taking place. The call was from the daughter of a woman who was murdered on 14 February 2000. The murder victim was Nancy Nolan. Her daughter asked me to raise this issue in the House tonight. The reality is that her mother was murdered by a man on day-release from Castlerea Prison, although the governor had said there was a danger that he would commit murder and local people had indicated their fear. How did this happen? There is still no explanation for victims, who seem to have no role in the scheme of things put forward by this Minister and his policy of zero tolerance.</P>
    <P>All of the anecdotal evidence is that the situation has worsened significantly since the appalling figures for the year 2000. The Minister was able to admit, during a debate with me on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on the day after the figures were released, that he was currently in possession of the preliminary figures for last year. What he said is on the record. He conceded, under pressure, that the figures for violent assault for last year would show another increase on the appalling increase of the previous year. However, his claim that he could not say what the actual increase was, because he did not have the figures with him, beggars belief.</P>
    <P>I believe that the figures for 2001 will, unfortunately for those concerned, show another substantial and worrying increase in the level of violent assault over and above the 130% increase <Col N="95" /> revealed in the Garda report for 2000. The Minister is only too well aware of the extent of that increase. His general amnesia is due solely to his desire to keep those figures from the public until after the next general election.</P>
    <P>The delay in producing Garda crime figures is unsatisfactory and difficult to justify, given the introduction of PULSE. It is not acceptable that there should be a 13 month delay in producing the report for 2000. If delays are tolerated, we can less effectively respond to the changes that are happening and affecting the community. People have a right to accurate and timely information. The failure of the Minister to alert the public to the fact that criminal damage offences had been transferred from the category of serious offences when those figures were published was, at best, an effort to withhold information and, at worst, a deliberate attempt to mislead the public. This sleight of hand enabled the Minister to boast of a decrease of 9.8% in the level of serious crime in 2000 whereas comparing like with like indicates that there was an increase of 2%.</P>
    <P>The use of the term &ldquo;headline offence&rdquo; rather than the former term &ldquo;serious indictable crime&rdquo; was also an issue that arose in the debate on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; between the Minister and myself. The Minister had the opportunity to clarify the situation, and the fact that he chose not to do so says much about his commitment to openness and accountability. Such manipulation of the figures would be unacceptable at any time but it is particularly outrageous in the run up to a general election in which crime will be a major issue. The situation is that there has been a 13 month delay in producing crime figures for 2000. Then it emerged that these figures had been doctored. We know the Minister, by his own admission, is in possession of preliminary figures for the first half of 2001 and he concedes that these will show a further increase in the level of violent assault, over the appalling increase between 1999 and 2000, but he refuses to release the figures.</P>
    <P>We must treat all official figures for crime with some degree of caution as there is evidence that a considerable amount of crime goes unreported and that this, rather than an overall reduction in crime rates, might account for some apparent improvement in some of the crime figures. Statistics published by the Central Statistics Office suggest that crime is considerably higher than the official figures would indicate. Statistics produced by the office in November 1999, based on the findings of its national household survey, show that approximately 12% of households, or one in eight households, are affected by crime each year, One victim in 30 had been burgled. More than 5% of households with a motor vehicle either had the vehicle stolen or something stolen from it and 5% of households had suffered from vandalism in the previous 12 months.</P>
    <P>Exposure to crime was highest in Dublin, where close to 20% of householders had been victims of one of the crimes surveyed. The survey <Col N="96" /> found that approximately one in every 100 people aged 18 years or over had been victims of non-violent theft. Violent theft and assault, other than domestic violence or sexual assault, had each affected one in every 200 adults. Young adults were found to be at risk with over 3%, that is, three out of every 100, claiming that they had been victims of theft or assault. There is strong evidence in the survey to support the suggestion that crime is not reported &ndash; 95% of car thefts were reported but in the same survey less than 40% of cases of vandalism were reported to the Garda. We must deal with these issues, not the imaginary world of the 1950s that the Minister would have us believe we inhabit. Unless we are willing to understand and face the truth we will not be able to provide adequate solutions to the situation that most concerns our people.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believes that the only way to defeat crime and vandalism is through a proper partnership between the community and the Garda Síochána. The community cannot fight crime alone and the Garda Síochána cannot defeat crime without the full involvement of the community. That is why we have published comprehensive proposals which are based, as I have often acknowledged, on the analysis of policing in Northern Ireland by the Patton Commission. We are determined to forge a new relationship between the gardaí and the communities which they serve. Communities must be involved in deciding policing priorities in consultation with the gardaí and in being an extra arm for the Garda Síochána in working on the ground, in understanding the needs of communities and identifying those who are committing crime.</P>
    <P>We believe that structural reform is required to restore the bond of trust that has broken down in some communities. That is the reason we published our document on the establishment of an independent Garda authority and published a Bill to establish a Garda ombudsman. Among the proposals in that comprehensive document is the establishment of county policing liaison committees that would mirror the work currently done, for example, by strategic policy committees in every other area of operation, by bringing community groups, elected representatives and the gardaí together in the fight against crime. This idea is not novel. It works and is effective everywhere. However, this Minister is so deaf to good proposals that emanate from this side of the House that he challenged me on radio to instance one proposal I had made, even though one such proposal is currently before the House in draft legislative form.</P>
    <P>The litany of crime that unfolds daily in our newspapers can be seen by any independent objective observer. I have only looked at the newspapers from the beginning of this year but I have listed pages of appalling headlines. I do not have the time to list all of them but I will instance the following: &ldquo;Three attempted abductions reported in Cork&rdquo; and &ldquo;Man dies after stabbing at New Year's Eve party&rdquo; from <i>The Irish Times,</i><Col N="97" /> 2 January; &ldquo;Barman kicked to death was easy prey&rdquo; from <i>The Irish Times,</i> 5 January; &ldquo;Limerick hotel employee murdered in robbery&rdquo; from <i>The Irish Times,</i> 7 January; &ldquo;Drug-assisted rapes double over one year&rdquo; from the <i>Irish Independent,</i> 7 January; &ldquo;Listowel family traumatised by masked vigilantes at their house&rdquo; from <i>The Irish Times,</i> 10 January; &ldquo;Teen claims man raped her in park&rdquo; from the <i>Irish Independent,</i> 15 January; &ldquo;Prisoner was stabbed to death &lsquo;for snoring'&rdquo; from the <i>Irish Independent,</i> 16 January; &ldquo;Teen jailed for Garda attack&rdquo; and &ldquo;Youth charged with murder&rdquo; from the <i>Irish Independent,</i> 17 January; &ldquo;Man fatally stabbed in Dundalk&rdquo; from <i>The Irish Times,</i> 21 January; &ldquo;Gardaí appeal for witnesses after death of Chinese student&rdquo; from <i>The Irish Times,</i> 26 January; &ldquo;Garda investigate three Dublin bank robberies&rdquo;, &ldquo;Attack victim on life support machine&rdquo;, &ldquo;Three held after Limerick shooting&rdquo; and &ldquo;Appeal for witnesses to fatal stabbing in Finglas&rdquo; from <i>The Irish Times,</i> 29 January. The latter article referred to the sixth violent death so far this year. According to the measure the Minister set himself in November 1997, he is an abysmal failure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the other Opposition parties for sharing time on this important issue. The Green Party strongly supports the motion, which quite properly puts the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the dock for their abysmal record in the area of crime prevention. The Minister for so-called zero tolerance has become the Minister for zero results. He has failed to deliver on any of his promises.</P>
      <P>The record speaks for itself. The motion refers to the Garda annual report for the year 2000. Violent crimes have increased dramatically with a 131% rise in assaults causing harm; six rapes a week; four serious drug offences every day; and 5,000 people needing overnight hospital care following violent attacks. The latter statistic sticks in my mind because it is the one with which I am confronted daily as a public representative in Dublin. I receive many calls about attacks, particularly on young people, but this is only part of the picture. We do not have the crime figures for 2001, even though the Minister admitted on RTE that there are approximate figures, which he will not release. Perhaps he will confirm to the House what we already know &ndash; the crime figures are even worse for the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics are also available which indicate that only one in four crimes is ever reported. I became aware of this in a real and graphic way recently. I met a Chinese gentleman who works as a cleaner in Leinster House and commiserated with him on the violent attack on one of his countrymen that resulted in a tragic death. He said such attacks happen all the time and that he had been attacked the previous evening in a shop where he also works. A gentleman came into the shop and bought something. He then said to the Chinese man that he had given him ten euro, but had only <Col N="98" /> received the change of five euro. The Chinese man said he would check the closed circuit television footage and was able to prove the customer was lying. As the Irish man left, he turned around and hit the Chinese man full in the face. I could see the bruise, but he did not report the attack to the Garda. Many racist attacks go unreported in Dublin, a city which is becoming very violent and resentful.</P>
    <P>We do not need statistics to tell us what we can see with our own eyes, particularly in Dublin. There are growing levels of casual violence on the streets involving young people who are usually drunk out of their minds. The European Union issued a report in 2001 which pointed out that Ireland tops the European league for under age drinking. This not only poses tremendous health problems for Ireland, as evidenced by the Minister for Health and Children's statement that in 1999 alcohol related illness cost the State £1.7 billion, it also poses significant social and criminal problems.</P>
    <P>Dr. Patricia Casey, professor of psychiatry at UCD recently stated this increase in alcohol consumption nationwide is one of the principal factors in increasing levels of crime. There has been a 35% increase in consumption since 1993 according to a Department of Health and Children study conducted in August 2001. The Garda annual report for the year 2000 referred to juvenile crime and stated:</P>
    <P>Referrals in relation to drink-related offences increased by 332 when compared to 1999. There was an increase of 24.8% over 1999 in the number of referrals relating to intoxication in a public place. Referrals relating to the purchase, possession and consumption of alcohol increased by 121, an 18.3% increase. Referrals for serious assaults increased by 8% and there was one referral for murder during 2000.</P>
    <P>We, in this House, have a responsibility to tackle the root causes of crime. We need to consider the phrase from the old Labour Party manifesto, &ldquo;Tough on Crime. Tough on the Causes of Crime.&rdquo; Alcohol plays an important role in crime. Since drinking hours were extended the problem has worsened. We must face up to this. Super pubs are part of our culture, but people cannot be monitored in pubs because they are too full. The drinking culture is glorified. For example, when a visiting dignitary comes to Ireland the first thing we do is bring him or her to a pub, hand him or her a pint of Guinness, take a photograph, clap ourselves on the back and say, &ldquo;Aren't we great fellows?&rdquo; This drinking culture defines us a nation. The Tánaiste used a State aeroplane to travel to the opening of an off-licence. I do not know to which I object more &ndash; the use of State funds for such a trip or the glorification of the drink culture. It behoves the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to do something about this problem. Those responsible for giv<Col N="99" /> ing drink to minors or to people who are already intoxicated must be met head on.</P>
    <P>There is resentment among the public because there is a perception that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor. People from deprived areas are the ones who end up in our jails. Tax fraud, the crime of the rich, is one of the most serious crimes not listed in the Garda annual report. The Garda states it is not listed because the Revenue Commissioners deal with this area, but tax fraud is an immense problem. There is no doubt the feeling that the rich are getting away with robbery feeds into the general growing lawlessness in the State.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General published his annual report for the year 2000 in September 2001 in which he pointed out that there were 56 settlements between the Revenue and taxpayers of more than £100,000, but none of them was prosecuted. The report also referred to payments to the Revenue by 24 individuals who held 124 Ansbacher accounts, which totalled £4.64 million. The Tánaiste is still investigating these accounts. I hope the names of the account holders are published before the general election as they would make for very interesting reading. The average payment by the 24 individuals was £200,000 and none of them was prosecuted. Why not? The banks also engaged in massive tax fraud amounting to £200 million and, again, there were no prosecutions. Political parties have participated in pick-me-up schemes. The Comptroller and Auditor General reported settlements in 34 of the smaller pick-me-up cases at an average of £17,300.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised a great deal. He came on the scene as the Minister for zero tolerance, the Rudy Giuliani of Caherciveen, who was going to do to criminals what George Bush promised to do to the Taliban. He was going to do everything, but has done very little. He could take one simple action to make Dublin a safer place. He should put more gardaí on the beat because people are reassured when they see gardaí. Dubliners who have visited New York feel safer walking the streets there or taking a subway than walking along O'Connell Street. That is down to the Minister who has failed in his duties. This will become an election issue. People will see what the Minister promised and that he has delivered very little.</P>

    <P>&ndash;acknowledges that the strength of the Garda Síochána now exceeds 11,700, an all-time high, which represents an increase of approximately 900 gardaí since the Government took office, and is on target to reach the planned strength of 12,000 this year;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes the important steps that have been taken in relation to dealing effectively with crime and crime-related issues through the establishment of the State's first ever National Crime Council;</P>

    <P>&ndash;commends the Minister's legislative record since taking office in enacting an unprecedented 42 Bills and, particularly, his reform of the criminal law;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes the social crime prevention activities supported by this Government as an important intervention in the lives of &lsquo;at risk' young persons, not least the significant numerical expansion in Garda youth diversion projects, from 12 in 1997 to 64 at present;</P>
    <P>&ndash;welcomes the specific measures by this Government to deal with the problem of violence against women, including the establishment of a high-level, interdisciplinary, multi-agency steering committee chaired by a Minister of State;</P>
    <P>&ndash;welcomes the measures taken at community level to deal with local crime problems, including the expansion of the Garda CCTV programme, for which 15 million has been allocated over the period 2001 to 2003;</P>
    <P>&ndash;acknowledges the measures taken by the Garda Síochána to facilitate the reporting of crime, particularly among members of ethnic minorities, through its quality customer service initiative and the establishment of a Garda racial and intercultural office;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="101" />&ndash;notes that enhanced Garda enforcement of the law has brought about increased detection of offences;</P>
    <P>&ndash;acknowledges the improvements in recent years in the service to victims of crime, including the provision of additional funding to service providers;</P>
    <P>&ndash;recognises the long-term benefits which PULSE will contribute to the analysis of crime statistics;</P>
    <P>&ndash;recognises the provision of substantial additional resources to other areas of the criminal justice system to underpin the work of the Garda Síochána, including increasing the number of prison places by 1,207 to date, with approximately 700 additional closed places on the way;</P>
    <P>&ndash;acknowledges the significant structural reforms being made to the criminal justice system through, for example, the appointment of additional judges, the establishment of the Courts Service and the Prisons Service and the significant progress that is being made in reforming the administration of the Garda Síochána, particularly through the strategic management initiative;</P>
    <P>&ndash;acknowledges the successful operations undertaken by the Criminal Assets Bureau and the excellent results it has secured;</P>
    <P>&ndash;recognises the underpinning of the work of the Garda Síochána through the Government's unprecedented and comprehensive programme of criminal law reform;</P>
    <P>&ndash;welcomes the high level of support among the community for the Garda Síochána; and</P>
    <P>&ndash;approves the Government's continuing commitment to give priority to resourcing structural and legislative measures to build on the significant advances that have been made in the fight against crime and, in particular, to tackle effectively the problem of street violence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate as it provides an opportunity to address misinformation about crime which has gained currency since the recent publication of the Garda annual report for 2000. It also provides me with an opportunity to outline what has been done to tackle crime since I took office in 1997. More importantly, it affords an opportunity to state once again in no uncertain terms that now, as always, certain forms of offending are a source of concern. It is essential the House should have the opportunity of debating the negatives as well as the positives, that it should know not just about the Government's record of <Col N="102" /> achievement, but how it proposes to maintain that into the future.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the Opposition should have the opportunity of sharing with us how, in the unlikely event that it gets the opportunity of doing so in Government, it would deal with the forms of offending that give cause for concern and what it would do that would differ from the inertia which it displayed on crime when in office. That was a period during which crime levels were far worse than they are now, no matter what way one looks at it.</P>
    <P>The terms of the Opposition motion are disappointing. They contain not even the glimmer of one idea as to how to tackle crime. They record no appreciation of the efforts of those involved in the criminal justice system which have proved so effective in many ways in recent years. The motion does little more than replace the rainbow coalition's policy of complacency while in Government with one of complaint while in Opposition. That approach stands in stark contrast to the series of measures set out in my amendment to the motion and to this Government's determination to continue to ensure that adequate resources are made available to the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>We will continue our programme of increasing the number of gardaí to its highest level ever of 12,000. We will continue to ensure that the revolving prison door remains firmly shut. We will introduce tougher legislation to deal with crime, especially in the area of street violence. On past performance, it would be forlorn to hope that these policies will get much support from the Opposition parties, but I believe the vast majority of people recognise they are vitally necessary to combat crime.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the facts about crime and especially the misinformation which has been put about concerning the most recent Garda annual report. Deputies will be aware that the Garda Síochána changed the system of crime presentation as part of the PULSE information technology project. This change was not the result of ministerial or departmental intervention. What happened and the reasons for it are as follows.</P>
    <P>For many decades crime statistics were presented in two main tables titled &ldquo;indictable offences&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-indictable offences&rdquo;. However, this classification system and its sub-categorisations became increasingly inadequate in describing the complex, modern criminal activities reported or known to the Garda Síochána in recent years.</P>
    <P>For instance, the previous decade witnessed an unprecedented amount of change in criminal law, with new criminal offences being created by approximately 40 statutes in the 1990s. These legislative developments presented a significant challenge to the Garda Síochána in the presentation of its crime statistics. The computer system <Col N="103" /> in use prior to the introduction of PULSE was capable of counting all these new and modified offences but lacked the flexibility required to show them as separate entities in the crime statistics. For example, a separate heading for stalking or harassment offences could not be shown in Garda annual reports prior to 2000. Rather, they had to be shown as other indictable offences.</P>
    <P>The introduction of PULSE provided a considerable improvement in this respect, and the new classification of &ldquo;headline offences&rdquo; contains ten sub-divisions which offer a comprehensive description of modern criminal activity in a much more user-friendly and amenable style and form. Rather than viewing this development in negative terms, the opposite is the case. The introduction of the new classification of headline offences is progressive, not regressive, and is the first step on the road to greater transparency in the preparation and presentation of crime statistics.</P>
    <P>It is important to underline that the long-standing crime counting rules have remained unchanged throughout the process of transition to the new PULSE platform. These rules are long established in Ireland and many European countries. When we speak of changes in the compilation of crime statistics in 2000, we refer primarily to the manner of presentation of data and not to willed changes in recording practice.</P>
    <P>It is important that it be understood that exact and exacting comparisons between the crime figures as published in the annual report for 2000 and previous years are not possible. Although precise comparisons are not possible, it would be a further misrepresentation of the facts for me to pretend that broad comparisons are invalid. The 2000 report states that &ldquo;crime categorised as headline crime . . . reflects to a major degree what, in the past, was defined as indictable crime&rdquo;. Despite the misinformation that has been put about, the report for 2000 shows a further significant reduction in serious crime.</P>

      <P>Much has been made, for example, of the exclusion of criminal damage offences from the headline offence category. Such offences would have been included before this as indictable crime, but the conclusions that have been drawn about the fact that they are now in the non-headline category are very wide of the mark.</P>
      <P>My advice from the Garda authorities is that, prior to the availability of the PULSE system, a significant percentage of criminal damage offences did not feature in the statistics. Had they been included, they would have been categorised as non-indictable. The argument, therefore, that 10,000 offences, a proportion of which would be criminal damage, have been moved from the headline to the non-headline offence category does not stand up to scrutiny.</P>

I am saying now, as I have acknowledged in the past, that the incidence of assault and general violence among young people, especially young men, at and about places of entertainment, at food outlets and so on late at night is a matter of concern to all of us as citizens and to those of us as parents whose children, like all young people, go out at night</P>

      <P>Hotspots receive particular Garda attention, with an emphasis on high-visibility patrolling. Special resource units and unmarked crime task force units are also utilised to the full. Moreover, key urban locations have been selected for intensive patrolling involving the Garda mounted unit, Garda dog unit and Garda air support unit. The Garda authorities consider Operation Oíche to have been highly successful to date. Since its introduction, there has been a more visible Garda presence on the streets, particularly at closing times of licensed premises and night clubs.</P>
      <P>A further significant measure against violent street crime is Garda CCTV. To date, CCTV systems have been installed in Dublin North Central, that is O'Connell Street and its surrounding areas; Dublin South Central, that is Grafton Street and its surrounding areas; and Tralee, County Kerry. A Garda CCTV system is currently nearing completion in Cork city and I understand that most of the cameras in the system are now fully operational. In late 2000, I announced that the number of Garda CCTV systems was to be further expanded, and I have allocated more than 15 million for expenditure in this area for the period 2001 to 2003. Garda town centre CCTV systems are planned for Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Clondalkin, Tallaght, Galway, Limerick, Athlone and Waterford. Moreover, the installation of systems in at least a further six areas will be announced in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, however, conscious that some applications for CCTV systems which have been received relate to relatively small schemes that, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided to such schemes. To this <Col N="108" /> end, I plan to introduce a grant scheme shortly to cater for those communities which would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. There is no doubt &ndash; I am not saying that this constitutes anything like a total explanation for the increased incidence of assaults &ndash; that the increased presence of gardaí on the streets at night to deal with this form of offending, has resulted in cases being recorded which heretofore simply would not have appeared in any statistics.</P>

I repeat I am not saying that this constitutes anything like a total explanation for the increase in the figures, but I am advised by the Garda authorities that it is a significant factor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide the Garda Síochána with additional powers to tackle anti-social behaviour. It will target, in particular, drunk and unruly elements who congregate late at night outside or in the vicinity of licensed and other premises such as fast food outlets and who by their aggressive and intimidating behaviour threaten the peace and well-being of decent citizens and are a danger to others and themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rape and sexual assaults are matters of serious concern. Sexual assault is a form of offending on which interventions other than purely law and order-type interventions have a vital role to play. <Col N="109" /> The role of educators, in particular, is obviously crucial. It is also a form of offending which, of its nature, is opportunistic and which usually occurs in places and in circumstances where it would be unrealistic to expect a law enforcement presence. The penalties for sexual offences are severe, but I will be interested to hear what Deputies have to say on this subject because if there are law enforcement measures which they wish to propose to address this very worrying phenomenon, I will certainly be glad to give them serious and urgent consideration.</P>
    <P>Returning to the motion, it is unfortunate and very unwise that the Opposition has chosen to condemn the Government for its record on crime while in office. No matter what way one looks at it, the situation has improved out of all proportion to what we found when the Government came to office.</P>

      <P>The Garda Síochána Vote for the year 2002 is 918 million &ndash; £723 million &ndash; which represents an increase of more than <Col N="110" /> 50% on 1997 levels. Continued investment is being made to equip the Garda organisation with the most up-to-date technologies, from major IT investments such as PULSE to a high-speed patrol boat and a second helicopter.</P>
      <P>I have introduced more legislation than any of my predecessors. The 42 Bills which I have enacted cover such areas as juvenile justice, child protection, fraud, organised crime and human trafficking. I have also successfully tackled the so-called revolving door syndrome in the prison system, which did so much to bring the entire criminal justice system into disrepute. The prisons building programme has delivered 1,207 new prison places and the Government has approved another 700 additional places. As a result, the number of prisoners on temporary release fell from more than 500 in 1997 to 150 in October 2001.</P>
      <P>I know that there are some of you who have expressed unease about, and even outright opposition to the increase in prison places, but whatever may be said about the harshness of this as an approach to tackling what was a very bad crime problem, there is no doubt that it has had a significant bearing on the drop in crime in recent years. To demonstrate this point, I draw the attention of the House to the incidence of burglary in this jurisdiction. In the year 2000 the Garda Síochána recorded a 6.3% decrease in burglaries, the sixth consecutive year of decreases, bringing the cumulative fall since 1994 to 34.1% and since 1996 to 27.4%.</P>

      <P>By any standard, this is a remarkable achievement which did not occur by chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to a research study commissioned by my Department to develop an econometric model of recorded levels of burglary, it was found that the incidence of this form of crime decreased according to criminal justice variables, namely, the Garda detection rate and the daily average number of people in prison. Specifically, every 1% increase in the Garda detection rate decreased burglary levels by 2.3%. Every 1% increase in the daily average number in prison decreased burglary levels by 0.4%. The findings of this research report are proof positive that my policies of increasing garda numbers to 12,000 and dramatically augmenting the number of prison places are having a demonstrable impact for the good on levels of burglary. It repudiates the complacent notion that crime just happens and puts the lie to the suggestion that the criminal justice system simply &ldquo;locks the stable door after the horse has bolted.&rdquo; The system works provided it receives the necessary injection of <Col N="111" /> resources, as has happened over the lifetime of the Government.</P>
    <P>It would, however, make no sense to pretend that solutions to the crime problem in the future lie exclusively in the building of more and more prisons. We need to work on other approaches also, such as increased custody alternatives. There are currently approximately 4,800 individuals subject to the various types of community sanctions under the supervision of the probation and welfare service. Since 1998 I have approved funding for 25 additional projects under the guidance of the service. There are now 65 such projects in operation throughout the country, all of which are community based dealing with areas such as drugs aftercare, alcohol treatment for offenders before the courts, youth service projects, community reparation and victim-offender mediation. Further such projects will continue to be developed in co-operation with the probation and welfare service under the national development plan.</P>
    <P>The budget for the probation and welfare service is 38 million in 2002, which is more than a 100% increase in funding during my term in office. Thanks, in part again, to the national development plan, I have also overseen a massive increase in the number of Garda youth diversion projects from 12 in 1997 to 64 at present, with a corresponding increase in the total financial allocation of more than 1,000%. These projects, which complement changes to the Garda juvenile liaison scheme arising from the Children Act, 2001, are a vital preventive strategy in helping young people at risk to avoid becoming involved, or further involved, in a criminal lifestyle. However, no matter what one does about custody alternatives, there is no doubt that there are certain forms of offending where, regrettably, it is essential to resort to tougher law and order measures. There is no better example of this than the way in which the problem of organised crime has been tackled during my term in office.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau continues to be successful in targeting the proceeds of profits of crime.</P>

      <P>It has successfully conducted investigations resulting in the confiscation of illegally obtained assets and wealth held both inside and outside this jurisdiction. It pursues a multi-agency approach to achieve its objectives, which has enabled it to make effective use of information gathered from the different agencies. Since its statutory inception in 1996 and up to the end of 2000 it has obtained provisional and final freezing orders on property to the value of more than 10 million and 9 million, respectively. During the same period it has collected almost 13 million in taxes, with social welfare savings amounting to approximately 2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="112" /> We have come a long way in the past five years in tackling the problem of crime. Our record of achievement shows that we have the determination and imagination to continue this battle. Common sense suggests that this society, in common with all other western societies, will continue to face the problem of crime, that new varieties will emerge and that some of them, including the threat of internationally organised crime, will continue to pose a major challenge.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of serious crime, it is a matter of particular satisfaction that during the term of office of the Government, in particular, the form of offending which gave rise for greatest concern to successive Governments over many years, that is, subversive crime, has at last been brought under much greater control. The Good Friday Agreement of 1998 has provided the basis upon which lasting peace can be achieved on this island. One of its key objectives is the decommissioning by all paramilitary groups of their arms. The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning has played a vital role in taking this process forward, as part of which we have recently seen an act of decommissioning by the IRA. Of course, there are those who reject the peace process and continue to seek to impose their will through violence. The House can be assured that the Garda Síochána will continue to do all in its power to make those concerned accountable before the law. The Garda authorities have achieved considerable success in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have set out the facts about crime. However, it is hardly surprising the Opposition parties simply do not want to accept them. What instead do they have to offer the people? As their motion contains no ideas on how to deal with crime&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="113" /> Given this legacy, I can be forgiven for not being optimistic that the rainbow, even with the added benefit of another shade of green, would do much better in the unlikely event that they get the chance. The people who, when in government, presided over the greatest series of consecutive fiascos ever to affect the criminal justice system have not gone away because the &ldquo;can't do anything, won't do anything&rdquo; brigade are still here, as are the facts. In the past five years the &ldquo;can't do anything, won't do anything&rdquo; brigade have relentlessly opposed virtually every criminal justice measure introduced by the Government. Spurred on by inept leadership, they have run with every confused hare and hunted with every populist hound in the mistaken belief that the people have forgotten their monumental ineptitude.</P>
    <P>Tonight I challenge the Opposition spokespersons and those behind them who have moved from the wings and are ready to stand in their shoes once the now inevitable leadership resignations are received later this year to point to any period in Irish history when a Minister from either of their parties could point to the record of achievement to which I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, can point on behalf of the Government.</P>

      <P>There is no deep mystery why the motion tonight contains no proposals for tackling crime. It is an open secret that when in government the rainbow parties simply could not agree on how to tackle it and ended up doing nothing. I suppose a pantomime horse has its uses, but it would be a great help if the people inside it could agree on the direction they want to go.</P>
      <P>Contrast this abysmal record with the record of the Government. We have overseen an historic decrease in serious crime, increased the Garda force to its highest level ever, put an end to the prison revolving door by providing the highest number of prison places in our history, introduced modern and effective laws to combat crime and undertaken a huge investment in the criminal justice system. Those are the objective facts to which the Opposition simply does not want to face up. Its Front Bench resembles a motley gathering of aspiring amnesiacs who have assembled to condemn the fact that what they said could not be done has, in fact, been done. I have no difficulty with the Opposition gloating at the inaccuracy of its own predictions. I have no difficulty with its anger at the achievement by the Government of the greatest ever drop in crime achieved by any Government, but spare the pretence that it has any alternative policy. For five years it has opposed us tooth and nail. It was destructive opposition, always knocking, never building.</P>

      <P>Bereft of suggestions, the Opposition aimlessly opposed. It is time for facts to be faced. In so far as crime is concerned, the Opposition and its administration were part of the problem; they played no part in any solution. If the Government followed its advice, had done as it asked and did, we would still have more than 20% of sentenced prisoners permanently at liberty, courtesy of its open door policy. That was unacceptable. The public has a right to expect that sentenced prisoners will remain sentenced. It was politically unacceptable to us, but not the Opposition. It allowed those sentenced prisoners their liberty and refused to make the necessary investment in prison places. One simple fact is blindingly clear. If the Government did as the Opposition asked and did, the crime rate would not have fallen. The policies it has espoused are, in reality, policies for higher crime rates.</P>

      <P>I recognise and commend the work of the Garda Síochána on the northside of Dublin, especially in the J and R districts of the Dublin metropolitan region. Many dedicated gardaí are trying to keep crime levels at bay with insufficient support from the Minister. I launched an initiative whereby senior Garda superintendents in Santry, Coolock and Raheny were invited to meet the Dublin north central committee of Dublin City Council. They did so last week in Darndale village centre. This meeting marked the beginning of what, I hope, will be a series of bi-annual meetings along the lines on which English local authorities operate. My colleague, Deputy Howlin, has proposed that we should operate a similar system here from now on. In that way senior members of the Garda Síochána and local politicians would meet regularly to examine and discuss what is happening in particular areas. This initiative has to be linked to a local policing plan. The Minister asked for suggestions and this is one. He has literally a few days left in Government, yet there has been no legislation to introduce such an important and useful initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> The motion before the House rightly identifies the Minister's failure over the past five years. The Garda Síochána's 2000 report on crime statistics contains a sad litany with the key indicators of crime deteriorating further during the Minister's term of office. The report contains a farcical division between headline and non-headline crime. That is grotesque and deeply insulting to the victims of so-called non-headline crimes, many of which go unreported. The report cannot ignore the fact that in 2000 there was more than one homicide case per week, under the Minister's administration. The pattern continued in 2001 when there was one homicide every five days. In the first 29 days of 2002, we have seen seven appalling homicides, of which three were on the northside of Dublin, including one brutal, racist murder in the Beaumont area. These appalling homicide figures reflect an increasingly violent society. They are at the top end of a litany of street violence that continues under the Minister's administration. He has not given the Garda sufficient resources to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>On four occasions I have asked the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, to get the Central Statistics Office to oversee Garda statistics, as the CSO does for all other key indicators. I do not know why this was not done, however.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of my saddest memories of this Dáil was when the Taoiseach and the Minister voted down my Bill to deal with joyriding. I was amazed because, despite widespread support for the measure from terrorised communities across north and west Dublin and other urban areas, and from the Garda Síochána, the Minister refused to take action. Is it any wonder that one night over the Christmas period, gardaí on the northside had to cope with no less than 12 vehicle thefts in one Garda district?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The harassment and intimidation of householders and pedestrians by young gangs is a serious problem that is plaguing estates, yet it has grown worse under the Minister's administration. They hang around streets at all hours of the night, especially after the pubs and discos close. Very often their base of operation is beside the house of a vulnerable person, perhaps a senior citizen, a parent rearing a family on their own, a person with a disability or a person of a different ethnic origin. Such families are often tormented nightly until they have to move. The Garda and local authorities try their best but are hopelessly hindered on three fronts. First, Garda strength in urban areas is far too low. There are only 4,000 gardaí in the greater Dublin area &ndash; that is one third of the Garda Síochána dealing with nearly 70% of crime. Gardaí themselves have said that while the Minister has introduced more specialist bodies, there are not enough gardaí on the beat. They have all been moved away from daily work <Col N="116" /> in the community. We need the specialist bodies but we also need extra gardaí on the beat, although the Minister has not delivered that. Last year, half the Garda strength in my constituency was sent northwards to deal with the foot and mouth crisis, so we had less gardaí on the ground.</P>
    <P>Second, there has been a lack of legislation. The Minister talked about all his Bills. To be fair to him, when in Opposition Deputy O'Donoghue did introduce Bills, as I have tried to do. There is a glaring need for anti-intimidation and anti-harrassment legislation to make the streets safer, but the Minister has not even considered this. Under the 1994 legislation, gardaí can ask people to move on but they cannot take significant action against the perpetrators who are hanging around the streets.</P>
    <P>Third, the Labour Party has always been tough on crime and the causes of crime. Everything the Minister has done, however, has been belated, slow and lethargic. I am referring particularly to the youth diversion scheme in relation to joyriding. After two long years of promises, just one social worker was appointed recently in my own district. I am disappointed with the Minister. Given his performance in Opposition in the previous DáiI, I expected him to be a dynamic Minister who would take a firm grip on crime if he meant what he said about zero tolerance. Five years later, however, I am sadly disappointed because the Minister has not delivered.</P>

      <P>One of the most infamous mantras that Fianna Fáil adopted in 1997 was that of &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo;. Everybody on this side of the House is well aware that when the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, was in Opposition he preached and pontificated about it up to the election. After five years in office, however, the Minister's promise of zero tolerance of crime has been exposed as a lie, a sound bite, and another one of the empty promises that epitomises Fianna Fáil's attitude to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very definition of zero tolerance implies no acceptance of any crime. It starts with the elimination of the most minor crimes and thereby roots out the ethos of crime in society. The people in my home town are very concerned about the increase in public order offences over the past year. It saddens me to have to cite examples of this occurring in Killarney, the most beautiful town in the country. If any Member of the House was to walk around the streets of Kil<Col N="117" /> larney between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. on a Saturday or Sunday morning they would soon see that zero tolerance has not been implemented even in the Minister's own backyard of south Kerry. The scene is one of hundreds of people walking the streets intoxicated, loud and often violent.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a notable increase in disorder, assaults and other public order offences in the town and other towns in the constituency. In my opinion, the reason for this is the extension of the pub opening hours. By extending the licensing hours, against the wishes of many licensed vintners, the Minister has increased late-night crime and public disorder. Licensing hours as they now stand will have to be reviewed. Many of those who lobbied for later opening hours did not envisage it would involve the later opening of nightclubs as well and therein lies the problem. It is one thing to have people spilling onto the streets from pubs at 1 o'clock in the morning, but these numbers swell considerably when the nightclubs empty between 2.30 a.m. and 4 a.m. Many of my constituents are suffering greatly due to late night noise and disorder in the streets. I suggest to the Minister, as my constituency colleague, to make a start on implementing the policy of zero tolerance by addressing the problems of violence and disorder in Killarney at weekends. The gardaí are doing their best, but they cannot do much with the resources they have. We cannot hide our heads in the sand any longer. It is difficult for anyone to admit there is serious public disorder in their home town, particularly if it depends on tourism. Unless the matter is tackled now, it will get worse. We have had enough filibuster, waffle and preaching. We want action. Otherwise, the Minister will not be known as the Minister for zero tolerance, but the Minister for zero action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone knows the crime figures started to decrease in 1995 before the Minister came into office. It is important to realise that Fianna Fáil has been in office for 11 of the past 13 years. The Central Statistics Office figures show that one in eight households is affected by crime. Does the Minister admit that if his policy of zero tolerance was working, there should be a huge increase in summary offences? His emphasis on zero tolerance during the last election campaign meant that crime became part of the modern consciousness. If people are not victims of crime, they are fearful of it because the Minister hyped it up at a time when it was decreasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is to have any credibility, he must publish the 2001 figures within the next few weeks. The Minister mentioned the concept of adjustment. The Garda is using the PULSE system, so I do not know what adjustment needs to be done. I am trying to be reasonable about this issue. I like the Minister who is not a bad man, but having listened to him tonight I realise there is a place for him in the street theatre in Killarney between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. next summer when he gives up his job. He was under pressure tonight <Col N="118" /> because he knows what he is saying is not 100% accurate.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Forum issued a report a couple of days ago. Its main findings are that the majority of prisoners are male, young and from the most deprived backgrounds and that they lack basic educational and employment skills. The weekly operational costs amount to 1,250 per prisoner, while a community or service supervision order costs between 50 and 75. Despite that, the consensus view of the experts that non-custodial options are more effective than prisons, and the decrease in crime in recent years, our imprisonment rate is increasing and is now treble that of England and Wales and quadruple that of the Scandinavian countries. Our prisoners have one of the highest re-offending rates in Europe. The Minister has made a virtue of increasing the number of prison spaces, but little research has been carried out on it. A man called Tarling in England did some research on it and the results showed that the 32% increase in prison population here between 1997 and 1999 only resulted in a reduction of approximately 1.2% in the crime rate. The Minister should have taken that report on board, but he failed miserably to do that.</P>
    <P>One in seven male offenders are sexual offenders. They have the most basic educational and employment skills. The Minister has often said that the Opposition does not have any suggestions, but in the few years I have been here I have continuously emphasised to the Minister, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Education and Science the lack of basic education. Many such people suffer from dyslexia. I told the Minister about research which was carried out in England and the United States and I asked him to get his Department to consider it. Research carried out in a juvenile delinquency centre in Scotland showed that 50% of offenders suffered from dyslexia compared to 48% of the normal community. These people are hitting back at society.</P>
    <P>The situation on sex offenders indicates to me that the Minister is not able to handle the job because he does not know how to approach it. There are sex offenders in the Curragh. What will happen to them when they are released? I know some of them have had one or two sessions on a particular programme before opting out. When they are released, they go back on the streets. We have done nothing for them. The Minister said in his speech that the role of educators is crucial. He also said if there are any law enforcement measures which Deputies wish to propose to address this worrying phenomenon, he would be glad to give them serious and urgent consideration. The public do not want jackboot tactics. They want integration and people to be given educational opportunities. They do not want a quick fix solution of zero tolerance. The Minister has over-emphasised law enforcement. I ask him to re-examine his approach to this issue.</P>

      <P>During the time Deputy Owen was Minister for Justice both the Minister and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, castigated her on a daily basis on different issues. They did not take into account that they were in office for seven years prior to the two and a half years Fine Gael spent in office. The Minister should analyse the figures. I listened to chief superintendent Kelly who appeared before Limerick County Council last Monday and gave a factual analysis of crime in Ireland. He responded honestly to our questions. If the Minister reviews the PULSE figures for 2001, he will find an increase in the level of crime. There has been a 131% increase in the number of violent assaults, but that will probably increase further. Surely the statistics prove to criminals that crime pays. Some 78 million worth of property was stolen in 2000, but there was only a 5.5% recovery rate. It was lower than in 1999 when there was almost a 10% recovery rate.</P>

    <P>I am concerned about the number of firearms which are stolen. I learned that a large number of firearms were stolen in County Limerick which made their way to the criminal gangs in Limerick city. I admit that an attempt was made here to introduce legislation for the use of wall safes, but the High Court found it was unconstitutional. I know that householders leave firearms lying around, but are we lax in issuing firearms licences? We have an acute problem in Limerick city. I compliment the Garda on their recent success in the Pyper case. I compliment the Garda <Col N="120" /> in Newcastle West on finding two elderly people who could have lost their lives when they were locked up.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is knocking on doors, like the rest of us. He knows there was a great deal of waffle in that document. We did not get the second script, which was added later on. I do not know who is preparing that information for the Minister, but much of it is not relevant to what is happening now. The Minister should reveal the figures for 2001 instead of hiding them and he should give valid comparisons. He introduced a computer system to simplify the process. The reply was given that it took 12 months longer to issue the report because the PULSE system was being introduced. The PULSE system is in operation. The Minister should reveal the figures. Is he afraid that the Minister for zero tolerance will be known as the Minister for zero intolerance?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this item tonight and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, who will take the debate. It is, however, regrettable that the Minster for Education and Science has failed <Col N="121" /> almost during all the lifetime of this Dáil to come here and stand his ground to explain why he has failed so miserably to deliver on this important aspect of education. He has not come in to take one of these items and one can only assume that, in this instance, because he has stifled any attempt to make provision for Cahergal national school, he is unable to come here to justify his actions.</P>
      <P>There are more than 840 schools seeking extensions and replacement and the Government is dealing with 80 per annum, which means it will never catch up. It has failed &ndash; equality does not exist in the Minister's mind as far as education is concerned. Why are the pupils in this overcrowded school denied equal opportunity with children in other areas? It is because the Minister is in a hold-all situation. He has stifled education and progress and is on a holding mission because the Minister for Finance will not give him the funds to allow projects like Cahergal national school to go ahead.</P>
      <P>For five years architectural surveys have been carried out on the school and reports produced. The proposal changed from an extension to a new school and then to a change of site for the school, all delaying tactics. The parents, board of management, staff and children have had enough. They are demoralised because of the Minister's inaction. Throughout the 1990s enrolment at this rural school, against all the trends, has increased from 70 to 102 pupils. There are three classrooms and a 20 year old prefab which would have fallen to bits had the caretaker not patched it together at weekends. If that is what the Minister of State calls delivering an education service, he and the Minister have failed.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will not accept responsibility for that, but I do not want him tonight to read off jargon and clichés assembled by civil servants who have no concern for those at this school in Tuam, County Galway. I want to hear the Minister stating that the people who have given a lifetime of commitment to this school and have raised funding to keep it going will have a date on which to start building the new school. That is what will satisfy them.</P>
      <P>There is no point in trying to make phone calls. All communications with the Department of Education and Science have failed. The chairman of the school's board of management has said that since last April he has endeavoured by writing, phoning and every other possible method to contact the planning unit in Tullamore but only gets answering machines or excuses. The Minister has failed. These people are entitled to equality.</P>
      <P>The school has had to use the cloakrooms for educational activities. The resource teacher operates from a room 1.4 metres square which is also used to store IT equipment sent by the Department, which is still in its boxes. The Minister ought not to give us rhetoric but a decision to allow this school to proceed in the current year.</P>

      <P>I want to raise the issue of Gaelscoil Charman in Wexford town and I do not <Col N="123" /> want the same answer we heard in relation to Cahergal, with the names changed &ndash; one answer suits all.</P>
      <P>The gaelscoil movement has enlivened communities across the country. Good people rallied to build schools with an ethos that is unique and attracted high calibre teachers to educate their children. In Wexford town, 225 pupils are involved in the gaelscoil, but unfortunately they use a totally inadequate and dangerous premises. One class is behind a stage and another is up a long flight of concrete steps. They have to stop teaching when it rains because the sound of the rain on the roof is deafening. They have no basic facilities for art or washing and basic toilets are shared by pupils and teachers alike. There are no sports facilities and there are totally inadequate recreation and play areas.</P>
      <P>I tabled a parliamentary question today and I heard the usual litany in reply. The Minister said that &ldquo;the project will continue through preparation of tender documents and an invitation to tender as soon as it is possible to do so under the expanded building programme&rdquo;. What does that mean? I do not want to hear a repeat of that tonight.</P>
      <P>I want to put the situation plain and simple to the Minister of State. These good people were promised faithfully last year that they would be included in the capital programme for 2002. They have full planning permission, have acquired the site, which is ready, and all they now need is approval to go to tender. They were promised that but the promise has now turned to dust. I am being deliberately political when I say this: if the Fianna Fáil Party has any interest in maintaining votes in County Wexford it better reverse its position on this and the Minister better be here tonight to give a firm commitment to the people of Wexford and the pupils and parents, who worked so hard and were so patient, that their school will now go to tender.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall pass on Deputy Howlin's comments to the Fianna Fáil Party in Wexford.</P>
      <P>At present, Scoil Charman has a principal, eight mainstream class teachers and a shared remedial teacher. The enrolment at 30 September 2001 was 221 pupils. The school is currently renting accommodation which is 95% funded by our Department. Our Department has recently purchased a site for a new school at a cost of 596,770. This is a clear indication of its commitment to proceeding with a permanent building. The major building project for Scoil Charman will proceed to preparation of tender documents and invitation of tenders as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding progress on the major building project, our Department has advised the board of management that it is prepared to put temporary accommodation on site as an interim measure, if for any reason the school has to <Col N="124" /> vacate the premises it selected when granted permanent recognition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The tragic death of an 18 year-old woman, in the first and last year of her adult life, a mother already of two young children, demands a much deeper and more effective response than a couple of days in the media headlines. While I welcome the announcement this evening that the Eastern Regional Health Authority has asked Mr. Justice Frederick Morris to carry out a case management review, it must not be accepted as an adequate response before moving on to other business. The substance of Justice Morris's findings, allowing for confidentiality, must be made public. The statement from the regional health authority does not make it clear whether the findings will be made public. Will the Minister clarify that? If this woman's life means anything, we must learn from her death and prevent the deaths of others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must not scapegoat the hard-pressed front-line staff of the Northern Area Health Board who are working under severe pressure due to shortages of personnel and resources and an increasing number of very troubled, frequently addicted, young people. These young people, our fellow citizens in the brave new world of the Celtic tiger, and the health professionals who are striving to make a difference to their lives, must be given the <Col N="125" /> priority that Justice Peter Kelly so single-mindedly demands for them. They need social workers, secure places to live with supportive care, addiction treatment, protection from exploitation and psychological and/or psychiatric care. These are services which our developed, rich economy does not, to our shame, provide. Kieran McGrath, editor of <i>The Irish Social Worker,</i> wrote two weeks ago that &ldquo;literally thousands of cases of suspected child abuse are unlocated&rdquo;. Have we learned anything from the revelations of abuse perpetrated on a previous generation of children? Will we look back on this time too and wish we had looked closer?</P>
    <P>I press the Minister to realise the urgency of appointing more social workers to this area. It has been pointed out repeatedly that there is an acute shortage of social workers to deal with these very vulnerable young people. These young people's needs are urgent and immediate: the response from Government is the opposite. The Ombudsman for children Bill has still not been published and therefore has little or no chance of being enacted before this Government goes out of office after five years. A children's Ombudsman could be the catalyst for action that is so lacking. His or her office would inevitably show up what is happening in the cold world of &lsquo;at risk' children.</P>
    <P>The woman who died was legally an adult, but she reportedly had the mind of a child. I ask the Minister to address the particular needs of those whose chronological age might suggest a lesser need for protection but who, clearly, cannot cope with adult responsibility. This could be addressed in the Disabilities Bill, which will be debated shortly.</P>
    <P>This woman's short life is over. I did not know her and it is unlikely that many people with the power to change things did. We have the power to change things for others like her and it is urgent that we do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The tragic death of this 18 year-old again exposes the abject failure of the Government with regard to children. The Government has seriously failed children. It has paid lip-service and given false promises. The acid test of the Government's commitment was its firm promise early last year to pass a Bill establishing the office of a children's Ombudsman by the end of the year. This developed into promising a Bill would be published by Christmas. On six different occasions during the last Dáil session the Taoiseach emphatically promised that this would happen, but he shamelessly misled the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for children made the establishment of an Ombudsman the centrepiece of her speeches. Her commitment to children has been exposed as phoney. After five years of this Government Justice Peter Kelly has been forced to abandon any idea that either the social or judicious services are remotely capable of dealing with the demands placed on them. The Minister presides over, in the words <Col N="126" /> of Pádraig Ó Móráin in today's <i>The Irish Times,</i>&ldquo;Dublin's ramshackle child protection service&rdquo;. The most recent victim is an 18 year-old with the mind of a child. She was dead for several days before she was discovered. Two years ago a psychiatrist described the service she had been receiving as disastrous. At 16 years of age she was placed in a bed-and-breakfast which she had to leave every morning to wander the streets aimlessly. An office of Ombudsman for children would surely have a damning report on the State's treatment of this child. What would an Ombudsman say of a 14 year-old child whose grandfather yesterday begged for him to be taken into care because he was a danger to himself and others? The Taoiseach and the Minister with responsibility for children do not want an office of Ombudsman exposing their abject, cruel failure and they have not the guts to say so. They lack basic human decency in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies O'Sullivan and Neville for raising this matter and for affording me the opportunity to comment on the sad death of this young woman. This is a very tragic case. It is a difficult time for the family and friends of the young woman concerned and for the staff of the health board who worked closely with her. I offer them my sincere sympathy.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Northern Area Health Board that the 18 year-old woman concerned was in a voluntary transition programme being provided by the health board. As she was over 18, she was not in the formal care of the health board at the time of her death and was free to come and go as she wished. She left the house in which she was living and when she failed to return, the Garda were notified to try and re-establish contact with her. Unfortunately she was subsequently found dead.</P>
      <P>I have also been informed that the young woman was previously in the care of the area health board concerned and a wide range of services were made available to address her needs.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, Mr. Donal O'Shea, chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, has today announced that the former President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Frederick Morris, has agreed to carry out a case management review of the care and services provided to this young woman. The review will also cover all the circumstances leading to her death. The review will be carried out in collaboration with the Northern Area Health Board and whatever assistance is required by Mr. Justice Morris will be made available to him. I welcome the appointment of Mr. Justice Morris to undertake this case management review. We should now await his findings and I am committed to implementing his recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the teenage boy referred to by Deputy Neville, I have been informed that while it would not be appropriate to go into the detail of an individual case the young person concerned <Col N="127" /> has been placed in a secure facility by order of the High Court.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to assure the House of this Government's commitment to the child welfare and protection services since entering office. An additional 171.45 million (£135 million) revenue has been invested since 1997 in the continued development of child welfare, protection and family support services. Of this, 63 million (£50 million) has been invested in the ERHA area.</P>
    <P>The number of high support and special care places has increased from 17 in 1997 to a current total of 93 which includes the 24-place special care unit at Ballydowd which is being opened on a phased basis. Plans are under way to develop an additional 41 places. These places are due to become available by mid-2002.</P>
    <P>This Government established the Social Services Inspectorate in 1999 to provide an independent inspectorate for the social services. In its first three years it is concentrating on child care and in particular residential child care services. To date 44 inspections have been carried out throughout the country on residential children's centres operated by the health boards. The Department of Health and Children in co-operation with the health boards and the SSI have developed national standards for children's residential centres as well as standards for special care units.</P>
    <P>The report of the working group on foster care was published last year. It addresses the range of problems currently being experienced by those involved in foster care and makes recommendations to further the development of services for foster children and their carers. There have been increases in the payments being made to foster carers. Payments last year were between £70 and £80 per child per week. It is now £220 to £230 per child per week. I am very anxious to promote not only family support but the support of foster carers.</P>
    <P>The Children Act, 2001, was passed by the Oireachtas last year. The National Children's Office has established a high-level cross-cutting group made up of representatives of the relevant Departments and agencies to devise a programme for the implementation of the Act. The Department of Health and Children is currently drawing up the necessary regulations to allow for the implementation of Parts 2, 3 and 11. The Special Residential Services Board which has important functions under the Children Act has been established. The National Children's Strategy was launched in November 2000. It is a ten-year plan to ensure that the needs of children can be addressed in a co-ordinated manner and the structures have already been put in place to ensure that this happens. The Youth Homelessness Strategy was launched towards the end of last year. It provides for a strategic and planned approach to address youth homelessness.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="128" /> The Government remains committed to ensuring that all staff in residential centres without formal qualification are facilitated to become professionally qualified. Significant pay increases have been awarded to child care workers in the health sector and the new pay arrangements which have been introduced recognise the importance of staff having professional child care qualifications. Developments are also taking place at national and regional level to improve the retention and recruitment of social work staff. There have never been more social workers either being trained or in the system.</P>
    <P>The Springboard initiative established family support projects in each health board area throughout the country, targeting children in the seven to 12 year age group who are at risk of getting into trouble and going into care. We know this is an effective intervention.</P>
    <P>After many years of neglect of children this Government is fully committed to children and to improving children's rights. In this context the Ombudsman for Children Bill has been circulated to Departments with a view to submission to Government next week.</P>

      <P>Tá mé buíochach den Cheann Chomhairle as cead a thabhairt dom an cheist seo a ardú agus cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. Tá súil agam go mbeidh sí ag caint leis an Aire féin mar gheall air seo. I refer the Minister to a unique situation in north county Dublin where an ESB plan for 110 kv line is needed between Swords and Balbriggan. The route follows the new M1 motorway reservation. Leaving aside the reports that indicate evidence of strong magnetic fields causing cancer, the issue here is really one of adopting the precautionary principle &ldquo;where it is possible&rdquo;. If ever it was possible, it is possible in this situation. Already 10% of the line is to be underground at Glassmore on the southern end and the case is very strong for the same to be done at the northern Balbriggan end, from the motorway to the town. The route is already 16 kilometres with 77 pylons proposed. In that regard it is important to look at the Australian experience of such a project where road reservations are seen as service reservations and they include not just roads but also rail and accessible pipes and cabling. Service roads separate maintenance crews from other road users. Given that cyclists and pedestrians or horses are prohibited on motorways, a service road could be a very valuable multi-use investment which could help tourism and provide safe routes for commuters such as cyclists. The Roads Act, 1993, is a large document. It gives total discretion to the National Roads Authority with regard to co-operation <Col N="129" /> with the ESB or other agencies including the local authority on this matter. In the case of Dublin north, Fingal County Council, the local authority, has passed a resolution to seek ducting and undergrounding of this unique roadside 110 kv line. The case is very strong. There are many homes and farms along the line. There is also the problem of the visual intrusion of this line along the main road. Most people are also worried about the electromagnetic pollution that high voltage lines are suspected of causing.</P>
      <P>The issue should be examined and the undergrounding done as soon as possible on this optimum stretch, especially in areas of high density housing or planned housing. There is a great deal of housing planned for north county Dublin. The Minister should make an order or amend the 1993 Roads Act to ensure co-operation between agencies. This change is needed anyway as I know that the ESB and the NRA are often at loggerheads over crossing of roads. There is a need to put in place proper co-operative structures to resolve problems. Co-location is accepted as a planning principle in terms of mobile phone masts. Co-location of services should be used to minimise impact and financial liability.</P>
      <P>The IFA and the various campaign groups such as Fingal for Undergrounding of Electricity Lines &ndash; FUEL &ndash; as well as representatives of various political parties are seeking this logical undergrounding option. They have warned that this campaign to place this line underground could become the Wood Quay campaign of Fingal. There is not just the cost of placing these lines underground as opposed to using pylons. The ESB would claim the cost is prohibitive, but I have a newspaper report that shows a link between the use of pylons and leukaemia. It refers to a successful British compensation test case with the potential to have a huge impact on the electricity industry. The Minister should think ahead on this matter and take the opportunity when it is presented to us on a plate, of placing underground a line which will go alongside a major road construction project.</P>

      <P>Go raibh maith ag an Teachta as ucht na ceiste seo a ardú. Déarfaidh mé leis an Aire caidé bhí le rá aige. In general, there are many potential advantages associated with the delivery of different infrastructures in a co-ordinated way. Apart from having the scope for reducing the overall financial cost of providing infrastructure, co-ordination can reduce the amount of land taken for services, result in less visual impact on the environment and result in a reduction in the nuisance and other social costs associated with providing infrastructure separately. It is desirable in principle, therefore, that service providers and local authorities should avail of whatever practical opportunities present themselves to co-ordinate the provision of infrastructure. This has been taking place for many years in so far as public roads have been used <Col N="130" /> by service providers to locate electricity, gas and telecommunications as well as water and waste water services.</P>
      <P>The main focus of the present work programme of the NRA is the provision of motorways and high quality dual carriageways on five major inter-urban routes and the upgrading of a large number of other national routes around the country. The function of these routes is to carry high volumes of traffic efficiently between the main urban centres.

      <P>The NRA considers that these activities would be likely to interfere with the efficient operation of the routes and would have a potential negative impact on road safety. Accordingly, it is understood that the NRA does not favour the use of the margins of major national routes to locate services. The implication in the Deputy's proposal that parallel but separate corridors be provided as part of major road development would also have major cost implications.</P>
      <P>However, in the case of other routes, local authorities and the NRA take account of and accommodate the needs of service providers in building new roads and upgrading existing roads. This contributes, among other things, to a reduced need among service providers to open such roads for maintenance and repairs. In addition, the provision of new national roads under the current work programme of the NRA will result in a substantial reduction in the levels of traffic on significant stretches of the existing national network. This will make it more practical and safer for service providers to provide cable and pipe services along these routes if they so wish.</P>
      <P>On electricity transmission and distribution networks, I understand very substantial additional costs and maintenance difficulties arise where such infrastructure is placed underground.</P>
      <P>On the provision of a separate service road for cyclists and pedestrians, it must be pointed out again that the function of the proposed new major routes is to carry high volumes of traffic efficiently between major urban centres. Apart from the unsuitability of such routes for cyclists and pedestrians, it is unlikely that there would be any significant demand for such facilities over most of the length of such routes. Furthermore, significant stretches of the existing national network, which will be by-passed by the new routes, will become more suitable for meeting the needs of cyclists and pedestrians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need to provide for separate facilities for cyclists and pedestrians arises predominantly in an urban and village context and considerable progress is being made in this regard. In recent <Col N="131" /> years the Dublin local authorities and the Dublin Transportation Office have provided 160 kilometres of two-way cycle routes and 2,500 cycle parking spaces. In addition, the Department of the Environment and Local Government has reminded local authorities of the need to ensure that the surface of hard shoulders is adequately maintained so as to ensure the safety and convenience of cyclists.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a local authority wishes to <Col N="132" /> develop cycling and pedestrian facilities along a national route, it is open to it to bring forward proposals to the NRA as part of an overall traffic management plan for the urban centre concerned. In the case of other roads, local authorities may use their discretionary improvement grant allocation or apply to the Department of the Environment and Local Government for funding under the regional traffic management grant scheme for the provision of improved cycle facilities.</P>

      <P>More balanced regional tourism is one of the objectives of Government policy on balanced development as set out in the national development plan, NDP. The challenge for the future is to ensure that not only overall tourism revenue increases, but also that the less developed regions share should continue to grow. To this end, a specific target has been included under the framework of the NDP for the BMW region's share of overseas tourism revenue to increase from 25% to 28% over the life of the plan.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that yesterday I formally launched the tourism product development scheme, which is provided for in the NDP and has been designed specifically to improve the spatial spread of tourism. The scheme has a particular focus on less developed areas and makes provision for public sector investment of 130 million over the next five years to help such areas realise their potential and to stimulate new tourism growth areas. However, it cannot be emphasised often enough that successful realisation of tourism product development strategy is dependent on, and directly linked to, the delivery by relevant local and other authorities of the necessary infrastructure, facilities and controls.</P>
      <P>In addition, comprehensive marketing plans for 2002, recently announced by Tourism Ireland Ltd. &ndash; TIL &ndash; and Bord Fáilte also include, among their objectives, regional development and target a broad mix of tourists of varying age, interest and market origins. The successful marketing of Ireland abroad plays a key role in encouraging a wide dispersal of visitors throughout the country and throughout the year, so that the benefits of tourism can be more evenly spread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>TIL's programme budget for 2002 of 27 million for the international marketing of the island of Ireland is the largest ever annual budget allocated for such a purpose. It is supplemented by substantial niche-product marketing funding by Bord Fáilte and a further 11 million for tourism marketing, which was announced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in the recent <Col N="134" /> budget. Over half of that additional money is aimed specifically at expanding regional tourism.</P>
    <P>In 2002, Bord Fáilte will implement an intensive marketing campaign in the home market and Northern Ireland, providing promotional platforms for the industry. The campaign, which has a budget of 2.1 million, will be particularly strong from February to May and September to November to encourage seasonal and regional extension. It comprises a new advertising campaign, tactical advertising with special offers, complementary publicity and PR, promotions, direct marketing and the distribution of more than 0.5 million Discover Ireland brochures enhanced by the use of the recently introduced Discover Ireland website.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>A joint delegation from the Scottish FA and the Scottish Executive met with Department officials on 17 December last to discuss their proposed joint bid with the FAI to host the European Football Championships 2008 and the requirements set out by UEFA for the hosting of this tournament. The Scottish delegation also met Bord Fáilte and the FAI on the same day. The chief executive of the FAI conveyed his association's strong support for a joint Irish-Scottish bid to host the tournament to Department officials at a meeting four days later on 21 December 2001.</P>
      <P>On Friday, 25 January I had a preliminary discussion with the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport on this matter and we arranged that officials of our respective Departments should meet without delay. This meeting took place yesterday, 29 January, and a meeting with the FAI has been arranged for Friday next. In addition, I have agreed to meet Mr. Mike Watson, Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport in the Scottish Executive on 5 February next.</P>
      <P>The Government is supportive in principle of the proposed joint bid but there are still many issues to be considered before it can proceed, for example, UEFA requirements in terms of stadia, policing, security, accommodation, transport and other infrastructure and services needed in organising this major international tournament. At any rate, both football associations must confirm by 28 February to UEFA that they intend submitting a joint bid by 31 May, the closing date for the submission of formal bids.</P>
      <P>As I previously stated in this House, the use of Croke Park, including for activities other than Gaelic games, is a matter entirely for the Gaelic Athletic Association.</P>

      <P>The report referred to by the Deputy is entitled Bord Fáilte Rural Tourism Research and was presented by MRBI in June 2001. It was commissioned by Bord Fáilte on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, who has responsibility for rural development. Earlier, rural tourism and agri-tourism programmes saw significant public and private investment in rural tourism facilities and the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, considered it appropriate to look at consumer awareness and behaviour in relation to rural tourism holidays in <Col N="136" /> northern Europe and to establish how Ireland is positioned in this regard.</P>
      <P>This was conceptual research and I understand a large percentage of those interviewed had not necessarily visited Ireland but were known to be interested in taking a rural holiday here at some time in the future. Therefore, the report essentially highlights expectations of a rural holiday in Ireland and, naturally, these include good accommodation standards and value for money.</P>
      <P>The findings of the research validated the objectives of national tourism policy and, more specifically, informed the draft guidelines for the rural tourism/agri-tourism programme to be implemented by the LEADER programme. Under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, some 30 million has been provided for rural/agri-tourism and this funding will be administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development under the LEADER programme for the development of sustainable rural/agri-tourism projects. Accordingly, any further questions about the rural/agri-tourism programme can be addressed to my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>I asked the Irish Sports Council to carry out an in-depth review of Ireland's preparation for and participation in the Sydney Olympics, including the supports, programmes and schemes which were put in place leading up to the games. The report of the review, including recommendations for the Athens 2004 Olympics, was published on 6 February 2001.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the council established a high performance committee to assist and advise the council in the development of a high performance strategy for Irish sport. A wide range of interests were represented on the committee which produced the strategy, including athletes, national governing bodies of sport, the National Coaching and Training Centre, the Olympic Council of Ireland, the Paralympic Council of Ireland, Sports Campus Ireland, my Department and Sports Council Northern Ireland. This strategy was launched on 12 December last.</P>
      <P>The strategy states that its implementation should be led by the Irish Sports Council in partnership with other key agencies. My Department is already providing substantial funding to the council to enable it to assist sports organisations and their athletes in their development. In the past three years since its establishment on a statutory basis, the Government has increased substantially the annual budget of the Irish Sports Council. The 2002 ISC annual budget of almost 26 million represents an increase of over 50% on the 2001 figure of 19.6 million and an almost 100% increase on the 2000 figure of just over 13 million. Additionally, our elite sportspersons have access also to the services of the National Coaching and Training Centre, the international carding scheme and the greatly enhanced range and quality of sports facilities now in place with the assistance of capital funding from my Department.</P>
      <P>The Government, in recognising the need to invest in our elite athletes if we are to succeed in a consistent basis at world level, allocated 3 million in the budget to the Irish Sports Council to commence the implementation of strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In commenting on the progress made in implementing the recommendations of the Sydney review group, it is important to highlight the process and the role played by the national governing bodies of sport in the preparation of our elite athletes and teams for international competition. With the aid of financial support and advice from the Irish Sports Council, the NGBs train and employ coaches, organise training camps and prepare teams to compete in major international events, such as the Olympic Games, world championships, European championships and home internationals. The work of the other <Col N="138" /> bodies, such as the NCTC, OCI and Paralympic Council, should all be seen in the context of supporting and underpinning the work of the NGBs on behalf of their athletes. This is why the Irish Sports Council when announcing its NGB grants invested 1,102,452 in the work of the National Coaching and Training Centre.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Irish Sports Council announced grants totalling 11 million to the national governing bodies of sport, which is a major investment in the work of the 67 national governing bodies. This will bring to 30 million the total investment in national governing bodies since l999. Coach education programmes in association with the national governing bodies facilitate the running of training camps for elite squads at the University of Limerick and oversee the services being provided to elite athletes through the international carding scheme. The challenging programme, which the National Coaching Training Centre has laid out in agreement with the council, will see more and more highly qualified coaches, more athletes benefiting from the expertise available at the centre and more and more squads taking advantage of the facilities now on offer at the University of Limerick.</P>
    <P>With that important role in mind, the Sports Council has worked very closely with the NGBs to help them identify their strengths and weaknesses and the need for strategic planning, to achieve value for money and to introduce measurement criteria. As a model for the implementation of a good strategic plan, the grant allocated by the council to the Badminton Union of Ireland increased from 125,000 in 2000 to 222,000 in 2002.</P>
    <P>Funding allocations under the sports capital grants programme have increased from 7.6 million in 1998 to 56 million in 2001, an increase of over 600% in this period. Under this programme I have received in excess of 1,300 applications, many from the national governing bodies, and these are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines terms and conditions of the programme. As soon as the assessment of the projects has been completed, I will be in a position to finalise the overall budget for this year's allocation. Many of those grant applications will assist high performance sport.</P>
    <P>A grant of 6.09 million was also allocated to Morton Stadium, our indoor national athletics stadium. Provision to enable capital payments for Campus and Stadium Ireland in 2002 is 39,886 million, consisting of 37,347 million capital and 2,539 million current, in order to complete the aqua and leisure centre, which is required for the Special Olympics World Games 2003. This is in addition to the 40.63 million provided in 2001.</P>
    <P>Again, under the NGB grants, the Special Olympics Ireland grant increased from 176,285 in 2000 to 226,403 in 2002. In respect of Special Olympics World Games 2003, an amount of 19,046,071 is being allocated towards the <Col N="139" /> development of Croke Park for hosting the games. Of the total amount of 19,046,071, half of this amount was paid in 2001 and the rest will be paid in 2002. A once-off allocation of 761,843 was given to Kill Equestrian Centre for the development of sporting facilities to be used during the Special Olympics.</P>
    <P>The national 50 meter swimming pool at the University of Limerick is due to open officially in the next few months. The total Government allocation for the pool is 7.55 million. A yearly grant of 250,138 for the operational and running costs of the 50 meter pool has been agreed with the Irish Sports Council.</P>
    <P>The governing bodies of Olympic sports have already commenced the development of performance plans for their sports and a liaison group has been established between the Sports Council and the OCI to help maintain liaison and co-operation between them and, very importantly, to drive and monitor the implementation of the Sydney review recommendations.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any study that compares the range of coaching, training and management facilities available here and the various other supports which exist for our elite sports persons to those in other EU countries. I am satisfied that the preparations for future Olympic success are well under way and that satisfactory co-operation is being achieved thus far in the process from all concerned.</P>

      <P>Tourism Ireland Limited, the new all-island tourism marketing body established under the framework of the Good Friday Agreement, was formally launched in November last year at major events in Dublin and Belfast. On that occasion the company outlined details of its marketing programme for 2002 and released details of its new advertising and media promotional materials. Tourism Ireland Limited formally took over responsibility from Bord Fáilte for the international marketing of Ireland as and from the beginning of the year. Bord Fáilte staff due to transfer have in the interim been carrying out the work of Tourism Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the company that the number of staff in Tourism Ireland will rise to 57 in February. Of these, 25 are based in Ireland and the balance are based overseas. I am informed <Col N="140" /> that the 57 comprise 14 who have already transferred, 20 whose letters of appointment are being finalised and 23 direct recruits who have accepted offers of appointment or are in the final stage of acceptance.</P>
    <P>The total number of staff who will be employed by Tourism Ireland in 2002 will be about 150, after all formal transfers take place from Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.</P>
    <P>Negotiations with staff and their representatives on matters connected with the transfer of staff, including terms of appointment, are at an advanced stage. Discussions have been very detailed due to a number of factors including the complexities of transferring staff in 15 jurisdictions worldwide; the merging of the overseas marketing activities of Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board in a number of the principal markets; compliance by Tourism Ireland with local regulations for conducting business in the various jurisdictions; the application of relevant local employment legislation; and the superannuation provisions for transferred staff and those recruited directly.</P>
    <P>Most of this work is now at an advanced stage and an early conclusion of the discussions and completion of formal transfers is anticipated. The ongoing work being carried out by the staff concerned has been extremely effective in developing and launching the overseas marketing programme in what will be a very challenging year for the tourist industry.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the foundations for achieving a more integrated and streamlined approach to local development initiatives were set out in the report of the task force on the integration of local government and local development. Since its approval by Government, work has been proceeding on its implementation including the appointment of directors of community and enterprise, the establishment of city-county development boards and the preparation of new economic, social and cultural strategies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the establishment of the city-county development boards all area partnership companies and community groups have been participating in the workings of the boards. Their strategic plans must demonstrate evidence of linkage and co-ordination within the framework of development boards and funding of these groups in <Col N="141" /> respect of these plans, which is administered by Area Development Management Limited, is conditional on the plans having been agreed with the director of community and enterprise of the appropriate development board.</P>
    <P>Funding in respect of these plans has been provided until the mid-term review of the national development plan in 2003. In the meantime, delivery methods for social inclusion measures at local level, including the role of area based partnerships, will be examined within the context of the economic, social and cultural strategies of the city-county development boards.</P>
    <P>The boards are mandated to bring about a more integrated approach to the delivery of public and local development services.</P>

    <P>The Irish Sports Council is currently piloting the concept of local sports partnerships. Eight LSPs were selected in May 2001, after open com<Col N="142" /> petition, for the pilot scheme and these are located in Clare, Donegal, Fingal, Kildare, Laois, Roscommon, Sligo and north Tipperary. Each receives an annual allocation of 114,276 from the Sports Council. Four other areas &ndash; Cork, Limerick, Meath and Waterford &ndash; are currently involved in an extensive development process with a view to joining the pilot programme in 2002.</P>
    <P>It is intended to have completed an evaluation of the pilot by mid 2003. The proven effectiveness of the concept will determine the final shape and structure of the concept for extension to other areas from end 2003.</P>
    <P>The aim of this partnership initiative, which is new to Irish sport and untested, is to create greater opportunities for participation by all in sport and to ensure that resources are cordinated and used to their best efforts at local level.</P>

      <P>The national lottery funded sports capital programme, administered by my Department, provides funding to voluntary sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level towards the provision of sport and recreational facilities. Annual funding allocations under the programme have increased from 7.6 million in 1998 to 56 million in 2001, an increase of almost 700% in this period. Over 135 million has been allocated to 2,044 projects under the 1998 to 2001 programmes compared with less than 24.6 million under the previous Government from 1995 to 1997. The substantial increase in funding has provided a greatly improved network of high quality facilities for all levels and types of sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sports Capital Programme for 2002 was advertised on 25 and 26 November 2001 with a closing date of 4 January for the receipt of completed applications. In excess of 1,300 applications were received and these applications are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed. The total value of the proposed allocations has not yet been decided. This will depend on the outcome of the assessment process. It will be based on the aims and objectives of the pro<Col N="143" /> gramme and subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme 2000-2002, the Government has allocated an overall total of 57.15 million towards the provision of pools. This represents an increase of 400% on previous annual allocation levels.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sports Council was established on a statutory basis on 1 July 1999. It is responsible for the administration of funding for a range of programmes to develop and enhance governing bodies of sport, their coaching, training and international competition activities. The 2002 ISC annual budget of almost 26 million represents an increase of over 50% on the 2001 figure of 19.6 million and an almost 100% increase on the 2000 figure of just over 13 million.</P>
    <P>The 2002 ISC budget includes 250,138 for the operational and running costs of the national 50 metre pool in Limerick, with this year being the first year of the operational grant payments. The pool is located at the University of Limerick and is due to officially open in the next few months. It received a total Government allocation towards its construction of 7.55 million.</P>
    <P>This year provision of 39,886 million has been made in respect of the completion of the aquatic and leisure centre at Abbottstown, which is required for the Special Olympics World Games 2003. This is in addition to the 40.63 million provided for the project in 2001. An amount of 19 million has also been allocated to the GAA to ensure that Croke Park will be ready to host the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2003 games. Half of this amount was paid in 2001 and the rest will be paid in 2002. Finally an allocation of 761,843 was provided in the 2002 budget to the Kill Equestrian Centre for the development of sporting facilities to be used during the games.</P>
    <P>The greatly increased funding for sport provided by this Government has resulted in a considerably enhanced quality and range of top class facilities from national level to local community clubs and centres.</P>

      <P>The National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 aims to tackle the drug problem in the most comprehensive way ever undertaken in Ireland. It contains 100 indi<Col N="144" /> vidual actions under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research.</P>
      <P>Since the strategy was launched in May 2001 considerable progress has been made by Departments and agencies to meet the targets set out in the strategy. The interdepartmental group on drugs, which I chair, meets monthly to monitor progress by Departments and agencies in achieving the targets set for them and any obstacles to the implementation of the strategy are brought to light at these meetings. A progress report on the implementation of the strategy will be presented to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion every six months.</P>
      <P>The first of these progress reports, which was presented at the January Cabinet committee meeting, highlighted a number of areas where substantial progress has been made. First, the Department of Education and Science is now represented on nearly all local drugs task forces. In addition, it is recruiting two support staff to enable the delivery of substance misuse prevention programmes in all schools over the next three years. Schools in the local drugs task force areas will be prioritised in this context.</P>
      <P>Second, it was also pointed out that the Department of Health and Children has established a cross-sectoral committee to develop the ongoing national awareness campaign which was recommended in the strategy. The committee's work is proceeding and it is planned to launch the first phase of the campaign in April. In this context the committee will also be taking on board the recommendations of the first report of the national advisory committee on drugs entitled Drug Misuse Prevention &ndash; An Overview of Research, which was published in early December 2001.</P>
      <P>Third, the national drugs strategy team is currently preparing guidelines for the operation of the regional drugs task forces which will be disseminated to the various sectors and agencies. Nominations will then be sought. It is planned to have the first meetings of the regional task forces in May. Representatives of the area based partnerships will be invited to sit on the regional drugs task forces and I expect them to play an important part in their ongoing work.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has also been made with regard to increasing the number of methadone treatment places. The number of places at the end of 2001 was 5,865, an increase of over 830 since the start of 2001. Under the national drugs strategy we are committed to increasing that number to 6,500 by the end of 2002.</P>
      <P>Work on implementing the various other actions outlined in the strategy will continue during 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the first report of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs entitled Drug Misuse Prevention: An Overview of Research was published in early December 2001. The report found there is no single drug problem with one dramatic solution. Rather, what is called the drug problem comprises varying degrees of involvement with a variety of substances arising from several influences many of which are unrelated to each other. The report calls for both targeted and broadly based programmes to tackle this situation.</P>
      <P>The report also recommends that these programmes should focus both on the most damaging forms of misuse &ndash; for which social and economic depravation is seen as a predisposing factor &ndash; and experimental drug use which is not uncommon to young people from all social backgrounds. In addition, it recognises the importance of programmes that emphasise personal and social development and welcomes developments in the social personal and health education programme in schools.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased that many of the recommendations in the report are in line with those in the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 which I launched in May of last year. The SPHE programme is being increasingly delivered throughout the second level school system. The strategy aims to have the programme in all such schools by September 2003, with schools in local drugs task force areas being prioritised.</P>
      <P>One of the key actions in the national drugs strategy is that an ongoing national awareness campaign highlighting the dangers of drug misuse be developed. The health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children formed a working group in 2001 to develop this campaign and their work is under way. They are studying the NACD report closely and will be taking on board its recommendations. It is planned to launch the first phase of the campaign by April.</P>
      <P>The NACD report also recommends that targeted initiatives to tackle the social origins of drugs problems should be comprehensive and involve inter-agency co-operation and the community. In this context, as the Deputy will be aware, inter-agency co-operation has been an integral part of initiatives in Ireland aimed at tackling social exclusion over the past number of years. In addition, the community and voluntary sectors play an important role &ndash; not only in interventions to deal with problem drug use such as the local drugs task forces &ndash; but also in the work of area partnerships and the RAPID programme. In addition, the regional drugs task forces which will be in place later in the year will also have representation from the community and voluntary sectors as well as all the relevant statutory bodies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The applications received are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. These include: the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will increase the levels of active <Col N="147" /> participation in sport and-or result in improved standards of sporting performance; the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will serve to increase participation in disadvantaged areas; the technical merits of the project, for example, whether it complies with standard technical specifications from the relevant governing body and statutory authorities, possession of planning permission; the financial viability of the project; the level of local funding available towards the project; the extent to which the applicant will be able to maintain the project after completion; the level of socio-economic disadvantage in the area and the current and planned levels of sport and recreational sport facilities in the area; the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds, having regard to the range of existing facilities in each county; the extent to which applicants have consulted with other clubs, community groups, schools and the local authority in developing their proposals and the outcome of these consultations; in the case of projects aimed at attracting people from disadvantaged areas, the strategies to be used to attract them; the need to achieve an equitable spread of funds among different sports and community groups; the priority of proposed improvements facilities in relation to the organisation's existing facilities; and the priorities for their individual sports, as identified by the national governing bodies.</P>
    <P>Each application is scored depending on the extent to which they meet these assessment criteria; different weights are attached to the various criteria depending on their importance.

      <P>Bord Fáilte has established six regional tourism authorities for the promotion and development of tourism on a regional basis. Their functions include visitor servicing, product development and regional marketing in co-operation with the tourist industry, development co-operation and planning. These functions are carried out in a seventh region, the mid-west by Shannon Development.</P>
      <P>The RTAs and Shannon Development also play a key role in co-ordinating tourism initiatives across their respective regions and in formulating the tourism perspective for the new county and city strategies for economic social and cultural development via the county development boards. The RTAs have 24 county tourism committees which give a voice to the industry at county level.</P>
      <P>The allocation of funding to the RTAs is an operational issue for Bord Fáilte who provides details of the subventions in its annual report and accounts, copies of which are lodged in the Oireachtas Library. The RTAs also receive annual subscriptions from members and generate other income from a range of commercial activities in which they are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of other local tourism groups funded by local subscription and sponsorship. They also avail of funding from sources such as county enterprise boards, Leader programmes, <Col N="149" /> local authorities in which I have no function or details.</P>
    <P>The voluntary effort and contribution of local communities and organisations can be a key factor influencing visitor welcome and activity. Of course they help produce a wider spin-off for local economies. There is an inherent risk that any proliferation of such groups can give rise to duplication of effort and reduced effectiveness in the use of scarce resources. It is vital that local groups who wish to be involved in tourism acquaint themselves, and act in accordance with, national and regional tourism development and marketing strategies. Local initiatives, whether on the tourism product or marketing sides must, if they are to be effective, tie in with these wider strategies.</P>
    <P>It is important to ensure that the extension and involvement of local community activity in the tourism sector does not lead to its fragmentation and that available resources are used prudently in keeping with the aims and objectives of the local RTA and national tourism policy. Accordingly, I strongly recommend that all local groups work in close partnership with their local RTA and county tourism committees so that all efforts can be co-ordinated in a way that will achieve optimum results for visitors and local communities alike.</P>

      <P>A critical component for regaining tourism business in 2002 will be maintaining a broad network of competitive access links by air and sea to Ireland. We are particularly well served by the levels of investment in sea access in recent years. This sector has seen the emergence of a high quality and competitive route network, in particular across the Irish sea and to France.</P>
      <P>My Department has been keeping in close contact with the Department of Public Enterprise on air access issues generally. Immediately following the events of 11 September my Department worked closely with that Department to safeguard as much of the air access route infrastructure as possible so that, as traveller confidence is restored and the sector recovers, we will be best placed to avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is also anxious to promote new air route development, in particular from the large continental European market which has not performed up to expectations in recent years. The extension by Aer Rianta of its incentive scheme <Col N="150" /> for new routes to Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports is very encouraging. I welcome recent announcements of additional routes for 2002. This will go some way to compensating for the loss of services arising from the shake-out of the airline sector following the events of 11 September.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental group, under the chairpersonship of the Department of the Taoiseach and including representatives of my Department, has been established to look at the interaction between access transport, particularly by air, and tourism with a view to identifying further possibilities for increasing the flow of visitors to Ireland. The work of that group is at an advanced stage and I am hopeful that the Government will consider its report very shortly.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, is responsible for the regional airports and the funding of regional air services under the public service obligation regime.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>Under the framework of the National Development Plan 2000-2006, published in November 1999, a number of indicators and targets have been set for tourism performance over the life of the plan. Foreign exchange earnings from tourism were projected to grow at an annual average rate of 5%, while a reduction of two percentage points was targeted over the seven year period in the number of visitors arriving during the peak July-August period. In addition, an increase of three percentage points in the proportion of total out of State tourism revenue accruing to the Border, midland and western region was targeted over the life of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the year 2000, the first full year of the NDP, foreign exchange earnings from tourism increased by approximately 15%, well ahead of the 5% target. There was a reduction of one percentage point in the number of visitors arriving during the peak July-August period. Progress <Col N="151" /> against the regional target was also satisfactory with a gain of over two percentage points in the proportion of tourism revenue accruing to the BMW region.</P>
    <P>While the above outcome is encouraging, caution must be exercised in interpreting the results for a single year in the context of multiannual target setting.</P>
    <P>Final figures for 2001 are not available. Due to the adverse impact on tourism by the foot and mouth disease emergency earlier this year and the inevitable negative repercussions for foreign travel of the recent terrorist attacks in the US, foreign exchange earnings from tourism are forecast by Bord Fáilte to be down this year for the first time in a decade. While the NDP targets must be viewed in the context of a seven year timeframe, it is inevitable that the recent unexpected setbacks will make the achievement of these targets by the industry more challenging.</P>

Wicklow County Council also submitted a proposal for a new pool in Greystones. To facilitate my Department's assessment of these three applications, the local authority had been requested to indicate its priority requirement in the context of the best way to meet the swimming pool needs of the north Wicklow area in a viable and sustainable manner. Bray Town Council prioritised a new pool in Bray and the refurbishment proposal from Presentation College has been withdrawn. The two remaining applications are under consideration by my Department in consultation with the Office of Public Works, our technical advisers.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the RAPID programme is a focused initiative by the Government to target the 25 most concentrated areas of disadvantage here. The programme will ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the designated areas through targeting State resources available under the NDP.</P>
      <P>The area implementation plans for 13 of the 25 RAPID areas have been approved by the relevant city/county development boards and submitted to the national co-ordinator for the programme at ADM Limited. In early March the plans for the remaining 12 areas &ndash; eight in the Dublin City Council area and four in the South Dublin County Council area &ndash; will go before the next meetings of the development boards for approval.</P>
      <P>All of the proposals contained in the plans already received have been submitted by the national co-ordinator to the relevant Departments for dissemination either within them or to the appropriate agencies under their remit.</P>
      <P>As part of the process, Departments and agencies have been asked to establish a timeframe for implementation of each proposal. This will enable the national co-ordinator to track delivery of the overall programme.</P>
      <P>A national monitoring committee, under the chairmanship of Ms Maureen Gaffney, has been established and its first meeting will take place on 12 February. The committee will oversee the operation of the programme and it will report to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion on progress in its implementation.</P>

      <P>While it is intended that the facilities in Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland at Abbottstown will be self-financing, it is also intended that facilities will be accessible not only to sports people and teams but also to individuals and families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> Commercial realities will dictate that the most effective way to ensure that these facilities operate without subvention will be for the operators to pitch the entrance charges at such a level to encourage a high volume of usage by the general public, including the local community. In the case of the aquatic and leisure centre, which is being developed to host the aquatic competitions of the Special Olympic Games in 2003, the contract terms negotiated between CSID and the construction-operation consortium, provide that CSID will have a role in the pricing structure for the centre in the interests of accessibility for the local community and the general public. Free training and competition time of 1,300 hours per annum will be allocated to allow elite and performance athletes access to its pool.</P>

      <P>The Team Ireland Golf Trust was established in September 1999 as the main support mechanism for assisting young golfers, both male and female, in the early stages of their professional careers. The trust provides financial and non-financial support for selected young golfers to help them qualify for tour cards and achieve success at international level. It has an initial fund of 241,250 per annum for three years provided by private organisations and individuals, the Irish Sports Council and Bord Fáilte. Non-financial support is provided in the form of access for a range of sports science and medical services, which are co-ordinated through the national coaching and training centre in Limerick.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Sports Council that the selection criteria of the golfers to be assisted by the trust are: performance record; coaching, training and competitive programme; progression in the sport; and financial requirements.</P>
      <P>The operation of the trust is overseen by a committee and includes representatives from the Golfing Union of Ireland, the Irish Ladies Golfing Union, the Professional Golfers Association, the Irish Sports Council, Bord Fáilte and the private sector. The Irish Sports Council is responsible for the trust's administration and financial management.</P>

      <P>The Seveso II Directive &ndash; EU Directive 96/82/EC &ndash; on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances introduced a requirement that the objectives of preventing major accidents, and limiting the consequences of such, are taken into account in land use policies and/or other relevant policies through controls on establishments covered by the directive, or a development in the vicinity of such an establishment. The regulations apply to companies where dangerous substances are present in quantities equal to or above specified thresholds. The directive also sets requirements for land use planning controls in relation to and around major hazard establishments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directive has been fully transposed into Irish law by my Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government <Col N="160" /> through the following legal instruments: The European Communities (Control of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances) Regulations, 2000 &ndash; S.I.

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's aims in its preparations for the changeover were that public sector preparations be completed in good time, the public be well informed and the changeover be completed smoothly and efficiently and with minimum disruption to commerce and the public. These aims were achieved.</P>
      <P>There were essentially six elements in the changeover preparations: legislation; the production and distribution of euro cash; preparations by the public sector; preparations by the private sector; consumer matters; and the provision of public information.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act, 2001, provided for convenient amounts in euro to replace Irish pound money amounts in the tax code from 1 January 2002. The Social Welfare Act did the same for the social welfare code. The Euro Changeover (Amounts) Act, 2001, provided in necessary cases elsewhere in law for convenient amounts in euro to replace IR£ amounts from 1 January 2002. These, and other similar changes, were introduced with a view to facilitating the day to day transaction of business with the State. In all cases where convenient euro amounts in law were provided for, the Government acted on the principle of favouring the citizen. In July 2001, I signed a ministerial order to withdraw legal tender status from IR£ notes and coins at midnight on 9 February 2002, as recommended in Ireland's cash changeover plan. Previous legislation in 1998 had already adapted Ireland's Central Bank and monetary law to cater for the launch of the euro, while more recent legislation catered for such matters as copyright and counterfeiting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cash production by the Central Bank involved over 200 million euro notes and over 1 billion euro coins. The frontloading of euro cash to banks and the sub-frontloading of retailers <Col N="161" /> ensured that the notes and coins were widely available for the transaction of business in euro from 1 January 2002. Starter packs of euro coins were put on sale to the public from 14 December 2001, mainly through post offices.</P>
    <P>In the public sector, each Department and body was made responsible for the changeover of its own operations and regular reports confirmed that progress was on target. These preparations included conversion of payroll and accounting systems and staff training. Each Department and body also had to make appropriate arrangements in respect of its own business clients. Thus, for example, Revenue provided its business customers with the facility of conducting their tax and customs affairs in euro from 1 January 1999. The 2002 Estimates for the public service and my recent budget were presented predominantly in euro.</P>
    <P>The Forfas EMU business awareness campaign was established in 1996 to provide businesses with the information they needed to prepare themselves for the changeover. The campaign distributed a wide range of information materials very extensively and in autumn 2001 a retail training kit, containing among other things a euro calculator, a detailed training manual and a ready reckoner, was distributed to over 45,000 retailers. Similar kits were provided in December to taxi and hackney licence holders. Practical training for retailers and their staff was also provided by FÁS and through business representative organisations.</P>
    <P>The consumer aspects of the changeover were addressed by my colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, the Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs, and by the Director of Consumer Affairs, through the national code of practice on the euro changeover. Subscribers to the national code committed themselves to carrying out the changeover to the euro fairly and to providing dual display of prices as far as practicable from 1 October 2001.</P>
    <P>As regards the public, the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland carried out very extensive public information and advertising activities. These activities included a range of materials and support mechanisms to meet the needs of low awareness and special needs groups. The final phase of the board's campaign saw nationwide household distributions by An Post of a comprehensive euro handbook and an electronic converter. The board's advertising in late December and early January gave practical advice to the public on how everyone could help the changeover run smoothly.</P>
    <P>The board's cash changeover plan, drawn up in conjunction with the key changeover organisations, was implemented efficiently from 1 January. Early on that day accounts with financial institutions were converted to euro, ATM machines began dispensing euro notes &ndash; 85% were dispensing in euro by 6 p.m. &ndash; and electronic point of sale systems which support credit card and similar payments were converted to <Col N="162" /> euro. Retailers who opened on that day systematically gave change in euro only or, in some cases, provided exchange facilities so as to enable transactions in euro only at the tills. From 2 January, euro cash became even more widely available through withdrawals from financial institutions, social welfare cash payments and change giving by retailers generally. By the end of the first weekend the bulk of cash transactions were taking place in euro and the changeover was virtually complete within a week. Withdrawal of Irish pound cash by the Central Bank is now well in hand.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the changeover went very well. I am glad to take this opportunity on behalf of the Government and on my behalf as Minister for Finance, to express our thanks and congratulations to all those involved, including the public at large, for making it so successful.</P>

      <P>The Consumer Credit Act, 1995, requires those engaged in the business of being money lenders to hold a licence granted for that purpose by the Director of Consumer Affairs. Such licences are renewable on a yearly basis. There are currently 60 lenders licensed by the director to engage in the business of being money lenders. From financial returns made by licensed lenders to the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, it is estimated that approximately £53 million was owed to licensed money lenders as of the middle of 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Consumer Credit Act entitles the director to refuse to grant a money lenders licence on the grounds that, in her opinion, the cost of credit to be charged is excessive. The director is aware that the cost of credit provided by licensed money lenders is expensive. Her office has examined the licensed moneylending sector and is satisfied that the cost to lenders of providing the service in terms of overheads, etc, can also be high. I share the director's concern as to the limited access that customers of licensed money lenders have to more mainstream sources of credit. However, I also agree with the director that there is a need to ensure that licensed lenders are not forced out of business with the consequence of being replaced by illegal and unlicensed lenders who <Col N="163" /> may charge much higher rates of interest and/or employ unacceptable collection practices.</P>
    <P>A general guide to the various protections afforded to borrowers under the Consumer Credit Act is available from the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs. Consumers who have any queries in relation of credit matters may also contact the ODCA helpline at (01) 4025555.</P>

      <P>Retailers providing credit via in-store charge cards or by other arrangements with finance houses, which are not deposit takers within the meaning of the Central Bank Acts, do not require a license from any authority to do so. However, if a retailer is paid a commission or consideration for arranging credit with a finance provider they must hold a credit intermediaries authorisation granted for that purpose by the Director of Consumer Affairs. Retailers arranging credit for consumers through licensed money lenders do not themselves require an authorisation or a licence but the money lender providing the credit must hold a licence granted for that purpose from the Director of Consumer Affairs. Neither my Department nor the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs has access to statistics on amounts outstanding on foot of in-store charge cards or other types of finance.</P>
      <P>The Consumer Credit Act, 1995, which is enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs contains general provisions in relation to the form and content of all credit agreements. These include requirements to specify the amount of credit lent, the amount of each repayment instalment, the rate of interest charged and the APR, together with particular provisions in relation to specific agreements such as hire purchase agreements. A general guide to the Consumer Credit Act, outlining the various protections afforded to borrowers under the Act, is available from the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.

      <P>I am very much aware of the increases in insurance premiums for road haulage and generally. The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual companies. Under EU law we cannot intervene in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks insurers are prepared to underwrite. It is intended that the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board will achieve a reduction in the delivery cost of personal injury compensation, thus permitting a reduction in insurance costs to consumers.</P>
      <P>The Third Insurance Framework Directives were adopted by the EU some years ago as part of the completion of the Internal Market in relation to insurance services. Since their transposition into Irish law, insurance companies authorised in any member state may provide insurance cover throughout the EU on the basis of their home country authorisation and supervision. Further regulatory measurers are not under consideration at present.</P>

      <P>The Dignity in the Workplace Charter originates from a recommendation of the task force on the prevention of workplace bullying. The Health and Safety Authority, in its role as the central co-ordinating State agency overseeing the implementation of the task force recommendations, is responsible for the distribution of the Dignity in the Workplace Charter. While the adoption of the charter is not a statutory requirement on an employer, I have been informed by the authority that, to date, they have distributed over 10,000 copies of the charter. The authority anticipates that the high level of demand for copies of the charter will continue for the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significantly, the charter has been endorsed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and the Construction Industry Federation. Each of these organisations is supporting the charter by promoting its adoption by their constituent members <Col N="165" /> and facilitating its distribution among their members. This endorsement gives the charter much impact and credibility not least because of the wide spectrum of interests which these organisations collectively represent. The charter is also available for, and equally applicable to, enterprises which are not associated with any of the above organisations.</P>
    <P>While I have no statutory role or function in relation to advising individual Departments on the methods to be used to promote their areas of responsibility, I have, in view of my initiative in setting up the task force on the prevention of workplace bullying, asked the Health and Safety Authority, as the central co-ordinating State agency, to ensure that all Departments and State agencies have been circulated with copies of the charter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 26 October last new late filing fees were introduced by our Department for companies which failed to file their annual return on time with the Companies Registration Office. Previously, a late filing fee of £5 &ndash; 6.35 &ndash; in addition to a registration fee of £25 &ndash; 31.74 &ndash; was imposed where a company had failed to file its returns on time. The late filing fee was the same irrespective of how late the return was filed. The new increased late filing fee of 100 plus a 3 daily fee for each day the return is late, subject to an overall maximum fee of 1,230, provides such an incentive.</P>
      <P>For too long there has been a culture of non-compliance with the requirements of company law and a failure by companies and their officers to meet their responsibilities under the Companies Acts, particularly with regard to the filing of annual returns with the CRO. While there has been a marked improvement in the last couple of years in companies meeting the requirements to file returns with the CRO on foot of pro-active enforcement by the Registrar of Companies, a large number of companies continue to fail to file their annual returns on time. For information to be of proper use to users of CRO data, it is important that the returns be made on time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Companies Registration Office heavily advertised these new progressively increasing fees in advance of the commencement date. This provided sufficient time for companies, which did not have their affairs in order before then, to do so <Col N="166" /> and thus avoid paying the new fee rates for returns that were overdue at the time. These charges are not excessive and I do not propose to reduce them. Companies will only incur a late filing penalty where they fail to meet their statutory obligations.</P>

The breakdown of the funding was as follows: £250,000 was provided to the An Síol Millennium Holiday Trust Limited. This project was initiated and jointly established by two community development groups, An Síol, North West Inner City, and the Quarryvale Community House Project, Clondalkin.

      <P>I understand from the Competition Authority that the only generic study into the professions of which it is aware, which would be comparable to the study being undertaken by the authority, was a study requested in April 1984 by the then Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism. That study was requested from the Restrictive Practices Commission under section 12 of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, into the rendering of certain professional and analogous services, with particular reference to the effect on the public <Col N="169" /> interest of barriers to entrance to the profession or occupation with particular regard to the institutional, including statutory, structures within which the relevant profession or occupation is carried on; prohibitions, including statutory prohibitions, on the provision of such services by persons who are not members of such a profession or by persons who are not recognised as being qualified to engage in such an occupation; restrictions on advertising; concerted fixing of fees or charges; and any other practice which tends to restrict competition between members of a profession or between members of such a profession and other persons who could be regarded as capable of providing an equivalent service or between persons carrying on such an occupation.</P>
      <P>Arising from that study four reports were published, the Report of Study into Concerted Fixing of Fees and Restrictions on Advertising in the Accountancy Profession &ndash; 1987; the Report of Study into Concerted Fixing of Fees and Restrictions on Advertising in the Engineering Profession &ndash; 1987; the Report of Study into Restrictive Practices in the Legal Profession &ndash; 1990; and the Report of Study of the Professions of Architects, Surveyors, Auctioneers and Valuers &ndash; 1990.</P>
      <P>Each of these reports contained detailed analysis and recommendations relating to the professions concerned and it would not be possible in the time available to specify the particular outcomes of all of the recommendations over the period since the reports were published. It can be said, however, that the work of the Restrictive Practices Commission in relation to the professions contributed to increasing public awareness of the scope and effects of restrictive practices in professions generally and this has helped to bring about many useful changes for the benefit of the public.</P>

Limited &ndash; commenced 23 January 1998 &ndash; and Kentford Securities Limited &ndash; commenced 9 June 1998. Reports in respect of two of these investigations are at a very advanced stage with the remaining three reports expected to be completed during the course of 2002. The Companies Acts specifically provide that I may not publish the result of these investigations without the prior consent in writing of the body which has been subject to examination under section 19.</P>

The companies involved are National Irish Bank Limited &ndash; NIB, commenced 30 March 1998 &ndash; National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited &ndash; NIBFS, commenced 15 June 1998 &ndash; and Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited &ndash; commenced 22 September 1999.</P>
      <P>The most recent interim report on the NIB/NIBFS investigation was submitted to the High Court on 7 December 2001.

      <P>With effect from 2 January 2002, new applications for work permits from employers must be accompanied by relevant documentation from FÁS confirming that all reasonable efforts have been made by the employer, in co-operation with the FÁS employment services, to fill the vacancy through the <Col N="172" /> domestic or wider EEA labour market. These new arrangements do not apply to applications in respect of professional medical personnel or to employers seeking to renew a work permit in respect of an existing employee.</P>
      <P>In addition, the fees for work permits have increased. The fee for a work permit for one year's duration is now 400. Concerning a new form of work permit document, discussions are taking place with the appropriate authorities in relation to including new security features and it is expected that a new version of the work permit will be introduced in the near future.</P>
      <P>The number of work permits which issued per month and the categories of work they pertained to are set out in the following tabular statement:</P>

      <P>The Seveso II Directive &ndash; EU Directive 96/82/EC &ndash; on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances introduced a requirement that the objectives of preventing major accidents and limiting the consequences of such are taken into account in land use policies and/or other relevant policies through controls on establishments covered by the directive, or a development in the vicinity of such an establishment. The regulations apply to companies where dangerous substances are present in quantities equal to, or above, specified thresholds. The directive also sets requirements for land use planning controls in relation to and around major hazard establishments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directive has been fully transposed into Irish law by my Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government through the following legal instruments: the European Communities (Control of Major Acci<Col N="173" /> dent Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances) Regulations, 2000 &ndash; S.I. No. 476 of 2000 &ndash; which I signed on 21 December 2000 and which came into effect from that date as well as section 10 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 &ndash; No. 30 of 2000 &ndash; which was commenced on 1 January 2001, and Part 11 of the Planning and Development Regulations, 2001 &ndash; S.I. No. 600 of 2001 &ndash; which will be operational from 11 March, 2002, both of which are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey.</P>

      <P>Independent Insurance Company Limited, IICL, is a United Kingdom authorised insurer. Accordingly, responsibility for ensuring that IICL could meet claims from its policyholders lay with the UK authorities which were responsible for the financial supervision of the company.</P>
      <P>The insurance industry here provided alternative cover, within a short timescale, for many of the policyholders affected. Such cover is provided through the marketplace by individual private insurance companies, based on their assessment of the risk. The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual companies. Under EU law we cannot intervene in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks insurers are prepared to underwrite.</P>
      <P>With regard to the functioning of the insurance market, under the Single Market EU insurance undertakings can write business in Ireland and have done so. I have encouraged such competition. With regard to motor insurance, I will be considering the functioning of that market in the light of the recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, from which I expect to receive the final report within a matter of weeks.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of the increases in insurance premiums for domestic insurance and generally. The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies and EU law prevents us from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk.</P>
      <P>The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors, both domestic and international, to explain these increases. These include the high cost of settling claims, the general reduction in investment returns, recent court decisions regarding the calculation of compensation losses in personal injury cases and the effects of the 11 September attacks in the United States. While the factors contributing to premium increases are having a general effect, I encourage consumers to obtain quotations from a number of insurers so that they can make a judgment on the best value for their requirements.</P>

      <P>My Department is the national paying authority for the European Social Fund, ESF, in Ireland for the period 2000-06. It is also the managing authority for the Employment and Human Resources Development Operational Programme and for the EQUAL Community Initiative Programme, both co-funded by the ESF and the Productive Sector Operational Programme, which is co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF.</P>
      <P>Under Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 438/2001 of 3 March 2001, concerning the management and control systems for assistance granted under the Structural Funds, each member state is required to notify the Commission of the detailed management and control systems and procedures in place at each level for the financial management of the each of the four Structural Funds. As the paying authority for the European Social Fund, my Department has supplied the Commission with the detailed procedures being implemented throughout the financial control cascade in so far as the ESF is concerned. In drawing up the financial management and control procedures for the ESF, my Department followed the requirements of the above mentioned regulation and all other relevant EU regulations and national statutory requirements and worked closely with the functionally independent national ESF financial control unit.</P>
      <P>The European Commission has informally signalled its satisfaction with the procedures we have in place. However, in an effort to ensure that the highest operating standards apply, my Department has invited the Commission to come to Ireland to take a detailed look at the systems in place throughout the financial control cascade, that is, from paying authority down to the level of final recipient of funding, in so far as the ESF is concerned. This audit is now expected to take place in the first quarter of 2002. In the interim, my Department has asked the ESF financial control unit to conduct a preventive systems audit on the relevant areas of my Department. This will take place over the coming weeks. Should any gaps or deficiencies become apparent during that audit, immediate steps will be taken to address the situation.</P>
      <P>In relation to projects co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund under the Productive Sector Operational Programme, my Department has provided details of the management and control procedures in place at each level to the Department of Finance, which is the national paying authority for the European Regional Development Fund.</P>

      <P>In line with a commitment in the PPF, and following consultations with relevant Departments and the social partners, certain services currently provided by participants on community employment are being mainstreamed. This process has already commenced in the case of CE services in schools.</P>
      <P>A FÁS audit of CE services carried out in May 2001 has previously identified in the region of 2,000 places in the area of health and personal social services, including services for the disabled, which may be suitable for mainstreaming. The Department of Health and Children supports the mainstreaming of these services in view of its potential to create more permanent funding conditions for the delivery of such services in the future. The allocation of funds to specific service providers will, thereafter, be a matter for the Department of Health and Children and the relevant health boards.</P>
      <P>The modalities involved are being actively examined between my Department, the Department of Health and Children, the health boards and FÁS. It is intended that discussions will also be held with representatives from the major sponsor organisations to ensure that all the relevant issues are properly considered before the mainstreaming commences. I am very hopeful that current discussions can be brought to an early and satisfactory conclusion to enable mainstreaming to commence by late spring.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of, and concerned about, the difficulties being experienced by some businesses in getting liability insurance cover at present. The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies and EU law prevents us from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk.</P>
      <P>Difficulties in obtaining cover are attributable to the combined effect of a number of factors that have arisen. I understand that the events of 11 September 2001 have accelerated price increases and have caused reinsurers to review the cover they are prepared to offer insurers. All of this is felt by the consumer in the form of higher prices and curtailed availability of cover.</P>
      <P>It seems that with regard to liability cover insurers consider there is a greater risk when employees are working away from their usual base. This Government has decided to establish a Personal Injuries Assessment Board with a view to reducing the costs of delivery of compensation in personal injuries cases. Work on the establishment of the PIAB is in progress. It is expected that the PIAB will, in the course of time, substantially reduce the number of personal injury claims being brought to court, thus reducing the legal and other costs involved in the delivery of personal injury compensation.</P>

The decision to gift the pavilion to the institute was made, <i>inter alia,</i> on the basis that the institute had sufficient funds available to cover the cost of demounting the pavilion and re-erecting it on its campus.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Department of Education and Science committed a sum of £2 million &ndash; 2.54 million &ndash; towards this project in 2001. The institute, however, indicated last autumn that an amount of up to 4.44 million  &ndash; £3.5 million &ndash; would be required to complete the re-erection of the pavilion. On the basis of value for money considerations I understand that the Department of Education and Science is not willing to commit further funds to the institute and following further appraisal of the project that Department remains firmly of view that public expenditure in excess of 2.54 million would not represent value for money.</P>
      <P>In the light of this decision by the Department of Education and Science and the absence of funds from any other source it appears that no option remains open to the institute at this stage, but to disengage from the project.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122, 123 and 125 together.</P>
      <P>Decisions on the underwriting of insurance risks and the setting of premiums, including those for young drivers, are matters of judgment by individual private insurance companies and EU law prevents us from intervening directly in the matter. Motor insurance premiums are normally based on underwriting experience, including trends in the level, frequency and cost of claims, for particular risks and classes of risk. The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors to explain increases in premiums. These include the high cost of settling claims, High Court decisions that require insurers to strengthen reserves for claims arising in past years and increases in reinsurance prices they must pay.</P>
      <P>While increases in insurance prices may make it more difficult for people to afford insurance, I do not accept that this should lead to an increase in the number of motorists driving without insurance. The Motor Insurance Advisory Board has been charged with advising me on motor insurance costs and, in particular, examining the relationship between the incidence of claims and the premiums charged for various classes of policyholder identified by age and sex. The issue of the high cost of insurance for young drivers is especially being examined by the board. I expect to receive the final report of the board within a matter of weeks. In the light of its recommendations, the Government will consider what further action is appropriate and necessary having carried out a detailed analysis of the report.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board will achieve a reduction in the delivery costs of personal injury compensation, thus permitting a reduction in insurance costs to consumers.</P>

      <P>In accordance with EU law, we cannot require motor insurance companies to notify us of premium rates. Accordingly, our Department does not have authoritative statistics on premiums. Neither does it have such statistics that would allow comparison of accidents in Ireland and the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, research conducted for our Department has shown that insurance premiums are <Col N="185" /> high in Ireland compared to other EU countries, including the UK. The Deloitte and Touche Report of 1996 found this to be the case, but pointed to differences in compensation systems and to high transaction costs of claims in Ireland, particularly legal costs and the cost of expert witnesses. In relation to personal injury accidents and claims, the report indicated that Ireland has a large rural road network and a lower traffic density compared to the UK which increases the proportion of high speed accidents.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board will achieve a reduction in the delivery costs of personal injury compensation, thus permitting a reduction in insurance costs to consumers.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of the Department to process applications for work permits strictly in the order in which they are received. The processing time for work permit applications has risen due to the unprecedented number of applications received in the Department, especially in November and December 2001. In the last week of December alone, some 1950 applications arrived in the Department. This should be seen in the context of an economy which has slowed from the extraordinary growth rates achieved in previous years.</P>
      <P>Increases in staff resources and overtime facilitated the issue of over 36,000 work permits in the year 2001, compared to 18,000 in the previous year. The Department is continuing to examine options for significantly reducing the processing time for the issue of work permits. The question of the appropriate level of resources for the work permits section will be reviewed again in the light of the experience with the new arrangements for consideration of applications involving prior engagement by employers with the placement services in FÁS.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 131 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 2,027 hectares of broadleaves were grant aided by my Department in 2000. This figure represents the planted area of commercial broadleaves and is equivalent to 12.9% of total planting. However, as I indicated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 57 of 11 October 2001 the data does not include broadleaves planted <Col N="187" /> near rivers, roads and scenic areas. When these factors are taken into account the target of 20% for broadleaf planting was met in 2000.</P>
    <P>Within the broadleaf figure for 2000, in absolute terms, the level of commercial broadleaves grant aided increased over 1999. However, in percentage terms there was a decrease. This was mainly due to the non-availability of sufficient land suitable for broadleaves. While the availability of suitable land may fluctuate from year to year it is expected that the recent increase in premium levels will lead to planting figures approaching targets while also making better quality land available.</P>
    <P>I am fully committed to achieving a 30% broadleaf target by 2006. I propose commencing a review later this year which will examine the factors necessary to meet this target as outlined in the CAP rural development plan 2000-2006.</P>

The boards are also statutorily obliged to have regard to the particular role and contribution of angling clubs and associations in the sustainable management and development to the public benefit of State, public and other inland fisheries in their fisheries regime. I am asking the South-Western Regional Fisheries Board to contact the Deputy directly in this matter with a view to providing him with information in relation to the specific fisheries in question.</P>

      <Quest>the aims and objectives of the expert task force on transport logistics in connection with commercial seaports; if the task force will examine the potential for the development of port estates and his proposed strategic study of the greater Dublin Bay, including Dublin Port; the progress made to date by each of those committees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Task Force on Transport Logistics in connection with ports was established under the chairmanship of Dr. John Mangan to examine the potential and prospect for increasing the volume of port traffic which is transported by rail and the transfer of port generated freight traffic from road to rail including the development of rail head facilities at existing ports; for transport of freight across transport modes by night &ndash; off peak; traffic diversion including, by rail, by pipeline, including relocation of oil tank farms, and to other less congested ports outside Dublin; and to identify other imaginative proposals to reduce congestion and make port access-egress more efficient cost effective options for the movement of port related traffic through Dublin and the possibility for transfer of non essential activities away from the commercial sector.</P>
      <P>The chairman has advised that the task force has completed its deliberations and expects to present its report to me in early February 2002.</P>
      <P>I also appointed Mr. Paul Tansey, as chairman of an expert task force to advise me on the potential for the development of port estates at commercial harbours operating under the Harbours Act, 1946 and Harbours Act, 1996 and 2000.</P>

    <P>The group has been requested to examine the potential for imaginative use of available port estates, optimal development of facilities, including multi-user facilities to create capital for investment in port related activity or income streams to support port operations; reclamation opportunities to underpin the creation of <Col N="204" /> development opportunities for port related or other beneficial purposes; the scope for public private partnership venture options and development of the State foreshore within or adjoining the jurisdiction of the port to generate capital funding for port investment.</P>
    <P>The task force on the development of port estates at commercial harbours has met on ten occasions and an 11th meeting is scheduled for 20 February 2002.</P>
    <P>The steering group responsible for the strategic study of the greater Dublin Bay, including Dublin Port is currently developing terms of reference for my approval in consultation with other Departments directly concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the International Transport Workers' Federation's concerns about the treatment of crews on vessels operating under flags of convenience.</P>
      <P>All merchant vessels of any significant size must be registered. There are over 140 ship registers in operation world-wide. Ship registers impose obligations on ship owners regarding maintenance, crewing standards and certification of those matters by the flag state or inspection bodies duly authorised by the flag state.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the practice of using &ldquo;flags of convenience&rdquo;, involving what is perceived as lenient regulatory requirements, is still permissible under international law.</P>
      <P>Foreign registered vessels using Irish ports are inspected regularly by the Marine survey office of my Department in the exercise of Ireland's port state control obligations. These inspections are aimed at ensuring that such vessels are maintained and operated in compliance with international safety standards laid down by the International Maritime Organisation &ndash; IMO &ndash; and, in relation to seafarers' social conditions, by the International Labour Organisation's &ndash; ILO &ndash; maritime conventions, together with relevant EU initiatives in the maritime area. Deficiencies identified are brought to the attention of the owner and flag state administration, and may have to be rectified before the ship continues its journey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department is currently actively addressing the strategic and operational aspects of delivery of its maritime safety regulatory services, including port state control. A detailed review of the services was commissioned in 1999 and the main recommendations of the report of the review, which was completed in October 2000, are now being implemented. The new Maritime Safety Directorate will be operational early this year and an additional ten vessel surveyors are currently being recruited to the marine survey <Col N="205" /> office, which will form an integral part of the new directorate.</P>
    <P>Ireland participates in IMO and ILO discussions on seafarers' welfare, supporting proposals aimed at improving their terms and conditions of employment. Maritime safety standards will be further augmented this year with the implementation of two EU Council directives which deal respectively with the organisation of working time for seafarers and with the enforcement through inspections of provisions in respect of seafarers' hours of work on board vessels calling at community ports.</P>
    <P>Ireland will continue to support all efforts to enhance working conditions for seafarers on board flags of convenience and indeed all vessels and will continue to enforce safety and operational standards through the port state control framework.</P>

The overall district quota will be set by reference to the scientific advice for stocks in the catchments and other relevant factors. Depending on the state of stocks the quota for each district will be set to deliver a percentage reduction over catches in recent years. The quota will be administered and enforced by the regional fisheries boards through the tagging scheme. I have mandated the chief executives of the fisheries boards to finalise the detailed practical arrangements for the operation of the quota scheme as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Irish Lights &ndash; CIL &ndash; is the general lighthouse authority &ndash; GLA &ndash; responsible for providing and maintaining aids to navigation throughout the 32 counties of Ireland and its adjacent seas and islands. They are one of the three general lighthouse authorities, GLAs, for Britain and Ireland, all of which are financed out of the general lighthouse fund. The other two GLAs are Trinity House for England and Wales and the Northern Lighthouse Board for Scotland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioners of Irish Lights is a statutory body which derives its origin from the Port of Dublin Act, 1786. The total membership of the CIL board is 21, consisting of 17 elected members, the Lord Mayor of Dublin <i>ex officio</i> and three representatives of Dublin Corporation, now known as Dublin City Council. The Act provides that, where a vacancy occurs in the number of elected members, the remaining members shall elect a successor. In the case of the three Dublin <Col N="208" /> City Council, members' successors are elected by the City Council.</P>
    <P>Provision was made in the international agreement establishing North-South implementation bodies, which was concluded by the UK and Irish Governments on 8 March 1999, for the establishment of a body for aquaculture and marine matters to be known as the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission (FCILC). Sections 36, 37, 38(2) and the first part of the table to section 38 of the British-Irish Agreement Act provide for the transfer of the lights functions to the FCILC. These sections have not been brought into force and they cannot be commenced until such time as amendments are made to the UK Merchant Shipping Act, 1995, which would enable CIL to be dissolved and its functions transferred to the new body. In the meantime, CIL retains its existing functions and its board remains in place.</P>
    <P>At the NSMC institutional meeting on 17 December 2001, the council noted the work undertaken and the complexities that have arisen in terms of pursuing a transfer of the existing functions of the Commissioners of Irish Lights to the Lights Agency. It agreed that officials should review the matter further and offer advice to the next meeting of the council in institutional format.</P>

      <P>The recently announced premium increases applied to those who planted between 1993 and 1999 and who did not qualify for the increases announced in March 2000. While overall increases averaged 30%, individual increases varied considerably because of a number of factors, such as land classification and categorisation. The lowest percentage increase, approximately 14%, applied in respect of afforestation on unenclosed land, such as had been undertaken by the person in question. The correct increase was paid in his case.</P>

      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, 25.4 million has been allocated to marine tourism, and targeted particularly at improving marine access infrastructure such as marinas, berths and slipways. This funding will be made available through the marine tourism grants scheme which will be implemented by my Department as part of the two regional operational programmes. Under the marine tourism grants scheme, funding will be available for feasibility studies in respect of marine access infrastructural projects.</P>
      <P>In order to initiate the marine tourism grants scheme, my Department has already announced the first call for applications and I intend to formally launch the scheme within the coming week. Following the launch, formal application forms and guidelines will be made available by my Department to all parties who have expressed an interest in the scheme, including those in Carrowmore-Lacken, Ballina, County Mayo. Once the grants scheme is in place and a formal application received from the promoters of proposed projects, they will be assessed in accordance with the procedures laid down under the scheme.</P>

      <P>Some £2.5 million or 3.174 million was made available to the shellfish production sector under the shellfish remedial package. The scheme was announced in budget 2001 and launched in Bantry on 12 January 2001 by the Minister of State, Deputy Hugh Byrne. The launch received wide media coverage in both the national and local press and radio and television. Details regarding the objectives of the scheme and how to apply were advertised by BIM, which administered the package on behalf of the Department, in<i> The Kerryman</i> and <i>The Connaught Tribune</i> of 19 January 2001 and the <i>Southern Star</i> of 20 January 2001. Details were also published in BIM's Aquaculture Newsletter No. 36 and Aquaculture Ireland.</P>
      <P>A total of 80 applications were received by BIM. Having assessed all applications in accordance with the criteria of the scheme, funding was approved in respect of 43 applications. Details of approved applications are at Table 1 while Table 2 provides details of grant aid relating to Killary-based applicants.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware I have granted a petroleum lease under the Petroleum and Other Minerals Act, 1960 demising the petroleum in the Corrib Field to Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited and its partners Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited and Marathon International Petroleum (Hibernia) Limited and to which I attached, in agreement with the Corrib Group certain covenants, conditions and subsidiary agreements as I considered proper or desirable in the public interest, consistent with good industry practice and in accordance with other relevant laws.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to release a copy of the petroleum lease. This document is commercially sensitive and must remain confidential between me and the lessees.</P>
      <P>The petroleum lease granted by me was in accordance with my Department's licensing terms for offshore oil and gas exploration and development, 1992, which require that when a commercial discovery has been established it will be the duty of an exploration authorisation holder to apply to me for a petroleum lease with a view to the development of the field.</P>
      <P>Under the lease no development can take place. Under the terms of the lease the lessees are not permitted to commence development of the field until a plan of development accompanied by an environmental impact statement is approved by me and all other authorisations, including planning permission for the terminal, are in place.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that a plan of development accompanied by an environmental impact statement has been submitted to me and is currently under consideration in my Department.</P>

      <P>Ireland is a party to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, as amended in 1995 &ndash; the STCW Convention. This convention is an international, worldwide agreement involving over 100 countries that establishes common international standards of training, certification and watchkeeping for seafarers. It comes into effect on 1 February 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's certification structure, including <Col N="215" /> course entry requirements, the setting of course syllabi, the organisational structure and performance of our nautical colleges and the examination system administered by my Department, have all been subjected to very thorough scrutiny by a team of international experts appointed by the international maritime organisation. This has resulted in Ireland being included in the &ldquo;White List&rdquo; of countries deemed to fully satisfy all STCW requirements.</P>
    <P>I am advised that officials in my Department have received a very small number of queries in relation to the continued validity of existing certificates of competency with the introduction of the new regime. The new certification standards will result in some adjustments to the sea area and tonnage limits specified on Irish certificates but in all cases the entitlements which holders of current certificates enjoy will be fully maintained.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department have explained and clarified these matters to those seafarers who have raised the issue directly with them. My officials will be pleased to assist seafarers or their representative organisations if any further clarification is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU has played an active role in addressing the grave environmental and humanitarian consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. It has also been instrumental in helping to finance an approach which has led to the closure of Chernobyl and made more secure the generators which remain there. The EU's policy has been <Col N="217" /> developed in the framework of an overall reform of the energy sector in Ukraine.</P>
      <P>The nuclear reactor destroyed in the accident at Chernobyl on 26 April 1986 was enclosed in a shelter or sarcophagus hastily built by the former Soviet authorities after the accident. Through age and deterioration, it had become unstable and required urgent repair and partial reconstruction. At the Denver Summit, in June 1997, the G7 and the European Commission endorsed the setting up of a multilateral funding mechanism to assist Ukraine in making the existing shelter safe and environmentally stable. The total cost of this shelter implementation plan is approximately US$750 million. The EU has so far provided 90.5 million for the shelter fund, including 40 million in 2001.</P>
      <P>Ukraine had posited the closure of Chernobyl on international assistance for completing two other nuclear power stations &ndash; known as K2 and R4 &ndash; Khmelnitsky and Rivne. The EU provided financial assistance in this regard, including through a loan financing package provided by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The closure of the last nuclear power generating unit at the Chernobyl site was announced by the Ukraine Government in December 2000.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the EU intends to provide an additional 20 million to ensure that adequate fuel is available for local needs and to address the social impact of the closure of Chernobyl.</P>
      <P>At a bilateral level also, of course, Ireland has been active in addressing the consequences of Chernobyl, including through a contribution to the shelter fund over and above our share of the EU contribution.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163, 166 and 169 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government was appalled by the murder of Mr. Eluay on 11 November. We responded immediately by working with our EU partners on <Col N="218" /> the drafting of a joint declaration which was issued by the Presidency on behalf of the Union. In this declaration, we urged the Indonesian authorities to clarify the circumstances of Mr. Eluay's murder and to act urgently to bring the perpetrators to justice. We also called for the full implementation of the special autonomy law.</P>
    <P>The EU continues to raise its concerns about the situation in Irian Jaya with the Indonesian authorities. We have previously called on, and encouraged the Indonesian Government to make further urgent efforts to address, and resolve peacefully the various conflicts in Indonesia, including in Irian Jaya. EU Heads of Mission in Jakarta plan to undertake a factfinding mission to the province in the near future to evaluate at first hand the situation there.</P>

      <P>There have been a number of improvements in the situation in Sri Lanka recently. The Sri Lankan Government embargo against the Tamil areas has been lifted and the Tamil Tigers de-proscribed. The Tamil Tigers declared a cessation of hostilities just before Christmas. The Sri Lankan Government has responded positively to this cessation. There are also positive signs from both sides with regard to the release of prisoners.</P>
      <P>The Government has been monitoring the situation closely with our EU partners. We fully support the mediation efforts of the Norwegian Government and will consider any request to assist the peace process.</P>

      <P>I have noted the developments referred to by the Deputy in relation to the Act of Free Choice of 1969. The Government believes that the best way to address the fundamental causes of tension in Irian Jaya is to follow an approach aimed at promoting greater decentralisation and autonomy. This should be based on dialogue and negotiation between the local representatives and the authorities in Jakarta. The Indonesian authorities must exercise full and proper control over the security forces in Irian Jaya, ensure that the human rights violations of which they are accused are investigated, and the perpetrators prosecuted, and that such abuses are brought to an end.</P>

      <P>The Consulate General in Boston has met with the person in question on a number of occasions over the last year and has been assisting him to obtain legal representation. These efforts have been taking place against the background where the individual concerned has no longer an entitlement to State-appointed representation and where it is necessary, therefore, to identify a lawyer who is willing to take on the case on a <i>pro bono</i> basis.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks, following efforts from the Consulate General, a lawyer has agreed to assist, on an informal basis, with the next step in the legal process. The Consulate General will remain in contact with the person in question and will continue to provide all possible consular assistance for him.</P>

      <P>The Government attaches great importance to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which is central to the protection and promotion of children's rights on a global level. The issue of child soldiers is of particular concern and Ireland has strongly supported international efforts to stop their use. In particular, Ireland has actively supported the Office of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General for Children and Armed Conflict.</P>
      <P>Ireland has joined an informal group known as the Friends of the Special Representative, which includes 11 other EU member states and the European Commission as well as Canada, Japan, Malaysia, India and Kenya. The aim of the group of friends is to support the work of the special representative and to promote measures for the protection of children in armed conflict.</P>
      <P>Ireland has signed the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict. The ratification of the optional protocol to the convention is the subject of active consideration by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Defence. This consideration includes a review of domestic legislation which may require amendment to enable ratification to proceed.</P>

      <P>The ongoing ethnic and religious tensions, and outbursts of violence in the Indonesian province of Maluku, are a matter of concern to the Govern<Col N="221" /> ment. Not only have they given rise to real human suffering and humanitarian problems in the region, making reconciliation and reconstruction very difficult, but they impact on the establishment of law and order, democracy and human rights in Indonesia as a whole. The increased numbers of Lahskar Jihad militias in Maluku exacerbate this problem, fuelling religious hatred and further complicating efforts at reaching a peaceful resolution of the conflict there.</P>
      <P>Ireland's EU partners widely share our concerns, and the EU's views on this issue have been clearly made known to the Indonesian authorities. The EU has regularly called on the Indonesian Government to make urgent efforts to address and resolve peacefully the country's internal conflicts, whether separatist or sectarian in character. The EU has underlined that the only viable way to guarantee the territorial integrity of Indonesia is for the Government to engage in a genuine dialogue with the provinces, in order to tackle the root causes of the violence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The protest along the route to Holy Cross Girls' Primary School in Ardoyne, which started in late June 2001, resumed the following September and continued for a further 12 weeks, with appalling sectarian abuse and physical intimidation being directed at the school children and their parents throughout.</P>
      <P>On Friday 23 November, the Glenbryn residents announced a suspension of their protest following a series of meetings between the First and Deputy First Ministers and representatives of the protesters and the Ardoyne parents. These meetings, together with social, economic and other measures offered by the Executive, helped to create the context for a discontinuation of the protest. A face to face meeting between the parents and protesters was held at Belfast City Hall on 25 November to improve the atmosphere and level of mutual understanding. The following day the Holy Cross pupils made their way to and from school without protest for the first time in 12 weeks. This period of calm continued up to the Christmas school break.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, on Wednesday, 9 January last, riot<Col N="223" /> ing broke out near the school and the disturbances quickly spread to other surrounding areas. Trouble continued to flare throughout the following day, leading to the closure for the day of Holy Cross School, amid fears that the violence would lead to a resumption of the Glenbryn residents' protest. Thankfully, however, this has not happened to date.</P>
    <P>Several important points need to be made about the dreadful situation in Ardoyne in the latter half of 2001 and earlier this month. The single most urgent concern remains the safety and well being of the school children; their right to education must be safeguarded and every effort must be made to ensure that they never again become the target of such intimidation.</P>
    <P>It is also clear that the blockade and the tensions surrounding it were deeply wounding to all sides and against the best interests of all of the residents of the area. While a calm of sorts has emerged, the situation remains tense. Every effort must be made to strengthen the fragile peace that currently exists.</P>
    <P>However, tensions remain high in the wider north Belfast area. There have been vicious and ongoing acts of sectarian violence and intimidation, including the shocking murder of postman Daniel McColgan in Rathcoole and the death threats against other workers, including teachers. It appears these threats have since been rescinded. However, the fact remains that the threats represented a direct and very disturbing assault on workers and on the wider community. The paramilitaries responsible for the murder of Mr. McColgan and for the death threats against his colleagues and other workers were rightly rejected by the people who turned out in large numbers at a number of anti-sectarianism rallies on 18 January. The trades union movement is to be commended for organising these rallies.</P>
    <P>Against the background of a very limited number of arrests, the Taoiseach has recently called on the police to take tougher action against those loyalist paramilitaries who are responsible for attacks in North Belfast. I have also raised this matter personally with the Secretary of State Dr. Reid. The community needs and deserves the assurance of effective action against both the organisers and the perpetrators of the awful sectarian violence we have witnessed over the past year.</P>
    <P>Within this disturbing context, it is imperative that the progress made in easing tensions before Christmas in and around the locality of Holy Cross school be sustained and developed in the weeks ahead.</P>
    <P>I have asked my officials &ndash; who have been in sustained contact with those directly involved in the Holy Cross situation and with political and community leaders in North Belfast &ndash; to continue to monitor the situation there closely. My officials have also raised the issue of loyalist paramilitary violence in the North Belfast area with the British authorities on an ongoing basis <Col N="224" /> through the framework of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in recent weeks. Moreover, officials from both sides are scheduled to meet to discuss this and other issues this week.</P>

      <P>Representations have been made to me in relation to the matter raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>My Department is considering a number of options to improve the service to persons resident in Northern Ireland, including the possibility of opening a Passport Office there and the introduction of a &lsquo;Passport Express' type service. While the former is under consideration, the immediate focus is on the latter option. In this regard, discussions are ongoing between representatives of my Department, An Post and Consignia, the UK Postal Authority. If these discussions are successfully concluded, I hope an express service for the residents of Northern Ireland might be introduced in the coming months, ideally in advance of the peak summer season.</P>
      <P>Passport Express, which in this jurisdiction is operated jointly between my Department and An Post, provides a ten working day postal return service to applicants. Since its introduction in 1995, this service has been a great success and now accounts for more than 68% of total passport applications made in Ireland. Of the total of 394,637 applications received last year, more than 269,000 were made by Passport Express.</P>
      <P>The number of passport applications received from persons resident in Northern Ireland has been increasing in recent years. A total of 23,060 applications were made in 2001. To improve the service to the public, the Passport Office has ecently introduced a number of measures including a Lo Call number &ndash; Telephone 0845 8504321 &ndash; through which it may be contacted by persons resident in Northern Ireland; the provision of passport information on the Department's website www.irlgov.ie/iveagh; and the establishment of an e-mail query and passport application form request service available at passport@iveagh.irlgov.ie. The anticipated addition of an express postal service in Northern Ireland will be of considerable benefit to applicants from that jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>The Government remains deeply concerned at the poor human rights situation in Zimbabwe. With our European Union partners, we have consistently called upon the government of Zimbabwe to put an end to the violence and intimidation, and to ensure full respect for democratic principles, human rights, and the rule of law.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the EU has been engaged in a dialogue with the Zimbabwean government since March 2001. The General Affairs Council on 25 June 2001 noted the lack of substantial progress in the dialogue and stressed the need for rapid and tangible results in the following five areas: an end to political violence; an invitation to the EU to support and observe coming elections; concrete action to protect the freedom of the mass media; independence of the judiciary; and an end to the illegal occupation of properties.</P>
      <P>At the General Affairs Council on 29 October 2001, my EU colleagues and I noted that Zimbabwe had made no visible progress on these issues and we therefore decided to intensify discussions with Zimbabwe by launching the consultation procedure provided for in Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. Article 96 is invoked in cases where a party to the agreement is considered to have failed to respect human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law. The European Council meeting in Laeken in December made a pressing appeal to the Zimbabwean Government to take all the action needed to improve the situation immediately, particularly with a view to the Article 96 consultations.</P>
      <P>On 11 January, the EU and Zimbabwe met in Brussels for consultations on the five areas of concern outlined by the General Affairs Council on 25 June. The Zimbabwean delegation, which included Minister for Foreign Affairs Mudenge, expressed a willingness to go some way towards meeting the EU concerns, which Minister Mudenge later confirmed in writing. However, serious violations of human rights have continued to occur in the intervening period and little progress has been made in allowing access for international observers and the media.</P>
      <P>At the General Affairs Council on 28 January, my EU colleagues and I decided that we would close the Article 96 consultations and implement targeted sanctions if: the Government of Zimbabwe prevents the deployment of an EU observation mission starting by 3 February 2002, or if it later prevents the mission from operating effectively; likewise, if the Government of Zimbabwe prevents the international media from having free access to cover the election; or there is a serious deterioration in the situation on the ground, in terms of worsening of the human rights situation or attacks on the opposition; or the election is assessed as not being free and fair.</P>

      <P>My Department has obtained the following clarification from the Canadian authorities on the aspect of Canadian immigration procedures raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Permanent residents of Canada who have been outside Canada for six months or more in any 12 month period must demonstrate at a Canadian port of entry that they have not abandoned residence in Canada. This requirement applies whether the absence has been a series of trips or one extended absence from Canada.</P>
      <P>To facilitate re-entry to Canada, a person should obtain a returning residence permit which can be issued at a Canadian visa office abroad. An application for a returning residence permit will require the presentation of documentation explaining the absence, such as a contract showing employment by a Canadian company abroad, school certificates if studying abroad, medical certificates indicating extended treatment or hospitalisation outside Canada, and/or documentation confirming that the individual has maintained ties to Canada, such as paying taxes. Further information regarding this matter is available on the following internet address www.canada.org.uk.</P>
      <P>Application forms for a returning residence permit can be obtained by post from the Canadian High Commission, Immigration Section, 38 Grosvenor Street, London W1K 4 AA, United Kingdom with the code RRP marked in the top left hand corner of the envelope. The telephone and fax numbers from Ireland for the Immigration Section are 00 44 20 7258 6600 and 00 44 20 7258 6506 respectively. The processing fee for a returning residence permit is Canadian $75 which is non-refundable regardless of the outcome of an application.</P>

      <P>The Government remains fully committed to supporting the vulnerable people of Afghanistan. This includes the ongoing provision of emergency humanitarian assistance and support for the process of national reconstruction in that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are well over five million people in Afghanistan who still require humanitarian assistance. The need for an effective strategy to provide this assistance is borne out by the images we have witnessed of hunger in the Hindu Kush <Col N="229" /> region and by the fact that a fourth successive year of drought is already being predicted.</P>
    <P>The World Food Programme, whose work is being supported by the Government, delivered 116,000 tonnes of food aid into Afghanistan during December and is now making a determined effort to access those people who may remain at risk in isolated areas or due to localised conflict.</P>
    <P>The crisis in the village of Bonawash in the Zarah district at the foot of the Hindu Kush mountains has been addressed jointly by the WFP and the International Rescue Committee, which the Government also supports. Both organisations have joined forces in effecting the delivery of emergency food aid. WFP sent a special team to Zarah to see what aid was needed and how best to provide it while IRC sent doctors to attend to those at risk. Some 50 locally-employed workers used 400 donkeys to deliver these essential supplies along dangerous mountain terrain. An initial distribution of 1,400 tonnes of food aid took place in the Zarah district on 6 January and this is being augmented so that each person will have enough food to survive the harsh winter. WFP is also deploying additional helicopters to help respond to such acute food shortages in the more remote highland areas.</P>
    <P>During 2001, a total of 5.08 million was provided by the Government in official humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan on behalf of the Irish people. Earlier this month, at the International Conference on Reconstruction Assistance to Afghanistan in Tokyo, I pledged a further 12 million in reconstruction assistance to that country over the coming three years. This pledge is in addition to our ongoing emergency relief and recovery assistance. The combination of our reconstruction and humanitarian commitments means that our support for Afghanistan during 2002 will at least equal, and likely exceed, that provided last year. While at the conference, I had a meeting with the Chairman of the Interim Administration of Afghanistan, Mr. Hamid Karzai, at which I reiterated Ireland's continued commitment to assisting the Afghan people.</P>
    <P>Along with other donors in Tokyo, we reiterated the need for a strong complementarity between humanitarian assistance, recovery, reconstruction and development in Afghanistan. Ireland Aid officials will carry out an assessment mission to Afghanistan and neighbouring Pakistan in early February. The Government will continue to work closely with Irish NGOs, the UN, ICRC and our other implementing partners in support of the Afghan people.</P>

      <P>In replying to the Deputy I would like to put in context the long-term Government support for renewable energy in a range of technologies such as wind, landfill gas and small scale hydro. In the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy, which I published in September 1999, I set a target of an additional 500MW of renewable energy up to the end of 2005. Government support for renewable energy technologies in the form of Alternative Energy Requirement (AER) competitions has been manifest over the past number of years. Next week I will be announcing the winning bidders in the fifth Alternative Energy Requirement competition (AER5). All winning projects already have full planning permission and, together with the market access they are in a position to avail of under AER5, they will be proceeding to build renewable generating stations over the next year or two. I have also given a commitment to the renewable energy industry that AER6 will follow on quickly.</P>
      <P>I have pursued a policy of positive support for renewable energy technologies and particularly wind energy. To date this has concentrated on on-shore projects.</P>
      <P>In relation to offshore development there are a number of developers who have expressed interest in offshore wind projects. However, a number of major issues arise and require research before final decisions can be made. These include the following: assessment of the capacity of the electricity grid system to accept large volumes of electricity generated by wind farms &ndash; the Commission for Electricity Regulation has just recently announced the commissioning of a comprehensive study of this issue which is expected to be completed in six months; a study of the costs associated with offshore wind developments in Irish conditions &ndash; some work has already been carried out in a study completed by Kirk, McClure, Morton entitled, Assessment of Offshore Wind Resources in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and this further study will allow a comparison of the cost of offshore generated electricity against the known costs of onshore generated electricity; costs of connections of windfarms of such substantial capacity &ndash; this issue will need to examined by Eirgrid and regulated by the Commission for Electricity Regulation; and the need to examine and evaluate the support mechanisms in place for offshore projects in other European countries such as Denmark and Holland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Irish Energy Centre, and in consultation with other relevant bodies and agencies, is undertaking the necessary work to develop a consultation document which will be put out to public consultation. An appropriate strategy will then be brought to Government for decision. The Deputy should be aware that, should it be decided that supports are desirable either in terms of market support or a direct grant in respect of connection costs to any <Col N="232" /> particular project, such supports would be subject to state aids and competition rules.</P>
    <P>In relation to the costs of connection to the electricity grid the position for any developer, including Eirtricity, is that the terms for connections to and use of the transmission or distribution systems are addressed in Section 39 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 (No. 23 of 1999). The cost of any connection to the electricity network is a matter for discussion between Eirgrid and the customer requesting the service in the first instance. In the event of a dispute regarding the making of an offer, the terms offered or the proposed charges the customer may seek the intervention of the Commission for Electricity Regulation and Eirgrid is bound by the Commission's determination.</P>

Under the national development plan 2000-2006, the figure allocated to telecommunications initiatives was 200 million. A first call for proposals was run in 2000 and on foot of submissions received, I signed nine contracts at the beginning of last year which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of August 2001 I announced a second call for proposals. The deadline for receipt of proposals was 19 October 2001. In all 31 proposals have been received. The proposals are being independently evaluated according to the criteria set out in the invitation to tender document. It is expected that the evaluation committee will make formal recommendations early this year. Details of these programmes are available on the Internet at www.ndpcomms.gov.ie</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to public transport, it is not possible to provide a breakdown of the expenditure on a constituency-by-constituency basis. Apart from meeting general transport objectives, a well functioning nationwide public transport infrastructure is vital for making optimal use of road infrastructure, minimising the impact on the environment of transport, promoting balanced regional development and making transport as widely accessible as possible. Most of the projects being undertaken, therefore, will provide benefits across constituency or county borders.</P>
      <P>During 2001, Dublin Bus ordered and received delivery of 56 replacement buses and Bus Éireann ordered and received delivery of 70 buses. Monasterevin Station was completed in 2001 at a cost of 2.54 million as was Tralee Bus Station. Listing of projects completed or commenced in 2001 does not give a full picture of the considerable investment being made by this Government under the national development plan as a number of the projects commenced in 2000 will take a number of years to complete. The plan, designed to span the years 2000 to 2006, will see an investment of 2.8 billion in public transport projects throughout the State.</P>
      <P>For the Deputy's benefit the major projects under way since 2000 include the following: delivery of 38 DART railcars which will serve to increase DART capacity by approximately 50%; commencement of work on the redevelopment of Heuston Station to accommodate additional train paths by reorganising rail approaches to the station and the provision of additional platforms &ndash; this project is to take approximately 18 months and will allow the more efficient use of facilities at the station and allow it to accommodate more trains; design work on the Kildare corridor; design and costing work on the DASH, Dublin Area Suburban Enhancement; 80 diesel railcars ordered for delivery in 2002/3, 60 from NDP funds and 20 from Iarnród Éireann's own resources; construction of a new railcar depot in Drogheda to commence shortly; tenders for the supply of up to 66 new mainline rail carriages being examined by Iarnród Éireann with a decision shortly; and 281 new buses have been delivered to Bus Átha Cliath to date under the NDP to provide new and additional bus services in the Dublin area &ndash; these buses have increased capacity on routes and increased frequency of services in peak hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All new BÁC buses delivered in 2000 and 2001 <Col N="234" /> are low floor and wheelchair accessible. Nine quality bus corridors are now in operation &ndash; Malahide, Lucan, Stillorgan, Finglas, north Clondalkin, Rathfarnham, Tallaght, Blanchardstown and Swords. Plans are under way to construct a new bus garage for over 200 buses at Harristown in north Dublin.</P>
    <P>Bus Éireann has taken delivery of 218 new buses to date under the NDP. The purchase of these new buses has led to a very substantial improvement in services increasing peak capacity by 50% on all main corridors into Dublin and regeneration of public transport services in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford with increase in departures up by 25% to 50%. New bus stations in Athlone and Skibbereen are nearing completion. Bus Áras is undergoing a major refurbishment programme.</P>
    <P>In November 2001 the National Research Network HEANet &ndash; www.heanet.ie &ndash; completed the next generation internet project which upgrades the level of international telecommunications capacity available to researchers and third level institutions throughout the State. This project received 2,993,000; 2000 &ndash; 964,000; 2001 2,029,000) in support from the information society fund through the Department of Public Enterprise and 7 x 155 megabytes per second units of capacity purchased by the State as part of the international connectivity project.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 193, 202 and 218 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Dáil Questions Nos. 54, 84 and 121 on 27 November 2001 in which I detailed the Government's activities in pursuit of its campaign against Sellafield and the nature of its legal action against the UK in regard to the MOX plant under both the OSPAR convention and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea &ndash; UNCLOS.</P>
      <P>In my reply to those questions, I mentioned, in the context of the legal action under UNCLOS, that Ireland had requested the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea &ndash; ITLOS &ndash; to order a legally-binding injunction on the UK to stop the commissioning of the MOX plant and associated shipments of nuclear material and that the outcome of the ITLOS Hearing held on 9 November 2001 in that regard would be known on 3 December 2001. On 3 December 2001, ITLOS duly delivered its judgment. While ITLOS did not agree to the implementation of the injunction measures requested by Ireland, it did decide that UNCLOS has jurisdiction in relation to Ireland's case and that Ireland has rights under UNCLOS to seek to protect the marine environment of the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>The ITLOS judgment order also imposed obligations of cooperation on the UK <i>vis-à-vis</i> exchange of information and construction of appropriate measures to prevent pollution of the marine environment pending the hearing of the substantive case by an arbitration tribunal to be established under UNCLOS. It is anticipated that the hearing of the substantive case by an arbitration tribunal under UNCLOS will take place in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the OSPAR arbitration pro<Col N="236" /> ceedings, both parties have now agreed on the membership and rules of procedure for this tribunal. Oral hearings in this case will take place this coming autumn. Although these two separate legal actions give us much scope for redress on the MOX issue, the Government has not ruled out taking other actions under appropriate law. In this context, an action under EU law is a possibility but at this stage consideration of possible legal action by Ireland on this front is not yet complete.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the concerns of the Irish public about Sellafield and the effective expansion of the Sellafield operations arising from the commissioning of the MOX plant. I assure the Deputies and the House that the Government is fully committed to its campaign to bring about the complete cessation of activities at Sellafield.</P>

      <Quest>the measures she has taken since 1997 to improve the public transport systems in the Dublin area with particular reference to the DART, suburban rail, city bus services, Luas and the Metro; the progress which has been made; her plans in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to inform the Deputy that major progress has been made in improving the public transport system in the greater Dublin area since 1997. With the assistance of the EU and Exchequer funding, Bus Átha Cliath has purchased a total of 431 new buses to expand the fleet and to replace older and more inefficient buses. Taking into account the new buses and subcontracting, the bus fleet has increased by more than 25%.</P>
      <P>All buses purchased since 2000 are low floor and wheelchair accessible. These buses have not only improved the quality and reliability of the bus service but have also increased the capacity on routes and increased the frequency during peak hours. The nine quality bus corridors now in operation around the city have helped to reduce the bus journey times by up to 40% in some cases. The Nitelink has proved to be an outstanding success and is now available all year round.</P>
      <P>Commuters in the greater Dublin area are also benefiting from the enhanced services provided by Bus Éireann on all the main radial routes into Dublin, with buses leaving every 15 minutes during peak hours from towns like Navan and Drogheda.</P>
      <P>On the rail side, the Maynooth line was commissioned as a double track line in early 2000. A fleet of 20 new diesel railcars entered service on that line last August, increasing capacity 100% and providing an improved timetable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 38 new DART cars have been delivered; 26 are now in service with 12 more to join <Col N="237" /> them in the coming months. When all are in service, by June this year, they will increase the capacity of the DART by almost 50%. The first of the new fleet of 80 diesel railcars for use on the outer suburban routes will begin to arrive in June of this year. In preparation for the entry into service of additional rolling stock capacity, all platforms at outer suburban stations for train services into Connolly Station have been extended to cater for eight-car trains. Design work continues on the Kildare route project on the main Dublin to Cork railway line to increase substantially capacity for both commuters and mainline rail passengers on this route. A major programme of work has begun in Heuston Station, including the provision of additional platforms enabling it to handle additional mainline and suburban trains at peak times.</P>
    <P>Design work is also continuing on the DART upgrade project. This project is intended to increase frequency of trains through the bottleneck at Connolly Station at peak times. The Railway Procurement Agency &ndash; RPA &ndash; was established on 28 December 2001. The agency is an independent, statutory, State body and the body has had its first formal meeting and has taken over responsibility from CIE for the Luas and Metro systems for Dublin.</P>
    <P>Work on the construction of the Luas lines from Tallaght to Connolly Station and from Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green is well advanced and on target for completion in 2003; five trams have already been received and are undergoing testing at the depot at Red Cow. Construction of the depot at Sandyford has commenced and will be completed later this year. A private operator for the Luas system will be chosen in the coming weeks and recruitment of staff is expected to commence shortly thereafter.</P>
    <P>On 16 January 2002 the Government approved the commencement of the procurement process for the Dublin Metro system. The RPA will develop the system in two phases. I expect an announcement from the RPA in the coming weeks in relation to the formal launch of the procurement of phase 1, involving a line from Dublin Airport through the City Centre to Shanganagh, with a spur from Blanchardstown.</P>

      <P>The regulation of costs for Internet access is an operational matter for the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. I have no function in these matters. Following the introduction by the director of flat rate Internet access codes there is no regulatory impediment to <Col N="238" /> the introduction of universal flat rates for Internet access. Ultimately, it is a matter for industry players to offer flat rate Internet access.</P>
      <P>The ODTR is satisfied that the framework for LLU in Ireland is complete. In terms of effecting widespread access to the local loop, it is ultimately a matter for individual companies to apply for such access. However, it should be noted that the introduction of flat rate Internet access is not dependent on unbundling of the local loop.</P>
      <P>Low cost, high speed Internet access is a key element of the Government's communications policy. Under the National Development Plan, 2000 &ndash; 2006, 200 million of public funds have been earmarked to leverage investment in advance communications infrastructure and services. The focus of this investment will be to support investment in communications and electronic commerce infrastructure, systems and services in less developed areas.</P>
      <P>The plan has as one of its objectives &ldquo;the development of the Irish communications sector so that it ranks in the top decile of OECD countries in terms of service range, quality, availability and price.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The rural transport initiative &ndash; RTI &ndash; is being administered on behalf of my Department by Area Development Management &ndash; ADM. Some 0.25 million of the overall funding of 3.8 million for the RTI in 2002 will be required by them for the management of the initiative. The remainder will be allocated to the community groups who successfully applied for funding to provide transport services in various parts of the country. On 21 January last I announced the names of the successful applicants for funding under the initiative. Among the 19 community groups selected by ADM is Meath Accessible Transport, a consortium of community, statutory and voluntary organisations in the county. While administrative costs are an unavoidable cost of any enterprise I know that ADM are very anxious to ensure that the bulk of the funding awarded to each group will go to the provision of transport services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Capital allocations made to my Department for 2002, 2003 and 2004 are 503 million, 484 million and 511 million respectively. The following is the position in relation to capital funding in the transport, energy and communications sectors.</P>
      <P>The capital allocation provided to this Department in respect of public transport of 424 million, £334 million, in 2002 will be used to address the public transport deficit in both Dublin and at a regional level by implementing the programme of public transport projects set out in the national development plan. The work commenced in 2002 will continue through 2003 and 2004. These projects include: developing, extending and increasing the bus network in Dublin through the purchase of additional buses to increase passenger capacity and increase frequency of services; implementing the light rail network; developing the suburban rail network including the purchase of additional DART and diesel rail cars; provision of new stations at strategic locations and resignalling work at Connolly Station to allow greater frequency of trains; mainline rail investment in safety and renewal; bus and rail development in the greater Cork area; bus development in Limerick, Galway and Waterford; regional bus improvements; and pilot measures for rural public transport to encourage local or community based initiatives to provide bus services in rural areas.</P>
      <P>The amounts allocated for capital grant for the airports in 2002, 2003 and 2004 are 6 million, £4.73 million, 4.5 million, £3.54 million, and 4.7 million, £3.7 million, respectively. These allocations will aid in supporting the carrying out of infrastructural improvements and upgrades in safety-related equipment and facilities at the six regional airports, Donegal, Sligo, Knock, Galway, Kerry and Waterford.</P>
      <P>Capital funding of 70,000, £55,130, has been included in the Abridged Estimates for consultancies to be undertaken by my Department concerning Aer Lingus. A similar token estimate has been included for 2003.</P>
      <P>Funding will be provided from the capital allocation to my Department for the sustainable energy priority of the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme 2000-2006 as follows: 2002&ndash;4.5 million, £3.54 million; 2003&ndash;6.5 million, £5.12 million; 2004&ndash;6.25 million, £4.92 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This capital will be allocated to energy conservation research and development activities; an energy conservation initiative for pre-1980 housing-public sector buildings; facilitating the strategic reinforcement and upgrading of the elec<Col N="240" /> tricity network in order to redress the weaknesses and grid constraints to accommodate connection of renewable energy projects and to support the delivery of an additional 500 Mwe of renewable energy based electricity generating plant; and research and development in the renewable energy sector.</P>
    <P>A sum of 650,000, £511,920, has been provided in 2002 for capital expenditure for the Geological Survey of Ireland IT development. This allocation will be spent on the upgrading of GSI IT systems towards a full integrated system for GSI data management. Similar allocations of 655,000, £515,850, and 660,000, £519,790, have been provided to continue this work in 2003 and 2004. The GSI has responsibility for managing all aspects of the seabed survey. The survey involves using a variety of hydrographic, geological and geophysical techniques from specialist ships, the provision of the resulting data to clients and the exploitation of this data to maximise revenues and other major benefits to the State. A sum of 4.5 million, £3.54 million, has been allocated to this project in 2002 with allocations of 5.350 million, £4.21 million, and 4.606 million, £3.63 million, for 2003 and 2004.</P>
    <P>A sum of 44 million, £34.65 million, has been allocated in 2002 in the area of broadband interconnectivity to facilitate projects aimed at ensuring that this technology contributes significantly to social and economic development in Ireland. The allocations for 2003 and 2004 of 26 million, £20.48 million, and 26.8 million, £21.11 million, respectively will continue to provide for the rollout of broadband infrastructure in the regions.</P>
    <P>The capital allocation for 2002 of 28.690 million, £22.6 million, will be used for the purchase of property and provision of broadband infrastructure. An additional 1.96 million, £1.54 million, has been allocated for 2003 for the completion of this project.</P>
    <P>The RPII's capital allocation for 2002 is 215, 000, £169,330, which will be spent on additional instrumentation for the Dosimetry Service, upgrading of equipment for the radiation monitoring network, and general upgrading of laboratory equipment and computer facilities.</P>
    <P>The capital allocation for 2003 and 2004 is 226,000, £177,990, and 237,000, £186,650, respectively which will be generally allocated to the provision of additional equipment and instrumentation for the Institute's environmental, dosimetry and radon laboratories and the general upgrading of computer and office facilities.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, included in the capital allocation for my Department in 2002 is a provision of 700,000, £551,290, towards the cost of completing an extension of the main runway at Derry Airport. In 1999, my Department and the Northern Ireland authorities each made a contribution of approximately £1.53 million, 1.94 million, towards the cost of the runway extension in Derry. The proposal that the project be grant-aided was initially put forward by the Donegal <Col N="241" /> Enterprise Task Force as part of their response to the difficulties for employment in East Donegal arising from redundancies at the Fruit of the Loom factories. However the project is not yet complete and has suffered from cost increases arising from environmental issues. It is envisaged that my Department's contribution to the additional costs, that is, 700,000, £551,290, together with a matching contribution by the Northern Ireland authorities, will arise in the coming months.</P>
    <P>There is also a capital allocation contained in the administration budget for my Department. This allocation of 1.171 million, £922,240, in 2002 will provide for the purchase of equipment and associated consumables for the technical areas of my Department, mainly Met Éireann and the geological survey and also for the purchase of computer hardware and software, telecommunications equipment, general office equipment, computer consultancies and outsourced computer project costs. The decrease in capital allocation from 2002 to 2003 is mainly due to a reduction in the capital funding required for the Digital Hub project. All related property acquisitions are expected to be completed for this project in 2002.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the issue of providing a rail link to Navan. I intend shortly to commission a strategic rail study which will provide a framework for future Government decisions on rail development over the next 20 years. It can be expected that proposals, which would include a rail link to Navan, will be examined in the course of that study.</P>
    <P>The farm electrification grant scheme, FEGS, which forms part of my Department's capital allocation subsidises the installation of electricity supply to farms located in disadvantaged areas which are without supply or where supply is inadequate to facilitate their development and modernisation. The FEGS capital grant allocation for 2002, 2003 and 2004 is 150,000, £118,000, 216,000, £170,000, and 216,000, £170,000, respectively.</P>

      <P>I like to travel on the railway as often as my schedule allows to experience and observe first hand the level of service and safety. My most recent journey was by DART from Dublin to Malahide to open the Malahide Heritage Garden on 8 August 2001.</P>
      <P>Since taking office, I have also travelled on most inter-city services, including Sligo-Dublin, Athlone-Galway, Athlone-Ballina-Westport, Cork-Dublin, Mallow-Dublin and on several occasions I travelled on the Enterprise service to Belfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On each occasion, I found the journey to be very pleasant and while I am not qualified to expertly judge railway safety, I saw nothing that concerned me. This Government has invested some 368 million since 1999 in the improvement of the safety of Iarnród Éireann's infrastructure and safety management systems under the railway safety programme 1999-2003. This Government has also made significant investment in acquisition of new rolling stock, refurbishment of stations and improvement of other non-safety <Col N="243" /> related infrastructure. It is only reasonable then that an improvement in the level of safety and service on the Iarnród Éireann network should be expected by the users of those services.</P>
    <P>I have commissioned a number of safety audits of the Iarnród Éireann network since 1998 and published the report of the most recent audit in August of last year. The report concluded that Iarnród Éireann had made substantial progress in improving the safety of railway infrastructure since their first audit in 1998 and that the pace of improvement had increased since their previous audit in 2000. IRMS added that the hard issues of life expired infrastructure were being tackled effectively by Iarnród Éireann and that the result should be a reliable and maintainable railway in the long-term.</P>
    <P>I personally took great comfort from those remarks and I believe they confirm the value of the investment this Government has made and continues to make in the railways.</P>

      <P>The safety of the rolling stock in use on any part of the Iarnród Éireann network is an operational matter for that company and I have, therefore, no statutory function in the matter.</P>
      <P>I am advised by Iarnród Éireann that all rolling stock, including that utilised on the Dublin-Sligo line, operates within strict safety criteria. New rolling stock has been introduced on rail services to Maynooth, Mullingar and Longford in the past year and this, coupled with the doubling of the line between Dublin and Maynooth, has resulted in the capacity on suburban peak-time services on that route almost doubling. This has allowed for an improvement in the stopping pattern of the Intercity service on the Dublin-Sligo line, resulting in increased capacity for the long distance traveller. Iarnród Éireann have assured me that they keep the issues of rolling stock safety and passenger loading under constant review.</P>
      <P>This year Iarnród Éireann will also start taking delivery of 80 diesel railcars to be used mainly on the Dublin outer suburban routes. In addition, Iarnród Éireann will shortly order 67 new mainline carriages for use on intercity routes. These investments, funded by the Government under the national development plan, should further improve the age profile of rolling stock in use on intercity routes, allow a more effective deployment of available rolling stock and alleviate the problem of crowding on some services at peak times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I published a Railway Safety Bill in December <Col N="244" /> last and when enacted, the Railway Safety Commission established under that Bill will have a legal power to inspect the safety of rolling stock in use on a railway. The commission will also be the body charged with acceptance of &ldquo;safety cases&rdquo; from railway undertakings. In its safety case, Iarnród Éireann will be required to demonstrate that the rolling stock in use on its railway is safe for operational use.</P>

      <Quest>if the viability report which her Department sought regarding the extension of a gas pipeline from Bullathomas, Ballinaboy, County Mayo, to areas of the north-west will be made public within the next month; the timeframe for the development to take place; and the cost of the scheme.</Quest>

      <P>The Government decision in principle to extend the gas transmission system to Sligo via Ballina from the proposed Mayo to Galway pipeline, and to Letterkenny from Derry, recognises that these extensions would not be viable on the basis of anticipated gas demand and that considerable grant aid would be required. The provision of such grant aid raises issues relating to EU State aid and procurement rules. My Department has already been in touch with Commission officials on this matter.</P>
      <P>The next step in moving the projects forward involves carrying out detailed engineering and planning work, in order to establish a firm estimate of the capital costs. This work is usually undertaken by specialist consultants and normally takes about six or seven months to complete. The process of tendering under the EU procurement rules for a task such as this could be expected to take about five months. Once this phase is completed and a firm estimate of the capital costs has been established, the Government will be in a position to make a decision on grant aid.</P>
      <P>Bord Gáis has written to me with proposals for carrying out the detailed engineering and planning. Given that there are competition and state aid issues involved, I am concerned to ensure at the outset that the approach taken to the next stage of the project does not create difficulties which might result in the project being delayed at a later stage. Therefore, I have sought the advice of the Attorney General in relation to the best approach to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining phases in pipeline projects of this scale &ndash; obtaining the necessary wayleaves and statutory consent under the Gas Acts and <Col N="245" /> constructing and commissioning the pipeline &ndash; usually take a further two years to complete.</P>
    <P>Once I have obtained the advice of the Attorney General, I will move swiftly to get the detailed planning of the project under way.</P>

      <P>Under the National Development <Col N="246" /> Plan 1994-1999, 26.5 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. This figure has been significantly increased under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, to 200 million. The allocation of this funding is the responsibility of my Department. Funding under this communications and e-commerce measure of the NDP will be utilised to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced information and communications infrastructure and services which will enhance the potential for the development of electronic commerce facilities and enable the electronic provision of public services, including education services, virtual libraries, welfare and health services.</P>
      <P>Two thirds of the funding under this Measure is being made available in the Border, midland and west region. A competition has been run by my Department to allocate the first 98 million of the funding. The competition process was executed over the summer months, with a closing date of 22 September last. Given the liberalised nature of the telecommunications sector, the competition was run on the basis of public sector co-funding of network extensions to regional areas where it would not be commercially viable to do so at this point in time. The competition criteria specifically award points for the provision of services in deficit areas and the removal of regional barriers.</P>
      <P>An extensive mail-out of information surrounded the call for proposals. All communications operators were informed of the possibilities presented by the competition for developing broadband networks in the BMW region. Business and community leaders throughout the BMW region in organisations such as chambers of commerce, local authorities and development agencies were also informed of the opportunities available through both the lobbying of and the developing of partnerships with telecommunications companies. A large number of project submissions from the Border, midlands and west region have been received. The submissions are currently being assessed and evaluated at arms length by independent consultants under the competition criteria.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Aviation Authority was established with effect from 1 January 1994 pursuant to the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993, to exercise powers and functions in relation to safety of air navigation services and regulation of <Col N="247" /> safety at airports in the State. When consulted about proposed developments in the so-called red zones, the IAA advises the planning authorities of any conflict with international aviation safety requirements, and also draws their attention to increased public safety risks in those areas.</P>
      <P>The Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act, 1998, requires Aer Rianta to take all proper measures for safety, security, management, control, regulation, operation, marketing and development of its airports. In discharge of that statutory duty, it is a matter for Aer Rianta to decide what representations, if any, it should make to the relevant planning authorities in respect of proposed developments within or in proximity to the State airports.</P>
      <P>The planning authorities have the normal statutory responsibility to regulate development in their area. In doing this, they take account of a wide variety of concerns, including public safety.</P>
      <P>The red zones at airports were developed in the 1960s to indicate to the local authorities the areas in which development may need to be restricted, in the interests of aviation safety specifically, and public safety generally. The red zones have traditionally had two functions, namely the aviation safety function of avoiding developments which potentially, because of their height, may interfere with safe take-off and landing of aircraft, but also avoiding developments which, because of their location, would add to public safety risks to people on the ground.</P>
      <P>This Department, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment and Local Government, has commissioned consultants to make recommendations for public safety zones in the vicinity of Dublin Airport. The recommendations of the consultants, ERM will specifically deal with the risk to people on the ground.</P>
      <P>The work, when completed, will clarify that the primary agency in relation to aviation safety assessments will continue to be the Irish Aviation Authority, whereas the primary agency in assessing public safety risks will be the relevant planning authority itself. In any event, the planning authorities in accordance with their own statutory obligations, and ultimately, An Bord Pleanála, will continue to decide whether specific developments in the vicinity of airports receive planning permission.</P>
      <P>When the study is completed, the Department of the Environment and Local Government will issue planning guidelines in accordance with the Planning Acts to the local authorities to assist them in their consideration of the public safety aspects of planning applications in the vicinity of airports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under EU Council Directive 96/26/EC, a person nominated to act as a transport manager for a road haulage operator or a road passenger operator must prove he or she is eligible to do so having qualified by examination for a certificate of professional competence, CPC, from the Chartered Institute of Transport in Ireland. The transport manager should also be involved in the day-to-day management of the operation.</P>
      <P>In 1999, a review of the road haulage industry by Indecon-Pricewaterhousecoopers consultants recommended that the licensing regime in respect of the designation of transport managers should be strictly applied. The resulting policy introduced by my Department in consultation with the Irish Road Haulage Association and IBEC in November 1999 requires that the transport manager be employed by the licence holder on a full time basis to ensure continuous and effective management of the business. This full time employment rule applies unless the transport manager is a partner or a director in the business or is the spouse or partner of the licence holder. This policy is intended to ensure that haulage businesses are effectively managed on an ongoing basis to provide a professional service to customers and the economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>The firm in question has approached my Department on this matter and enquiries are being made with the Chartered Institute of Transport in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following is the position in relation to projects under the national development plan in the transport, energy and communications sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Book of Estimates for 2002 provides 143 million, £112 million, for rail safety, 127 million, £100 million, for Light Rail and 97 million, £76 <Col N="250" /> million, for public transport investment. As part of the budget day announcements, an additional 57 million, £45 million, is being provided by way of Exchequer funding. In total, 424 million, £333 million, is being provided by the Exchequer, compared with 345 million, £271 million, in 2001, an increase of 23% on last year.</P>
    <P>This Exchequer funding has been allocated as follows: 143 million, £112 million, in respect of the railway safety programme will enable Iarnród Éireann to continue to expand their investment programme of track renewal and upgrading of signalling, bridge renewal, level crossings improvements and improved safety management, across the entire network.</P>
    <P>A sum of 140 million, £110 million, has been allocated to the Rail Procurement Agency of which 13 million, £10 million, will be used to meet the set up costs of the agency. The balance of 127 million, £100 million, is being allocated to fund the development of the LUAS project which will see services commence in late 2003.</P>
    <P>Over 141 million, £111 million, will be utilised to progress a number of projects in 2002. EU co-funding will also be provided in respect of a number of these projects. The projects include: a major expansion of Heuston Station facilities and capacity to accommodate increased frequency of mainline and suburban trains with extra platforms, signalling and improved passenger facilities and his investment will form part of the Kildare Line upgrade; and continued funding of the DART Upgrade project including the final payment on 12 DART cars to go into service next spring. The next phase in the DART expansion involves upgrading platforms, signalling and power supply to enable eight-car DARTS operate on the system. It will also allow for extra slots in the area of Connolly Station-Pearse Station for additional trains from the Northern and Maynooth lines.</P>
    <P>In 2002, Iarnród Éireann will start taking delivery of 80 diesel rail cars to be used mainly on the outer suburban rail system. In addition, a rail depot at Drogheda will be constructed for the maintenance of these trains. Both Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus will continue with their fleet development and enhancement programmes. Iarnród Éireann are in the process of tendering for new mainline carriages to replace old rolling stock and expect to place orders for these carriages shortly. Funding has been allocated to community-based pilot projects to assist in the development of rural transport under the rural transport initiative and funding is also being provided for projects which will help the mobility impaired in accessing public transport facilities and vehicles, including making further progress on improvements to rail station lifts and foot bridges.</P>
    <P>Funding is being provided to the Light Rail Project Office-Railway Procurement Agency to further develop an integrated ticketing system for the greater Dublin area and funding is also being provided for improved facilities for public trans<Col N="251" /> port customers in terms of reliable and up-to-date information. Information technology will be central to these new customer facilities. Some funding is also being provided for transport research.</P>
    <P>The physical and financial progress of the above projects will be closely monitored by the NDP monitoring committee established early last year by my Department and made up of representatives from my Department, the Department of Finance, CIE Holding Group and the three subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>A total of 6 million, £4.73 million, has been provided in the Abridged Estimates for 2002 for capital development works and improvements in facilities at the six regional airports, Donegal, Kerry, Knock, Galway, Sligo and Waterford.</P>
    <P>Of this, 3.72 million, £2.93 million, is allocated under the airports measure of the national development plan. This NDP allocation will be used to grant aid infrastructural improvements &ndash; maximum aid rate 75% &ndash; and upgrades in safety-related equipment and facilities &ndash; maximum aid rate 90% &ndash; at the regional airports.</P>
    <P>As part of the 2002 Abridged Estimates the sum of 9.3 million, £7.32 million, has been allocated to my Department for the promotion of energy conservation and renewable energy measures. In the energy sector, a key priority of the national development plan is to identify those areas of expenditure, which will assist Ireland in complying with its obligation under the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
    <P>The Irish Energy Centre is the main implementing body for measures relating to energy efficiency and renewable energy and the estimate allocation will be expended by them in a range of activities such as: public sector building, research and development in energy efficient housing, renewable energy and public awareness.</P>
    <P>Over recent years, the Government has put in place a number of initiatives aimed at promoting the roll-out of regional broadband. While the telecommunications market is liberalised, certain interventions have taken place to address the issue of market failure in the delivery of broadband services. Funding made available in the 2002 Estimates of 25 million, £20 million, and additional funding made available in the budget of 19 million, £15 million, will be used to extend and develop these initiatives under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. It is particularly appropriate at a time when the private telecommunications sector is undergoing a period of capital expenditure retrenchment. The focus of this investment will be to support investment in communications and electronic commerce infrastructure, systems and services in less developed areas with the objective of balanced regional development and the enabling of e-commerce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 212 and 228 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of telecommunications services is a matter in the first instance for the companies who now operate in a fully liberalised market. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. Irish telecommunications policy has traditionally attempted to ensure the widest possible availability of competitive services throughout the regions. I have in recent years put in place a number of initiatives, which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 1994-1999, 26.5 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. This figure has been significantly increased under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, to 200 million. The allocation of this funding is the responsibility of my Department. Funding under this communications and e-commerce measure of the NDP will be utilised to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced information and communications infrastructure and services which will enhance the potential for the development of electronic commerce facilities and enable the electronic provision of public services, including education services, virtual libraries, welfare and health services.</P>
      <P>Two thirds of the funding under this measure is being made available in the Border, midland and west Region. A competition has been run by my Department to allocate the first 98 million of the funding. The competition process was executed over the summer months, with a closing date of 22 September last. Given the liberalised nature of the telecommunications sector, the competition was run on the basis of public-sector co-funding of network extensions to regional areas where it would not be commercially viable to do so at this point in time. The competition criteria specifically award points for the provision of services in deficit areas and the removal of regional barriers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has given an explicit commitment to the retention of the rural sub-post office network in the White Paper on Rural Development and I have given an undertaking that there will be no forced closures of post offices.</P>
      <P>I understand that negotiations have recently been concluded between An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union on proposals to secure the future of the post office network and appropriate severance terms, where sub-postmasters who are engaged on a contract basis by An Post, wish to withdraw from their contract on a voluntary basis.</P>
      <P>These negotiations have arisen in the context of the agreement between An Post and the unions in relation to the conversion of 26 post offices to agency status on a pilot basis as was recommended in the Flynn report. The negotiations are a matter for the board and management of An Post. I have no statutory function in relation to the terms of any agreement reached.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the Government has approved a 12.7 million, £10 million, increase in the share capital of An Post specifically to assist in the retention of the post office network and in November 2001, sub-postmasters received a 12% increase in pay which was recommended in the Flynn report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know and fully appreciate the work undertaken by postmasters and postmistresses over the years in terms of providing excellent services to <Col N="254" /> the customer, particularly in rural areas, and I am committed to ensuring that the public service ethos offered by the post office network will remain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 215 and 216 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has embarked on an investment programme in railway infrastructure, which has already seen investment of 14 million under the EU Operational Programme for Transport 1994-1999 on the Waterford-Kilkenny to Dublin line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, launched in November 1999, 2.54 million was spent on the enhancement of the line during 2000 with a further 6.35 million during 2001. The work involves the replacement of life-expired <Col N="256" /> jointed tracks, laid on timber sleepers, with continuous welded rail on concrete sleepers. Iarnród Éireann expect the work to be completed by the end of this year and passengers will see improvements of up to ten minutes on the total journey time.</P>
    <P>The demand for services has increased year-on-year on all routes operated by Iarnród Éireann and the Waterford to Dublin line is no exception. To deal with this growth, Iarnród Éireann is acquiring new rolling stock for mainline and suburban services. Iarnród Éireann will shortly begin to take delivery of a new fleet of 80 diesel rail cars, which will start to enter service towards the end of this year. They will be used, partially to replace older rolling stock, but also to improve existing service and increase capacity. Additionally Iarnród Éireann is examining tenders for the supply of up to 67 new mainline locomotive hauled carriages. When the tendering and contract process is completed, it will take about two years for these carriages to be delivered and put into service.</P>
    <P>The deployment of these new carriages on specific train services is a day-to-day operational matter for Iarnród Éireann to address and not within my remit.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Public Enterprise</askee>
      <Quest>her plans to improve the intercity rail link from Cork to Dublin and to other locations; the time scale she envisages for its introduction; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The demand for services has increased year-on-year on all routes operated by Iarnród Éireann and the Cork to Dublin line is no exception. Iarnród Éireann is examining tenders for the supply of up to 67 new mainline locomotive-hauled carriages. When the tendering and procurement procedures are complete, it will take about two years for their delivery and entry into service. These trains on entry into service will provide a significant improvement in the quality of mainline services between Cork and Dublin.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann also informs me that planning and design is continuing on the south/west rail corridor into Heuston Station. The project aims to separate long distance trains from commuter trains and allow faster journey times into and out of Heuston Station. In the meantime, work has already begun to improve the infrastructure at Heuston Station to allow it to handle trains more efficiently by rearranging the trackwork at the station and increasing the number of platforms from five to nine.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann state that, taken together, these two projects will provide increased trains paths and therefore allow them to increase the number of trains it can operate on the routes into and out of Heuston Station.</P>

      <P>I have not moved any public capital programme expenditure into public private partnerships, or PPPs, in the past three months. The two PPP's currently being progressed by the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA are: (a) the operation of the Luas services and (b) the development of the Dublin Metro.</P>
      <P>The competition for the selection of the Luas operator is at an advanced stage with the contract likely to be awarded in the coming weeks. The contract is for operation only and no capital expenditure from the Exchequer is involved.</P>
      <P>The procurement process for the Dublin Metro will begin shortly.</P>

      <Quest>the details of the notified reduction in capacity for flights arriving in Dublin Airport for 2002; if this is a gross or net figure; and the proposed action planned to increase capacity levels.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of capacity, in terms of flights or seats, which is provided by carriers using Dublin Airport is an operational commercial matter for the airline companies involved and I have no function in relation to that matter.</P>
      <P>However, Aer Rianta informs me that, despite the current difficult circumstance for the global aviation sector, the forecast passenger throughput at Dublin Airport for 2002 is expected to match last year's figure of approximately 14.3 million passengers. A total of 70 commercial airlines, both scheduled and charter, served 122 destinations in 2001 and Aer Rianta expect that, in the current year, the number of destinations served will rise to at least 125.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta informs me that it is not possible to be specific about the changes in the capacity that will be available at Dublin Airport during 2002. Airlines are still finalising their summer schedules while the winter schedules for 2002-03 have yet to be decided upon by the airlines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As of now, Aer Rianta is aware that GO will exit its Edinburgh and Glasgow routes in 2002. Aer Lingus have announced that they will be <Col N="258" /> commencing new routes to Nice and Barcelona and will also continue their Malaga service into 2002. Air Canada is commencing a new daily service from Toronto to Dublin-Shannon from June to October this year and Skynet is inaugurating a new Dublin-Shannon service to Warsaw. Aer Rianta expects that these new services will generate an additional 7,500 seats per week.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta's ongoing marketing and promotional activities aimed at further boosting traffic at the three State airports, including Dublin Airport, will continue. These activities will be supported by the company's incentive schemes for new route development at the three airports which, at Dublin Airport, provides for zero airport charges for airlines for the first three years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 222 and 226 together.</P>
      <P>The regulation of costs for Internet access is an operational matter for the Office of the Director to Telecommunications Regulation. I have no function in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An analysis of dial-up Internet access prices is <Col N="259" /> contained in the EU Commission's recently published Seventh Report on the Implementation of the Telecommunications Regulatory Package in Member States, COM 2001 706 final, 26 November 2001. The Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation has taken several steps to support dial-up Internet access and in particular it has opened two new non-geographic codes for use in accessing Internet service providers, ISPs.</P>
    <P>Government policy is to facilitate the rollout of state of the art infrastructures and to provide the legislative and regulatory environment which will serve to make a major contribution to sustained macro-economic growth and the realisation of competitively priced, high quality services.</P>
    <P>Low cost, high speed Internet access is a key element of my Department's communications policy. Under the National Development Plan 2000 &ndash; 2006, 200 million of public funds have been earmarked to leverage investment in advanced communications infrastructure and services. The focus of this investment will be to support investment in communications and electronic commerce infrastructure, systems and services in less developed areas.</P>
    <P>Government proposals in relation to regulatory reform of the communications sector are designed to ensure that the regulatory conditions in Ireland are effective in stimulating a competitive market for communications services, including Internet services. In this regard the draft Communications (Regulation) Bill will enhance the regulatory framework so as to further facilitate the development of the sector while ensuring that appropriate elements of the public interest are taken into account.</P>
    <P>The Bill is currently being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. It is my intention to have the Bill published in the next few weeks and, time permitting, to have it enacted before the Easter recess.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann has informed me that major investment has been made on the Maynooth line over the past three years which involved upgrad<Col N="260" /> ing of the track, signalling, stations and the acquisition of 20 new diesel railcars. A new timetable with more frequent services was introduced last year involving a 100% increase in capacity on the service.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann is proceeding with planning and design work for the upgrading of the rail infrastructure on the Dublin-Kildare line. This major project will involve quadrupling of rail track between Hazelhatch and Sallins to separate long distance and suburban services.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann plan to provide a new station at Lucan &ndash; Adamstown &ndash; as part of this project and Iarnród Éireann is in discussion with the local authorities and developers regarding the optimum location for the station and funding options. Iarnród Éireann in the coming months will start taking delivery of 80 diesel railcars which will be used to upgrade further services on the Dublin suburban services later in the year.</P>

      <P>Since the terrorist incidents of 11 September 2001 in the US, the National Civil Aviation Security Committee chaired by a senior official from my Department has reviewed the existing on-the-ground and in-flight aviation security procedures for Irish aviation and has strengthened existing procedures where appropriate. This work is ongoing.</P>
      <P>As regards new regulations, my Department will be making arrangements to give legal effect as quickly as possible to a new EU aviation security regulation concerned with establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security across member states. All the essential elements of these common rules are already being implemented in Irish aviation. The text of the draft regulation in question was approved at the meeting of Transport Ministers on 5-6 December 2001. The draft regulation is to be considered by the European Parliament shortly.</P>

      <P>All members of the Defence Forces are subject to annual and random physical fitness tests which include measurement of their body mass index. Minimum physical fitness requirements are age and sex-related but are otherwise the same for all members of the Defence Forces. Training regimes are devised by physical education officers for personnel who fail to meet these minimum standards based on the reasons why they failed to meet the standards, whether this be due to obesity or any other reasons. The use of the product in question would not in itself be a factor in the formulation of an individual training programme.</P>
      <P>Obesity is a recognised risk factor for a variety of conditions such as coronary heart disease, degenerative disc disease and arthritis of major weight-bearing joints. The use of the product in association with a primary care service to reduce the potential mortality and morbidity from such conditions and the associated costs is considered to be cost effective.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 234 and 237 together.</P>
      <P>On 17 January 2002, I authorised my Department to open negotiations with Sikorsky International Operations, Inc., Connecticut, USA, for the purchase of three medium range helicopters, S-92s, for search and rescue purposes, with an option for a further two helicopters for general purpose military transport. The decision followed from a detailed examination of the tenders received from the four companies &ndash; Sikorsky, USA; CHC Scotia, Scotland; EH Industries Limited, UK and Eurocopter, France.</P>
      <P>The offer from Sikorsky was deemed to be the most strategically and economically advantageous tender taking account of the award criteria set out for the tender competition, which were: functional characteristics, technical merit, all maintenance and on-line technical support, after sales service and warranty terms on offer, cost and ready availability of spare parts, tender prices and life cycle costs over a nominal 20 year period.</P>

      <P>Chapter 21 of the final report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions, which was published by the Minister for Finance in January 2001, specifically addressed the superannuation position of members of the Defence Forces. During the course of the commission's deliberations, interested parties had been invited to make submissions and I understand that PDFORRA was among those who did so and was also met by the commission. The commission made a series of recommendations in relation to the design of a new pension scheme for new entrants to the Defence Forces and recommended that the new scheme should be drawn up as soon as possible, with appropriate consultation involving the Defence Forces' representative associations. It <Col N="268" /> also recommended that, having regard to the advantageous nature of the existing Defence Forces pensions schemes considered in the round, no fundamental modifications should be made to the pension terms of serving personnel.</P>
      <P>The Government's response to the commission's final report was announced by the Minister for Finance on 28 September 2001. The Government decided to accept the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the Commission and to establish the working group, comprised of the public service unions, relevant Government Departments and other appropriate parties, to advise on implementation as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The Government also decided to establish parallel structures in the case of the Defence Forces and Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>I understand that a plenary meeting of the PPF working group took place on 10 January 2002 and that the process of detailed discussions to address the various issues relating to implementation of the Commission's recommendations is to formally commence on 31 January 2002. The establishment of parallel structures for the Defence Forces is being addressed in my Department and it is hoped that it will be possible to have appropriate structures put in place in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sale of 19.218 acres at the former Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, to Cork County Council, in conjunction with the IDA, for 973,889, £767, 000, has been completed. The lands will be developed and marketed as a strategic industrial site to attract inward investment. This develop<Col N="269" /> ment will greatly assist in the continuing revitalisation of Fermoy and will greatly enhance its potential for future industrial development.</P>
    <P>The former Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare, comprises an area of approximately 22 acres. I agreed to cede seven acres free of charge to Naas Urban District Council and to sell one acre to Kildare County Council for 380,921, £300,000, all for local community purposes. I have also agreed to sell the remaining 14 acres or thereabouts, which are zoned for housing, to Naas UDC for 8,888,167, £7 million. The legal formalities to give effect to these agreements are progressing and I expect them to be completed very shortly.</P>
    <P>In relation to Castleblayney, that property is in the process of being sold to the North-Eastern Health Board for 761, 843, £600,000 and sale contracts have recently been signed. Pending completion of the legal and financial formalities, a caretaker's agreement was completed and the former barracks was handed over to the health board in 2000 on foot of that agreement. The legal formalities in this case are now completed.</P>
    <P>The integrated action area plan which was commissioned from independent consultants to provide for the future development of the former Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, has now been adopted by Cork County Council. A tender competition has been held for the appointment of selling agents for the former barracks and it is expected that an appointment will be made as soon as is practical.</P>
    <P>In relation to the need for accommodation, the vacated Magee Barracks, Kildare, is now providing accommodation for asylum seekers. I have also agreed to provide circa one acre to the local authority for a temporary halting site for 20 persons for a period of one year. In relation to the remainder of this site I am arranging early discussions with all the interested parties including the local authority.</P>
    <P>Clancy Barracks, Dublin, was advertised by the selling agents, Hamilton Osborne King, for sale by public tender on 14 June 2001. Two bids were received, one of which was from Dublin City Council. Both tenders were considered too low to permit acceptance. My Department is, of course, prepared to talk to any party interested in purchasing the property, which remains on the market. It is my intention to generate the maximum return from the site for re-investment in essential Defence Forces needs.</P>
    <P>Arising from the temporary provision of accommodation for asylum seekers the cost of security at Magee barracks, Kildare is now met by the Office of Public Works and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Castleblayney Military Barracks was transferred to the North-Eastern Health Board on a caretaker basis on 9 February 2000 and the former Fitzgerald Camp in Fermoy has been sold to Cork County Council and no further costs will fall to be met by my Department in relation to either of these properties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> The cost of security for each former barracks since closure now stands at:&ndash;</P>

    <P>Significant savings have arisen since the evacuation of the six barracks placed under private security arrangements. On military security duty alone, it is estimated that savings to date exceed 1.4 million, £1,103,000. In addition there have been significant savings on utility costs, such as telephone, gas and electricity charges at each of the evacuated Barracks which, for example, would have amounted to approximately 228,553, £180,000, in the case of Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig.</P>

      <P>Two CASA aircraft &ndash; C252 and C253 &ndash; were delivered in 1994 under the terms of the 1991 to 1995 fishery protection support programme. While the conditions of use of the CASA aircraft for EU funding purposes were not explicitly set out the primacy of the fishery protection role was implicit. A combined flying hour profile of the two CASA aircraft, for fishery protection duties, of approximately 1400 was indicated in the context of the EU 1996 &ndash; 2000 fishery protection programme. The breakdown, on a flying hour basis, of the various operational tasks undertaken in 2001 is as follows:&ndash;</P>

    <P>The total hours flown in 2001 by CASA C252 and C253 amounted to 875 and 927 respectively. These figures include hours flown for training, maintenance etc. purposes. I am satisfied that a satisfactory and effective fishery protection service, utilising existing resources, is being provided by the Naval Service and Air Corps and no concerns to the contrary have been expressed to me by either the GOC Air Corps, the flag officer commanding the Naval Service, or by members of the Air Corps or Naval Service.</P>
    <P>There has been no approach to my Department from any representative of the European Com<Col N="273" /> mission seeking a breakdown of CASA aircraft flying hours.  </P>

      <P>Under the provisions of paragraph 22 of Defence Force Regulations A10, a recruit is on probation until the end of his or her training, when each recruit's final suitability to become a soldier is assessed. This assessment requires that, among other things, the recruit complies with prescribed military standards of medical and physical fitness. A recruit may not be finally approved unless he or she is considered suitable in all respects for service in the Permanent Defence Force. The criteria in relation to medical suitability for recruitment and final approval of recruits and the interpretation of these criteria are a matter for the military medical authorities. These criteria are of general application and exceptions cannot be made in individual cases.</P>
      <P>The person in question enlisted as a recruit on 24 September 2001. The recruit platoon of which he is a member is due to &ldquo;pass out&rdquo; on 6 February 2002 having completed their recruit training. When the recruit in question was medically assessed for &ldquo;final approval&rdquo; in accordance with the relevant regulations he was found not to meet the required medical standards for final approval. The available internal appeal procedures in relation to this finding are being availed of by this recruit and have not yet been concluded.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 259 to 261, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The scheme of investment aid for the commercial horticulture sector, operated under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, provides for aid of more than 19 million over the period of the scheme. This will greatly assist producers in the horticulture sector, including beekeepers, to upgrade their equipment and facilities and help them meet market demands.</P>
      <P>A total of 312 applications were received in the first round of the scheme which closed on 4 May 2001. Of these 263 have been approved to date, for grant aid in respect of projects with completion dates up to the end of June 2002. The aim in selecting projects for grant approval has been to meet sectoral and producer priorities in an equitable and transparent way. Up to the end of December 2001, 26 applications for payment were processed and a total of approximately 575,000 or an average of 22,000 each was paid. The level of individual grant varies considerably because of the diverse nature of the sector.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the very satisfactory uptake to date, I am satisfied that the scheme will prove to be effective and, therefore, I have no plans to change it at this stage. The position will be reviewed at the end of the current round which finishes at the end of June 2002. Following that review the new round will be announced, probably in early autumn 2002.</P>

Following an on-farm inspection on 16 August 2001, it was found that three of these animals were absent. There is also no evidence that the three animals were in the ownership and possession of the person named at the time of application and there is no record on the CMMS database concerning the movement-death of these animals. On 21 November the applicant was informed that as a result of these findings he would be excluded from the suckler cow premium scheme for 2001. He was advised that he could appeal this decision within 21 days. To date my Department has not received any request to have this case reviewed.</P>

      <P>The animal based headage schemes were replaced in 2001 by the area based compensatory allowance scheme. The new scheme, which was approved by the European Commission, provides that applicants must meet a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare of the holding in the year preceding application. However, farmers who are unable to meet that minimum stocking density but who traditionally qualified for headage grants in respect of cattle and-or sheep may continue to qualify for payment, provided their land is being utilized and is not in danger of undergrazing. The person named was not a headage recipient in 2000, and according to my <Col N="280" /> Department's records, the stocking density of the holding does not meet the minimum requirement. My Department wrote to the person named on 7 November 2001 with a view to establishing the type of farming activity being pursued. A reply was received in the district livestock office with details of the stock on the holding. As the stocking density was 0.14 livestock units per hectare in 2001 she would not appear to qualify for payment under the 2001 area based compensatory allowance scheme. A final decision on all outstanding cases will be made soon.</P>

      <P>In this case payment of 4,075.10, £3,209.40 was made under the 2001 area based compensatory allowance scheme on 26 September 2001 in respect of 37.2 hectares of mountain type land at 57.14, £45 per hectare sum of 1,949.49, £1,535.35, under a compensation package agreed with the European Commission for farmers experiencing losses under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme. The additional sum is equal to 90% of the difference between the average sum of the headage payments under the 1998, 1999 and 2000 headage schemes and the amount payable under the 2001 area based compensatory allowance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a thorough review of the area-based compensatory allowance scheme, proposals have been submitted to the European Commission for increased payment rates for farmers with mountain type land. The proposals involves making a payment of 101.58, £80, per hectare on the first 10 hectares of mountain type land with a payment <Col N="281" /> of 88.88, £70, per hectare on each remaining hectare subject to an overall payment ceiling of 45 hectares. Subject to securing the necessary EU approval it is that the revised payment rates will apply from 2001.</P>

      <P>The discussions relate to a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the animal health requirements applicable to non-commercial movement of pet animals. The objective of this proposal is to introduce a harmonized system for the movement of such animals both intra-Community and from third countries. The main focus is on rabies control.</P>
      <P>The proposal has been discussed on a number of occasions and some issues have emerged on which a consensus has yet to be reached. These issues include the scope of application, the type of identification to be used and the additional safeguards required by the three member states, Ireland, the UK and Sweden, that have traditionally operated a quarantine system.</P>
      <P>Discussions are continuing at both Council and working party levels. I will, of course, have to be fully satisfied with the level of public health protection provided by any alternative to our existing system before I could accept any changes.</P>

      <P>This case was reviewed in my Department and the outcome of that review was communicated to the person named on 1 October 2001. The decision was appealed and a more senior official reviewed the case again, but it was concluded that there were no grounds to amend the original decision.</P>
      <P>There is an onus on REPS participants to ensure that they make their annual application for payment within the prescribed timeframe. The application for payment in this case should have been received by 31 October 2000 to avoid penalty for late application. It was not received until August 2001, over nine months later. While the scheme provides for certain extreme circumstances such as long-term illness or incapacity to be accepted as <i>force majeure</i> excusing late application, what the person named has put forward as mitigating circumstances do not in the view of my Department constitute sufficient grounds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The animal based headage schemes were replaced in 2001 by the area based compensatory allowance scheme. The new scheme, which was approved by the European Commission, provides that applicants must meet a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare of the holding in the year preceding application. Arable area is not acceptable for calculation of stocking density for the purpose of the area based compensatory allowance scheme, and the person named did not include arable land on his 2001 area aid application. However, farmers who are unable to meet that minimum stocking density but who traditionally qualified for headage grants in respect of cattle and-or sheep may continue to qualify for payment, provided their land is being utilised and is not in danger of undergrazing. The person named was not a headage recipient in 2000, and according to my Department's records, the stocking density of the holding did not meet the minimum requirement. My Department wrote to the person named on 7 November 2001 with a view to establishing the type of farming activity being pursued. A reply was received in his district livestock office with details of the stock on the holding. As his stocking density was 0.11 livestock units per hectare in 2001 he would not appear to qualify for payment under the 2001 area based compensatory allowance scheme. A final decision on all outstanding cases will be made soon.</P>

      <P>One of the parcels claimed by the person named in his 2001 area aid application overlaps with a parcel of land claimed by another applicant. The person named was contacted in this regard and in his reply clarified the position by including a map showing the correct position. This information is now being entered onto the Department's electronic database. When this is completed any payments due under the 2001 area based compensatory allowance, special beef premium schemes and 2001 suckler cow premium scheme will issue. The person named has been paid slaughter premium for 2001 in respect of two animals found eligible on the basis of data recorded on the CMMS for the period 01 January 2001 to 30 September 2001. Payment to the amount of 84.80 has issued representing an 80% advance on the amount due.</P>

      <P>Draft statutory instruments for the implementation of Directives 2000/37/EC and 99/74/EC are undergoing final checking procedures and are now expected to be adopted by the end of February. I am making arrangements to ensure that the remaining directive, 2000/75/EC, laying down specific provisions for the control and eradication of blue tongue, is implemented as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The implementation dates referred to in my reply of 20 November 2001 represented expected or estimated dates of implementation. It was not possible to meet the expected date in each case because of the need to resolve legal issues arising and also due to other work demands on the staff concerned.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for 27 cows and five heifers under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. Following an examination of his application it was discovered that one animal, tag number SPHP0048D, had died prior to the date of application. A letter issued on 28 November 2001 to the applicant informing him that as he was in breach of clause 20(iii) of the terms and conditions of the scheme, no payment would be made under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. On 12 December 2001, the herdowner successfully appealed this decision and 26 cows and five heifers were accepted for payment. However, one animal, tag number MYA259511, is not showing on the applicants herd profile on CMMS and this matter remains unresolved. In the meantime, the application is being processed for payment on the basis of 25 cows and five heifers and if found in order, his 80% advance entitlement will issue shortly.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for premium for 95 animals under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. Under the terms and conditions of the scheme a producer with more than 15 reckonable livestock units may be paid premium on up to two reckonable livestock units only per hectare of the forage area of his holding as established from the producers 2001 area aid application. The livestock units counted are cows-heifers submitted for the suckler cow premium, steer-bulls submitted for special beef premium, ewes submitted for ewe premium and any milk quota held divided by 876 gallons. Any cattle submitted for 2001 suckler cow and special beef premium over and above that two reckonable livestock units limit will not be paid such premium. In this case area aid records show 25.29 hectares allowing payment on a maximum 50.58 livestock units. The person named has been paid for 36.6 livestock units of special beef premium and 12.3 livestock units of ewe premium. The 80% advance payment under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme for 1.68 livestock units will issue within the next week.</P>

      <P>The person named was paid her 80% advance entitlement under the <Col N="293" /> 2001 suckler cow premium scheme on 26 November 2001. The person named submitted applications for special beef premium on 11 January and 20 November 2001 for 13 animals and three animals respectively. The January 2001 application has been processed to payment stage by the special beef premium unit. November applications will be eligible for payment in February 2002 when the retention period is complete and the terms and conditions of the scheme have been met.</P>
      <P>It was subsequently discovered, however, that one of the parcels claimed by the person named in her 2001 area aid application overlaps with a parcel of land claimed by another applicant. This resulted in both the final instalment under the 2001 suckler cow premium and all other area aid related payments being held, pending the resolution of the problem. Special beef premium payments cannot be made until the outstanding area aid issues have been resolved.</P>
      <P>The area aid unit has examined the files of both herdowners involved and the overlap is being resolved in favour of the person named. This information is now being entered on to the Department's electronic database, and the balancing payment under the suckler cow premium scheme, and the 2001 area based payment will be made when the area aid application is fully processed and found in order. It should be noted, however, that payment of the 2001 extensification premium is not scheduled to commence until June 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The transition from Irish pounds to euro will have no effect on the amount payable to participants in the early retirement scheme. Pensions paid under the 1994 scheme have been converted from Irish pounds into the exact equivalent in euro using the six-digit conversion rate and rounded to the nearest cent. No conversion was necessary in the case of participants in the scheme which was introduced in November 2000, because their rates of payment were already denominated in euro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the person named, there have been two occasions on which his pension under the early retirement scheme was reduced. The first was in January 1999 when the euro was introduced. This resulted in a reduction of 5.05% in the rate of pension. A three-year scheme of compensation to reimburse participants was approved <Col N="294" /> by the European Commission and the third payment will be made in the coming months. All participants who were in the scheme before January 1999 were affected by this reduction and have received the compensation.</P>
    <P>The person named also had his pension under the early retirement scheme reduced in January 2000 when he qualified for the contributory old age pension. The EU Council regulation under which the early retirement scheme was introduced requires that the pension payable to a participant must be reduced by the amount of any national retirement pension to which he or she is entitled.</P>

      <P>The incidence of bovine TB in County Waterford is, unfortunately, above the national average and my Department is keeping this situation under close and on-going review.</P>
      <P>Wildlife, in particular badgers, are considered by veterinary experts to be a significant constraint in addressing the TB problem at national level. In the context of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF, it was agreed that additional resources would be assigned to the removal of all sources of infection in the 20% of the country that yielded 50% of TB reactors. A number of additional staff have already been recruited by my Department for this purpose and I am arranging for some of the additional staff to be assigned to Waterford District Veterinary Office to deal with wildlife measures. It should be noted, however, that badgers can only be removed under licences issued by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
      <P>Deer have not generally been associated with the spread of bovine TB. However, my Department will keep the situation in County Waterford under close review in this regard.</P>
      <P>Questions regarding reactor compensation and the financial well-being of farmers with restricted herds are aspects of disease eradication that are discussed at national level in the context of the Animal Health Advisory Forum comprising representatives of the main farm and veterinary bodies, the Department of Finance and my own Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with another PPF commitment, arrangements are now being made to establish a local monitoring committee in each DVO area including Waterford. Each committee, consisting of departmental, farmer and veterinary representa<Col N="295" /> tives, will review the progress of the eradication schemes in the local area.</P>

      <P>My Department wrote to the person named on 20 February 2001 telling him that he had been overpaid under the rural environment protection scheme. The overpayment had arisen because penalties for non-compliance with the terms and conditions of the scheme were imposed following an inspection of the holding in August 1999 and because a portion of the holding was found to be ineligible for payment.</P>
      <P>The most substantial penalty that had been imposed related to the participant's eligibility for payment under supplementary measure 6 &ndash; organic farming.

      <P>The person named applied for premium on 20 cows and five heifers under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme on 29 May 2001. Records showed that animal, tag number JPWW0105W, described as a cow on the application calved for the first time on 31/05/01. As the number of heifers &ndash; six &ndash; was greater than 20% of the number of animals submitted for premium, the animal in question was rejected. Four cows were not properly identified by ear tags, one having a brass tag was deleted without penalty and the other three were rejected. The herdowner was informed on 16 October 2001 that no premium was payable on his 2001 suckler cow application as clause 20(i) and clause 20(iv) of the terms and conditions of the scheme had been contravened. The applicant appealed this decision on 26 October 2001. The documentation submitted has been examined and the person named was informed on 8 January 2002 that animal tag number JPWW0105W is now eligible for payment as it has been accepted that an incorrect calving date was recorded on CMMS. The decision regarding the other four animals remains unchanged. In accordance with clause 33 of the terms and conditions of the suckler cow scheme, the application will now be processed on the basis of 21 eligible animals with a reduction penalty. The person named has also been informed that he may appeal this decision by completing an appeals form and sending it within 21 days to the headage and premia appeals unit.</P>

      <P>Applications for replacement cards or passports are checked against the CMMS system to ensure that the animals in question are in the applicant's herd at the time of application for a replacement. The above-mentioned herdowner applied for replacement cards for the two animals in question in October 2001. However, there was no record on the cattle movement monitoring system of the animals being moved into his herd. To this end the DVO advised the herdowner to make the appropriate movement notification and forwarded notification forms for completion by both parties involved in the transaction. The matter was resolved and the replacement cards issued for the two animals on 20 December 2001.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for premium for ten cows under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. Further checks on his application showed that four of these animals were in fact heifers and that the 20% heifer ratio was thereby exceeded. The applicant was informed of the situation on 14 November 2001 and given 21 days to reply. As the herdowner has not replied to date, his application is now being processed on the basis of three animals rejected with six cows and one heifer accepted for payment subject to a shortfall penalty. The person named has been informed of this decision and again has the option of contacting my Department within 21 days if he wishes to have his case reviewed.</P>

    <P>The priority categories were Category A: Farmers under 35 years of age who will apply for the suckler cow premium scheme for the first time in 2002. Farmers who applied for the first time in 2001 may also qualify under this category. Applicants must have the necessary farming qualifications and the livestock unit level on the holding must not exceed 50; Category B: Farmers with holdings on off-shore islands &ndash; at least 50% of the forage area of the holding must be located on the island. A total of 5% of the available quota was reserved for eligible applicants under this category; Category C: Organic farmers who are registered with the Department. The livestock unit level on the holding must not exceed 50. A total of 10% of the available quota was reserved <Col N="304" /> for eligible farmers under this category; Category E: Farmers on the Cooley peninsula who had to destock as a direct result of the foot and mouth crisis. A total of 10% of the available quota was reserved for eligible farmers under this category; and Category D: Farmers who apply regularly for the suckler cow premium scheme and who required additional quota to ensure the future viability of their holdings.</P>

      <P>Various descriptions exist for the term &ldquo;hogget&rdquo;. The most classic definition-description of a hogget is a &ldquo;yearling sheep&rdquo;. In practice, to verify the age of an animal presented as a hogget, the dentition of the animal is normally used, that is, the first pair of permanent incisor teeth have erupted. Eruption of the first pair of permanent teeth in sheep occurs at approximately one to one and a half years of age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 319 and 320 together.</P>
      <P>My Department neither owns nor operates meat plants. In the normal course it is therefore a matter for each meat plant to ensure the efficacy of weighing apparatus on its premises and to meet all relevant requirements. However, I assume the Deputy's particular concern in this instance is the temporary arrangement which my Department has with a meat plant for the slaughter of flocks being depopulated as a result of scrapie.</P>
      <P>In this regard the position is that following negotiations with the IFA and farmers whose confirmed scrapie positive flocks were to be depopulated, the slaughter of restricted flocks commenced on Friday, 14 December 2001. The formula agreed with the IFA and farmers included a provision for determining an element of the compensation to paid by reference to the weight of the animals. In accordance with the express wishes of the farmers involved, the animals to be slaughtered were weighed live. I should also mention that in the course of negotiations, the urgency of proceeding with the depopulation, particularly of flocks in which lambing was likely to commence in December or January, was repeatedly stressed by the IFA and the farmers concerned.</P>
      <P>In order to accommodate these factors, my Department ordered a self calibrating, digital sheep scales which the supplier has indicated is used extensively for this purpose in Ireland. I also understand that the New Zealand manufacturers of the weight cells are world leaders in the manufacture of electronic livestock scales and operate to the ISO 9001 quality standard.</P>
      <P>My Department is satisfied, on the basis of close observation and reports by the officers responsible for the weighing of sheep at the factory in question, that this scales was functioning correctly and accurately at all times during the weighing of sheep at the plant concerned. However, on 7 January 2002, the scales was overturned in the lairage of the factory without the authority of the veterinary officer in charge. Test weights recorded immediately after that incident were, understandably, wildly inaccurate, and therefore this scales was not used for weighing animals following this incident. An alternative scales provided by a farmer and tested using test weights provided by the factory was, with the consent of the individual whose sheep were being processed at the time, used for the remainder of the day. Further slaughter was suspended until such time as the Department's scales could be readjusted by the supplier.</P>
      <P>This was done on 11 January 2002. On that date the accuracy was also checked by an independent industrial weighing company which issued a certificate of conformance indicating that the scales had been tested and was weighing accurately. A copy of that certificate has been made available to IFA.</P>

      <P>The person named was paid 1,831.34, £1,442.30, under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme on 25 September 2001 in respect of 32.05 hectares of mountain type land at 57.14, £45, per hectare. This compares with his average payment of 1,611.81, £1,269.40, under the old animal-based headage schemes in the three years 1998, 1999 and 2000.</P>
      <P>Following a thorough review of the area-based compensatory allowance scheme, proposals have been submitted to the European Commission for increased payment rates for farmers with mountain-type land. The proposal involves making a payment of 101.58, £80, per hectare on the first ten hectares of mountain-type land with a payment of 88.88, £70, per hectare on each remaining hectare subject to an overall payment ceiling of 45 hectares. Subject to securing the necessary EU approval it is intended that the revised payment rates will apply from 2001.</P>

      <P>Under the area-based compensatory allowance scheme there is a minimum stocking density level required of 0.15 livestock units equivalent per forage hectare in the calendar year preceding the year of application for compensatory allowances. This is to ensure that the land is being farmed, and to prevent problems of undergrazing and is a requirement laid down by the European Commission. The minimum stocking level will not apply where agri-environment or other recognised environmental measures require a lower stocking density. In addition, farmers who are unable to meet the minimum stocking level but who traditionally qualified for headage grants in respect of cattle and-or sheep may continue to qualify for payment, provided their land is being utilized and is not in danger of undergrazing.</P>

      <P>On 26 November 2001, my Department informed the person named that payments must be refunded in respect of the land he had disposed of. He was also informed that his third and fourth-year REPS payment would be offset against the amount owed. He appealed the decision and his appeal is being considered at present. While it is being considered, my Department has deferred further action to recover the balance of the debt.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the Australian Government took the initiative to end the mutual recognition of veterinary qualifications between Ireland and Australia; his views on whether this step is causing problems for veterinary surgeons from Australia who wish to practise here and for those from Ireland who wish to practise in Australia; and when the new draft legislation to replace the Veterinary Surgeon Act, 1931, will be circulated.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Veterinary Council of Ireland that the essential reason underlying the withdrawal by the Australian registration authority from the mutual recognition arrangements with this country relates to the break in the link between the Veterinary Council and the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons; this latter break arose in the context of the setting up of EU mutual recognition arrangements. I am informed that the Veterinary Council also understands that the Australian <Col N="317" /> authorities, which, with New Zealand, have become part of a broader Australian registration authority, have also ended recognition arrangements with certain other countries, both within the EU and outside.</P>
      <P>The ending by the Australian authorities of the mutual recognition arrangements has the effect that under current legislation governing the veterinary profession in Ireland, the Veterinary Council is precluded from recognising the relevant Australian qualification. Similarly, Irish veterinary graduates will not be registered by the Australian authorities on the basis of their Irish veterinary qualification, but may, I understand, sit an examination in Australia in order to gain such registration.</P>
      <P>I have obtained Government approval to bring forward legislation to replace the current legislation regulating the veterinary profession in Ireland, which legislation would include provisions enabling the Veterinary Council, in appropriate circumstances, to recognise third country qualifications, even in the absence of reciprocal recognition arrangements with the country concerned. I am anxious to proceed with circulation of this draft legislation at the earliest possible date and I am currently awaiting finalisation of the legal drafting by the parliamentary counsel's office.</P>

      <P>The allocation of milk quota from the national reserve is granted on the basis of recommendations from the milk quota appeals tribunal. The tribunal is a body established to consider and advise on applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered extreme hardship as a result of the milk quota system. The closing date for receipt of applications for additional quota in respect of the 2001-2002 milk quota year, which was published by way of a notice in the farming press, was 18 January 2002. If an application has been made by the person named, it will be considered by the tribunal and she will be notified of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The person named furnished an incomplete 2001 area aid application in that he did not include a map for new parcels of land on which he is claiming area aid. The area aid unit made contact with the applicant in this regard, and he subsequently submitted maps which are currently being entered on the Department's electronic database. When the area aid application has been fully processed and found in order, payment due under the 2001 area based compensatory allowance will issue.</P>
      <P>Under the 2001 ewe premium scheme, the person named applied on 200 ewes &ndash; 100 breeding ewes and 100 hogget ewes. He holds a permanent quota of 200 rights. To enable his application to be processed for payment he was asked on 5 April 2001 to complete a Form EP250 giving details of any losses incurred during the retention period. The person named returned Form EP250 on 29 June 2001 stating that he had applied on 100 ewes and that he had 100 ewes in his flock. In order to clarify the position an inspection of his flock was carried out on 16 August 2001. Following the inspection it was accepted that the person named had inadvertently claimed on 200 ewes. His application should have been in respect of 100 ewes. However, the inspection also revealed that he only had 88 ewes in his flock. He was offered an opportunity to provide documentary evidence in respect of the missing ewes. It was satisfactorily established from the documentary evidence that six ewes were disposed post retention but the documentary evidence submitted in respect of the remaining ewes was deemed unsatisfactory. Consequently, he was advised on 10 January 2002 that a shortfall penalty would apply in respect of six ewes. His application has now been finalised for payment on that basis. He was also advised on 10 January 2002 that he could have this decision reviewed by forwarding a formal appeal to the local district inspector. He has not done so to date.</P>
      <P>The person named applied for premium for 78 animals under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme but the application is being processed for 75 animals as he only submitted 75 cattle identity cards. Initial checks on the application revealed a number of cows without dates of last calving and two cows with last calving dates in 1997 all of which require further clarification. An on-farm inspection was carried out on 13 November 2001 at which the spouse of the person named acted as his agent. She was informed again of the requirement to provide evidence of calving dates for a number of animals on the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 22 November 2001 she called into the district livestock office of my Department and submitted evidence, which on examination was found <Col N="322" /> to be inadequate. A letter issued to the person named on 25 January 2002 again reminding him of the outstanding queries. His application will be dealt with further on receipt of the requested information.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 361 and 370 together.</P>
      <P>The prices currently being paid for cattle in Ireland suggest that there is a competitive market for cattle in the west and in the country as a whole. Steer and heifer deadweight prices have increased by 15% and 10% respectively since last November. Live weight prices have increased by 5% in the same period.</P>
      <P>In view of our high self-sufficiency ratio the availability of maximum export outlets is a key factor in the market for Irish cattle. It is the policy of this Government that every export market should be open to Irish cattle and beef and no effort is being spared by my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs or an Bord Bia to bring this about. The major third country markets for Irish beef, Russia and Egypt, are open to Irish beef exporters and it is a matter for the commercial interests involved to develop these markets. With regard to other third country markets, such as Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, each of these is being dealt with in whatever way is most appropriate to the circumstances prevailing in that market. The strategy adopted in each case is kept under constant review by my Department having regard to advice from our embassies in the countries concerned and from an Bord Bia.</P>
      <P>As far as the live export trade is concerned, this outlet plays an important role in maintaining competition in the cattle market place. The live trade is an important outlet for our young weanlings which are exported to the EU and for older animals which are exported both to the EU and to third countries. I have made it clear in discussions in the EU Agricultural Council that I am committed to ensuring that this trade is permitted to continue, while at the same time maintaining high animal welfare standards for cattle during transport.</P>

    <P>It will be noted that there appears to have been a dramatic increase in the number of sheep imported during 2001. This is because prior to 2001 there was a bilateral agreement in place with Northern Ireland under which sheep could be moved freely between both jurisdictions without prior notification. Since the restoration of trade in sheep between this jurisdiction and Northern Ireland in the wake of the foot and mouth crisis, full intra-Community trade rules have been applied to cross-Border trade. These rules require, <i>inter alia</i>, prior notification by the member state of export to the importing member state, and for this reason imports from Northern Ireland are included in the statistics for 2001, but not in those for previous years.</P>

      <P>In 1989 as part of the national strategic plan for the eradication of tuberculosis in cattle, an epidemiology unit known as the tuberculosis investigation unit, TIU, was established by ERAD, in co-operation with Teagasc and the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the unit was to establish a research group, bringing together a number of disciplines from different agencies, to investigate the factors that militate against the eradication of tuberculosis in cattle and to identify means of improving the rate of eradication. Over the years this function has been extended to include other animal diseases of major importance. This change in focus is reflected in its current title, the veterinary epidemiology and tuberculosis investigation unit, VETIU. Projects have been undertaken by members of the unit into a variety of issues falling within this broader remit. The unit has gained particular expertise in such areas as quantitative methods of analysis, geographical information systems, database development and data management. The unit's work is determined and man<Col N="325" /> aged by a project board, which meets regularly to plan for the review progress of the various research projects involved.</P>
    <P>Building on both the success of this model and the experience it has gained over the years, it has been decided to formally extend the remit of, and expand the membership of, this unit. The unit will in future be responsible for carrying out epidemiological and risk assessment studies across all areas in which animal health and husbandry practices could impact on public and/or animal health. The unit will continue its existing work programme on bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis and BSE but in order to reflect the change in membership and scope, the unit will be re-titled the veterinary epidemiology and risk assessment unit VERAU.</P>
    <P>My Department is at present examining the human resource implications of this development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> My Department currently employs two full time experts with formal epidemiological qualifications, one in the veterinary, epidemiology and tuberculosis investigation unit, and one in the BSE unit. Their expertise can and has been used in fields other than those for which they have specific responsibility, when the need arises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is fully committed to maintaining the highest possible number of viable full time and part-time farmers. This is the long-term strategy underpinning the Agri Food 2010 action plan.</P>
      <P>By way of implementation of the action plan, the National Development Plan, 2000-2006 provides 8.5 billion for rural areas and includes almost 5 billion for expenditure specifically on development. Of specific importance to young farmers is the enhanced scheme of installation aid for which 38 million has been assigned in the NDP to encourage young farmers to take over holdings. This scheme provides for a premium of 9,523 which contributes to defraying start-up expenses of eligible young farmers. A total of 793 farmers have availed of this scheme. Coupled with the early retirement scheme this should assist in the earlier and more efficient transfer of land to younger farmers. In addition, a number of on-farm investment schemes with expenditure allocation totalling 329 million is provided for in the NDP in order to maximise production efficiency and ensure economic sustainability.</P>
      <P>A range of tax and social welfare policy measures designed to help support farm families and to encourage the transfer of land to young trained farmers have been introduced since 1998.</P>
      <P>Apart from the various financial incentives, I have emphasised the importance of education and training in making agriculture more attractive and rewarding as a career for young people. In this regard, Teagasc is currently implementing the recommendations of the task force that I established to review the training needs of the agriculture sector. A major step forward has been the mainstreaming of agricultural training in conjunction with the institutes of technology. Teagasc's vocational courses have been benchmarked and upgraded and are now nationally accredited by the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC. Teagasc also provides a comprehensive range of courses tailored to the needs of adult farmers. A multi-annual capital development programme, with Exchequer funding of 14 million in the period 2000-2002, is now being implemented to upgrade the facilities in the colleges.</P>

      <P>The level of cattle prices in the different member states is a function of a number of factors, including, in particular, <Col N="327" /> the preference in certain countries for domestically produced beef, the age at slaughter, the rate of self sufficiency and distance from the market. These factors help to explain the reason prices in member states such as Italy and Spain, which are traditionally major importers of weanlings and store cattle and where animals are slaughtered younger, tend to be higher than in member states such as Ireland, which is a substantial net exporter of live cattle and beef.</P>
      <P>While store prices in Italy and Spain are currently higher than in Ireland, the gap between prices in Ireland and these two member states has narrowed substantially over the past 14 months, with the result that Irish store prices have moved from 85% of the Spanish prices in October 2000 to 94% at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulations governing the export of live cattle are, in the main, laid down in EU directives and are designed, in the context of a Single European Market, to facilitate trade while protecting human and animal health. In this context a number of additional rules relating to the transport of animals, and designed to prevent the spread of disease, were introduced by the European Commission. These rules, governing, <i>inter alia</i>, the use of staging posts as resting points for animals being transported in the European Union, are still in place and applicable to Ireland as to every other EU member state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a national level and in the context of the <Col N="328" /> FMD crisis, I introduced a 30 day standstill rule requiring bought-in animals to remain on the purchaser's premises for a period of 30 days prior to being moved on. This was a sensible precaution designed to slow down the movement of animals and minimise the potential for spreading disease. However, recognising the importance of live exports to Irish agriculture and to the economy generally, I specifically provided for exemptions from this rule for individuals involved in the assembly of animals for export.</P>
    <P>Ireland's rules in relation to the transport of cattle by sea are among the most advanced in the world and require vessels intended to be used for this purpose to undergo an approval process involving a detailed examination by an independent marine surveyor and a veterinary surgeon. My Department has approved a significant number of vessels, with a total of 15 dedicated vessels, and two roll on /roll off vessels &ndash; one approved on a provisional basis pending a trial voyage &ndash; currently being available for live exports. Implementation of these rules has on occasion required shipowners to carry out modifications or other work on their vessels before an approval would be granted or renewed by my Department. It is also the case that where appropriate approvals are conditional and may in some instances involve restrictions on the routes over which particular vessels may carry animals from Ireland. My Department has also refused to approve vessels to carry cattle from Ireland where it was not satisfied that they met the required standards.</P>
    <P>I fully recognise the importance of the live trade to the Irish beef sector. However, a number of member states in the European Union are uneasy about or opposed to the transport of live animals by sea to third countries. There is also concern within the European Parliament on this issue. It can therefore be expected that live export trade will continue to be the focus of close attention. Against this background, it is absolutely essential that Ireland adheres strictly to the animal health and welfare rules in place and that it remains an advocate of high standards in these areas. All elements involved in the live trade need to recognise this reality and ensure that in practice all of the relevant requirements are met consistently. Any other strategy would be short sighted and counter productive and in the long-term would work against the interests of Irish beef farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated in my reply to the Deputy's question on 21 February 2001 that the 1995 guidance notes were under review. The issue of customer identification procedures, including the setting out of more specific guidance on alternative methods of identification in cases where persons are not in a position to produce a passport or driving licence, were considered. The objective was to ensure that measures adopted by institutions should not deny a person access to financial services on the grounds that they do not possess specified identification documentation, while at the same time ensuring that financial institutions are in a position to comply with their legal obligations under the Act. Following approval by the money laundering steering committee, revised guidance notes were issued to all credit institutions in November 2001 with a request that revised procedures be put in place as soon as possible, but no later than 1 May 2002.</P>
      <P>While the revised guidance notes provide additional examples of documents which may be used to verify identity at account opening, the basic recommendation to credit institutions is that they should verify a customer's name by seeking a document which bears a photograph and signature. Wherever possible, a current valid full passport should be requested. There are also other documents that a customer might produce as evidence of identity and each credit institution should decide on the appropriateness of such documents, in the light of other security procedures operated and information available at account opening. If a person cannot satisfy this requirement, the credit institution may adopt alternative identification procedures. Under these procedures, an identification form with a photograph signed by a Garda or documentation or cards issued by a Government Department showing the name of the person, together with a letter or statement from a person of responsibility, such as a solicitor, accountant, doctor, minister of religion, teacher, social worker or community employment scheme supervisor, who is in a position to confirm the person's identity to the credit institution, may be accepted. In such circumstances the person providing the letter or statement must present themselves to the relevant credit institution providing proof of their own identity and verifying their status to the credit institution. A free travel pass issued by a Government Department would need to be accompanied by a letter or statement from a person of responsibility as outlined above. Such a travel pass could also be used to satisfy the requirement for address verification.</P>
      <P>I should stress that it is a matter for each institution to ensure that its procedures satisfy the legal requirement, under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, that financial institutions take reasonable measures to identify their customers.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, arising from the prior need to identify the qualifying trade union members in the most efficient way possible, the tax relief for trade union subscriptions due in respect of the short tax year ended 31 December 2001 will, with the agreement of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, be carried forward for inclusion with the relief appropriate to the 2002 income tax year.</P>
      <P>A consultative process was initiated in 2001, involving the ICTU, employers and the Revenue Commissioners, with a view to identifying the trade union members in question rather than requiring qualifying members to make individual claims to tax offices. The result so far has been the supply of over 250,000 qualifying PPS numbers by employers to revenue. This information will enable revenue to give the tax relief automatically for those cases in the certificates of tax credit to be issued next month for the 2002 tax year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> Those remaining qualifying trade union members, who have not been identified as part of the consultative process with employers and the ICTU, will need to claim the relief in the normal way. The entitlement to the relief will be highlighted in the explanatory leaflet to be issued with all certificates of tax credit, and claims will be accepted in writing or by telephone call. Furthermore, Revenue will continue to work with the ICTU to ensure that as many trade union members as possible avail of this relief.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent relevant information available relates to the income tax year 1998-99 for which some 27,500 claims for tax relief were allowed in respect of local authority services charges in the whole country.</P>
      <P>An estimated breakdown of the figures on a geographical basis is available on the basis of &ldquo;bailiwick&rdquo;, meaning, in this case, the jurisdiction or boundaries within which revenue sheriffs, county registrars or their officers operate for the purposes of enforcement of tax debt. It equates geographically with &ldquo;county&rdquo; while also providing separate breakdowns for &ldquo;city&rdquo; and &ldquo;county&rdquo; in the case of counties Dublin and Cork. In 1998-99, the number of claimants for tax relief on service charges for the Dublin city bailiwick, equivalent to the Dublin Corporation area, was about 5,750.</P>
      <P>In considering the data, however, it should be borne in mind that the allocation by county of PAYE employees, who represent the bulk of the claimants, could be somewhat misleading because each employee is associated in Revenue's computer system with the county in which his or her employer is registered for PAYE purposes, regardless of the address of the actual workplace or of the individual's home address. Thus, the data relating to a company with its headquarters in Dublin could include employees working in any other part of the country. Self-employed persons are associated on the tax record with the address at which the business is located, which may be different to the home address.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that as employees are not required to include income arising from the provision of bus and rail passes by their employers in their tax returns there is no basis on which an estimate of the numbers involved can be provided. In the case of employers, the expense of providing bus and rail passes for employees is allowable as a deduction in arriving at profits for tax purposes. However, the employer's tax return of income does not contain an entry in respect of this item and the employer's profit and loss account does not normally distinguish between this particular expense and other employment related expenses. In these circumstances there is no basis on which a reliable estimate of numbers involved can be provided.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Revenue Commissioners clarified in September 2000 the circumstances in which they would accept salary sacrifice arrangements as qualifying for exemption from benefit-in-kind taxation. The advantages of such an arrangement have been advertised widely by CIE in recent times. In the case of the Civil Service, the travel pass scheme was negotiated with the trade unions and introduced in early November 2001. Under the rules agreed, persons participating in the scheme are required to commit themselves to an annual salary sacrifice in return for the provision of an annual travel pass by their Department or Office. Reaction to the scheme has been positive and I understand from CIE that, to date, almost 3,500 annual travel passes have issued in respect of civil servants with a sales value to CIE of 2.4 million in 2002. In my own Department, almost 25% of staff have applied under the scheme and reports from other Departments indicate they have had a similar response.</P>
      <P>As regards the operation of the arrangements in the private sector and elsewhere, I understand from CIE that following Revenue's clarification of the acceptability of salary sacrifice arrangements, the number of relevant ticket sales rose from almost 2,000 in 2000, with a total value of about 200,000, £157,000, to in excess of 12,500 in the year 2001 with a sales value in excess of 1,400,000.</P>

The final version will be submitted firstly to my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and then to me for signing off. My Department has no objection to members of the staff of the authority who were recruited by the authority in a professional, technical or specialist capacity being considered for an award of added notional years of pensionable service on the basis of the scheme for the award of such &ldquo;professional added years&rdquo; by State-sponsored bodies. Members of the staff of the authority who were formerly civil servants who were entitled to be considered for an award of added notional years of service for superannuation purposes under section 6(3) or 6(4) of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963. Those designated by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in accordance with section 20 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, may also be considered for an award of added notional years of pensionable service on the basis of the scheme for the award of &ldquo;professional added years&rdquo; by State-sponsored bodies. It should be noted that section 21 of the Act provides that such designated persons shall not be granted superannuation benefits on terms and conditions which are less favourable than the terms and conditions which applied to them in relation to such benefits immediately before being transferred to the authority. My Depart<Col N="339" /> ment indicated to the authority in May 2000 that it had no objection to draft arrangements for the purchase of additional notional years of service for superannuation purposes by members of its staff which were submitted by the authority.</P>

      <P>On 28 September 2001, I announced the Government's decision to accept the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the Commission on Public Service Pensions and to establish a working group to advise on implementation, as provided for in the PPF. The operational details of the implementation of the commission's recommendations will be agreed by Government following receipt of a report from the implementation working group. The working group, comprising representatives from the public service unions and relevant Government Departments has been established and held its first meeting on 10 January 2002. The next meeting is scheduled for tomorrow, 31 January 2002. Parallel structures, subject to the same timeframe and remit, are being established in the case of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. My Department is also finalising arrangements for the involvement of pensioners in the working group process and a preliminary meeting was held with pensioner group representatives, in this connection, on 11 December 2001.</P>

      <P>The premises will be completed and ready for occupation in January 2003. The following State sector groups and organisations will be accommodated in the premises: the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the Family Mediation Service, FÁS, the Northern Area Health Board and Dublin City Council. In the community sector, the centre will be occupied by Northside Partnership, Monetary Advice and Budgeting, the Local Employment Service, the Coolock Community Law Centre, NEAR FM and the Northside Citizens Information Centre. There will also be shared crèche, café and conference facilities.</P>
      <P>The Northside Citizens Information Centre, a community information service funded by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, approached local management in the Department in 1998 with a proposal to develop a civic centre in Coolock which would enable the Department to relocate its service from its city centre location in Gardiner Street to Coolock. The Department has been seeking a suitable site for a local office in the Dublin 5-17 area since 1993. In 1999 a site owned by Dublin City Council became available at Bunratty Road, Coolock. The council indicated that it would be prepared to sell the site to the State, provided any development would include accommodation for the various voluntary groups in the area. Following community consultations, the Northside Citizens Information Centre compiled a list of the requirements of the local community and voluntary groups to be accommodated in the civic centre. The brief for the building was developed by a management committee comprised of all State and community sector occupants.</P>

      <P>This provision was introduced in the Finance Act, 1998, and guidelines were issued in August 1999. A problem emerged in relation to certain state aid aspects and a solution had to be negotiated with the European Commission. This resulted in amendments to the tax legislation in the Finance Act, 2001, which confined the capital allowances on the business elements to local services.</P>
      <P>Under the relevant legislation, applications have to be made in the first instance to the local authority in whose area the application for the park and ride facility is proposed. My Department has no up-to-date information on this matter, due to the fact that information from tax returns is not recorded in such a way that it would be possible to provide an estimate of the number of persons who have availed of capital allowances for the construction of park and ride facilities. However, we are asking the Department of the Environment and Local Government to contact all relevant local authorities. When the relevant information has been obtained, the matter will be reviewed by my Department in consultation with the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Public Enterprise and the Dublin Transportation Office.</P>

      <P>On 1 November 2001 Dublin Corporation, in its capacity as contracting authority <Col N="349" /> for the River Tolka flood alleviation study, issued a request for proposal for the appointment of a service provider for the study. A proposal has been received from the consultants in response to the request. The proposal was made in response to a detailed brief, setting out the requirements of the study, prepared by Dublin Corporation in association with the Office of Public Works, Meath County Council and Fingal County Council. Detailed consideration of the proposal and negotiations with the consultants are in progress and it is expected that the study will commence around the end of January or in early February 2002. Funding for the study will be provided from the Vote of the Office of Public Works. The study is due to be completed before the end of 2002. No decision on the works to be undertaken can be made until the study is completed and the findings analysed.</P>

      <P>Candidates who are successful in open competition receive a starting salary equal to the minimum of the incremental pay scale in question, irrespective of whether they are already working in the Civil Service or working in outside employment. However, both categories of candidate may, in certain circumstances, receive a starting salary which exceeds the minimum of the pay scale in question. In the case of an existing civil servant, starting pay may be set at existing pay plus an accrued increment, that portion of the current increment which has been earned by or has been accrued by the officer, if such a level of remuneration is more favourable than the minimum of the grade to which the individual is being appointed. This affords a significant protection to the candidate who is already a civil servant in that it at least preserves his-her existing level of remuneration in all circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a prospective appointee is working outside the Civil Service immediately prior to appointment and is not a civil servant, the employing Department may consider offering the candidate a starting salary above the minimum of the pay scale in question provided that such a provision has been made in the conditions of service set by the Civil Service Commissioners for the competition &ndash; a provision of this type has been made in the case to which the Deputy refers &ndash; the candidate is deemed to have appropriate qualifications and-or experience to merit the payment of additional increments on the pay scale concerned, the candidate can prove that they are currently in outside employment and are being <Col N="350" /> remunerated at some point above the minimum of the incremental pay scale for the position concerned, and the candidate has applied in writing to negotiate their starting salary in advance of accepting their appointment to the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Any higher starting salary which, in compliance with the conditions just outlined, is determined by negotiation between the Civil Service and the prospective appointee, cannot exceed the salary of the individual concerned in their previous employment. Ensuring the appointment of suitability qualified candidates at the most economical rate possible is of critical importance to the employing Departments. Within this overall context, I am satisfied that the existing arrangements afford a significant protection to existing civil servants who are successful in open competition, while at the same time providing a fair and practical framework for dealing with the starting pay of non-civil servant recruits. The limited facility to negotiate a higher starting salary does not confer an automatic entitlement to payment of a starting salary to non-civil servant recruits which is above the minimum of the pay scale. In that light, I do not accept that the rules governing starting pay on recruitment to the Civil Service by open competition discriminate against qualified candidates who are already working in the service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in the short tax year which ran from 6 April to 31 December 2001, a total of 1,584 cases were <Col N="351" /> referred for legal proceedings under section 1078 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 for failure to make tax returns. Of this total, 1,364 cases were in respect of failure to submit income tax returns and 220 were in respect of failure to submit corporation tax returns. Figures available to date show that there were a total of 713 convictions in the nine months to 31 December 2001, some 689 in respect of income tax and 24 in respect of corporation tax returns. These figures are provisional and are likely to increase.</P>
      <P>As regards prosecutions for making incorrect returns, in the nine months to 31 December 2001, there were four such prosecutions under Section 1078 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. One of the cases involved incorrect income tax returns, another involved incorrect VAT and employer PAYE returns, the third case involved incorrect VAT returns, while the remaining case involved incorrect income tax, VAT and employer PAYE returns. Convictions were obtained in all four cases. In three of the cases, a prison sentence was imposed, suspended in one and under appeal in another. Sentence has not, as yet, been imposed in the fourth case. Some 29 further cases are at various stages of investigation with a view to prosecution.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the very high level of evidence and proof required to sustain a criminal prosecution and that prosecutions can only be taken where such evidence is available. The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied with the progress they now are making under their more active criminal prosecutions programme for serious tax evasion. I am also pleased to be in a position to tell the Deputy that the commissioners will shortly launch a new dedicated prosecution division as part of its internal restructuring programme. This will further enhance progress in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no proposals for the introduction of capital allowances for the purchase of sugar beet contracts. The purchase of sugar beet growing contracts does not involve a transfer of quota as is the case with milk quota. The milk quota restructuring scheme was introduced on foot of EU directives and a Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development policy initiative for national agricultural policy reasons. A sugar beet contract restructuring scheme was put in place in 2000 by agreement between Irish Sugar and the Irish Farmers Association. Under that scheme, a grower who wished to surrender contracts could nominate another grower to take the contract. If <Col N="352" /> Irish Sugar agreed to the nomination, a portion of the tonnage involved would become available for reallocation. The operation of that scheme is a matter entirely for the company and the growers and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has no function in the matter. The purchase payments in question are not in respect of an actual purchase of a quota but are paid by individuals to other individuals in respect of nominations for sugar beet growing contracts. There is no actual transfer of quota involved in these transactions and for all these reasons I have no plans for the introduction of capital allowances for the cost incurred in securing the transfer or otherwise of sugar beet growing contract nominations.</P>

While the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has primary responsibility for dealing with wildlife, I understand that it sees its responsibility as conservation of wildlife. I am informed that as the work of the Irish Seal Sanctuary does not impact significantly on overall seal numbers and is primarily of a welfare nature, involving the rehabilitation of individual seals, it does not come within that remit and in the circumstances it is not possible to allocate funding to the Irish Seal Sanctuary.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the Med 1 form has been revised, taking account of the changes brought about by the short tax year in 2001. While the form has a multi-year use, taxpayer's attention is drawn to a prominently displayed notes panel on page 1, to the effect that the figure, for which no relief is due for the year 2001, is £74, 94, in the case of an individual and £148, 188, in the case where the claim is in respect of two or more people. On page 2, the taxpayer is again prompted to deduct £74, 94, or <Col N="353" /> £148, 188, as appropriate, under the heading of deductions, if the claim is in respect of the year 2001 and £100, 127, or £200, 254, for years other than 2001. For the tax year 2002 and subsequent years the threshold will be 125, £98, in the case of an individual and 250, £197, in the case of an individual and his or her dependants. Staff in tax offices will automatically apply the lower deduction figures for the year 2001 in claims where taxpayers have inadvertently used the higher figure.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 411 and 412 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, the minimum payment required for preliminary tax, income tax, must not be less than either 90% of the liability for the year, or 100% of the liability for the previous year, or in the case of a person who pays by direct debit, 105% of liability of the pre-preceding year. Under the relevant statutory provisions, payment of an amount of preliminary tax less than the minimum required means that the full tax liability for the tax year in question is regarded as payable on the <Col N="354" /> preliminary tax due date. Interest is liable to be charged from that date.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that interest charges in relation to preliminary tax can arise either in the normal course of the collection of outstanding tax, or from a specific interest campaign. While it is not feasible to tackle all cases each year, Revenue has in recent years devoted resources to conducting a dedicated interest collection campaign targeted at the most serious cases of non-compliance with the preliminary tax rules. The previous history of compliance by the taxpayer as well as any mitigating factors are taken into account. The following table shows the number of cases that have paid an amount of preliminary tax less than the minimum due:</P>

    <P>Many of these cases failed to meet the relevant preliminary tax obligations by a marginal amount and in many other cases the overall liability was relatively small. Data are not kept as a matter of course on the number of individual interest charges in cases dealt with as part of the ongoing collection of outstanding tax debt and where the preliminary tax payment was less than the minimum required. Revenue has intensified its work in the area of debt management for all taxes. The total amount of interest collected for the above years for all taxes, excluding DIRT, totalled 91.4million. However, as regards the dedicated interest collection campaigns carried out by Revenue, the following tables set out the number of interest charges raised to date for the years for which data are available and the smallest cases which were included in the campaign. Available case data are based on the total tax liability for the year in instances where the preliminary tax payment is less than a specified proportion of the amount due; overall data on the actual underpayments in individual cases are not maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may know, under income tax law, the gain arising from shares acquired as a result of employee share options is chargeable partly to income tax, on the difference between the price paid for the shares and the market value at date of exercise of the option, and partly to capital gains tax, on the difference between the market value at the date of exercise and the proceeds received on any subsequent sale of the shares.</P>
      <P>The case has been made to me that the gain from such shares was more in the nature of a capital receipt than income and should, therefore, be chargeable to capital gains tax only. This treatment, it is argued, would help companies recruit and reward highly skilled and internationally mobile staff as well as facilitating participation by all employees in the fortunes of the company for which they work. Accordingly, in the Finance Act, 2001, after extensive consultation with interested parties, I introduced a scheme providing for favourable tax treatment where, on disposal, the gain from shares acquired as a result of employee share options would be chargeable to capital gains tax only, providing certain conditions were satisfied.</P>
      <P>To receive approval from the Revenue Commissioners for such favourable tax treatment, a share option scheme must be open to all employees and must provide that employees be eligible to participate on similar terms. However, the scheme may contain a key employee element where options can be granted without similar terms or conditions. In such a case, no more than 30% of the total number of shares over which rights are granted in any year can be used for the key employee element. Employees cannot participate in both elements of the scheme in the same year. There is also a minimum retention period of three years between the time the option is granted and the time the shares may be sold by the employee. It was understood at the time from the relevant agencies and representative bodies that a relief along these lines would meet their objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should also be noted that these &ldquo;all employee-similar terms&rdquo; rules are a feature of the other tax relieved employee share schemes; approved profit sharing schemes, employee share ownership plans and save as you earn schemes. I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that, to date, seven employee share option <Col N="357" /> schemes out of 71 applications have been approved for the purpose of the relief and it is estimated that 6,000 individuals within these schemes could benefit. As I mentioned previously, I will continue to monitor this relief to ascertain that it is fulfilling the aims for which it was introduced.</P>

One of the conditions of the revenue job assist scheme is that the employment being taken up by an unemployed person must be capable of lasting at least 12 months. The taxpayer's revenue job assist application indicated that her job would last for ten months. The inspector explained the position to the taxpayer who indicated that she would request her employer to extend the period of her employment to 12 months. The inspector sent the taxpayer an application form to enable her to make a fresh application. When that application is received, the inspector will review the matter to determine whether the taxpayer is eligible for the revenue job assist tax credit.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the person referred to in this question was refused exemption, under transfer of residence provisions, from payment of vehicle registration tax in respect of a vehicle which the person was bringing into the State from the United Kingdom. The refusal was on the basis that the person was unable to provide satisfactory evidence to show that she-he had possession and use of the vehicle in the UK for the required period before it was brought into the State. I understand that the refusal was upheld on appeal under the terms of section 145 of the Finance Act, 2001. I further understand that the person in question has requested a hearing of the case before the appeal commissioners under the terms of section 146 of the Finance Act, 2001. I am informed that the hearing has been granted and the appeal is scheduled for hearing by the appeal commissioners on 11 February 2002. Under the circumstances, it is not appropriate for me to comment further on this matter.</P>

      <P>In June 1998 a preliminary survey of the boiler room in Hawkins House revealed small quantities of asbestos based thermal insulation and, following a tender competition, the material was removed in February 1999.</P>
      <P>In February 1999, during the course of refurbishment works in the main foyer, further quantities of the material were discovered on pipework embedded in the concrete floor. This has been left <i>in situ</i> and completely sealed within the floor area where it poses no threat. A detailed survey of the building carried out in July 1999 uncovered isolated pockets of asbestos based materials in various forms such as ceiling tiles, duct lining and fire doors. These will be removed as necessary during future refurbishment work. At present, left untouched, they pose no health risk.</P>
      <P>At all times during the course of asbestos removal works the occupiers of the building were kept advised of developments. Air tests were carried out before, during and after works to provide assurances that there were no airborne fibres present and that, consequently, there was no danger to staff.</P>

      <P>In the budget for 2000 a sum of £2.5 million, 3,174,345, was provided for special works to alleviate the effects of flooding in south Galway. I established a steering group in January 2000 to bring forward proposals for the most efficient and effective use of those funds. The group comprises representatives from the Irish Farmers Association, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Galway County Council and the Office of Public Works. The group has been examining the feasibility of a number of schemes for the following areas: Cregaclare, Mannin Cross, Kilchreest, Termon, Kiltiernan-Ballinderreen and a number of culvert sites in the Kinvara area. The group has met on six occasions to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme at the most advanced stage of preparation is that for Cregaclare. The cost benefit ratio for this scheme is currently being considered by the Commissioners of Public Works. The proposed schemes for Mannin Cross, Kilchreest and Termon all involve transferring larger volumes of water to adjoining river catchments and, accordingly, require complex investigation and assessment in order to determine downstream impacts. These areas are being monitored <Col N="363" /> on an ongoing basis by consultants and final project reports on feasibility are awaited. Pending the outcome of these investigations into the feasibility of the schemes, it is not possible to give any commitment to work programmes or definitive timescales for them.</P>
    <P>The scheme at Kiltiernan-Ballinderreen involves significant environmental issues. There is also an existing privately executed scheme there. These private works and the surrounding area have been surveyed by the Office of Public Works and are currently the subject of ongoing review by the Office of Public Works in consultation with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. In relation to the two culvert sites in the Kinvara area which were identified for possible works in the south Galway flood report, the Office of Public Works instructed Galway County Council in September 2001 to proceed with these works. Work on these culverts is substantially complete and the costs, up to approximately £200,000, 253,947, committed to works at Kinvara is due to be paid to Galway County Council in 2002. In respect of consultants' studies and reports, £36,189, 45,950, was expended in 2000 and a further £35,741, 45,382, in 2001.</P>

However, I have made inquiries in relation to this case and the company has informed me that an application for a lotto terminal was received from the proprietor of the business concerned in September 1993. Due to the removal of a lotto agency from the area, a review was carried out of all applications for that area, including the one referred to. Following this review, the applicant was informed that he was unsuccessful in obtaining a national lottery retail sales agency. The lotto terminal which had been removed from the area was later relocated to another nearby outlet.</P>
      <P>Should the applicant still be interested in obtaining an agency it is now necessary for a new application form to be completed. As part of the application process, a bank guarantee or bond is sought from successful applicants. The figure required varies from outlet to outlet and is determined by the prospective sales at the outlet concerned.</P>

These provisions will not be available until the Finance Bill, 2002, is published around 11 February 2002 and it is intended to formally notify the Commission of the extension to the scheme as soon as possible thereafter. The timescale for dealing with the notification is a matter for the Commission and every effort will be made to assist it in dealing with the application as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>It is assumed in the context of the question that the Deputy is referring to capital acquisitions tax agricultural relief. Capital acquisitions tax agricultural relief on the inheritance of a farm is a very significant relief which allows the value of agricultural property received by gift or inheritance to be reduced for the purposes of calculating CAT by 90%. It is intended to apply specifically to farmers and consequently applies only where the beneficiary's assets are 80% or more made up of agricultural assets after the gift or inheritance. Qualifying agricultural assets include land, buildings, livestock and machinery.</P>
      <P>The relief cannot be claimed by individuals inheriting non-agricultural property, although business relief may be claimable in such circumstances if the relevant business relief conditions are met. As regards valuation, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the value of agricultural property in the case of an inheritance depends on the market value of property. The market value is the price which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, such property would fetch if sold on the open market on the date on which it is to be valued and subject to such conditions as might reasonably be calculated to obtain for the vendor the best possible price.</P>
      <P>Where it is discovered that property has been undervalued, then revised documentation, including an additional inheritance tax return together with any outstanding tax and interest, should be presented to the capital taxes division of the Revenue Commissioners. In certain circumstances the undervaluation may give rise to a surcharge.</P>

      <P>Provision for the regulation of insurance intermediaries was first introduced into law by Part IV of the Insurance Act 1989. This provided for a relatively simple system of self-regulation by the insurance industry, under the overall responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, introduced detailed procedures for the regulation of investment intermediaries under the regulatory responsibility of the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>As there was considerable blurring at the margins between investment and insurance products, with a significant number of intermediaries engaging in both investment and insurance business, the Insurance Act 2000, allocated regulatory responsibility for insurance intermediaries to the Central Bank, largely in accordance with the parameters set down in the 1995 Act.</P>
      <P>Under the Investment Intermediaries Act, the Central Bank is obliged to set down various codes of conduct and conduct of business rules handbooks for all firms falling within the scope of the Act in order to ensure appropriate consumer protection. Following a lengthy consultation process, the Central Bank produced handbooks, with equivalent measures, both for independent insurance intermediaries and for banks acting as insurance intermediaries. I understand that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which has responsibility for regulating life assurance companies, is due to publish similar codes for that sector. In the meantime, the Irish Insurance Federation has expressed an interest in developing voluntary codes for its members, pending official regulation.</P>
      <P>I understand that the most contentious aspect of the handbooks relates to contact with potential new clients, so called &ldquo;cold-calling&rdquo;. Although the same rules apply to both types of intermediary, banks probably have an advantage over the independent intermediaries, simply because their size and customer base. This is a reflection of general market forces rather than as a result of regulatory practices employed by the Central Bank. The bank continually reviews its codes of conduct in order to identify and address any anomalies that may arise.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to questions on 20 November 2001 in which I outlined the payroll processing schedule which would apply in the run-up to the new year and the reasons for this. This schedule was adhered to during the Christmas and new year period. My Department sent the relevant payroll schedule details to the personnel section of the Houses of the Oireachtas on 30 October 2001. It was emphasised that overtime claims received before 1 p.m. on 20 November would be paid before Christmas and overtime claims received after this deadline would be paid in January 2002. Overtime claims received after the 20 November deadline were processed in order of receipt and were paid on 4 and 11 January 2002.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that under the PAYE system an employer is obliged by the Income Tax (Consolidated) (Emoluments) Regulations 2001, to deduct tax at the date of payment of the emoluments by reference to the employee's tax credits and standard rate cut-off point as at that date. Where emoluments earned in November and December 2001 &ndash; year of assessment 2001 &ndash; are paid in January 2002 &ndash; year of assessment 2002 &ndash; the employer is obliged to deduct tax from those emoluments by reference to the employee's tax credits and standard rate cut off point at the date of payment in January 2002.</P>
      <P>Under the tax credit system, tax is deducted at 20% from the amount of an employee's gross pay up to his or her standard rate cut-off point and on any excess at 42%. The system operates on a cumulative basis. In practice, this means that each week of the tax year the system re-calculates an employee's tax liability up to that week by referring to the salary and overtime already paid and the tax already paid. The employee will, during the year, receive a refund of any excess tax that may have been deducted earlier in the year. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the question of entitlement to a refund of tax paid in 2002 on income earned in 2001 can only be adjudicated upon after the end of the current tax year 31 December 2002. An employee who wishes to apply for a refund of tax may do so after 31 December 2002 by submitting his or her P60 for both years 2001 and 2002 to the Inspector of Taxes, Division 66 unit 669, 85/93 Lower Mount Street, Dublin 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The shorter tax year had no impact on the PRSI exemption limit in 2001. PRSI allowances and thresholds are calculated on a weekly basis and therefore, have been unaffected. A weekly, non-cumulative PRSI free allowance of 127, £100, per week applied to employees' social insurance contributions in classes A, E and H in any week that reckonable earnings exceeded 287, £226. A similar allowance of 26, £20, applied for those in classes B, C and D. Employees covered under classes A, B, C, D, E and H with reckonable weekly earnings of not more than 287, £226, were exempt from paying PRSI for that week.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may refer to the employee PRSI contribution ceiling of 35,870, £28,250, for 2001. When annual earnings are in excess of the relevant contribution ceiling, employees have a period in each contribution year in which no contribution is due, sometimes referred to as the PRSI holiday, the duration of which depends on the level of annual earnings and the point in the tax year at which the earnings ceiling is reached. Up to now, PRSI holidays tended to be concentrated mainly in the first quarter of the calendar year in the lead up to the end of the tax year on 5 April. Prior to the decision to align the tax and calendar years from January 2002, relevant employees could have expected a contribution holiday in the first quarter of 2002. Arising from this alignment their contribution holiday will be deferred until the final quarter of 2002. Although the contribution ceiling was left intact for the short tax year these employees will continue to have two PRSI holidays over the two year period from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2002, as they would have had prior to the changeover, although the second holiday period will now occur mainly in the final quarter of 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the employee contribution ceiling is concerned, the issue is of relevance only to the minority &ndash; an estimated 13% &ndash; of employees who would have annual earnings above the contribution ceiling. I remind the Deputy that this decision was taken at the same time as I announced a reduction of 0.5% in the contri<Col N="371" /> bution rate of class A PRSI, from 4.5% to 4%, in budget 2001, which benefited most employees &ndash; 929,000 employments &ndash; and which was effective from 6 April 2001.</P>

      <P>The Government's aims in its preparations for the changeover were that public sector preparations be completed in good time, that the public be well informed and that the changeover be completed smoothly and efficiently and with minimum disruption to commerce and the public. These aims were achieved. There were essentially six elements in the changeover preparations: legislation; the production and distribution of euro cash; preparations by the public sector; preparations by the private sector; consumer matters; and the provision of public information.</P>
      <P>As regards legislation, the Finance Act 2001, provided for convenient amounts in euro to replace IR£ money amounts in the tax code from 1 January 2002. The Social Welfare Act did the same for the social welfare code. The Euro Changeover (Amounts) Act 2001, provided in necessary cases elsewhere in law for convenient amounts in euro to replace IR£ amounts from 1 January 2002. These, and other similar changes, were introduced with a view to facilitating the day to day transaction of business with the State. In all cases where convenient euro amounts in law were provided for, the Government acted on the principle of favouring the citizen. In July 2001, I signed a ministerial order to withdraw legal tender status from IR£ notes and coins at midnight on 9 February 2002, as recommended in Ireland's cash changeover plan. Previous legislation in 1998 had already adapted Ireland's Central Bank and monetary law to cater for the launch of the euro, while more recent legislation catered for such matters as copyright and counterfeiting.</P>
      <P>Cash production by the Central Bank involved over 200 million euro notes and over 1 billion euro coins. The frontloading of euro cash to banks and the sub-frontloading of retailers ensured that the notes and coins were widely available for the transaction of business in euro from 1 January 2002. Starter packs of euro coins were put on sale to the public from 14 December 2001, mainly through post offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the public sector, each Government Department and body was made responsible for the changeover of its own operations and regular reports confirmed that progress was on target. These preparations included conversion of payroll and accounting systems and staff training. Each Department and body also had to make appropriate arrangements in respect of its own <Col N="372" /> business clients. Thus, for example, the Revenue Commissioners provided business customers with the facility of conducting tax and customs affairs in euro from 1 January 1999. The 2002 Estimates for the public service and my recent budget were presented predominantly in euro.</P>
    <P>The Forfás EMU business awareness campaign was established in 1996 to provide businesses with the information they needed to prepare themselves for the changeover. The campaign distributed a wide range of information materials very extensively and in autumn 2001 a retail training kit, containing among other things, a euro calculator, a detailed training manual and a ready reckoner, was distributed to over 45,000 retailers throughout the country. Similar kits were provided in December to taxi and hackney licence holders. Practical training for retailers and their staff was also provided by FÁS and through business representative organisations.</P>
    <P>The consumer aspects of the changeover were addressed by my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, and by the Director of Consumer Affairs through the national code of practice on the euro changeover. Subscribers to the national code committed themselves to carrying out the changeover to the euro fairly and to providing dual display of prices, as far as practicable, from 1 October 2001.</P>
    <P>As regards the public, the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland carried out very extensive public information and advertising activities. These activities included a range of materials and support mechanisms to meet the needs of low awareness and special needs groups. The final phase of the board's campaign saw nationwide household distributions by An Post of a comprehensive euro handbook and an electronic converter. The board's advertising in late December-early January gave practical advice to the public on how everyone could help the changeover run smoothly.</P>
    <P>The board's cash changeover plan, drawn up in conjunction with the key changeover organisations, was implemented efficiently from 1 January. Early on that day, accounts with financial institutions were converted to euro, ATM machines began dispensing euro notes &ndash; 85% were dispensing in euro by 6 p.m. &ndash; and electronic point of sale systems, which support credit card and similar payments, were also converted to euro. Retailers who opened on that day systematically gave change in euro only or, in some cases, provided exchange facilities so as to enable transactions in euro only at the tills. From 2 January, euro cash became even more widely available through withdrawals from financial institutions, social welfare cash payments and change giving by retailers generally. By the end of the first weekend the bulk of cash transactions was taking place in euro and the changeover was virtually complete within a week. Withdrawal of IR£ cash by the Central Bank is now well in hand.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the changeover went very well. I <Col N="373" /> am glad to take this opportunity on behalf of the Government, and on my own behalf as Minister for Finance, to express our thanks and congratulations to all those involved, including the public at large, for making it so successful.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to claims for the refund of excise duty on diesel used in the provision of school bus services prior to 1 January 1997. Section 94(3)(<i>b</i>) of the Finance Act, 2000, provided a basis for refunds backdated to 1 January 1997 or an earlier date if so prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners. I understand that the Revenue Commissioners will shortly be making an order nominating an earlier date for the purpose of further retrospective refunds. Once this order has been made, all eligible persons may submit claims to their local excise officer for refunds of the mineral oil tax involved. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that all claims covered by the current period are being processed without undue delay.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 450 and 451 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am unclear as to the precise nature of the Deputy's questions, the import of which appears to be that under the income tax system the self-employed face less of a tax burden than those on the same income in the PAYE sector and that the threshold above which tax at the higher rate must be paid is lower for those in PAYE sector than for those who are self-employed. Self-employed persons are subject to exactly the same income tax rates, bands and credits as those in the PAYE sector. The one notable exception to this is that those who are employees rather than self-<Col N="374" /> employed are entitled to an employee tax credit, formerly known as the PAYE credit, which is not available to the self-employed.</P>
    <P>As regards the issue of widening the standard rate band, the Deputy will be aware of the Government's target, shared with the social partners in the PPF and set out in the PPF agreement, to have 80% of income earners paying tax at no more than the standard rate. Band widening is the only method to take people out of the top rate of tax now that tax credits have been introduced. It should also be noted that the PPF provides that the social partners support the policy of establishing a single standard rate band for all individual taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Before the move to widen the standard rate band in budget 2000, single people on incomes less than the average industrial wage were paying at the top rate. For example, single persons on the then average industrial wage of about 22,750 were taxed at the top rate on their marginal income. Budget 2002 has increased the amount for a single person which is taxable at the standard rate to approximately 105% of the average industrial wage for 2002, as projected by my Department. As a result of budget 2002 we are now in a position where 27% of income earners pay tax at the top rate, an improvement of three percentage points on the pre-budget position.</P>

      <P>In budget 2002, I increased the income tax exemption limits for those aged 65 and over by over 20% to 13,000 for single and widowed persons and to 26,000 for married persons. In addition to the above exemption limits, I point out that in the year of bereavement, a widowed person may receive a personal tax credit which is equivalent in value to the married tax credit. In budget 2002, I increased the value of this credit from 2,794 to 3,040. Following the year of bereavement, a widowed parent with a qualifying child or children may qualify for the one-parent family tax credit of 1,520 in addition to the single personal tax credit of 1,520.</P>
      <P>A further credit, the widowed parent credit, is available on a sliding scale for the first five tax years following the year of bereavement. In budget 2002, I also increased these credits significantly to the following:</P>

      <Col N="375" /> Therefore, in the first year following bereavement, a widowed parent would be entitled to aggregate tax credits of 5,640, comprising a single personal credit of 1,520, a one-parent family credit of 1,520 and a widowed parent credit of 2,600.</P>
    <P>For widowed persons with no dependent children, a tax credit which is additional to the basic single personal credit is available after the year of bereavement. In budget 2002, I increased the value of this credit by over 18% to 300. Accordingly, such widowed persons may receive personal tax credits with an aggregate value of 1,820, comprising 300 plus the single personal tax credit of 1,520. I have no plans at this point to increase the above limits further.</P>

      <P>There is no specific CAT relief or exemption where a person takes an inheritance from a relative for whom they had cared. The Deputy refers to a concession along the lines of a favourite relative relief where the beneficiary has contributed to the operation of a business for a number of years. Favourite nephew or niece relief is available only to certain nephews and nieces who take a gift or inheritance of a business from the disponer. This relief is not available to other relatives, such as a cousin or nephew-in-law. In order to qualify the beneficiary must have worked substantially on a full-time basis for the disponer for a minimum of five years ending on the date of the gift or inheritance. If the criteria are met the beneficiary is entitled to the tax free threshold of a child of the disponer, currently 422,148.</P>
      <P>If favourite nephew or niece relief is not available, a nephew or niece in receipt of an inheritance from an uncle or aunt is entitled to the group B threshold which is currently 42,215. This threshold may also apply in the case of the relative referred to by the Deputy. I have no plans to change the existing legislative provisions in this area.</P>

      <P>The aim of the programme is to provide for the sustainable development of the territories through an integrated approach to economic, social and environmental development. The programme will provide further opportunities to encourage innovative joint projects between Irish and Welsh businesses and groups and for the transfer of best practice in various fields. It will cover joint co-operation in business and enterprise development, human resources, rural development, communications in technology and transport, marine and coastal development, heritage, tourism and culture.</P>
      <P>The programme covers the counties of Dublin, Meath, Kildare, Wicklow, Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford. Wexford and south Tipperary in Ireland, and Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion, Conwy, Denbighshire, Gwynedd, Pembrokeshire and Anglesey in Wales. Preparations are being made for the launch of the programme at a ceremony in Dublin Castle involving the Taoiseach and the Welsh First Minister on 11 February. The first monitoring committee meeting of the programme is due to be held in Wales on 11 March 2002.</P>
      <P>The programme has a total budget of 65.5 million, with the European Union contributing 47.6 million through the European Regional Development Fund.

    <P>In the Finance Act, 2000, I introduced an exemption from tax in the case of a gift or inheritance of a dwelling house where it has been the only or main residence of the recipient for a period of three years. In addition, the recipient must not have an interest in any other dwelling house and must continue to reside in the property for a period of six years after the date of the gift or inheritance. Provided the recipient fulfils the qualifying conditions, his or her relationship to the donor is irrelevant. He or she may be a sibling or a stranger and previous home ownership is not relevant. There is no requirement that the donor must have resided in the property.</P>
    <P>As regards recipients who are unable to pay CAT, I am advised that the Revenue Commissioners have power in cases of excessive hardship to postpone payment of tax on such terms as they think fit, including waiver of interest. As part of the terms, in certain circumstances Revenue may, with the agreement of the recipient, seek to register a charge against the property in question. As the Deputy will appreciate, I cannot comment on what will or will not be in the Finance Bill prior to its publication as only some of the items involved were included in the preliminary list of measures for the Bill, which was published on 18 January 2002.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for an t-Árd Chláraitheoir, the Registrar-General of births, deaths and marriages and for local registrars who operate under his general direction. I take it that the Deputy is referring to the number of births registered where the parents are not married to each other. I understand, from information supplied by the Central Statistics Office, that the numbers of births where parents were not married to each other for the years 1998 to 2000 were as follows: 1998, 15,492; 1999, 16,461; 2000, 17,235.</P>
      <P>The Registration of Births and Deaths Acts, 1863 to 1996, set out the particulars to be entered in the register of births and the procedures for registration, including procedures provided by the Status of Children Act, 1987, for the registration and the re-registration of births of children who are not married to each other. These provisions enable the registrar to register such births subject to the requirements set out in section 49 of the Act.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> Copies of all birth entries are made to an t-Árd Chláraitheoir, whose functions include the compilation of a national index to the records of births. However entries in respect of children whose parents are not married to each other are not specifically identified in the index and the information requested by the Deputy is not collated from the records. Where a birth is registered without paternity details, the re-registration of such births to include paternity details can only be effected with an authority issued by an t-Árd Chláraitheoir. The number of authorities issued by an t-Árd Chláraitheoir for the re-registration of births for the years 1998 to 2001 are as follows: 1998, 1,299; 1999, 1,367; 2000, 1,150; 2001, 1,092.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Other than for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically entitled to a medical card, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his\her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>My Department advised the health board chief executive officers last year and again this year that medical card holders should not lose their cards because of increases in social welfare rates announced in the budget.</P>

The Deputy will be aware that many health boards and specialist service providers have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting allied health professionals and specifically speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. This is due primarily to the general shortage of available staff in these grades nationally. Health boards and agencies have been and are continuing to undertake intensive recruitment drives both at home and abroad. My Department has also asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision or an enhancement in line with agreed service developments using the resources allocated to the services.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of health related support services to children with special needs in the Dublin region rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. My Department has therefore asked the chief executive officer of the authority to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and reply to him directly.</P>

      <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Following an assessment of dependency and means, as provided for in the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, sections 22.3 and 22.4 of the regulations, introduced in 1996 following a review of the scheme, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within available resources.</P>
      <P>There is no provision in the nursing home subvention regulations governing this issue. Nevertheless, I understand that, for administrative purposes, a patient may opt to appoint the health board as an agent to collect their pension. In some circumstances, for example, where an applicant has been granted an enhanced subvention, a patient may opt to have the health board collect the pension on their behalf. However, such an arrangement should only be entered into for the convenience, and with the agreement, of the patient. This issue is one of a number being examined by my Department in the context of the ongoing review of the nursing home subvention scheme. It is intended to bring forward proposals at a future date, based on this review as well as the ombudsman's report and the expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme together with experience gained since the introduction of the scheme.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, that many children who beg on the streets are from the Traveller community, with an increasing number coming from the Roma community. The area health boards provide a range of services for Traveller children and their families, for asylum seeking and refugee families and for unaccompanied minor asylum seekers. The ERHA set up a working group last <Col N="381" /> year to examine the services currently available for children who beg and to determine how these services can be improved. The working group comprises the Garda, a range of Traveller organisations, the Leanbh service of the ISPCC, the crisis intervention service, Focus Ireland and the ERHA. It is due to complete its work by September 2002.</P>
      <P>The Leanbh service was set up specifically by the ISPCC to work with children begging. It works closely with the Garda, schools and training centres and employs childhood support workers. It works with children and their families. The Leanbh service comprises an outreach and street service and operates for 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Government has allocated 114,300 over the next three years to support the project. The Children Act, 2001, updates the law in relation to child begging. The provisions of the Act make it an offence for a child to be allowed, or induced, by an adult to beg in any street or public place or to make house to house calls for the purpose of begging or receiving alms. The Act will be brought into operation on a phased basis. The National Children's Office is at present drawing up a plan for the implementation of the Act, which it hopes to submit to Government soon.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by ERHA that if a member of the public is concerned about a child begging they should contact either the local Garda station, the Leanbh service or the local health board community care area. My Department has asked the regional chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to reply to the Deputy directly in relation to the individual cases of children begging which have been raised.</P>

      <P>I am committed to supporting the establishment of a lung transplant facility in Ireland and to ensuring that the programme, when introduced, will be in a position to match the highest international standards in lung and heart and lung transplantation. The Mater Hospital in Dublin has been designated as the surgical site for the programme. The provision of a transplant unit forms part of a major capital development at the Mater Hospital. An expert consultative group, which includes representatives of the Mater Hospital and the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, was established to advise on the development of the programme. The report of the consultative group has recently been received and is being considered by my Department. My Department will be in contact with the Hospital and the ERHA shortly to progress the matter. Pending the establishment of an Irish based programme, an agreement is in place with the Freeman Hospital in the UK for the treatment of Irish patients requiring a lung or heart and lung transplant.</P>

      <P>The payment of foster care allowance is legislated for under the Child Care Act, 1991, and governed by the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations, 1995, and the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations, 1995. The provision of aftercare for a child who has reached the age of 18 is legislated for in section 45 of the Child Care Act, 1991, which states that a child may be assisted for so long as the board is satisfied as to his-her need for assistance provided that the child has not reached the age of 21. If the person has reached the age of 21 and is pursuing a course of education, the board may only continue to provide assistance until the completion of the course of education in which he-she is engaged.</P>
      <P>The Act and the provisions therein do not take specific note of those placed in foster care who may have a disability. However, the working group on foster care report Foster Care &ndash; A Child Centred Partnership examined this area and made a number of recommendations in relation to the issue of children with a disability in foster care. These recommendations include three which relate directly to adults with disabilities. In relation to aftercare plans, the working group recommended that these plans should aim to ensure a seamless transition into the adult disability services. The working group recommended that appropriate financial assistance should be provided for carers who continue to care for adults with an intellectual disability who were in a long-term foster care arrangement. It also recommended that where an adult with a physical disability is highly dependent on his or her carers such financial support should be provided as part of the aftercare plan.</P>
      <P>The Government has approved in principle the recommendations of the report. The provision of financial assistance for former foster children with disabilities who remain with their former foster carers is currently being examined by my Department with a view to identifying a mechanism which will enable the health boards to continue to support both the young adults in question and their foster families.</P>

      <P>The provision of health related support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, including spina bifida, is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. It is my policy that health services be developed to meet the individual requirements of people with physical and sensory disabilities. This is achieved through service plans which are developed by the health boards. The overall thrust of these services is to enable people with physical and sensory disabilities to live as independently as possible within the community. A comprehensive community support service includes residential respite care, day care, home support services, including personal assistance services, nursing, therapy, counselling and family support, aids and appliances. Specialised residential care services are also required.</P>

    <P>Other key recommendations of the report include the provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators; the need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; concerted recruitment from overseas; the establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a patient-centred health service; and a career struc<Col N="387" /> ture, workload, working practices and skills-mix issues encompassed in context of the report of the expert group on various health professions published in April 2000.</P>
    <P>I am working closely with my colleague the Minister for Education and Science to ensure the rapid provision of the additional places as an urgent priority. To this end an interagency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study. The bids have now been received and are currently being assessed by the interagency working group.</P>

    <P>In 2001, I provided additional funding of 190,000 for orthodontic services in the board, of <Col N="389" /> which 127,000 was for its orthodontic initiative. This has enabled the board to recruit additional staff and the chief executive officer has informed me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter, there were 2,024 patients in orthodontic treatment in the board. This is an increase of 175 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared to the corresponding figure at the end of the June 2001 quarter. The waiting time for treatment in the board is approximately 12 months.</P>
    <P>In addition, structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service such as the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. My Department has funded the training of a dentist from the SEHB for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. The dentist concerned commenced training in October last and discussions on providing an additional training course in 2002 are also under way. I am confident that these combined measures will further improve the delivery of orthodontics in the SEHB.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than for persons aged seventy years and over, who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services <Col N="390" /> for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide health services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>The issue of eligibility was considered in the context of the new national health strategy, Quality and Fairness, A Health System For You, launched by the Government. The strategy outlines a number of measures designed to improve eligibility for health services which the Government has committed itself to introducing over a number of years. Among the measures proposed is an increase in access to medical cards. In addition to the recent extension of eligibility to all persons aged 70 years and over, the strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low incomes who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased to provide a 40.63 million investment package in 2000-2001 aimed at alleviating anticipated service pressures and maintaining services to patients in the acute hospital sector, particularly over the winter period. The investment package was targeted at a number of key service areas, including the contracting of private nursing home beds, the provision of a range of aids and supports for use by older people and the recruitment of an additional 29 accident and emergency consultants and 19 consultant anaesthetists to the hospital system.</P>
      <P>In relation to the recruitment of additional consultants, I requested of Comhairle na nOspidéal that these posts be filled initially on a temporary basis, given the long lead-in time normally associated with the recruitment of consultants. I have been informed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the health boards that to date 12 accident and emergency consultants and 11 consultant anaesthetists have been appointed.</P>
      <P>The investment package also provided for the contracting of additional private nursing home places by the ERHA and the health boards. These places are for patients whose acute phase of treatment has been completed but who require further care in an non-acute setting. The ERHA and the health boards contracted over 700 beds under the initiative and this has helped to free up acute beds for patients awaiting admission to hospital.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Southern Health Board has received a significantly increased number of claims from patients for enhanced subvention payments in accordance with Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993. It is a matter for the board to determine the extent to which it can meet such claims consistent with its requirement to live within its overall revenue allocation and taking account of the fact that such enhanced payments are discretionary. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in the interest of avoiding hardship to individual patients, my Department has been in regular contact with the board in an effort to find a solution which would take cognisance of the considerations outlined above. A resolution was found to meet the most immediate individual problems which included the making available of additional funding to the Southern Health Board to help meet the costs of the scheme. Arrangements were also made to allow the board use funding originally earmarked for the winter <Col N="395" /> initiative. This funding was used by the board in advance of the re-commencement of the winter initiative on 1 October 2001. A further sum was made available to the Southern Health Board to meet the cost of the winter initiative from 1 October last and the board's allocation was adjusted accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The domiciliary care allowance, DCA, was introduced in 1973 by way of circular 24/73 and is payable under section 61 of the Health Act, 1970. This is a monthly allowance paid by health boards from date of application up to the age of 16 years. It provides financial support to the carers of eligible children whose disability is so severe that they require care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. The allowance is not paid in respect of children maintained on a full time basis in special/residential institutions. However, the allowance may be paid on a pro-rata basis for the number of nights spent at home, e.g. weekends or holidays, by eligible children who attend special/residential institutions.</P>
      <P>To be eligible to receive this allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: be under 16 years of age; the disability must be present at the time of the application and be likely to last for at least a year; the disability must be so severe that they require from another person constant care or supervision, that is, continual or continuous care or supervision substantially greater than that which would normally be required by a child of the same age; and the constant care or supervision must be provided by the parents themselves or by arrangement by them with another person or persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only the means of the child should be taken into account in determining eligibility for an allowance &ndash; the means of the parents should not be considered. Means in this context include pay<Col N="396" /> ments of compensation, following a court action or otherwise, in respect of injuries or disabilities sustained. Where there is more than one eligible child in a family, a full DCA payment should be made in respect of each eligible child. In some cases, depending on medical condition, eligibility is reviewed at regular intervals, for example if the child's condition improves, he/she may no longer meet the criteria for eligibility. The maximum rate of DCA is 179.80 per month, effective from 1 January 2002.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1 January 2000, children under the age of two years were not regarded as eligible for DCA as it was felt that such children normally required constant care and attention in any event. From the 1 January 2000 this requirement was abolished. However, the requirement that the disability must be present for six months prior to the date of application was not removed at this stage. My Department notified all health boards of this modification in a letter dated 8 December 1999.</P>
    <P>On 1 April 2001, the requirement that the disability must have been present for six months prior to the date of application was abolished. From that date, children who meet the eligibility criteria could become eligible for DCA from birth, with payment being made from the date of application. My Department notified all health boards of this modification in a letter dated 16 March 2001.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's further questions which refer to the administration of the DCA scheme by health boards, my Department is aware that discrepancies/anomalies still exist in the administration of these allowances. My Department has been very conscious of the need to ensure that all the disability related allowances which come under its aegis are administered by the health boards in a standardised manner.</P>
    <P>In this context, my Department requested a working group consisting of health board representatives to examine these allowances/grants. I understand that the group's work is at an advanced stage. When the working group has submitted its report to my Department, it will be considered with a view to standardising the administration of these allowances across all health boards. Where there are financial implications, my Department will consult with the Department of Finance in the context of the many competing demands for resources within the health services.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, if the Deputy is aware of any individual case affected by an existing anomaly in the administration of the disability related allowances which come under the aegis of my Department, he should forward the details to me and I will ask the health board to investigate the matter.</P>

      <P>Nursing students on the diploma programmes receive an annual non-means tested maintenance grant of 4,533, £3,570, as well as other financial supports.  Student nurses also benefit from a book allowance of 343, £270, along with a uniform allowance of 203, £160. Student nurses are also entitled to receive free meals on a seven-day per week basis in designated health institutions.</P>
      <P>In early 1998, a new allowance of 25, £20, per week was introduced to assist students undertaking external clinical placements. This is payable where it is necessary for the students to find alternative accommodation away from their normal place of residence for the duration of the placement. This allowance is now 51, £40, per week with effect from 1 June 2001. Students undertaking external clinical placements also receive a weekly travel pass.</P>
      <P>Since the abolition of third level fees does not extend to the nursing diploma programmes, the student nurses' fees continue to be paid by the relevant health agency on their behalf. The average annual fee is about 2,032, £1,600.</P>
      <P>The average annual total value of these supports is some 8,888, £7,000, per nursing student, which compares most favourably with the level of funding available to other third level students.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than for persons aged seventy years and over, who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide <Col N="398" /> general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide health services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders and people with conditions other than those covered under the long-term illness scheme can avail of the drug payment scheme, which was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme and drug refund scheme. Under the drug payment scheme no individual or family unit pays more than 53.33, £42, per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The primary aim of the drugs payments scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and it is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and significantly to improve the cashflow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
      <P>The issue of eligibility was considered in the context of the new national health strategy, Quality and Fairness, A Health System For You, launched by the Government. The strategy outlines a number of measures designed to improve eligibility for health services which the Government has committed itself to introducing over a number of years. Amongst the measures proposed is an increase in access to medical cards. In addition to the recent extension of eligibility to all persons aged 70 years and over, the strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low incomes who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 254 of 4 December 2001, and on the Adjournment Debate on 9 October, the company has come to the conclusion that, on the basis of available evidence, the discrepancies in the hand-<Col N="399" /> written vaccination records which have been discovered are due to transcription errors. In relation to the three further discrepancies referred to in the Adjournment Debate, the company has advised that it has checked a second group of hand-written adverse event lists for the period in question and has discovered three discrepancies relating to batch numbers cited on the hand-written table as follows. Two batch numbers are cited which correspond to distilled water vials. A further batch number listed corresponds to Black Leg vaccine. In all three cases, a single digit transcription error would give a number corresponding to a Trivax batch number in use in the EHB region at that time.</P>
      <P>My Department officials wrote to the company on 30 October 2001 asking it to keep the Department informed should any further details come to light in this matter, and in the event of the company so doing, I will advise the Deputy of same at the earliest opportunity.</P>

The assessment of entitlement to and payment of the mobility allowance in any individual case is a matter for the relevant health board. My Department has therefore asked the regional chief executive, Eastern Regional Health Authority, to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and reply to him directly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 502, 514, 522, 527, 531, 534, 554 and 689 together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputies that on Wednesday, 23 January 2002, I received the Irish Medicine Board's report entitled Herbal Medicines Project Final Report. This report is currently being considered in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 2000, in light of difficulties in the licensing of herbal medicinal products under current medicines legislation, in particular in relation to proving efficacy in accordance with existing EU requirements, I requested the Irish Medicines Board to develop a proposal for an interim national licensing system for traditional and alter<Col N="403" /> native medicinal products, including herbal medicinal products. A herbal medicines project manager was appointed to the IMB in September 2000 and a press advertisement was placed on 29 September 2000 in three national newspapers outlining the aim of the project and inviting public comment on all aspects of a possible interim national licensing scheme for traditional, alternative and-or herbal medicinal products. The total number of submissions received by the IMB was 41, all of which were accepted and reviewed. In addition, the IMB formally contacted those organisations known to it to have an interest in herbal medicines as follows: Consumers for Health Choice, the Health Products Alliance, the Irish Association of Health Stores, the Irish Association of Medicinal Herbalists, the Irish Health Trade Association and Irish Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine. The Professional Register of Traditional Chinese Medicine also contacted the IMB directly and was duly invited to make a submission.</P>
    <P>As part of the consultation process, the public and interested parties were asked to make nominations for membership of an <i>ad hoc</i> Scientific Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products. The intention was that this committee should comprise of a panel of scientific experts having a special knowledge in herbal medicines and-or related areas and that its role would be to advise and assist the IMB in matters pertaining to the development of an interim national licensing scheme. Dr. Desmond Corrigan, director of the school of pharmacy, Trinity College, Dublin, was nominated by a member of the public to serve on the <i>ad hoc</i> SCHMP and was also proposed by the IMB. Dr. Corrigan is an acknowledged international expert in herbal medicine/ pharmacognosy and has been involved in this area at a European level for more than ten years. On this basis, the IMB invited Dr. Corrigan to be chairperson of the <i>ad hoc</i> SCHMP.</P>
    <P>The establishment of this committee was considered important for the success of the project and a total of 15 names were proposed as part of the consultation process. In addition, the IMB nominated eight candidates for consideration by the chairperson. Dr. Corrigan suggested one additional nominee. From the suggestions received, the chairperson selected those people whom he deemed appropriate and who were available to join the committee. The members were chosen with a view to establishing a balanced committee consisting of people from a variety of backgrounds who would effectively reflect and represent the many views and opinions in this area.</P>
    <P>It was the intention that the <i>ad hoc</i> SCHMB be established as a group of experts and not as a group representing interested parties. Consequently, members with expertise in the following disciplines were appointed to the committee and were required to sign a confidentiality agreement and to declare any conflicts of interest: pharmac<Col N="404" /> ognosy, phytochemistry, complementary medicine, general and Chinese medicine, general and herbal medicine, herbal medicine and pharmacy and aromatherapy. The committee had a total of seven meetings from December 2000 to September 2001.</P>
    <P>The following organisations also agreed to participate in the consultation process the College of Anaesthetists of the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland, Consumers for Health Choice, the European Herbal Practitioners Association, the International Society of Professional Aromatherapists &ndash; Irish Branch, the Irish and International Aromatherapy Association, the Irish Association of Health Stores, the Irish Association of Medical Herbalists, the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Irish Health Trade Association, the Irish Herbal Practitioners Asociation, the Irish Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine, the National Institute of Medical Herbalists and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In September 2001, the <i>ad hoc</i> SCHMP agreed the final draft of the herbal medicines project report prior to its release for public consultation. This consultation process was available to the public through the IMB website for a period of four weeks from 1 November 2001 and, following representations, I arranged for the closing date for public comment to be extended by a further four weeks to 27 December 2001. A total of 86 responses was received and these were all discussed by the committee and the IMB at a meeting in January 2002. I understand that both the report and the IMB-SCHMP review of responses received through the public consultation have now been placed on the Irish Medicine Board's website.</P>
    <P>The Deputies should be aware that it is not the intention of the IMB-SCHMP proposal that safe and favourite remedies would no longer be available for sale to the general public. On the contrary the IMB-SCHMP wishes to ensure the continued availability of safe traditional medicinal products for sale in pharmacies, health food stores and supermarkets. Under the proposed scheme the consumer will have an assurance that the registered traditional medicinal products they buy are produced to an appropriate quality standard; safe under the proposed conditions of use; can be expected to act in accordance with an established tradition of use; and are appropriately labelled.</P>
    <P>The Deputies should also be aware that a proposed EU Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products was agreed by the European Commission on 17 January 2002. This proposal will now be sent to the European Parliament and Council. I understand that the IMB-SCHMP proposal for an interim national licensing scheme is broadly in line with the proposed EU directive. Both the IMB's proposal and the proposed EU directive are currently being examined in my Department. As a follow up to the publication of its report, I have requested the IMB to organise <Col N="405" /> a seminar for interested parties which will offer further scope to review the report's implications.</P>
    <P>Like the Deputies, I have also received many representations about this proposal and I will be considering these in the context of our examination of the IMB report and the proposed EU directive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Eoin Ryan, has overall responsibility to ensure that a coordinated, integrated response to the problems posed by drug misuse is in place.</P>
      <P>In so far as my Department is concerned the objectives of the health response to the drug problem are based on two key elements, reducing the number of people turning to drug misuse in the first instance through information, education and prevention programmes and providing a range of treatment options for those addicted to drugs, the ultimate objective of which is a return to a drug free lifestyle.</P>
      <P>My Department, through the health promotion unit, runs or is involved in a number of initiatives which are aimed at tackling and reducing the number of young people misusing substances. These initiatives include supporting drug education and prevention programmes and social and personal health education &ndash; a broad based lifeskills programme for junior certificate students in schools. A support service to implement this programme has been established through a partnership between my Department and the Department of Education and Science, in conjunction with health boards, Marino Institute and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.</P>
      <P>The substance abuse prevention programme, On My Own Two Feet, will be incorporated into the SPHE programme in the future and the Walk Tall programme will continue to be implemented in primary schools. Teachers and schools are also often supported by regional health education officers from the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the youth sector the national youth health programme has been developed through a partnership between my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the National Youth Council of Ireland. This programme provides training and support for a range of initiatives aimed at the youth sector nation-wide. The programmes supported include the youth work support pack for dealing with the drugs issue, Knowledge is Power and Drink Awareness for Everyone. A range of other training and support is offered to youth groups and <Col N="406" /> youth work leaders to assist them to deal with the issue of drugs, alcohol and smoking as they arise in their work. Also within the youth sector a substantial number of drugs education workers have been appointed and supported.</P>
    <P>Within the community setting Drugs Questions, Local Answers is a community-based programme offered by health boards which aims to activate local communities to assess the drug problem specific to their own area and then to look at ways in which the community can respond to the issues arising. The programme was developed by the health promotion unit of my Department and is delivered regionally by local people who have been trained in delivering the programme. Being Well is another community-based programme which has been developed by the health promotion unit. This programme encourages people to take a holistic approach to their health but also looks specifically at smoking and alcohol. Again this programme is supported by regional health boards and delivered by local people, who have been appropriately trained.</P>
    <P>The health boards also support a range of parenting interventions such as Family, Communication and Self Esteem which is a parenting programme equipping parents to pro-actively deal with the issue of drugs that may arise within the home. Health boards also fund a number of voluntary organisations whose work involves prevention and treatment of drug misuse. Of course the Health Promotion Unit also provides a wide range of resource materials which are available free of charge among health boards.</P>
    <P>Services for drug users in all health boards have increased substantially over the last number of years. Funding has been provided to the regional health boards to considerably strengthen the infrastructure for the delivery of drugs services. In the eastern region, treatment services have expanded from 12 locations in early 1997 to the current 57. The number of people receiving treatment has risen from 1,914 in 1997 to 5,865 at the end of December 2001. In an independent review of the drug services of the Eastern Health Board published in 2000 the authors found that, &ldquo;There has been a remarkable degree of activity and expansion within the services in the EHB over the past four to five years . . . A programme of service expansion was embarked on that is probably one of the more innovative community drug service programmes in Europe&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also know that a new national drugs strategy which sets out a series of specific objectives and actions for dealing with this serious problem over the next seven years was published last May. The national drugs strategy recommends 100 actions. My Department will have a major responsibility in implementing a number of these and a special working group, chaired by the deputy secretary general, has been established to drive their implementation.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these actions, many of which involve a multisectoral approach, will have a positive impact on the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of the Department of Health and Children is to maintain older people in dignity and independence at home in accordance with their wishes, as expressed in many research studies, to restore to independence at home those older people who become ill or dependent, to encourage and support the care of older people in their own community by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies and to provide a high quality of hospital and residential care for older people when they can no longer be maintained in dignity and independence at home. This overall approach is emphasised in the recently published health strategy.</P>
      <P>Additional revenue funding for the development of services for older people has increased significantly from 12.7 million in 1997 to an additional 72.91 million in 2001, including nursing home subvention funding. This resulted in over 1,300 additional staff being approved for services for older people between 1997 and 2001. Between 1998 and 2001 over 550 additional beds have been provided in new community nursing units and over 1,250 day places per week were provided in new day care centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional funding of 87.807 million is being made available in 2002 for services for older people to include, <i>inter alia</i>, the following: 2.093 million for enhancing the scope of the home help service to cover more people and to provide more hours for existing clients, as well as providing training courses; 2.815 million for the improvement of community support structures, specifically geared towards the support of older people in their homes, through a range of measures; 1.029 million for carers support. This continues the initiative which began in 1999 to help carers through the provision of, or payment for, a specific service, e.g. respite or assistance in caring; 0.451 million to the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland for the provision of day care; 0.172 million to a number of voluntary groups; 3.228 million for the improvement in staff ratios to help cope with the growing level of dependency in extended care facilities; 26.974 million for improvements in the nursing home subvention scheme; 6.488 million under demographics, for the provision of services for older people, i.e., continuing-extended care and community based services to respond to additional pressures on the system; 34 million to commence the implementation of the provisions in the new health strategy under services for older people, including funding for voluntary organisations and 10.557 million for the improvement and enhancement of existing services, e.g., additional funding provided to com<Col N="408" /> munity nursing units, day care centres, community services, as well as a contribution towards improvements in home help pay, and for innovative approaches to the delivery of services for older people at a local level.</P>
    <P>It was decided in 1999 to double the income threshold for persons aged 70 years and over for the purpose of medical card assessment in three phases: phase one, in March 1999, phase two in March 2000 and phase three in March 2001.</P>
    <P>In the budget of December 2000 a decision was made to grant medical cards automatically to all persons aged 70 years and over applying for a medical card for the first time in the community, regardless of their income. This initiative was implemented with effect from 1 July 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Beaumont Hospital and the Mater Hospital, a range of measures have been taken to assist both hospitals in coping with pressure on their accident and emergency departments. These measures include, in the case of Beaumont Hospital, the provision of an additional 37 beds, arising from the national review of bed capacity which will be designated for elective work and which will allow the hospital to schedule urgent cases more effectively and thereby avoid patients being admitted through A&amp;E. Further proposals from Beaumont in relation to the provision of additional beds in 2003 and beyond will be considered as part of the next phase of the national review of bed capacity; additional long-stay beds are becoming available in the hospital's catchment area; a new 50 bed unit in Lusk was opened by the Northern Area Health Board in November 2001 &ndash; it will be fully operational in February 2002 &ndash; and this will increase the number of public extended-care beds in the area; a new joint project between the Northern Area Health Board and Beaumont Hospital was initiated and funded by the Eastern Regional Health Authority in 2001. Called the Home First project, this is designed to allow elderly patients to return home after hospitalisation with the necessary support services being provided in their homes. The hospital also introduced an outreach chronic obstructive pulmonary disease service in 2001. This service is provided to patients in their own homes and avoids unnecessary A&amp;E attendances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, a major re-development is planned which will include expanded and improved facilities and the construction of a new children's hospital (replacing the existing children's hospital <Col N="409" /> at Temple Street) on the hospital Campus. A new accident and emergency department will be part of this re-development. Initiatives approved within the last year to improve services in the Mater's accident and emergency department include the following; the re-organisation of services for medical emergency admissions through a project known as the medical emergency division, to improve the flow of patients through the department thereby decreasing delays for patients awaiting admission to in-patient beds; the provision of a chest pain assessment unit and a respiratory unit; the appointment of nurse practitioners and cardiac nurses; and the appointment of patient liaison officers to provide information and support services for patients awaiting treatment.</P>
    <P>At national level I have requested Comhairle na nOspidéal to review the structure, operation and staffing of A&amp;E services and departments with the aim of improving the provision and quality of patient care. Comhairle has been engaged in an extensive consultation process, meeting with and receiving submissions from representatives of each health board, relevant voluntary hospitals, appropriate professional bodies and other interested parties. It has also obtained information on attendances in each A&amp;E department and has also reviewed extensive literature regarding A&amp;E services in Britain, Europe, the US, Canada and Australia. I am informed by Comhairle that the report is expected to be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>The new health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, outlines a number of initiatives which will be taken to improve the operation of A&amp;E departments including the establishment of 24-hour GP co-operatives which will help reduce demand from, and treat appropriately, patients who would otherwise attend at an A&amp;E department; the establishment of minor injury units to ensure appropriate treatment and management of non-urgent cases; the use of chest pain clinics, respiratory clinics and in-house specialist teams to fast-track patients as appropriate; the re-organisation of diagnostic services to ensure increased access to, and availability of, services at busy times in A&amp;E departments; the appointment of advanced nurse practitioners &ndash; emergency &ndash; in acute hospitals; the use of admission protocols to ensure that emergency patients will be the only group of patients admitted to hospital through A&amp;E departments.</P>

      <P>Dedicated funding is provided to health agencies under the waiting list initiative to enable hospitals <Col N="410" /> carry out waiting list procedures. In 2002 funding of 43.81 million has been indicated to health agencies to enable them to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times.</P>
      <P>The total number of patients on public hospital in-patient waiting lists at 30 September 2001, as reported by health agencies, was 26,345, a drop of 11% on the comparative figure for 2000. The number of adults waiting for more than 12 months for treatment in target specialties has fallen by 17% and the number of children waiting for more than six months for treatment in target specialties has fallen by 8.5% in the same period.</P>
      <P>The new health strategy, which I launched recently, will provide a framework for the reform of the acute hospital system and improved access for public patients. It includes a plan covering the actions required to address the issue of waiting lists and particularly waiting times. The targets set out in the strategy are that by the end of 2002 no adult will wait longer than 12 months and no child will wait longer than six months for treatment, by the end of 2003 no adult will wait longer than six months and no child will wait longer than three months for treatment and by the end of 2004 no public patients will wait longer than three months for treatment. A new dedicated treatment purchase fund will be used for the purpose of purchasing treatments for public patients. It will be a matter for those charged with the operation of the treatment purchase fund to identify the needs and to source appropriate procedures either in Ireland or, if necessary, from abroad.</P>
      <P>The single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. In this context a comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted in both the acute and non-acute sectors. The review, which I launched recently, has focused primarily on the emerging need to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and long-terms. I recently announced the commissioning of an additional 709 acute beds in public hospitals at a cost of 65 million. This is the first phase of the provision of an additional 3,000 beds over the period to 2011, as announced in the health strategy.</P>
      <P>The strategy outlines further measures which are designed to address the issues of capacity and efficiency in the delivery of services. A strategic partnership will be developed with the private sector in providing services for public patients and a national hospital agency will be set up to plan the configuration of hospital services. I am confident that these measures will result in a more accessible and equitable acute hospital system for public patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The cross-departmental team, chaired by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, was established in September 1998. My Department is represented on this team, whose purpose is to develop an integrated response to the many issues which affect homeless people, such as emergency, transitional and long-term accommodation, health, education, employment and home-making. The report of the Cross-Departmental Team on Homelessness &ndash; An Integrated Strategy, was published in May 2000 and is currently being implemented by my Department, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the other Departments concerned. The main elements of the strategy are the establishment of a homeless forum in every city and county and the preparation of three year action plans by the local authorities and health boards, together with the voluntary bodies. It is my understanding that the work of the homeless fora is at an advanced stage, with many of the action plans either complete or nearing completion.</P>
      <P>The main difficulty in relation to adult homelessness has been in the Dublin area and in order to address this, the Eastern Regional Health Authority has appointed a director of homelessness who is working closely with the three area health boards in implementing the strategy Homelessness &ndash; An Integrated Strategy.</P>
      <P>Specifically, the work of the three area health boards includes: the appointment of area co-ordinators who will be responsible for the implementation of the health and care aspects of the plan; better take up of medical cards for those who are homeless; the establishment of two multidisciplinary teams whose composition include nurses, doctors, community welfare officers, social workers, care attendants, community psychiatric nurses and outreach drug workers who will connect with and support homeless people quickly and effectively and link into mainstream services; the provision of a dedicated dental service for homeless people; improved discharge procedures for people who are homeless; improved mental health services for people who are homeless and improved access to addiction services for homeless people including those who have alcohol problems. The action plan detailing the work in the above areas includes timescales for each of the main work areas.</P>
      <P>Another key element of the strategy is the commitment that the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform each have institutions under their aegis and each will develop and publish strategies to prevent homelessness amongst those at risk, leaving institutional care. My Department's preventative strategy is now complete and is due to be published shortly by the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has also shown total commitment to tackling youth homelessness. In October <Col N="412" /> last, the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, launched the youth homelessness strategy which complements the Government's strategy on adult and family homelessness published by the Department of Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>The primary goal of the youth homelessness strategy is to reduce and if possible eliminate youth homelessness through preventative strategies and where a child becomes homeless to ensure that s/he benefits from a comprehensive range of services aimed at reintegrating him-her into his-her community as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Each health board is currently in the process of drawing up a two year youth homelessness implementation plan following consultation with relevant statutory and voluntary providers in line with specific measures, responsive services and planning and administrative supports. The three area health boards in the eastern region will develop a joint regional implementation plan.</P>
    <P>The strategy also requires a range of other bodies in the public sector, including schools, the National Education Welfare Board, local authorities, the city and county development boards to either support the actions of health boards or take specific steps themselves. At national level, given the cross-spectral dimensions of youth homelessness, the National Children's Office has lead responsibility for driving and co-ordinating the actions necessary to ensure the successful implementation of the strategy.</P>
    <P>Additional funding of 5 million was provided in 2002 towards the cost of implementation of the youth homelessness strategy. This brings to 17 million the amount invested in youth homelessness services since the Government came into office.</P>
    <P>As the main difficulty in regard to youth homelessness has been in the Dublin area, a comprehensive package of child care service developments was agreed in 2000 to tackle youth homelessness and some of the key provisions of the package included the appointment of a director of homelessness in 2000 and the appointment of an additional assistant chief executive in each of the three area health boards to allow for the enhanced provision of child care and youth homelessness services; the expansion and restructuring of the outreach services to ensure vulnerable young children are aware of all the new facilities and can avail of them; a provider forum which brings together the key statutory and voluntary service providers in the youth homelessness field; a review of existing facilities and sourcing of properties to provide additional hostel/residential care accommodation, taking account of emergency, short-term, downstream and mainstream child care residential facilities between 60 and 70 &ndash; approximately &ndash; extra places have been provided; the development of multidisciplinary teams to target young people at risk and/or out of home. Family resource centres, specialist services for children with addiction problems were also provided for.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="413" /> Services for homeless children are provided by the other health boards and generally these are provided as part of the child protection and welfare services. Emergency and other facilities have been developed in Cork, Limerick, Galway and other centres to cater for youth homelessness. Additional funding has been allocated to support these services.</P>
    <P>With the increase in emergency, longer term and specialist provision for young homeless people in Dublin, as well as expanded services in Cork and Limerick, there is a bed available for each young homeless person.</P>

      <P>Between 1997 and the end of 2001 my Department invested additional revenue and capital funding amounting to £205 million, 260.3 million, in the services for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. This has brought on stream around 1,600 new residential places, 2,400 new day places and 395 new respite places. In addition to the new residential, respite and day places, many individuals have received an enhanced level of service, including an upgraded level of residential care, more appropriate day placements or increased access to multidisciplinary support, social or leisure activities. For example, as a result of the 2001 development programme, over 5,000 people benefited to some extent from the new or enhanced level of services which came on stream.</P>
      <P>There has been significant progress in the provision of more appropriate services and accommodation for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in psychiatric hospitals or other inappropriate placements. The number of persons with an intellectual disability or autism in psychiatric hospitals at the end of 2001 was 503, down from 970 in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 2002 additional revenue funding amounting to 25 million has been allocated for the further development of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. This funding is in addition to the 13.825 million revenue funding which has already been made available to the services to meet the full year costs of the 2001 development programme and identified needs in existing services. A total of 12.7 million capital funding has also been made available to the services in 2002. This funding will provide for the following new service developments: over 100 new residential places, 75 new respite places, 600 new day places, the further enhancement of health related support services for children with an intellectual disability or autism, the continuation of the programme to transfer persons with <Col N="414" /> an intellectual disability or autism from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements and the further enhancement of specialist support services.</P>
    <P>This funding will enable the health boards and specialist service providers to continue to build on the very significant developments which have taken place in the services particularly over the last two years.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. I have initiated a range of measures to substantially increase the capacity of the orthodontic services and reduce the waiting times for orthodontic treatment.</P>
      <P>Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service such as the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>My Department has provided additional funding of 0.932 million for orthodontic services in 2002 of which 541,000 was for a specialist training programme in orthodontics. Six dentists from the health boards, four of which are from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, commenced their training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications last October. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also under way.</P>
      <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Post Graduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes.</P>
      <P>In 2001, I provided an additional 2.971 million for the orthodontic service in the ERHA of which 2.044 million was for an initiative. Under this initiative, the authority has recruited additional staff including two consultant orthodontists and two specialists in orthodontics. A six surgery facility and a five surgery facility at Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit and St. James's Hospital orthodontic unit, respectively, have also been developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, under this initiative, my Department is exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both <Col N="415" /> by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the ERHA has informed me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter, there were 3,776 patients in orthodontic treatment in the authority. This is an increase of 488 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the corresponding figure at the end of the September 2001 quarter. The number of patients awaiting assessment and treatment has also decreased by 2,189 for the same period.</P>

      <P>General practitioners who hold GMS contracts are obliged to ensure that an out of hours service is available to their patients.

In addition, most health boards have facilitated the establishment of out of hours co-operatives.</P>
      <P>The overall position is as follows: in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area a limited general practitioner service from the sites of St. James's Hospital (DubDoc) and St. Vincent's Hospital (EastDoc) together with the KDoc general practitioner co-operative which operates in the South-Western Area Health Board area of the authority based at Naas. KDoc, North EastDoc &ndash; the North-Eastern Health Board &ndash; CareDoc &ndash; the South-Eastern Health Board &ndash; SouthDoc &ndash; the Southern Health Board &ndash; and NOWDoc &ndash; the North-Western health Board &ndash; all provide general practitioner cover for the hours of operation of their respective co-ops, which is normally evenings, weekends and public holidays but normally for the patients of the doctors participating in the co-ops.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to note that 10 million was made available in budget 2002 for the further development of out of hours co-operatives during the current year.

      <P>By virtue of the designation under section 13 of the Act, licences may be only granted for the purpose of research, forensic analysis, or in respect of the use of the drug as an essential intermediate or starting material in an industrial manufacturing process. Licences may also be granted in the case of certain low Tetrahydrocannabinol plant varieties of cannabis for the growing of hemp. Furthermore, the Minister must be satisfied in regard to the scientific or medical justification offered in support of the grant of any licence involving any of the designated controlled drugs such as cannabis.</P>
      <P>I am aware that claims are being made in respect of cannabis about the possible benefits for patients suffering from certain conditions such as multiple sclerosis and glaucoma. However, these medical claims are not currently supported by the results of recognised medical research.</P>
      <P>If, however, an application were to be made to me for a licence under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, and the orders and regulations made thereunder, which proposed the conduct of research into the therapeutic use of cannabis, in circumstances where the approval of the Irish Medicines Board under the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987, were to be forthcoming and which would be likely to obtain the necessary approval of the appropriate ethics committee under that Act, I would be prepared to give serious consideration to the grant of the required licence(s) under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the authority that the proposed refurbishment programme for this health centre will be extensive and is subject to planning permission. The refurbished health centre will contain a reception area, waiting area, four clinics, five offices, community welfare office, a meeting room, storeroom, public toilets, staff toilets/shower and staff tea room. The plans for the refurbishment have been finalised and application for planning permission is imminent. Planning permission will take three months and the construction time is estimated at six months. The Eastern Regional Health Authority envisages that the refurbished health centre will be open for business before the end of 2002. The sum of 635,000 has been earmarked for this project.</P>

      <P>The background to this issue is that the Irish Medicines Board received an application for authorisation for this medicinal product in June 2000 under the European mutual recognition licensing procedure. The proposed indication was emergency contraception within 72 hours of unprotected sexual intercourse or failure of a contraceptive method.</P>
      <P>No products with this indication have ever been licensed in Ireland. The precise mechanisms of action of this product were unclear and one of the suggestions was that it could act as an abortifacient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As there are strict timelines to the European mutual recognition licensing procedure, the Irish Medicines Board informed the company of difficulties in assessing the product in that timeframe <Col N="423" /> from the legal and medical aspects, and the company subsequently withdrew its application.</P>
    <P>Over the past year the Irish Medicines Board has discussed this product with medical experts and with the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Legal advice was obtained and the issue was also discussed at the IMB's clinical expert group, the advisory committee on human medicines and subsequently at an IMB board meeting.</P>
    <P>Based on all the advice available the board, at its October 2001 meeting, classified this product as a contraceptive.</P>

      <P>The determination of eligibility for medical cards is a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer are unable to provide medical services for themselves and/or their dependants without undue hardship. It is possible for a medical card to be issued to one member of a family but there is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for sufferers from autism or in cases where a domiciliary care allowance is paid. However, persons suffering from autism are entitled to apply to their local health board for a long-term illness card which entitles the holder to a range of prescribed approved drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition.</P>
      <P>The domiciliary care allowance is paid by health boards in respect of eligible children up to the age of sixteen years who are so severely disabled or mentally handicapped that they require care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age.</P>

    <P>The sponsorship scheme is open to employees working in the Irish public health service, such as health care assistants and ward attendants, who are directly involved in the delivery of care to patients/clients within a nursing context. Applicants must have at least five year's relevant service in the Irish public health service on 1 January of the year in which they apply for sponsorship, and must qualify as a mature code applicant for a place on the pre-registration nursing degree programme under the system operated by the Central Applications Office (CAO) on behalf of the higher education institutions.</P>
    <P>Successful applicants who give a written commitment to work as nurses for a period of five years following successful completion of the nursing degree programme will be allowed to retain their existing substantive salary throughout the four years of the programme, and will continue to be entitled to normal incremental progression up to the maximum of that scale.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> This new sponsorship scheme has been warmly welcomed by the health service unions representing care assistants as providing an exciting new career development path for their members. Nursing students undertaking the present three-year pre-registration nursing diploma programme receive a non-means-tested maintenance grant of 4,533 &ndash; £3,570 &ndash; per annum. The reason this grant is not means-tested, and why it is almost double the level of the maximum higher education grant, is in recognition of the 48 week commitment that nursing diploma students are required to give to the programme in each of the three years.</P>
    <P>The education modules of the new four year nursing degree programme, however, will take place around academic semesters. This will allow nursing students to become more like other third-level students with similar holiday periods. On this basis, and in accordance with a specific recommendation of the Commission on Nursing, the student nurse grant will be the same as that available to other students and be means-tested. However, a uniform allowance and financial support for nursing degree students undertaking distant clinical placements will continue to be provided.</P>

      <P>Under arrangements for public hospital services introduced in June 1991, everyone, regardless of income is entitled to public hospital and public consultant services subject only to modest statutory charges, from which medical card holders are exempt. At present these charges are set at £26/33 per night, subject to a maximum of £260/330 in any 12 month period in respect of in-patient public hospital services.</P>
      <P>Alternatively, one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital. Any patient, whether a medical card holder or not, who opts for treatment in a private hospital or as a private patient in a public hospital is liable for the costs relating to such treatment.</P>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, the determination of eligibility for health services is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, and neither I nor my Department has a function in the matter. I would like to add that health boards have discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused.</P>

      <P>Pre-registration nursing education is being integrated into the higher education sector from the start of the next academic year, 2002-03, to coincide with the implementation of a new four-year degree programme. This will implement a <Col N="431" /> central recommendation of the Commission on Nursing.</P>
      <P>The Government has approved my proposals for a capital building and equipment programme costing 223.5 million, £176 million, to facilitate the full integration of nursing degree students into the higher education sector. This programme is due to be completed by September 2004 and will ensure that nursing students are accommodated in purpose built schools of nursing studies at thirteen higher education sites throughout the country, including National University of Ireland, Galway.</P>
      <P>With the integration of pre-registration nursing education into the higher education sector, the various schools of nursing around the country, including the school at Portiuncula Hospital, are being phased out. A number of the schools will become centres of nursing education providing a range of post-registration educational and training services to nurses and midwives within given catchment areas.</P>
      <P>Discussions have been taking place between health service employers and the nursing unions in relation to the number and location of centres of nursing education. There are currently five pre-registration schools of nursing in the Western Health Board area and there is agreement between the parties that two centres of nursing education are required, one in Galway and one in Castlebar.</P>
      <P>It is important to understand that, in addition to nurses attending education and training courses external to the hospital, in-service education and training for nurses will continue to be delivered at Portiuncula Hospital. There will be no diminution in the level of in-service training currently provided by the hospital to its nursing staff. Moreover, should the nurse tutors who are currently employed at the school of nursing at Portiuncula Hospital decide not to transfer to National University of Ireland, Galway, on the commencement of the new nursing degree programme this year, they will continue to be based in Portiuncula Hospital. These arrangements are not contrary to the purchase agreement entered into by the Western Health Board on behalf of my Department.</P>

      <P>Effective rehabilitation draws on a broad range of services to meet the particular needs of patients, with the objective of helping patients return to normal life in the community. In light of this, a large element of rehabilitation services <Col N="432" /> is provided on a day or community care basis. The relevant services range from specialist in-patient medical rehabilitation through such services as physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy. These services are often initiated in the context of in-patient treatment for another underlying illness or condition and subsequently continued on a day care basis or in the community, consistent with patients needs. It is, therefore, more appropriate to focus on ensuring that rehabilitation is provided to patients in the most appropriate setting rather than on the basis of identifying dedicated services for particular categories of patients other than those requiring specialist in-patient medical rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>The provision of appropriate rehabilitation care is also an integral element of the service required by many types of patients and proposals for development of additional capacity in the services that contribute to rehabilitation are often presented in the context of proposals for broader service developments. For example, the report of the review group on the waiting list initiative identified that a significant proportion of acute hospital beds were being inappropriately used by patients who did not need, or who no longer needed, acute hospital care. This problem arises due to a shortage of places in the areas of step-down or convalescent care, rehabilitation facilities and community based services which reduce the need to use acute hospital care.</P>
      <P>Rehabilitation services also have an important role for groups such as people with physical disabilities. Rehabilitation services in this area are provided as part of a comprehensive range of community based services. Since this Government came into office, just over 175 million additional funding has been invested in the maintenance and development of services, including young chronic sick (constant nursing care), respite and therapy services, for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
      <P>I regard the continued development of rehabilitation services as an essential element of providing appropriate care to patients across a wide range of health services. Indicative of this is the fact that under the health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health Strategy for You, my Department is committed to develop an action plan for rehabilitation services in 2002. Work has already commenced in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 558 and 563 together.</P>
      <P>I presume the Deputies are referring to the assessment of family circumstances of subvention applicants (Articles 9.1/9.2 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993), as well as the assessment of applicant's means which allows health boards disregard a sum equivalent to one fifth of the old age non-contributory pension when assessing these means and calculating the amount of subvention to be paid (Article 8.2 of the regulations).</P>
      <P>An additional allocation of £4 million was made available in 1998 to six of the eight health boards, where Article 8.2 was applied incorrectly, to meet the costs of arrears payments in respect of the full implementation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 and subsequent regulations. As the Deputies are aware, there were delays in making these payments to subvention recipients.</P>
      <P>In relation to the assessment of children's circumstances, a decision was taken to make payments to people adversely affected by this provision. A group representing the Department and the health boards/Eastern Regional Health Authority was established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. Instructions as to how the payments should be made was issued by my Department and funding was made available to commence the making of these payments from the 1 November 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are proposals to arrange for compensation for late payments by health boards to clients; arrangements have not been finalised. My Department, in consultation with the health boards and the Department of Finance, is currently examining the situation, with a view to putting a process in place. Similar compensation schemes are in operation in the Department of <Col N="434" /> Social, Community and Family Affairs and these are being examined to ensure consistency of approach.</P>

      <Col N="435" /> Considerable progress has been made by the South-Eastern Health Board in reducing waiting list numbers. The total number of people on public hospital waiting lists in the South-Eastern Health Board area at 30 September 2001 was 1,382, compared to the number awaiting treatment at 30 September 2000 which was 1,935. This represents an overall decrease of 553 or 29% over the 12 month period.</P>
    <P>This year 2.03 million has already been indicated to the board by my Department under the waiting list initiative to enable hospitals to carry out waiting list procedures. My Department has asked the chief executive officer of the board to outline to the Deputy the proposals he has to further reduce waiting lists and waiting times at the hospitals in the area.</P>

People with disabilities attending sheltered work services currently retain their primary and secondary state <Col N="438" /> disability benefits. Many service users also receive an additional weekly payment from service providers. If persons availing of these services were to receive the minimum wage they would lose their entitlement to state disability benefits.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Form E111 provides entitlement to immediate necessary medical treatment during a temporary stay in a European Union or European Economic Area member state on the same basis as if the person was an insured resident of that member state. It is important to note that in some instances accessing these services may incur a charge. However, such charges would be in line with charges imposed on residents of that country. Temporary stays are periods where a person cannot be considered resident in a member state under that country's legislation. Form E111 is available from health boards and all persons ordinarily resident in Ireland are eligible to obtain this form. This covers public treatment only and any person who opts for private treatment is liable for any expenses incurred. It is important to remember that the E111 may not cover all one's medical expenses. The E112 and the E128 are two other forms that enable Irish residents to access treatment in other member states. Where an individual requires specific treatment which is necessary and which is not available in Ireland, a health board may authorise the provision of treatment in another member state with the E112 form.</P>
      <P>Under European Union regulations, form E128 certifies entitlement to full health cover for posted workers, their dependants who accompany them abroad, and also for students and their dependants who accompany them abroad for the duration of the course. The E128 form does not need to be registered in the country of posting or study but is presented at the time treatment is required. E128 holders are entitled to full medical treatment in any EEA country for any condition, whether or not it is of an emergency nature. The form covers students and accompanying family dependants who are temporarily staying in another EEA member country to study a recognised course. The E128 does not cover family dependants who do not accompany the student abroad for the duration of the course. Such dependants, who may visit the student for a holiday, are entitled to form E111 for urgent treatment only. As the E128 is not a registration form, health boards are advised that medical cards should not be issued as a general rule. However, a health board may decide to issue a medical card because of a particular individual's medical circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The availability of forms E111 in health board clinics and the categories of health board personnel entitled to sign these forms are operational <Col N="440" /> matters for the relevant health board or authority. Accordingly, I have written to the chairman of the health board chief executive officers' group, Mr. Paul Robinson, asking him to investigate the matter and reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than for persons aged seventy years and over, who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even if a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers <Col N="442" /> that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide health services for themselves or their dependants without hardship. Membership of VHI or BUPA does not affect entitlement to obtain or retain a medical card.</P>
    <P>The issue of eligibility was considered in the context of the new national health strategy, Quality and Fairness, A Health System For You, launched by the Government in November 2001. The strategy outlines a number of measures designed to improve eligibility for health services which the Government has committed itself to introducing over a number of years. Amongst the measures proposed is an increase in access to medical cards. In addition to the recent extension of eligibility to all persons aged 70 years and over, the strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low incomes who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability.</P>

      <P>Further additional funding has been provided by my Department in 2002 to build on the developments which have been put in place in services to persons with autism and those with an intellectual disability over the last number of years. A total of 51.525 million in revenue and capital has been allocated to these services this year to put in place a range of new developments to meet the full-year cost of the 2001 development programme and to meet identified needs in existing services. From the 25 million provided for the development of new services nationally, 1.878 million has been allocated to the Mid-Western Health Board region. The precise details of the services to be developed in the region are a matter for the board in line with the guidelines issued by my Department and the priorities which have been identified for the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to services provided to support persons with autism in the Mid-Western Health Board region, I have been informed by the board that during the past year, area intervention teams commenced in Limerick and Clare with the appointment of a service co-ordinator and clinical psychologist in each area and a social work team leader in Clare. A total of 54 children and 13 adults benefited from these services. A needs-assessment survey has been completed in Clare <Col N="443" /> which is being used to inform the intervention teams in relation to the required models of service provision. A sub-committee has been formed to review the current structures and service provision with a view to finalising an action plan for autism spectrum disorder services in 2002. The board, in partnership with other service providers, will continue to develop services for persons within the autistic spectrum. This will include the further development of catchment area teams.</P>
    <P>In the case of the individual mentioned by the Deputy, I have outlined the information given to me by the board in relation to the services provided for him in a separate letter as it would not be appropriate to give personal information in my reply. I would however like to assure the Deputy that this Government is committed to the ongoing development of support services for persons with autism and their families.</P>

The overall funding for the health capital programme announced in the 2002 Abridged Estimates volume and on budget day provides for the planning, design, construction and equipping of these projects.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 582 to 584, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board has sought approval from my Department to commence the process of selecting and appointing a design team in order to ensure progression of capital projects at the hospital and in particular to prepare a development control plan for the hospital. This is now being considered by my Department in conjunction with the board. However, the overall development brief is now being finalised by the project team appointed to undertake this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft brief does not propose any increase in the current total number of beds at the hospital <Col N="446" /> under the proposed first phase of developments. The question of providing additional beds will be considered in the context of the review of bed capacity, the first phase of which was the recently published national review of bed capacity. The next phases of the review will involve an examination and assessment of bed needs by speciality and by region. In the knowledge that the review of bed capacity may have a requirement that Ennis General Hospital increase its current bed capacity the project team will make the necessary provision in the development brief to allow for expansion of capacity at the hospital.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the project team is considering various priority areas for inclusion in the first phase of development. These will be confirmed in due course, taking account of factors such as the availability of resources, the need to maintain existing services during construction, and the orderly planning and development of the site. It would be premature to list particular elements to be given priority pending consideration of the issues outlined above. It is, however, agreed that the first phase of work will be drawn from the priority areas identified by the hospital and noted in the draft development brief, and will also include infrastructural upgrade, necessary for the longer-term benefit of the hospital.</P>

Specific funding is provided in respect of the childhood immunisation programme to each health board and health authority, who in turn determine how this funding should be utilised in their region. In 2001 an additional sum of 1.27 million, or £1 million, was provided to the health boards in respect of the childhood immunisation programme, and a further additional sum of 2.445 million has been provided in respect of this programme in the current year.</P>
      <P>The immunisation information systems currently in place in each health board and health authority were recently examined as part of the national immunisation steering committee review which was set up to address a wide range of issues relating to the childhood and other immunisation programmes including the identification of issues that are hampering the achievement of uptake targets. The committee established working groups to address specific aspects of the immunisation programme. The terms of reference of the IT working group were to review current and future IT systems requirements for the optimum management and delivery of all immunisation and vaccination programmes, with a view to initiating the development of a common IT system to be operated in all health boards. The report of the committee is at final draft stage and is expected to be submitted to my Department shortly.</P>

    <P>My Department advised the health board chief executive officers last year and again this year that medical card holders should not lose their cards because of the increases in social welfare rates announced in the budget.</P>

The completion of Phase 2B will see the number of beds at the hospital increase from 198 to 296. The increase in medical beds, in particular, will alleviate the difficulties encountered each winter in the hospital, while on the surgical side the development of day services and five-day wards will facilitate greater throughput and further improve the ratio of day cases to in-patient work.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 590 and 671 together.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency. Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility, category 1, medical card holders, or limited eligibility, category 2, for health services. Health boards normally regard a person as ordinarily resident in Ireland if he or she satisfies the health board that it is his or her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year. Persons in category 1 are medical card holders and they are entitled to a full range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants' services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants' services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.</P>
      <P>Persons in category 2 or non-medical-card holders are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards, including consultants' services and out-patient public hospital services, including consultants' services. Attendance at accident and emergency departments is subject to a charge of 31.70 where the patient does not have a referral note from his or her doctor. This charge applies only to the first visit in any episode of care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a non-EU national is deemed not to be ordinarily resident in Ireland, the health board <Col N="450" /> may either apply the full economic charge for any services provided or provide urgent necessary treatment at a reduced charge or without charge, as deemed appropriate by the health board, where application of the full economic charge would cause undue hardship. My Department does not hold any information on comparable charges for non-EU nationals in other European Union countries.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 591 and 676 together.</P>
      <P>The matter raised by the Deputies is an important and sensitive one and is being handled by the North-Eastern Health Board which has statutory responsibility for the provision of services in its functional area. The chief executive officer of the board took immediate steps to deal with the situation as soon as he became aware of it and the board initiated a review which was carried out by experts nominated by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The report of the review group has been referred by the board to the Medical Council in the context of its statutory functions as set out in the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978.</P>
      <P>I went to Drogheda in July 2000 and met with many of the women involved and heard their experiences at first hand. I had a further meeting with a group representing the women involved in October, 2000. The matter is being investigated by the Medical Council. I will await the outcome of the council's deliberations prior to deciding what further measures may be required in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 601 and 602 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Charges can be made under two sets of regulations in respect of long-stay or extended care. They can be made under the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1965 and charges may also be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 1987. In deciding the <Col N="454" /> amount to be contributed, health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the relevant health board, payment would cause undue hardship.</P>
    <P>I am advised that it is the policy of the Western Health Board in accordance with the above regulations to allow the recipients of long term care in State nursing homes retain an allowance of 30.50. I am not aware of any instances in which this allowance has been withheld in these circumstances. If the Deputy is aware of any such cases, he might consider bringing them to my attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the <Col N="461" /> responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has informed me that as the consultant orthodontist prioritises the severity of need of patients for orthodontic treatment, he carries out all assessments using guidelines issued by my Department. The waiting list for treatment in the board arose as a result of staff losses between 1995 and 1999. In fact, between mid-1996 and mid-1997 the board had no consultant orthodontist; consequently, during this period almost no patients were taken off the waiting list for treatment even though patients were still being added to it.</P>
      <P>I have initiated a range of measures to substantially increase the capacity of the orthodontic services and reduce the waiting times for orthodontic treatment. Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service, such as the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. Two dentists from the Western Health Board are currently in training at the Dublin Dental School and Hospital for specialist dentist in orthodontics qualifications. Both are due to qualify in June this year. Once they achieve their specialist qualification, they will be in a position to take over responsibility for a larger number of patients and further reduce the number of patients waiting for treatment.</P>
      <P>Additional funding of 0.628 million was allocated to the Western Health Board in 2001 for orthodontic services of which 0.533 million was for an orthodontic initiative in the board. The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has informed me that a specialist in orthodontics has been recruited and commenced working in the board's orthodontic unit in late November. The board has also made arrangements with private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. The chief executive officer has also informed me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter, there were 1,511 patients in orthodontic treatment in the board. This is an increase of 83 patients in orthodontic treatment in comparison with the corresponding figure at the end of the June 2001 quarter. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures in the orthodontic initiative that I announced last year take effect.</P>

The chief executive officer has also informed me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter there were 1,511 patients in orthodontic treatment in the board. This is an increase of 83 patients in orthodontic treatment in comparison with the corresponding figure at the end of the June 2001 quarter.

      <P>The consultation process undertaken with key stakeholders in the health service in the context of the development of the health strategy was the most comprehensive ever undertaken in this country. As part of this process I wrote personally to several hundred organisations, including the Hospital Pharmacists Association of Ireland, inviting them to make submissions. Over 300 organisations made submissions, including the Hospital Pharmacists Association of Ireland. The views and proposals contained in the submissions fed into the development of the strategy in a very significant way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I established a national health strategy consultative forum, representative of key stakeholders, to provide advice on key themes and the direction of the strategy. Unfortunately, due to the numbers involved it was not possible to invite all representative groups to participate directly in the forum. However, in inviting these groups to make a written submission I am satisfied that their views and proposals were taken into account. On account of the foot and mouth restrictions and the pressure of work involved in the preparation of the health strategy I was unable to meet, as planned, with the Hospital Pharmacists Association of Ireland in March 2001 but indicated at the time the availability of officials from my Department to meet with the association. Unfortunately, owing to the very heavy schedule of Government and departmental business, it did not prove possible for me to meet with the Hospital Pharmacists Association of Ireland subsequently. However, I have asked my officials to make contact with the association to <Col N="464" /> arrange a meeting as soon as possible and to brief me fully afterwards in relation to key issues for the hospital pharmacy profession.</P>

      <P>Foster care allowances are paid in respect of children who are placed in foster care or relative care under the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations, 1995 or the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations, 1995. The children in respect of whom these allowances are paid must be in the care of the health board, under the Child Care Act, 1991, either on a voluntary basis or by court order.</P>
      <P>The responsibility for providing social work support for a family or the issue of taking a child into care under the provisions of the Act are matters for the local health board. In response to a previous parliamentary question and representations made in relation to this case, the ERHA has advised my Department that the children concerned are not in the care of the health board under the provisions of the Child Care Act and therefore they are not entitled to the foster care allowance. They have been advised of this by the South Western Area Health Board. The board has advised them that they may be entitled to claim child benefit and orphan's allowance or pension, which are paid by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. They have been further advised to contact that Department on the matter.</P>

      <P>The OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland was critical of certain restrictions in Irish professions, including the retail pharmaceutical sector. A high-level group has been established to examine the recommendations made in the report. One area addressed by the report was the statutory system for granting community pharmacy contracts. In order to assess and respond to the issues raised by the OECD, I have set up the pharmacy review group, which will report to the high-level group. The group has begun its work under the chairmanship of Dr. Michael Mortell, former President of University College Cork, and it is expected that it will make recommendations to the high level group within 6-12 months.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the group take account of consumer concerns by requiring it to consult consumer interests widely. As well as a general invitation for public submissions, a wide range of consumer organisations have been specifically invited to make submissions. The terms of reference and membership of the group are, in the context of regulatory reform in Ireland and the vital role played by pharmacies in the health service, to review the pharmacy regulations with a view to:</P>
      <P>&ndash;facilitating the provision, maintenance and development of a high quality pharmacy service to service recipients;</P>
      <P>&ndash;maximising the potential to increase competition within the sector with a view to ensuring lower prices and improved services to the consumer as envisaged in the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland;</P>
      <P>&ndash;assessing and responding to the recommendations in the OECD report on restrictions on the location of pharmacies while ensuring, as far as possible, a reasonable spread of pharmacies so that the service is convenient to the consumer;</P>
      <P>&ndash;assessing and responding to the recommendations in the OECD report on the current restrictions on pharmacists educated in other EU countries with a view to enabling this country to discontinue the derogation incorporated in Article 2.2 of Council Directive 85/433/EEC on the free movement of pharmacists;</P>
      <P>&ndash;ensuring a high quality pharmacy service in remote and deprived areas, to include an assessment of the dispensing doctor scheme;</P>
      <P>&ndash;ensuring that the opening hours of pharmacies facilitate consumers and meet all reasonable health needs of the population in its area;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;assessing the extent to which the 1996 regulations, together with the community pharmacy contract, have achieved their objectives in regard to locating new pharmacies in remote <Col N="466" /> or disadvantaged areas and their impact on the quality of the service provided by pharmacists to the public;</P>
    <P>&ndash;taking full account of pharmacy regulation in other jurisdictions;</P>
    <P>&ndash;taking full account of the wider regulatory framework in which pharmacy operates;</P>
    <P>&ndash;considering how a universal service and public service obligation can be identified and met and assessing any funding consequences which may arise.</P>
    <P>In conducting the review the group is to consult widely with all interests involved and, in particular, consumer interests.</P>
    <P>The membership of the pharmacy review group is as follows: </P>
    <P>Chairperson: Dr. Michael Mortell, UCC.</P>

      <P>The broad thrust of admission policy in the psychiatric services in this country is to admit to in-patient care those patients whose illnesses, on the basis of clinical judgment in each individual case, are deemed to be of such severity as to be inappropriate for community-based treatment. In any assessment of whether an individual should be admitted to hospital for in-patient care, it is normal practice to take into consideration the account given by relatives of the evolution of an individual's illness, his or her social circumstances or any other matters bearing on the advisability of in-patient as against community-based care. A review of mental health services is to be carried out as outlined in the new health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You.</P>

      <P>There are a number of issues raised in the letter referred to by the Deputy. In the first instance the organisation and provision of services at University College Hospital Galway is the responsibility of the Western Health Board. My Department has asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate the position as outlined in the letter and reply to the Deputy directly. The other two issues raised in the letter are being addressed in the context of the implementation of the Government's health strategy, Quality and Fairness.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently published a major review of acute hospital bed capacity in Ireland. The report reviews changes in acute hospital capacity and activity over the period 1980 to 2000. It provides an estimate of the number of additional beds required to eliminate current gaps in capacity, examines the factors that are likely to increase the need for additional beds and it provides an assessment of the additional capacity required up to 2011. I am providing funding of 65 million in the current year for the commissioning of an additional 709 beds in public hospitals. This is the first phase of the provision of additional capacity in the public hospital service and represents the largest ever expansion of bed capacity in this country.</P>
      <P>There is a commitment in the strategy to continue the enhancement of diagnostic facilities in acute hospitals. Diagnostic services such as radiology and laboratory will have extended service hours, to maximise the use of the facilities and provide services as soon as possible to patients. The details of this initiative will need to be discussed with the unions and staff in the context of partnership and industrial relations structures.</P>

In September 2001, the Brothers of Charity found they were unable to maintain this service. The recruitment of a basic grade psychologist post for a one year period commenced early in 2001 and interviews were held on 19 June 2001. The one successful candidate advised the service on 3 October 2001 that she was not taking up the post. The post was then re-advertised in the newspapers on 27 and 28 October 2001. There were two applicants for the post, both of whom cancelled prior to the interviews on 6 December 2001. It is now intended that this post will be advertised again in early February. The question of the possible re-grading of this post to greater seniority is a matter in the first instance for the Southern Health Board.</P>

This service operates in accordance with guidelines prepared by the Irish division of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. In-patient admissions for this service are to the acute psychiatric unit in Cavan, facilitating access to general hospital services including liaison access to a consultant physician in geriatric medicine. Nine people from County Monaghan have been admitted to this service in Cavan since January 2000. The day hospital component of the service is located at St. Davnet's Hospital.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to capital and equipment expenditure in each of the five hospital sites in each of the past five years in the North-Eastern Health Board region is being compiled by my Department and will be forwarded to the Deputy as speedily as possible. I visited Monaghan General Hospital recently and I met hospital management and staff and representatives of local groups. I was happy to be in a position to allay any concerns with regard to the future development of the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A significant level of capital investment in Monaghan General Hospital is proposed in the short-term; plans are being advanced by the North-Eastern Health Board for the development and upgrading of the high-dependency unit at the hospital, in addition to substantial upgrading and refurbishment of ward accommodation, the <Col N="470" /> development of the treatment and minor injuries unit and the development of a midwifery led unit. The associated capital cost is of the order of 7 million. I am advised by the board that the development of new consultant-led services in dermatology and geriatric medicine at the hospital is planned and I regard this as evidence of the commitment of the board to continued investment in the development of services on the hospital campus.</P>
    <P>I have announced the immediate commissioning process for an additional 709 acute hospital beds in public hospitals nationwide at a cost of 65 million in the current year. This is the first phase in the provision of the additional 3,000 acute hospital beds by 2011. Thirty eight of the additional 709 public hospital beds will be provided in the North-Eastern Health Board region with ten of these being provided in Monaghan General Hospital. All of the additional bed capacity at the hospital will be designated for public patients and will allow the hospital to significantly increase activity levels for its public patients. I am satisfied that the proposed development of additional consultant-led services at the hospital, together with the provision of additional bed capacity and the proposed significant level of capital investment is tangible evidence of additional funding for the provision of acute hospital services to the catchment area population served by the hospital.</P>

      <P>The North-Eastern Health Board is responsible <Col N="472" /> for the provision of acute hospital services in its functional area. I have, therefore, asked the chief executive officer of the board to furnish the Deputy directly with the information which he requires in relation to the number of beds at the five hospital sites.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, at the request of the board and in the context of the national review of acute hospital bed capacity which I recently launched, I was happy to set aside indicative funding of 2.379 million revenue and 0.473 million capital for the board for additional bed capacity at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan (14 beds) Louth County Hospital, Dundalk (14 beds) and Monaghan General Hospital (ten beds). This funding is in addition to the board's determination of 450.053 million for the current year for the maintenance and continued development of existing services and for the provision and development of new services. The provision of the ten beds at Monaghan represents an increase in the number of medical admission beds at the hospital and will also provide an opportunity to improve the special care and coronary care facility, requested by consultant physicians.</P>

      <P>The provision of health-related services, including speech and language therapy, is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Accordingly, the Deputy's question has been referred to the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority with a request that he examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>In response to my concern regarding current labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide, my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists including speech and language therapists. The study, a comprehensive quantitative assessment of workforce requirements for qualified personnel in this area to 2015 was published on 25 July last. The report concludes that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of therapy professionals over the next 15 years, including a fourfold increase in speech and language therapists. This will require a significant increase in training places with a recommended annual increase of 75 course places for speech and language therapy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other key recommendations of the report include: provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement <Col N="473" /> co-ordinators; need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; concerted recruitment from overseas; establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a patient-centred health service; and career structure, workload, working practices and skills-mix issues encompassed in context of the report of the expert group on various health professions, published April 2000.</P>
    <P>I am working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, to ensure the rapid provision of the additional places as an urgent priority. To this end an inter-agency working group has been established, comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study. The bids have now been received and are currently being assessed by the working group.</P>

      <P>Persons suffering from any of the following conditions, who are not already medical card holders, may obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness &ndash; for persons under 16 years only &ndash; phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia. Persons with any of the above illnesses may apply to their local health board for admission to the scheme. If eligible, <Col N="474" /> they are issued with a long-term illness book. This lists the drugs and medicines for the treatment of their condition that will be provided to them free of charge through their community pharmacist.</P>
      <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. Non-medical-card holders and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than 53.33 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned about the delays being experienced by applicants for inter-country adoption assessment in the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Delays have arisen over the last few years because of an increased interest in inter-country adoption and difficulties being experienced by the South West Area Health board, which to date has been providing this service on behalf of the three area boards, in recruiting social workers in the child care area, including inter-country adoption. The standardised framework for inter-country adoption assessment procedures is now being used in all health boards. The purpose is to streamline assessment processes for first and second assessments so that resources are used effectively and to provide a transparent system that can be understood by all of the parties. The framework has been welcomed by both health boards and couples.</P>
      <P>To reduce time spent by couples on waiting lists for inter-country adoption assessment in the ERHA, additional funding of almost 830,000 or £653,000 has been provided over the last four years on the following measures: to increase significantly the number of social workers in the service &ndash; funding has been provided to raise the complement of social workers, whole time equivalent, to over 20. At the end of last year, because of ongoing difficulties over recruitment, there were only 9.5 social workers, whole time equivalent, in the service; to assign new administrative personnel to provide support for social workers. This is to free up social workers to concentrate on assessments, post-placement reports and other appropriate work; a one-stop shop facility has been introduced to increase capacity for holding office based interviews and reduce the time that social workers spend travelling to and from clients; to implement fully the standardised framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions have been ongoing with the ERHA on further measures to address the problem. The authority has decided that two new assessment units will be established in the Northern and East Coast area boards and that the present service will become the unit for the SWAHB. I am advised by the ERHA that it is involved in ongoing discussions with the three area boards on the arrangements for devolving the service with a view to having the service operational as soon as possible and that a letter has issued to all applicants notifying them of the impending changes to the current service and their place on the current waiting list. The ERHA <Col N="476" /> is currently recruiting a regional co-ordinator who will support the restructuring of the service. I will continue to monitor the situation in relation to the new arrangements for the new assessment centres and anticipate that this initiative will be successful in dealing with the delays currently being experienced by the couples in the region.</P>
    <P>My Department collects statistics from each of the health boards in respect of inter-country adoption at the end of every quarter. The most recent data which I have included below, as requested by the Deputy, refers to the end of 2001:</P>
    <P>&ndash;The duration of assessment in the SWAHB is currently 8-9 months for first assessment and 3-4 months for second assessment. The Deputy refers to speeding up the process and while every effort is being made to reduce the waiting time before assessment begins the duration of the assessment itself in the SWAHB is within the suggested average duration of assessment in the framework.</P>
    <P>&ndash;The number of applications awaiting assessment at the end of last year is 477 for first-time applicants and 61 for second-time applicants. I am advised by the ERHA that the number of assessments completed rose from 85 in 2000 to 137 in 2001.</P>
    <P>&ndash;In addition to the initiatives taken by the ERHA I have also recently written to the other seven health boards asking them to consider assisting the ERHA in carrying out inter-country adoption assessments. Unfortunately none of the boards were in a position to release social workers to assist the ERHA in undertaking inter-country adoption assessments. Some boards have indicated that they may be in a position to offer assistance to the ERHA on the organisation and delivery of preparation courses in their respective regions. This is being followed up on by the ERHA.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, a health board may make arrangements for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to persons suffering from a prescribed disease or disability of a permanent or long-term nature. Diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus are among the conditions prescribed under the Act. As the operation of this scheme, known as the long-term illness scheme, is primarily a matter for the relevant health board, the person concerned should contact the board directly to make the necessary arrangements.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed in the new health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, to ensuring that the operation of out-patient departments is improved and includes specific initiatives this regard. The strategy states that protocols for investigation and referral to hospital out-patient departments will be developed in conjunction with general practitioners; acute hospitals will allocate individual appointments to each out-patient, where this is not already the practice. This will change the current situation where a number of patients who are given the same appointment time may experience a lengthy delay; an assessment of out-patient recall rates will be undertaken; and nurse-led clinics for selected conditions will be introduced where feasible.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specific case referred to by the Deputy I would point out that responsibility for the provision of health services to persons living in County Dublin rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority.

      <P>Foster care allowances are paid in respect of children who are placed in foster care or relative care under the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations, 1995 or the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations, 1995. The children in respect of whom these allowances are paid must be in the care of the health board, under the Child Care Act, 1991, either on a voluntary basis or by court order. Under the regulations, a health board must assess the needs of a child placed in care and the suitability of the prospective foster or relative carers, and draw up a child care plan. The implementation of the child care plan places significant responsibilities and duties on foster carers, whether relatives or non-relatives. The foster care allowance is paid in recognition of these additional responsibilities and the additional costs of looking after foster children. Responsibility for the provision of foster care allowance in this case rests with the ERHA. My Department has therefore asked the chief executive officer to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and reply to him directly.</P>

      <P>Until 1999, there was no set national rate of pay for part-time home helps. In April 1999 funding was allocated to ensure that all part-time home helps would be paid £3 (3.80) per hour. The following year, 2000, the National Minimum Wage Agreement allowed for the rate of pay to be increased to £4.40 (5.59) per hour. Neither of these pay increases contained an arrears element. The part-time home helps agreement, 2000, which was negotiated for this grade of staff by its representatives, awarded the part-time home helps the Non-Nursing Group I rate, now roughly 9.92 or £7.81 per hour, from January 2001. The point of this pay scale at which a home help was to be paid was determined by his or her length of service. Those home helps who had been in the service during or prior to 1994 were paid at point 8 of the pay scale from 2001. A lump sum payment was paid in lieu of arrears.</P>

    <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the numbers of persons in full-time education. In the academic year 2000/01 the number of students taking the clinical speech and language therapy degree course in TCD on a full-time basis was 94.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that in response to my concern regarding the current severe labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The study was published in July 2001 and concludes that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of speech and language therapists requiring a significant increase in training places. To this end, an inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, HEA. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study. The proposals received are currently being assessed by the inter-agency working group.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the provision of appointments rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. My Department has, therefore, asked the chief executive officer to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and reply to him directly.</P>

      <P>Arrangements for risk equalisation are governed by the Health Insurance Acts, 1994 and 2001. Under this legislation, the operation of risk equalisation is to be a matter for the health insurance authority. I commenced provisions contained in the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2001 dealing with risk equalisation on November 14 2001.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently liaising with the health insurance authority in relation to a draft statutory scheme of risk equalisation, which it has referred for the authority's consideration. In accordance with the legislation, I shall seek a resolution of each House of the Oireachtas approving the draft scheme.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to make the necessary arrangements for such resolutions as soon as the work on drafting the scheme is finalised and I hope to be in a position to do this before the end of the current session.</P>

      <P>Arising from a number of meetings with various interest groups, I requested Comhairle na n-Ospidéal to conduct a review of neurological services and related issues. Comhairle established a committee with the following terms of reference: to examine the existing arrangements for the provision of consultant-level neurology and neurophysiology services nationally and, following consultation with the interests concerned, to make recommendations to Comhairle na n-Ospidéal on the future organisation and development of neurology and neurophysiology services. The review will focus on updating the 1991 Comhairle report taking into account recent advances in and increasing demand for neurological and neurophysiological services.</P>
      <P>The Comhairle review is still underway and the consultation stage is almost complete. It is expected that its report should be complete in the next few months. The need for additional investment in neurology and neurophysiology will be considered in the light of the review by Comhairle, other competing priorities and the availability of adequate funding.</P>

      <P>The provision of health services in Belmullet is, in the first instance, the responsibility of the Western Health Board. My Department has made inquiries of the board regarding this matter and has been advised that the extension of radiology services at district hospitals throughout the board's area would be a major enhancement of such services. However, such developments are dependent on capital and revenue funding. The equipment would cost in the region of 300,000 and the ongoing revenue would be 120,000 per year.</P>
      <P>The immediate priority for radiology services in Mayo is the replacement of the screening room at Mayo General Hospital and the replacement of current radiology equipment with modern picture archiving communication system facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="488" /> A formal assessment of the working and effectiveness of the radiology service at Clifden District Hospital will be undertaken shortly.

      <P>Between 1998 and 2000 additional funding amounting to 1.128 million was allocated to the South Eastern Health Board for the enhancement of health related support services, including speech and language therapy, to children with autism. Further additional funding amounting to 0.571million was made available to the board between 2001 and this year for these services for children with an intellectual disability and autism. The allocation of this additional funding is a matter in the first instance for the South Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy, however, will be aware that many health boards and specialist service providers have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting allied health professionals and specifically speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. This is due primarily to the general shortage of available staff in these grades nationally. Health boards and agencies have been and are continuing to undertake intensive recruitment drives both at home and abroad. My Department has also asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing <Col N="490" /> level of service provision or an enhancement in line with agreed service developments using the resources allocated to the services.</P>
    <P>My Department has asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and to reply to him directly.</P>

      <P>Orthodontic guidelines were issued by my Department in 1985 and are still in operation. Their purpose is to allow prioritisation of children for orthodontic treatment based on the severity of need. I do not regard it as appropriate to lay the guidelines before the House but I am happy to make them generally available.</P>
      <P>The guidelines are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way patients in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them. Patients assessed as category A have severe malocclusions and should receive urgent orthodontic care; patients assessed as category B have less severe problems and are placed on orthodontic treatment waiting lists. The number of cases treated will depend on the level of resources available, in terms of qualified staff, in an area.</P>
      <P>Health board consultant orthodontists recommended that the 1985 guidelines be modified to prioritise treatment for the most severe categories of patients. My Department will be writing to the chief executive officers of the health boards concerning the operation of these modified guidelines with regard to maintaining the delivery of orthodontic services in a prioritised way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive officers' report on orthodontics, known as the Moran report, recommended the use of an alternative index of need. This is known as the index of orthodontic treatment need, IOTN. The chief dental officer has advised that this new index should not be implemented until its implications have been evaluated in a national survey of children's dental health. This survey is currently underway and is expected to be completed in mid 2002. The pur<Col N="492" /> pose of the survey is to identify accurately the number of children that would benefit from orthodontic treatment and the resources needed to meet the corresponding level of care.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards in the first instance. The Southern Health Board, SHB, was allocated an additional 1.191million last year for orthodontic services of which 1.032 million was for the orthodontic initiative. Under the initiative, the board propose to, <i>inter alia, </i>recruit an additional two consultant orthodontists, one of which will be located in Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the board has informed me that the Local Appointments Commission, LAC, has recommended a candidate for one of the consultant orthodontist posts to be based in the north of Cork city. The board is currently arranging with the LAC to re-advertise the other consultant post for the Tralee unit in order to expedite an early appointment. I have initiated <Col N="493" /> a range of measures to substantially increase the capacity of the orthodontic services and reduce the waiting times for orthodontic treatment.</P>
    <P>Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service such as the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>My Department has provided additional funding of 0.932 million for orthodontic services in 2002 of which 0.541million was for a specialist training programme in orthodontics. Six dentists from the health boards, four of whom are from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, commenced their training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications last October. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also underway.</P>
    <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish committee for specialist training in dentistry through the postgraduate medical and dental board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes.</P>
    <P>My Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately 1.269 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as part of the initiative, my Department is also exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has advised me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter, there were 2,300 patients receiving orthodontic treatment from the board.</P>

      <P>In the wake of the events of 11 September 2001 in the USA, I established a committee under the chairmanship of Professor Bill Hall, director of <Col N="494" /> the virus reference laboratory, to prepare an operational plan which would be implemented in the event of a biological attack in this country. In preparing the plan it was necessary to identify the level of risk of such an attack. The committee considered that although the risk of a primary attack in this country was low, the secondary consequences of an attack in another country was the more likely threat.</P>
      <P>On 17 October 2001, I launched a protocol for dealing with a suspected anthrax attack in Ireland. The protocol was prepared by the expert committee and deals with the procedures to be adopted in the event of a suspected anthrax attack, including patient treatment and management, post exposure guidelines, etc. Included with the protocol are guidelines for individuals and companies on how to deal with a suspect package believed to contain anthrax. The protocol is revised on an ongoing basis as a result of feedback to the committee. The protocol and guidelines are available on the Department's web site &ndash; www.doh.ie.</P>
      <P>The expert committee has prepared a more detailed protocol which deals with the other category A agents, including smallpox, botulism, plague and tularaemia. Similar to anthrax, the key issues are preparedness and prevention, based on early detection and surveillance, and the provision of prompt public health responses. I am currently examining the protocol which will issue shortly to appropriate medical and emergency personnel.</P>
      <P>Based on the recommendations of the committee I have approved the purchase of specific antibiotics and vaccine which would be required in the event of a biological attack with specific class A agents. These products will complement the existing stocks of medicinal products for the treatment of these diseases.</P>
      <P>The high level containment facility which is currently under construction at the virus reference laboratory is tentatively scheduled for completion in September 2002. The facility is designed to a BL 3 plus standard to allow increased containment of a range of infectious agents and to ensure increased safety.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officers of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards established a group to review all aspects of major emergency planning in the health context which would inform the need for any revision to existing emergency plans. The group has recently completed its deliberations and has made a number of recommendations in this regard which are to be considered by the chief executive officers at a meeting scheduled to take place this week.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of the Irish Medicine Board, IMB, to review the safety of all authorised medicinal products on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>In keeping with this policy, the IMB in collaboration with its European counterparts has continually, monitored the safety profile of this medicinal product in order to identify any emerging safety issues and to take any appropriate regulatory action. To facilitate this monitoring process, the IMB has actively encouraged healthcare professionals to report all suspected adverse drug reactions, ADRs, associated with use of this medicinal product.</P>
      <P>To date, the IMB has received 145 cases of suspected adverse drug reactions, ADRs, occurring during treatment. The majority of ADRs reported were in keeping with the types of reactions known to occur with this product. These reports consisted mainly of agitation, anxiety, dizziness, insomnia, tremor, nausea, pruritis &ndash; itching &ndash; rash and headache.</P>
      <P>Two patients are reported to have died during treatment, but in neither case is this medicinal product considered to have caused their deaths. It should be noted that this product is estimated to have been used in approximately 33,000 patients in Ireland and in over 28 million patients world-wide.</P>
      <P>In addition to encouraging reporting of suspected ADRs, the IMB has reminded healthcare professionals on a number of occasions of the prescribing information and published updated information in the Drug Safety Newsletter, December 2000 and April 2001, and in an article in MIMS, July 2001. Following one of the reviews of the world-wide safety data during 2001, the IMB in association with its European counterparts implemented regulatory action to strengthen the product information to minimise the risk of adverse reactions in particular, seizure.</P>
      <P>This medicinal product will remain under review both at a national and European level and the Irish Medicines Board will take any further regulatory action considered appropriate.</P>

      <P>Children First, National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children are national over-arching guidelines that apply to all individuals and agencies that are dealing with children. One of the key elements of Children First is the introduction of a child protection notification system, CPNS, which is to be a health board record of every child about whom, following a preliminary assessment, there is a child protection concern. The CPNS aims to improve the management and record keeping of child abuse notifications and ensure uniformity of approach across health boards.</P>
      <P>In the process of introducing the CPNS over the last 12 months, differences in its interpretation among health boards arose. One of the most important aspects of Children First is that it highlights the importance of consistency between policies and procedures across health boards and other statutory and voluntary organisations.</P>
      <P>Further guidance on the introduction of the CPNS is currently being developed by the national advisory group on the implementation of Children First in conjunction with a resource team from the health board executive, HeBE. This guidance will address these issues and ensure uniformity of approach across health boards in assessing child protection notifications. As a result of the differing interpretations of the CPNS, it is not operational across all health boards at present.</P>
      <P>When the CPNS is operational across all health boards returns will be made to my Department on an annual basis at the end of each year. At present, therefore, the figures sought by the Deputy are not available.</P>

      <P>Since mid-1997 over 171.45 million, £135 million, additional revenue funding has been invested through the health boards in the development of the child protection, welfare and family support services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Capital investment of approximately 38.09 million, £30 million, is being made available by the Government through the health boards to put in place additional high support and special care <Col N="497" /> places to provide for a small group of children who need more intensive intervention than mainstream residential or fostercare services. The number of high support and special care places has increased from 17 in 1996 to a current total of 93. Included in this figure is the 24 place purpose-built special care unit at Ballydowd in the eastern region which is being opened on a phased basis and the seven place special care unit for girls in Cork. An additional 41 places are planned as follows: in the eastern region a high support facility providing 24 places at Portrane is nearing completion; the Midland Health Board, North-Eastern Health Board, North-Western Health Board and the Western Health Board are co-operating to provide 12 high support places on a single campus in Castleblaney; and the Mid-Western Health Board will be providing five special care places for adolescent boys on behalf of the southern region, Mid-Western Health Board, Southern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board in a purpose built-facility which is nearing completion. Places in these facilities are due to become available by mid 2002.</P>
    <P>While health boards have experienced some difficulties in recruiting suitably trained staff, progress has been made in this area through recruitment abroad and the expansion of training courses. As the Deputy will be aware, a new career and pay structure for child care workers was introduced last year. This aims to ensure that more people are attracted into child care and to ensure that child care workers are trained to an appropriate level.</P>
    <P>Recruitment and retention of staff for high support and special care units is also being looked at by the special residential services board which will advise and improve the co-ordination of special residential services for children convicted by the courts and for non-offending children in need of special care and protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 697 to 699, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I am now responsible for overseeing the implementation of the national children's strategy and co-ordinating Government policy on children to maintain the policy coherence achieved through the publication of the strategy. This is in addition to my current statutory role in the Departments of Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science. I report to the Cabinet Committee on Children on progress being made.</P>
      <P>The national children's office is providing a dedicated team to support me in my expanded role. The role of the office is to implement the national children's strategy in co-operation with the relevant statutory and non-statutory bodies. While Government Departments retain responsibility for implementing the national children's strategy, the national children's office co-ordinates and monitors progress to ensure that the goals of the strategy are being achieved. The office has an advisory board comprising assistant secretaries from the key Departments involved in implementing the strategy.</P>
      <P>These are the Departments of the Taoiseach; Finance; Health and Children; Education and Science; Social, Community and Family Affairs; Justice, Equality and Law Reform; the Environment and Local Government; Tourism, Sport and Recreation; and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The Attorney General's Office is also represented on the board.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet Committee on Children, which was established in March of last year, met on three occasions in 2001. The composition of the committee reflects that of the advisory board of the national children's office, with the addition of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. To date the Cabinet committee has agreed, <i>inter alia,</i> the core functions of the national children's office and the priority policy areas to be tackled. The priorities for the office are the implementation of the Children Act, 2001, and the national youth homelessness strategy and to develop a national play and recreation policy. Work in relation to these areas will be ongoing throughout 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the national play and recreation policy, a survey has been conducted through the county managers in relation to the current levels of playground provision around the country. As a first step in developing the policy, I asked the recently established national children's advisory council to advise me on the scope of such a policy and the detailed issues which needed to be addressed. I understand that the council will be submitting their advice to me shortly. An inter-<Col N="499" /> departmental committee has been established by the national children's office to develop the policy. It will hold its first meeting in February.</P>
    <P>The post of director of the national children's office was advertised and filled in 2001 and arrangements are now in train to bring the staff of the office up to its full complement of 20 from its level of six in 2001.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Other than for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically entitled to a medical card, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons in category 1 are medical card holders and they are entitled to a full range of services, including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital <Col N="500" /> services in public wards, including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services, including consultants services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances, and a maternity and infant care service.</P>
    <P>Persons in category 2, non-medical card holders, are entitled to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards, including consultants services, and out-patient public hospital services, including consultants services subject to some modest charges. The public hospital statutory in-patient charge in respect of each day during which a person is maintained is 33. The maximum payment in any 12 consecutive months is 330. Attendance at accident and emergency departments is subject to a charge of 31.70 where the patient does not have a referral note from his/her doctor. This charge applies only to the first visit in any episode of care.</P>
    <P>Charges can also be made under two sets of regulations in respect of long-stay or extended care. They can be made under the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1965, and charges may also be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 1987.</P>
    <P>In deciding the amount to be contributed, health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the relevant health board, payment would cause undue hardship. Maintenance charges may also be applied for private and semi-private accommodation in public hospitals. These charges are as follows:</P>
    <P>Revised charges per day from 1 January 2002:</P>

      <Quest>the position regarding the progress achieved under special three year funding for the intellectual disability sector; if the planned numbers of residential and day places have been achieved; if there is a variance or deficit from the plan; if he will provide figures planned and achieved for each health board and for each agency in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area; and the progress made by agency as per (details supplied).</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the commitment given by the Government in late 1999 to implement an accelerated programme of investment in services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism, additional revenue and capital funding of 260.3 million was made available to the services up to the end of 2001.</P>
      <P>When allocating additional funding for new services, estimates are made, based on averaged costs, of the number of new residential and day places which might be expected from this funding. However, these figures are subsequently adjusted to take account of the actual number of new places which are provided by the end of the year in question. As the Deputy will appreciate, the cost of providing residential and day places varies, depending on individual client needs. In 2000, 422 new residential and 815 new day places were provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original estimated figures for the services were 555 residential and 700 day places. In 2001, the original estimated figures for these services were 450 residential and 600 day places. While the final figures are currently being checked with the health boards, it would appear that between 395 and 400 new residential and 700 new day places will have been provided in 2001. In addition to the new residential and day places mentioned, the additional funding allocated to the services over the last two years also provided for: a significant investment in the respite services; an enhanced level of support for those already in receipt of some level of residential, day, respite or other support services; the enhancement of health related support services to children with an intellectual disability and those with autism; the continuation of the programme to transfer persons with an intellectual disability or autism from psychiatric hospitals or other inappropriate placements; the development of specialist support services for those who require <Col N="502" /> a more intensive level of support; and identified needs in existing services.</P>
    <P>Further additional revenue and capital funding amounting to 51.525 million has been provided in 2002 to build on the developments which have taken place over the last number of years. This funding will provide over 100 new residential places and 600 day places, in addition to a range of other enhanced support services and will also meet some identified needs in existing services.</P>
    <P>In relation to the information concerning the breakdown by area health board and agency within the Eastern Regional Health Authority, I have asked the authority to reply directly to the Deputy with this information.</P>
    <P>In April 1999, information from the national intellectual disability database indicated that in the period 2000 to 2004, 1,677 new residential and 912 new day places were required to meet the identified needs for these services. It should be noted that in addition to the day places required to meet the needs of those awaiting placement in the services as mentioned above, the additional funding also provided for those requiring a change in day services. For example, young people leaving school and requiring rehabilitative training places or those moving from rehabilitative training to other areas of the services such as sheltered work, activation or services for older people. My Department is reviewing on an ongoing basis the position in relation to the implementation of this development programme with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards.</P>
    <P>Information will be available shortly from the national intellectual disability database in relation to the level of service provision and identified need as of 30 May 2001. This will reflect the impact of the 2000 development programme, which will also assist my Department in this matter. The national monitoring committee, which is representative of my Department, the health research board, the chief executives of the health boards, the national federation of voluntary bodies providing services to people with intellectual disability, the national parents and siblings alliance and the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland, NAMHI, is also involved in the monitoring of this programme.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot at this stage give specific commitments in relation to levels of expenditure in 2003 for any particular service area as these matters will be decided as part of the discussions on the Estimates and budget for that year between my Department and the Department of Finance. However, I assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to fulfilling the commitment which it gave in relation to meeting the needs of this population group.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of bus lanes is to facilitate and promote bus based public transport. Existing regulations generally limit the use of bus lanes to buses and, in the case of with-flow bus lanes, to cyclists. Having regard to the role of taxis in providing on-street immediate hire services, an exemption to that limitation is allowed in respect of taxis when they are being used in the course of business.</P>
      <P>Following representations from hackney, limousine and motorcycle interests on the issue of bus lane access, I requested my Department to undertake a review of the regulations in consultation with the Garda Síochána, the Dublin Transportation Office and Dublin Corporation. This review has now been completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Statutory responsibility for the provision of drinking water supplies and for upholding the prescribed quality standards rests with sanitary authorities. Stringent drinking water standards are prescribed in the European Com<Col N="507" /> munities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988. The duty placed on sanitary authorities to take the necessary measures, including chlorination, to ensure that drinking water meets these standards is performed under the general supervision of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA. The most recent EPA report on water quality in Ireland, 1998-2000, is available in the Oireachtas Library. The report is based on the results of 141,955 individual tests on 22,801 samples of drinking water taken from 2,559 supplies.</P>
      <P>The report concludes that the overall quality of drinking water from public supplies continues to be satisfactory. The EPA places a strong emphasis on the need to tackle deficiencies in a small number of public supplies which have been identified as frequently breaching water quality standards and calls on local authorities to adopt corrective action programmes in relation to the relevant water treatment plants. Future reports will highlight the extent to which deficiencies identified in EPA audits have been addressed. The National Development Plan, 2000-2006, provides for large-scale investment in water services, including a particular focus on the provision of additional water treatment and distribution capacity, the maintenance of water quality standards, water conservation and leakage reduction and network rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>The EPA report acknowledges the water quality deficiencies affecting group water schemes, in particular on privately sourced schemes that supply some 5% of households nationally and highlights the Government's continuing commitment to achieve improved performance in the group sector.</P>
      <P>During 2000 monitoring of group water schemes increased by 34% on average over 1999 levels for all parameters and by 76% for total and faecal coliforms. The major drive to tackle quality deficiencies in this sector is being maintained and expanded, with a focus on all areas of relevance &ndash; sources, distribution, analytical programmes and services, full definition of quality problems, management aspects, treatment options and costings. This is being underpinned by a commitment of 644 million, current prices, under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006 for the rural water programme and a radically improved grants scheme. Other measures being pursued in partnership with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, NFGWS, include the establishment of the national rural water monitoring committee, the provision by my Department of financial support to the NFGWS and the introduction on a pilot basis of a quality assurance scheme for the group sector by the NFGWS with the backing of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new comprehensive group water scheme monitoring programme, beginning in March 2002, will sample and analyse drinking water in the estimated 1,500 group schemes falling within the remit of the European Communities (Drinking <Col N="508" /> Water) Regulations, 2000, which comes into operation on 1 January 2004.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that in 2001 there were two large outbreaks of gastroenteritis associated with contaminated drinking water. I understand that in both cases hotels with private sources of supply were involved. One of the hotels has since substantially upgraded its treatment system and the other has reverted to the mains supply. In addition, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has issued advice to the hotel trade in relation to the protection and use of drinking water.</P>

The types of existing structures on which antennae may be erected under the new exemption include: public or commercial buildings, by way of attachment to roofs, facades, chimneys, chimney pots or vent pipes; but not educational facilities, childcare facilities, hospitals or protected structures; telegraph poles, lamp posts, flag poles, and CCTV poles; and electricity pylons.</P>
    <P>There are strict conditions and limitations attached to these provisions. These include compliance with radiation emission standards set down by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and advance notice of at least four weeks to the planning authority. If these conditions and limitations are not complied with, the planning authority can take enforcement action or insist that planning permission be sought.</P>
    <P>The regulations also contain, for the first time, the condition that the field strength of the non-ionising radiation emission from all antennae and other apparatus exempted under the regulations must not exceed the limits specified by the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. My Department is currently working with the Department of Public Enterprise on devising a monitoring system to ensure that the level of non-ionising emissions from any antennae or other apparatus, which are either subject to planning permission or exempted under class 31, comply with the limits set down by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.</P>

      <P>In December 1998, my Department approved in principle the use of 12.44 million in surplus internal capital receipts by South Dublin County Council towards the take-over and refurbishment of former Dublin Corporation houses which were in the council's administrative area. It was proposed at that time that refurbishment works would be undertaken at Cushlawn and Shancastle-Greenfort.</P>

    <P>I understand that to date a major refurbishment programme has been completed at Donomore Park-Crescent and Killinarden Heights which included the provision of central heating in 240 houses that were refurbished in these estates. A major refurbishment programme is also currently underway in Avonbeg which is being funded separately under my Department's remedial works scheme. The Department is in ongoing discussions with South Dublin County Council regarding funding for refurbishment programmes, including the provision of central heating in local authority rented houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has developed and put in place a range of measures since 1997 to tackle homelessness. In 1998, a cross-Department team on homelessness was established under the aegis of my Department to devise more effective ways of tackling homelessness. A comprehensive <Col N="515" /> Government strategy &ldquo;Homelessness An Integrated Strategy&rdquo; was published in May 2000.</P>
      <P>The strategy explicitly recognised that homelessness is not just about a lack of living accommodation, but that the health, care, welfare, education and training needs of homeless persons needed to be addressed in a co-ordinated manner if the problem of homelessness is to be tackled effectively. As part of the strategy all local authorities are required to draw up homeless action plans in conjunction with health boards and voluntary bodies. The plans for the main urban areas have already been completed and the measures in them are currently being implemented. The plans for other areas are well underway and should be completed shortly.</P>
      <P>Substantial additional funding has been made available to ensure that the recommendations in the homelessness strategy are implemented. Capital funding for the direct provision by local authorities of accommodation for homeless persons is being doubled from 25.4 million to 50.8 million for the period 2001-2006 and current funding to assist towards the provision of accommodation for homeless persons, generally by voluntary housing bodies &ndash; was increased from 4.4 million in 1997 to 31.7 million in 2001. Hostel and other accommodation is also provided by voluntary bodies with capital funding provided under the capital assistance and the rental subsidy schemes operated by my Department. In the period 1997 to 2001, some 109 projects for homeless persons at an estimated cost of 97.8 million have been approved under the capital assistance scheme. Additional funding is also being made available by the Department of Health and Children to fund the provision of in-house care in hostels providing accommodation for homeless persons.</P>
      <P>An important element of the Government's strategy is the need to provide additional accommodation, and a greater variety of accommodation type, to cater for the varying needs of homeless persons, including homeless families. Additional transitional and move-on accommodation is also being provided both by local authorities and voluntary bodies to enable people to move out of emergency accommodation, whether in bed and breakfast accommodation or hostels, into accommodation that is more suitable to their needs.</P>
      <P>As part of the homelessness strategy, it was agreed that preventative strategies would be prepared by key Government Departments to target groups at risk of homelessness, particularly those leaving institutional care, whether custodial or health related, and young people leaving care. These plans have now been prepared and co-ordinated into an overall strategy by my Department. The strategy will be published shortly and is designed to ensure that people leaving State care do not become homeless.</P>

      <P>The Government recognises the importance of, and need for, a diverse and well managed private rented sector and the need to increase the supply of rental accommodation in order to stabilise rent levels.</P>
      <P>The Government's response to the proposals of the commission on the private rented residential sector was announced in January 2001 and forms the basis for the reform of the sector. It includes <i>inter alia</i> the establishment of a private residential tenancies board for facilitating speedy dispute resolution, the introduction of legislation to improve security of tenure and to increase the periods for notice to quit, and, in addition, certain taxation incentives to encourage increased supply. In relation to rent levels, the commission recommended that rents should be the open market rate and that rent reviews should occur no more frequently than once yearly, unless there has been a substantial improvement in the property in the interim. These recommendations, along with other of the commission's recommendations approved by the Government will be given effect to in new legislation. The drafting of this legislation is progressing in collaboration with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which is responsible for the landlord and tenant legislative code. The private residential tenancies board was established on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis in October last.</P>
      <P>Some of the commission's taxation proposals approved by Government were implemented in last year's Finance Act including: the restoration of interest deductibility on borrowings to purchase or make improvements to certain rented property; allowance of capital expenditure on refurbishment or maintenance to be offset against rental income for tax purposes; the making available of rollover relief for capital gains tax purposes, subject to certain conditions.</P>
      <P>Further measures were introduced in Budget 2002 aimed at increasing the supply of rental accommodation. From 1 January 2002, interest arising on borrowed moneys used to purchase rented residential properties is allowed as a deduction for tax purposes against rental income. In addition, investors in new and second-hand residential property who purchase second-hand property with effect from 6 December 2001 will pay the same stamp duty rates as apply to owner-occupiers, other than first time buyers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has also targeted in a specific way the accommodation needs of students through section 50 of the 1999 Finance Act, which provides tax incentives for the construction of purpose built student accommodation. Certain <Col N="517" /> amendments to this scheme were announced in Budget 2002 including extending the deadline for the scheme by 2½ years to 30 September 2005.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need to bring forward regulations to provide a statutory basis for the application in all areas of established standards of good farming practice for environmental protection. These regulations will support good farming practice, give further effect to a number of EU directives on waste and water quality, including the Nitrates Directive, and generally strengthen and support other measures in place for protection of the environment. I envisage that the detailed provisions of the regulations will be developed over the coming months in consultation with the main farming organisations and other interested parties.</P>
      <P>It would be possible in the context of these regulations for the livestock manure application limits specified in the Nitrates Directive to be applied in relation to all areas or to certain areas designated as vulnerable zones i.e. areas where waters are, or are likely to become, significantly affected by nitrates from agriculture. I have already briefed my Cabinet colleagues on the general position and I intend, following discussions with the main farming organisations and other interests, to report to Government within a few weeks with recommendations in this regard. These discussions are ongoing.</P>
      <P>The proposed regulations will support implementation of a 1991 directive on waste which, as an alternative to licensing and in the case of certain activities, permits waste recovery or disposal in accordance with &ldquo;general rules&rdquo; by persons who are registered for the purpose, as well as implementation of the 2000 Water Framework Directive which requires that at least &ldquo;good status&rdquo; be achieved in relation to all waters by 2015 and that action programmes be established to achieve this objective.</P>
      <P>The Nitrates Directive has the objectives of reducing water pollution induced by nitrates from agricultural sources and preventing further such pollution, with the primary emphasis being on the management of manures and other fertilisers. It requires member states to carry out monitoring of nitrate levels in waters, to establish a code of practice for farmers and develop and implement action programmes to reduce and prevent pollution of waters by nitrates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="518" /> The most recent comprehensive data on water quality are contained in the report &ldquo;Water Quality in Ireland 1998-2000&rdquo;, published by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, on 24 January 2002. The report includes data on the extent of eutrophication in surface waters and on the levels of nitrogen compounds in groundwaters and surface waters. I understand that a copy of the report will shortly be placed in the Oireachtas Library. This latter report is supported by a March 2001 assessment prepared by the EPA, at the request of my Department, in relation to the trophic status of estuaries and bays, which identified a total of 17 estuarine waterbodies as eutrophic or potentially eutrophic. This latter assessment is of particular significance in the context of implementation of the Nitrates Directive and provides a basis for designation of extensive areas in the east, south-east and south as vulnerable zones. Earlier, in May 2000, an expert panel recommended that certain groundwaters in five counties, Carlow, Cork, Kerry, Louth and Waterford, be identified as waters affected by pollution by nitrates from agricultural sources. I am arranging to have sent to the Deputy copies of the above mentioned EPA assessment and of the groundwater monitoring data available to the panel. An EPA report on the quality of drinking water in Ireland for the year 2000 became available in December 2001 and is available in the Oireachtas Library. This indicates a compliance rate of just over 99% with the prescribed standard for nitrates, 50 mg/l nitrates, but also that breaches of the standard were recorded in nine counties.</P>

      <P>My Department has received proposals from a number of bodies, including the local authority concerned, to seek assistance from the European Economic Area Financial Instrument for certain projects. The objective of the instrument, which is funded by Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, is to contribute to reducing social and economic disparities in Europe. Under the instrument, up to 5.525 million may be available to Ireland during the period 1999 to 2003 for projects related to the environment, including urban renewal, the reduction of urban pollution, cultural heritage, transport and education and training, including academic research. In the case of projects otherwise financed from central or local government, the contribution from the instrument can be up to 85% of the project cost. Responsibility for the <Col N="522" /> approval of assistance rests with the Financial Instrument Committee, which is representative of the funding states and based in Brussels.</P>
      <P>Following discussions with the Department of Finance, which is responsible for the selection of projects to be put forward for assistance, my Department has recently been in contact with the bodies that put forward the proposals, including the local authority concerned, with a view to finalising an application to the Financial Instrument Committee as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>My Department requires driving test candidates to ensure that where the seats of the vehicle to be used for a driving test were designed to hold head restraints, these restraints must be in place on the day of the test. Candidates are advised of this requirement in documentation provided to them when applying for the driving test.</P>
      <P>These requirements are generally consistent with the provisions of road traffic regulations that every motor vehicle shall be maintained by reference to the design and construction of the vehicle as carried out by the manufacturer.</P>

      <P>Current road traffic regulations require the fitting of seat belts in all forward facing front seats in all minibuses, including those used as school buses, which have a design gross vehicle weight not exceeding 3500 kg and are first registered on or after 1 January 1992. Under EU Directive 96/36/EC, member states may require that all seating positions in new passenger vehicles with seating for more than eight persons excluding the driver, are fitted with seat belts: vehicles designed to accommodate standing passengers are excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The adoption of this requirement would <i>inter alia</i> involve the phasing out of the present 3:2 rule which applies to school buses. My Department is at present preparing to publish a working paper on school bus safety in consultation with the Department of Education and Science and Bus Éireann. It is intended that this paper will <i>inter alia</i> address the provision of seat belts in school buses. The analysis will take account of relevant <Col N="525" /> EU directives and further European Commission proposals concerning specifications and use of buses.</P>
    <P>I intend that the forthcoming paper will support a public consultation process which will provide all interested parties with the opportunity to respond and assist in developing practical improvements in relation to school bus safety.</P>

      <P>The provision of a new waste water treatment plant and collection system at Derrinturn was included as a 2005 objective in the list of schemes submitted by Kildare County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The list did not include proposals for a sewerage scheme for Ticknevin.</P>
      <P>The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme 2000-2002, announced in July 2000. Given the timing indicated for the Derrinturn scheme by the council, and the absence of any prioritised proposal for Ticknevin, it has not been possible to include the schemes in the programme. Certain improvements to the existing sewerage system in Derrinturn were completed in May 2001 under the serviced land initiative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1999 urban renewal scheme envisages the preparation of integrated area plans, IAPs, by local authorities <Col N="530" /> as part of a more planned, integrated and focused approach to tax &ndash; incentive-based urban regeneration in line with recommendations made in the KPMG led report on urban renewal published in 1996. Detailed guidelines have been issued by my Department to assist local authorities in preparing IAPs. These set out the purposes and aims of the scheme, the criteria to be used in selecting areas for which plans are prepared, and advice on the approach to be followed in preparing plans.</P>
      <P>Local authorities were advised that the extent of designation was, of necessity, to be limited and well targeted, and that only areas that clearly fulfilled the objectives of the plans should be designated. The award of incentives could only be justified where it could be shown that they would assist in overcoming identifiable barriers to development. Following the preparation and submission of integrated area plan proposals by local authorities, these were then subjected to detailed assessment by a specially established expert advisory panel. The panel's recommendations on the areas to be designated will shortly be fully incorporated into the formal designation orders to be made by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been made under the scheme to date, and two recent initiatives should further encourage the bringing forward to construction of new projects and allow sufficient time for their completion: the deadline for tax reliefs for relevant expenditure under the scheme has been extended from 31 December 2002 to 31 December 2004 and, with effect from 5 December last, section 23 residential investor incentives are now available to sites already designated for residential owner-occupier relief under the scheme. This will boost rental residential supply under the scheme at a time when there is high demand for such accommodation. No further designations are being made under the scheme; the priority now is to ensure that the scheme is implemented successfully in the areas designated.</P>

The design of these standards is at present being formulated by a working group comprising representatives of my Department and of instruction interests. It is envisaged that as part of this process an organisation will have to seek accreditation from the National Accreditation Board that they are operating to a set standard. Accreditation cannot be confined to any one organisation. It will be open to any organisation to meet the required standard and seek recognition. The legislative basis for implementing these proposals is contained in the Road Traffic Bill, 2001.</P>

      <P>Draft regulations to introduce a levy on plastic shopping bags were released for public consultation on 18 September 2001. These proposed that the levy, to be charged <Col N="532" /> at 15 cent per bag with effect from 4 February 2002, would apply to all plastic bags suitable for use by customers at point-of-sale in retail outlets, subject to certain specified exemptions &ndash; for example, smaller bags used for non-packaged fresh food products. A two month consultation period was provided to give interested parties an opportunity to make comments or observations in relation to the draft regulations. A number of interested parties sought changes to, or exemptions from, the regulations. Requests were also received from trade representative bodies for the levy to be postponed until after the dual currency period associated with the euro changeover. Following detailed consideration of all submissions received, I made the final regulations on 19 December 2001. These provide for the introduction of the levy from 4 March 2002, thereby avoiding any clash with the euro changeover period, and allowing retailers extra time to put in place any necessary changes or measures to implement the levy.</P>

      <P>The maintenance and improvement of non-national roads in their areas is a matter for individual local authorities to be funded from their own resources supplemented by State grants provided by my Department. The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded under the various non-national road grant categories is also a matter for individual local authorities. I have recently announced a non-national road grant allocation of 6.05 million in 2002 to Louth County Council, which represents an increase of 19% on the 2001 payment figure and an increase of 112% on the 1997 payment figure. Drogheda Borough Council was allocated a total of 548,670 for 2002 an increase of 17% on the 2001 payment figure and an increase of 220% on the 1997 payment figure. While Drogheda Borough Council has advised my Department of outline proposals for the Drogheda cross route, otherwise known as the Ballymakenny cross route, neither local authority has submitted an application for funding for this scheme under the EU co-financed specific improvement grants scheme in 2002.</P>

    <P>My Department has placed numerous advertisements since June, 1997, mainly on foot of statutory notification requirements. There has also been a range of advertising campaigns across the whole media spectrum over the period in question to highlight issues of relevance to my Department. The expenditure returns outlined above <Col N="537" /> include a contribution of 1,270, £1,000, in 1998 towards an educational video and 20,316, £15,000, in 2001 towards a promotional video. The bulk of the increase in expenditure in recent years is due to the comprehensive multi-annual environmental awareness campaign initiated in 1999. The Department also funds the operations of ENFO &ndash; the environmental information service. ENFO provides an authoritative source of factual information on the environment and sustainable life styles. This is achieved, <i>inter alia</i>, through providing access to a drop-in centre, library, exhibitions, leaflets, CDs and videos.</P>

It is an offence for a vehicle to be stopped or parked in a disabled persons parking bay unless a disabled persons parking permit is displayed in the vehicle or it is being parked for the convenience of the person to whom the permit is granted. The signing approach adopted in respect of the disabled persons parking bay is consistent with the general approach adopted both nationally in respect of parking bays that are regulatory in nature and internationally in relation to disabled persons parking bays. The traffic signs manual provides that where a disabled persons parking bay is provided, an information sign depicting a person in a wheelchair should also be provided. I do not propose to alter the current signage arrangement for disabled persons parking bays.</P>

      <P>No such change has been made in the classification of public capital programme expenditure for which my Department is responsible. The main elements of the public private partnerships, PPP, programme were set out in the national development plan in 1999. The plan sets a minimum target of 1.968 million for privately financed projects included in programmes under the aegis of my Department. Most of these privately financed projects will be in the national roads, 1,270 million, and waste management, 571 million, sectors with a smaller target for the water services sector, 127 million. In addition, a considerable number of PPP arrangements will be wholly financed by public capital, particularly in the water services sector for the design, build and operation of waste infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the plan, consideration has been given to the potential for PPP arrangements in some other areas, where this would provide additional value for money, scope for innovation and accelerate delivery of projects. For example, in August 2001, local authorities were invited to examine the potential for PPP projects within the housing sector. In addition, a fund of approximately 5 million has been established for a three year period from 2000 to provide local authorities with start up funding for PPP projects outside the main capital programmes.</P>

      <P>The disabled persons grant scheme is administered by local authorities in accordance with the legal framework laid down in section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1979 and statutory Regulations made under that Act. Under the scheme, local authorities may pay a grant for the provision of additional accommodation or necessary works of adaptation to an existing house to meet the needs of a disabled member of the household or in respect of a new house which has been specifically adapted to meet the needs of a disabled person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have improved the terms and conditions of the disabled persons grant scheme on three <Col N="541" /> occasions since 1997 with the effective maximum grant of 20,320 for adaptation works to an existing house now double its 1997 level. I have also introduced an effective maximum grant of 12,700, compared to a previous maximum of 3,809, towards the purchase of a new house specially adapted for a disabled person. The somewhat lower maximum grant available for new house works reflects the generally greater cost of adapting an existing house compared to a new house to provide for the needs of a disabled person.</P>
    <P>Bodies which may be considered for approved status as a voluntary housing body include limited companies formed by guarantee of their members and without shareholders and registered under the Companies Acts 1963-1990, societies registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts 1893-1978 and trusts incorporated under the Charities Acts. To qualify for approved status, a body must have as an objective the provision of housing, the relief of housing need or poverty or hardship. A company or society must have provisions in its memorandum of association or registered rules, as the case may be, prohibiting the distribution of any surplus, profit, bonus or dividend to members and requiring that the assets of the body be applied solely towards its objectives. Voluntary housing projects have no maximum or minimum unit requirements.</P>
    <P>Applications for approval must be supported by the memorandum and articles of association, rules or the constitution of the body seeking approval together with a copy of its certificate of incorporation or registration, information on its present financial position, a description of its activities, plans and programme, the names and addresses of its officers and of the members of its governing body or board of directors, the address of its registered office and the address of its secretary, if different from the registered office.</P>

      <P>Since 1997 the following approved voluntary bodies have been assisted in the provision of dwelling units for disabled adults in the Dublin area: Cheshire Foundation of Ireland Ltd, Interaid, National Association of Housing for Visually Impaired Ltd, Aspire, St. Michael's House and Sue Ryder Foundation (IRL) Limited. I understand from the local authorities who are responsible for the operation of the voluntary housing schemes in the Dublin area that those voluntary bodies are still active together with a number of others which also cater for the housing needs of disabled persons, for example, <Col N="542" /> Newgrove, Sunbeam House. Enquiries regarding the availability of accommodation should be made to the relevant local authority or to the voluntary body.</P>

      <P>No such guidelines have been issued by my Department. Under the Air Pollution Act 1987, as amended by the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, primary responsibility for the monitoring of air quality and the nature, extent and effects of emissions rests with a local authority. In the case of activities licensable under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, the management of odours is a matter for the EPA. The Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 (Ambient Air Quality Assessment and Management) Regulations 1999 designated the EPA as the competent authority and body responsible for assessing ambient air quality for the purposes of Directive 96/62/EC on ambient air quality assessment and management. Part II of the Air Pollution Act 1987 sets out the steps which can be taken in relation to air pollution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2(2) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992 sets an objective for the board of determining every appeal or other matter within a period of four months. The Planning and Development Act, 2000 amends the statutory objective period to 18 weeks, with effect from 11 March 2002.</P>
      <P>Statistics supplied to my Department by An Bord Pleanála indicate that in 2001, 29% of cases received during the year were determined within four months. The average time taken to dispose of cases in 2001 was 25 weeks. However, the board gives priority to appeals involving housing developments in excess of 30 units and the percentage of such cases not decided within four months was 44% as at end 2001. The primary cause for the high percentage not determined within four months was the major increase in the number of appeals coming before the board in recent years. The number of cases received by the board in 2001 was 5,219; 4,998 cases were disposed of by the board in the year. This compares with 3,424 cases received and 3,237 cases disposed of, respectively, in 1996. The precautionary measures taken by the board in response to the foot and mouth outbreak, which restricted site inspections was also a factor in 2001.</P>
      <P>Details of the measures being pursued by my Department and the board to enable the board to process appeals more expeditiously are set out in detail in the reply to Question No. 4 of 6 December 2001. In summary, during my term as Minister, board membership has been doubled from six in 1998 to 12 currently, the authorised staff complement stands at 138, an increase of over 50, 79 planners have been engaged on a fee per case basis to provide reports on the smaller type of appeals, seven consultancy firms have been engaged to provide reports on the larger cases and a panel of consultants have been set up to hold hearings in relation to motorway schemes, CPOs and other procedures devolved to the board under the Planning and Development Act, 2000. I anticipate that all of these measures will enable the board to eliminate the backlog of appeal cases by mid 2002 as well as to discharge effectively its new functions in relation to major infrastructural development.</P>

Under section 9 of the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, a dog must be accompanied and kept under effectual control unless it is on the premises of its owner or of the person in whose charge the dog is or of another person, with that person's consent. The worrying of livestock by a dog is an offence for which the owner, or any other person in charge of the dog, may be liable to a penalty involving a fine not exceeding 1,269.74 and/or a term of imprisonment of not exceeding three months, or both.</P>

      <P>Donegal County Council's tender recommendation in respect of the Donegal town centre sewer contract is under examination in my Department and will be dealt with as quickly as possible. The treatment works element of the scheme is being advanced as a grouped design-build-operate project that also includes the Rossnowlagh and Ballyshannon sewerage schemes. Contract documents for this project have been submitted to my Department by the council and are being examined. Certain planning aspects of the Ballyshannon and Rossnowlagh schemes will need to be resolved by the council before tenders can be invited for the grouped project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The town renewal scheme is monitored on an ongoing basis. Designations under the town renewal scheme were announced in July 2000. Residential incentives were commenced immediately, but the requirement to obtain European Commission approval for the commercial incentives meant that these did not commence until 6 April 2001. While the detailed information requested is not yet available in my Department, the take up of the scheme appears to have been slow in some towns. In response to this position, the Government announced in December 2001 a new initiative aimed at boosting the supply of rental residential accommodation in areas already designated under the town renewal scheme and the current urban renewal scheme.</P>
      <P>The initiative involves the extension of section 23 type incentives with effect from 5 December 2001 to sites and sub-areas already designated for owner-occupier reliefs. This arrangement complements other measures aimed at boosting housing supply which were contained in budget 2002. These amendments represent a considerable enhancement of the town renewal scheme and will also complement local authority efforts in attracting investment for sites designated as commercial and industrial under the scheme. I am confident that, with pro-active promotion of the scheme by the relevant county councils involved, activation of the section 23 initiative announced recently, and the removal of uncertainty in relation to the operation of the commercial and industrial incentives, significant progress will be achieved in the towns designated. The scheme will run to 31 December 2003.</P>

      <P>Section 38 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 enables planning authorities to enter into agreements with any person with a legal interest in land in their area for the purpose of restricting or regulating the development or use <Col N="549" /> of land, permanently or for a specific period. Such agreements may be used, for example, where applications are made for housing for family members on farm land where, under the development plan, planning permission for housing would not normally be granted. In circumstances such as these where it is proposed to grant permission as an exception to the general planning policy for the area, permission for a house may be granted subject to a requirement that the house is occupied by a family member and to a requirement that a section 38 agreement is signed to ensure that remaining land is kept available for farming by restricting further housing development.</P>
      <P>While no specific guidelines on the use of such agreements have been published by my Department, advice on the restriction of housing occupancy to family members was contained in general guidance issued in 1982. That advises that these conditions may be imposed where the grant of permission is considered essential to meet the need for which the exception is made.</P>

      <P>Contract documents for this scheme, submitted to my Department by Kilkenny County Council in the mid-1980s and revised in February 2001, have not been approved. Elements of the scheme were included in the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by the council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of these assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme, 2000-02, announced in July 2000. Because of the level of competing demand, the limited funding available, and the need to prioritise individual proposals on a national basis, it has not been possible to include the scheme in the programme.</P>

The scheme was included as a 2004-05 objective in the list of sewerage schemes submitted by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into <Col N="553" /> account in the framing of the water services investment programme, 2000-02, announced in July 2000. Given the priority rating afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available, it has not been possible to include it in the programme.</P>

    <P>The carer's benefit scheme is intended to support people who must leave the workforce temporarily to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention. The arrangements involve two separate elements. The first is a weekly income support payment, which is operated and paid by my Department. This is based <Col N="554" /> on PRSI contributions paid by the carer. The second is the protection of the carer's employment rights for the duration of the caring period, which is a key feature of the scheme. In order to qualify for carer's benefit, a person must be in full-time employment. This condition is satisfied if the person worked at least 19 hours per week or 38 hours per fortnight in the three months prior to applying for carer's benefit. The person concerned is not entitled to carer's benefit, as they do not satisfy this condition.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is a universal payment which is payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years and continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 years who are in full-time education or who have a physical or mental disability. Policy in relation to the issue of school attendance is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science. In this regard, the Deputy may be aware that the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 provides for a new system to support students to attend school regularly. This Act puts the focus on a welfare approach to encourage regular attendance at school, rather than enforcement. In the circumstances, making the payment of child benefit contingent on regular attendance at school would not be consistent with the policy direction of the Education (Welfare) Act. Moreover, the proposal to link payment of child benefit to regular attendance at school would have extensive administrat<Col N="555" /> ive implications, both in relation to the operation of the child benefit scheme and for the schools involved in certifying such attendance.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the various health boards and neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for the payment by a health board of exceptional needs payments in order to assist people with once off exceptional expenditure which, given the circumstances of the case, the person could not be reasonably be expected to meet out of their normal weekly income. Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment. Payments are &ldquo;once-off&rdquo; and made at the discretion of the health board. Every decision in these cases is based on careful consideration of all the circumstances of the individual case taking account of the nature and extent of the need.</P>
      <P>There is no facility under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to make payments in respect of the type of expense referred to by the Deputy. The expenses incurred in purchasing a car are not appropriate to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and no such payments have been made under the scheme. However, if the Deputy has a particular case or cases in mind and can supply relevant details, I will arrange to have further inquiries made with the health board concerned to clarify the nature of any assistance being provided and the individual circumstances of the particular case.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 813 and 818 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free schemes, which include the electricity-gas allowance, telephone allowance and free TV licence scheme, provide a basic package of neces<Col N="556" /> sary benefits which ensure a limited standard of comfort or well-being to a particular targeted group. It is not within the scope of my Department to provide for all socially desirable items of expenditure. As indicated in response to the Deputy's previous question on this subject a review of the free schemes, published in 2000, recommended that no further goods and services be covered by the schemes, unless their social benefit is clearly over and above that which can be purchased by increased income. Accordingly, there are no plans at present to expand the range of services covered by the schemes. Some companies, not just those in the semi-State sector, do offer concessions to older people. I encourage companies to offer concessions where possible but, at the end of the day, this is a matter for the individual enterprises.</P>
    <P>With regard to the time restrictions on the free travel scheme, these have been a feature of the free travel scheme since its inception. They apply at peak times on city bus services in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. They do not, however, apply in the case of mentally handicapped people, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses or certain work experience programmes and certain other disabled or blind people. These people are issued with an unrestricted free travel pass which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times. The central issue in regard to time restrictions relates to capacity constraints. Where restrictions apply it is at the request of the transport companies because the transport system is under severe pressure from commuters travelling to and from work and school in the morning and evening. There are no peak time travel restrictions on DART, suburban rail services, and on services provided by private transport operators in other parts of the country.</P>

      <P>The family mediation service is a free, professional confidential service which enables couples, who have decided to separate, reach agreement on all issues related to their separation. It assists couples in addressing the issues on which they need to make decisions including: post-separation living arrangements; finances and parenting arrangements so that ongoing close relationships with both parents are made possible for the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this Government came to office the family mediation service has been radically expanded in line with commitments in An Action Programme for the Millennium to establish a nationwide service. The service is now available from 11 centres throughout the country, up from just two <Col N="557" /> in 1997. The family mediation service is now available from centres in Dublin, Athlone, Castlebar, Cork, Dundalk, Galway, Limerick, Tralee and Wexford. The Dublin service has been expanded and relocated to larger premises to deal with more clients and new services have been established in Tallaght and Marino serving Coolock and the northside of Dublin. A new service for the people of Blanchardstown and the surrounding population in north west Dublin will commence shortly and the provision of a service for the north west of the country remains a high priority.</P>
    <P>As soon as the present phase of expansion is completed plans for the further extension of the family mediation service in the south east of the country to County Waterford will be progressed by the new Family Support Agency. The Family Support Agency will take on the responsibility for the future development of a range of pro-family services which I have introduced over the past few years to promote family well-being, including the family mediation service. The further development and expansion of the family mediation service so that more people throughout the country will have access to this important family service will be a core function of the new agency. It is my intention to formally establish the new Family Support Agency very shortly.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of the Dormant Accounts Act, 2001 is to reunite account holders with their dormant funds in credit institutions. From April 2002, credit institutions will be obliged to make reasonable efforts to contact the owners of accounts that have been &ldquo;dormant&rdquo;, that is, where there has been no customer initiated transactions on the account, for 15 years or more. If the owners of accounts which have been dormant for 15 years or more, have not come forward by the end of March 2003 to reclaim their moneys, the balances in the accounts will be transferred to a &ldquo;Dormant Accounts Fund&rdquo; to be established and managed by the National Management Treasury Agency. The transfer of moneys will take place on the basis that the beneficial owners of them will have a guaranteed right of reclaim to their property at any time in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act also provides that I will appoint the members of the &ldquo;Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursement Board&rdquo;, whose remit will be to oversee a scheme for disbursement of surplus dormant funds from April 2003. The purposes for which the surplus dormant funds will be disbursed are set out in section 41 of the Act. Broadly speaking, the projects or programmes to <Col N="558" /> benefit will be those designed to assist the personal, educational and social development of persons who are economically, educationally or socially disadvantaged. The scheme will also be applied to programmes to assist people with a disability and to assist primary school students with learning difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Act provides that, as soon as practicable after its establishment, the board will prepare a plan for disbursement of moneys from the fund. The plan will include the objectives of the board in making disbursements and what strategy the board has for achieving those objectives. As Minister, I also have power to issue directions and guidelines to the board concerning the preparation of the plan. Preliminary arrangements to establish the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursement Board are under way in my Department. I will ensure that the board is established in good time to begin the important work on the preparation of its plan for disbursement of surplus dormant moneys from April 2003.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. Under the terms of the SWA scheme payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>SWA is subject to a means test. Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances, less 7.62, £6. This 7.62, £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Many recipients pay more than 7.62, £6 towards their rent because applicants are required to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>SWA is not normally payable to people in full time employment. However, special arrangements have been in place for a number of years now which allow people on approved schemes such as community employment to retain part of their rent or mortgage interest supplement, subject to a gross household income limit of 317.43, £250 per week and certain other conditions. Fol<Col N="559" /> lowing discussions with the social partners, under Partnership 2000, substantial improvements in the conditions relating to the retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements were introduced from 6 April 2000. The 317.43, £250 per month limit on the amount of rent supplement payable was abolished and the sharp withdrawal of support at the end of the third year was removed, the supplement now being withdrawn on a tapered basis over a 4 year period i.e. 75% in year 1, 50% in year 2 and 25% in year 3 and 25% in year 4. As a result, many participants in CE schemes now retain a greater amount of rent supplement than they would have done under the earlier arrangements. This is particularly the case for families. In no circumstances do the new rules result in a lower rate of rent supplement than is payable under the standard rules of SWA. All CE recipients are entitled to either the gradually reducing amount that can be retained under the transitional arrangements or the amount that is normally paid under the standard rules of SWA, whichever is the greater.</P>

      <P>An individual who breaks a limb and is unable to work would normally apply for disability benefit from my Department. To qualify for disability benefit an individual must be incapable of work and satisfy certain PRSI contribution conditions. Short-term benefits such as disability benefit require the claimant to have paid a minimum number of contributions, 39 weeks and to demonstrate a recent attachment to the workforce by having a minimum number of contributions in a recent tax year. In some instances where an individual's average weekly income in the relevant tax year is below a certain level a reduced rate of disability benefit may be payable. Where an individual does not have sufficient contributions to qualify for disability benefit or is only qualified for a reduced rate they may qualify for assistance under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, health boards can provide a basic weekly payment to eligible people who have little or no income. In addition to the basic payment assistance is also available in the form of supplements which may be paid in respect of such needs as rent, diet or <Col N="560" /> heating and exceptional needs payments where in the opinion of the health board exceptional circumstances exist. An assessment of a person's means, whether this be cash income or benefit in kind, is carried out and where there is a shortfall in a person's means a payment may be made to bring that person's income up to the supplementary welfare allowance rate appropriate to their family size.</P>

      <Quest>the level of protection or benefits provided under the social insurance scheme to persons who are involved in job sharing; if the normal benefits, such as dental, eye, maternity and superannuation benefits apply to persons in this category; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Job sharers are liable to pay PRSI, subject to the normal thresholds etc, and receive the relevant benefits under the same terms and conditions that apply to PRSI contributors generally. Because PRSI is charged on a weekly basis, some job sharers may find that, because of their particular work pattern, they do not work for 52 PRSI weeks and therefore have less than 52 contributions in a year. This can, in certain circumstances, effect their entitlement to benefits. However, in many cases, jobsharers may be in the situation where they can change their work pattern to ensure that they work in each PRSI week, and therefore get the full 52 contributions. The main effects of having less than 52 contributions or credits in a year are set out as follows, but in view of the range of job sharing options available, it is difficult to deal with all possibilities in a single statement. Individual job sharers who are unsure of their entitlements should contact my Department's information section for fuller details of the implications for their case.</P>
      <P>In relation to old age and retirement pension, these pensions are based on the person's contribution over their full working life, and not the pattern in any particular year. Since job sharing is usually availed of for a few years, rather than over a person's full working life, most people would find they have sufficient contributions for a pension, even if they have been job sharing for some years of their working life. Short-term benefits, such as unemployment and sickness benefits require that a certain number of contributions be paid or credited in the &ldquo;governing contribution year&rdquo;, which is currently the second last tax year before the calendar year in which one claims benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until last year, to qualify for these benefits, 39 <Col N="561" /> contributions had to be paid or credited in the governing contribution year. The difficulty which this presented for job sharers was brought to my attention, and as a result, I added an alternative contribution test for these benefits last year: a person who does not have 39 contributions in the governing contribution year, but who has 26 contributions paid in both the governing contribution year and the previous year, can now qualify for unemployment benefit, disability benefit, and carers benefit. In general, jobsharers whose working pattern means that they only have 26 contributions in a year can now qualify for these benefits under this new test. A small number of people, e.g. those who were job sharing, but not for the full year might still not have 26 contributions paid, but in a contributory system it is necessary to strike a balance between a reasonable number of contributions and entitlement to benefits. Treatment benefits, i.e. dental and optical benefits, generally require the customer to have 39 PRSI contributions either paid or credited in the governing contribution year. Some job sharers may find that they do not have the required number of contributions, and therefore fail to qualify for these benefits.</P>
    <P>In view of the complexity of these arrangements, my Department is in the process of preparing an information leaflet for jobsharers and potential jobsharers, in order that they will be able to assess the implications of different jobsharing options. In the meantime, individuals can contact my Department to establish their own situation. In the medium term, there is a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to set up a working group to produce proposals for the development of a fully inclusive social insurance model which would facilitate combining work and family responsibilities. It is intended to establish this group later this year, and I would expect that its work would include making proposals for any further measures needed to address the situation of job sharers.</P>

      <P>The weekly value of capital is assessed in a similar manner for both old age pension and pre-retirement allowance. I understand the Deputy is referring, in particular, to the difference in the assessment of means generally, including capital, for these schemes in the case of couples. It is estimated that the cost of applying the same arrangements as applies in the case of old age pension in respect of capital for <Col N="562" /> pre-retirement allowance would be approximately 0.33 million per annum. However, the difference in the assessment of means from capital must be seen in the context of the assessment of means generally for the schemes in question. In the case of old age pension, the current arrangements provide that the means of the claimant shall be taken to be one half of the total means of the couple. Where means are in excess of 7.60 per week, reduced rates of both the personal payment and the increase for a qualified adult are payable.</P>
      <P>In the case of pre-retirement allowance, the means of a couple are halved where the spouse has earnings from insurable employment and where the spouse-partner's income from any source is greater than 76.18 per week. Increases for qualified adults continue to be payable at the full rate where the spouse-partner's income is less than 88.88 per week and at reduced rates where that income is between 88.88 per week and 196.81 per week. These provisions are similar to those which apply in the case of unemployment assistance and disability allowance.</P>
      <P>The differences in the assessment of means for various schemes arises as a result of the fact that each scheme was developed to ensure that the needs of the various client groups were met. Any change in the method of assessment of capital for pre-retirement allowance could only be considered in the context of the assessment of means generally for this scheme and associated schemes and there are no plans, at present, to change the current arrangements.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 821 and 830 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme. Since its commencement, a total of 32.5 million has been allocated to the scheme, which to the end of 2000 has assisted some 80,482 individuals. Details of grants awarded in 2001 and the number of beneficiaries of the scheme last year are currently being compiled and will be made available in the coming <Col N="563" /> weeks. A further 4.4 million has again been provided for the scheme in 2002.</P>
    <P>Voluntary or community based groups seeking funding under the scheme of community support for older people must satisfy the defined eligibility criteria of the scheme, comply with Government tax clearance procedures and provide satisfactory accounts in respect of previously paid grants. I am anxious that this scheme continues to operate in a way that benefits the most vulnerable older people in our society. With this in mind my Department keeps the administrative procedures applying to the scheme under review and makes amendments as appropriate. My Department also monitors the scheme on an on-going basis to ensure that those organisations receiving funding under the scheme are complying with all the scheme regulations and requirements.</P>
    <P>The organisation mentioned in the Deputy's question is one of the voluntary organisations who have submitted applications for funding to my Department in recent years. While every effort is made to ensure the prompt processing of applications under the scheme, my Department, in administering this and other grant schemes funded from public money, must ensure that all criteria are adhered to, including the provision by funded groups of satisfactory accounts in respect of previously issued grants.</P>
    <P>An application for funding was received from this organisation in 2000 and 2001. However, as satisfactory accounts were not submitted to my Department in respect of the grant issued in 1999, it was not possible to process the application further. My Department has been engaged in lengthy correspondence with the group on this matter and recently received accounts and other documentation which are currently under consideration. Representatives from my Department met the organisation recently to discuss outstanding issues relating to its application. As a result of that meeting my Department is reviewing the application and additional information provided by the organisation. My Department hopes to resolve this situation shortly and will be in touch with the organisation in due course.</P>
    <P>In relation to the individual mentioned in the Deputy's question, this person applied for funding through the voluntary organisation mentioned in the question in 2000. I have made arrangements with the Dublin north regional office of my Department, which processes applications for the organisation mentioned, to notify this individual of the outcome of his application as soon as the situation has been resolved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 822 and 827 together.</P>
      <P>Since this Government took office, I have introduced a range of measures to improve the position of carers. Some of these measures are listed below:</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme was extended to carers of people who receive a prescribed relatives or constant attendance allowance from April 1999. The free Travel scheme was extended to carer's allowance recipients from September 1998. Credited PRSI contributions are available to all qualified carers from April 1999. An annual payment, which is made in June each year towards respite care, was introduced in June 1999. A double respite care grant is payable to carers caring for more than one person. The telephone allowance was extended to all qualified carers from August 1999. The residency criteria have been relaxed to allow non-resident carers qualify for the allowance from August 1999. Carer's allowance was extended to all carers caring for someone between the age of 16 and 65, regardless of the source of income of the care recipient. The allowance was also extended to include carers who are caring for a child in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance. These measures were implemented from August 1999.</P>
      <P>Qualified carers are no longer required to satisfy &ldquo;13 paid contribution&rdquo; rule when claiming disability benefit from April 2000. Carers who have ceased their caring responsibilities are eligible for the back to work scheme from April 1999 and for the back to education allowance scheme from September 2000.</P>
      <P>The electricity-gas allowance and free TV licence schemes were extended to all qualified carers from October 2000. The carer's benefit scheme was introduced in October 2000. This is a social insurance payment specifically intended to support people who must leave the workforce to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also announced a number of significant improvements for carers in the recent budget as follows: carer's allowance rates increased by 10.23, £8.06 for carers aged under 66 and by 12.73, £10.03 for carers aged over 66 from 3 January. Carer's benefit rates also increased by 10.17, £8.01 per week to 132.70, £104.51 from this date. From April 2002, the weekly income disregards in the carer's allowance means test will increase by 32.28, £25.42 to 191, £150.42 for a <Col N="565" /> single person and by 64.57, £50.85 to 382, £300.84 for a couple. In addition, for the third successive year, I have made provision for an increase in the respite care grant by 127, £100.02 to 635, £500.10 and to 1,270, £1,000.21 for carers who are caring for more than one person.</P>
    <P>At the end of 2001, there were more than 18,800 carers in receipt of carer's allowance. This is an increase of more than 104% per cent in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since this Government took office. This large increase is reflected in the expenditure on carer's allowance, which was £36.5 million, 46.3 in 1997 and is estimated to be £101.4 million, 128.7 in 2001, representing an increase of almost 180 per cent. From August 1999 the full-time care and attention requirements were relaxed to introduce greater flexibility into the carer's allowance scheme, while still safeguarding the needs and interests of care recipients. This measure allows carers to work for up to 10 hours per week. This was introduced in recognition of the economic and therapeutic values of work outside the home. It also allows carers to maintain contact with the labour market.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance scheme is designed for full-time carers. Part-time caring situations are not covered by the scheme. The respite care grant and other supports, such as the free schemes, are only paid where there is a carer's allowance in payment and to carers who are caring for recipients of a constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance. All other matters relating to respite care are the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children.</P>

      <P>The Action Programme for the Millennium set a target old age pension rate of 126.97 by 2002. In the review of this programme, the Government committed to the early achievement of the 126.97 rate and, furthermore, extended it to other social welfare pensions. This target was achieved one year ahead of schedule in the case of old age contributory pension and widow's contributory pension and was achieved in this year's budget for old age non-contributory pension. The improvements announced in Budget 2002 saw the old age (contributory) pension increase to 147.30 per week, the old age (non-contributory) pension increase to 134.00 per week and the widow(er)'s contributory pension for someone over 66 years of age increase to 144.80 per week. The Government is also committed to increasing the rate of the widow(er)'s contributory pension to same level as the old age (contributory) pension and <Col N="566" /> significant progress has also been made in this regard in recent years.</P>
      <P>Overall increases in old age pensions since 1997 amount to between 33.02 and 48.29 per week or 37% to 49%. The personal rate of contributory pensions has increased from 27% of average earnings in 1997 to a projected 31% in 2002. As announced in last year's budget, I intend to increase the payment for qualified adults, aged 66 or over to same level as the personal rate of the old age non-contributory pension. This process commenced in Budget 2000 with special increases of 19.05 granted. In Budget 2002 increases of up to 12.70 were granted to qualified adults over 66 years of age. This Government is committed to ensuring the widest possible coverage for contributory pensions. In recent years more flexibility has been introduced into the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory pension scheme including a reduction in the average number of contributions required for pension purposes to 10. Arrangements were also introduced to cater for particular groups who would not otherwise qualify for a pension.</P>
      <P>A special old age contributory pension was introduced in April 1999 for those self employed people who were aged 56 or over in April 1988 when compulsory social insurance was introduced for this group. These could not satisfy the basic requirement of having entered insurance 10 years before pension age. The pension is paid to those who have at least 5 year's contributions paid. Payment is at a flat-rate of 50% of the standard maximum rate with equivalent increases for adult and child dependants.</P>
      <P>In 2000 a special flat-rate old age contributory pension, payable at 50% of the maximum personal rate was introduced for any person who became insurably employed prior to 1953 and who, due to the yearly average rule, failed to qualify for pension or qualified for a pension at less than 50% of the standard maximum rate. To qualify, a person must have paid at least 260 contributions which may comprise all pre-53 contributions or a combination of pre and post 1953 insurance. Applications for this special pension are still being processed but at this stage over 9,000 have been awarded a pension while 8,500 existing pensioners who were receiving pro-rata pensions at less than 50% of the full personal rate have also benefited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also in 2000 I introduced significant improvements in the structure of the rates band under the old age contributory and retirement pensions which involved a reduction in the number of different rates payable. As a result all payments were reviewed and some 38,000 pensioners, who were on reduced rate old age contributory and retirement pensions saw their position improved. Other improvements made in the area of pensions include changes in the assessment of capital under the means tests for non-contributory payments and the extension of tapering of the qualified adult allowance to recipients of the old age contributory and retirement pensions. This latter <Col N="567" /> measure involves a more gradual withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance where the qualified adult has an independent income. The current gross income range for a qualified adult is between 88.88 and 196.81.</P>
    <P>Significant improvements have also been made in the area of the free schemes. In October 2000, the free schemes were extended to all people over 75 years of age regardless of their income or household composition and the qualifying age was reduced to 70 years of age with effect from May 2001. Free electricity allowance and free TV licence schemes were also extended to qualified carers with effect from October 2000. The number of units on electricity-gas allowance will increase from 1,500 units per annum to 1,800 units per annum from February 2002. The qualifying conditions for all the schemes are being standardised from May 2002 and this will mean that those who qualify will receive the full range of schemes available under these three schemes. Last year's budget extended the free fuel scheme by three weeks to 29 weeks. Improvements for the elderly have been one the Governments main priorities since taking office and very significant progress has been made this area.</P>

      <P>This Government is committed to supporting parents in rearing their children. Child benefit, normally payable to the mother, recognises the important value of the work done by the primary carer, who is usually the mother. Budget 2002 provides for a repeat of the record child benefit increases paid in 2001. From April this year, child benefit rates will rise by 31.80 for the first two children and 38.10 for third and subsequent children &ndash; bringing the lower rate to 117.60 and the higher rate for subsequent children to 142.30. These substantial increases will further strengthen the position of those who choose to care for their children on a full-time basis in the home. Action has also been taken to safeguard the social welfare pension rights of those who take them out of the paid workforce for caring duties. In recent years more flexibility has been introduced into the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory pension scheme, including a reduction in the average number of contributions required for a minimum pension to 10, the introduction of pro-rata pensions for those with mixed rate insurance records and the special pension for those with pre-1953 insurance contributions. These measures are of benefit to many women who have gaps in their <Col N="568" /> PRSI records due to working in the home looking after children, or caring full time for an elderly or incapacitated person.</P>
      <P>The homemakers scheme was introduced in 1994 and allows for periods spent out of the work force caring for children or sick relatives to be disregarded when a person's contribution record is being averaged for pension purposes. This scheme is being reviewed as part of an overall review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pension, the first phase of which was published in August 2000. It is expected that the phase 2 report will be finalised shortly. Changes to the homemakers scheme will be considered in the context of the findings of the phase 2 report.</P>

      <P>In Budget 2002, for the second year in a row I brought in a special increase of 15.87 per week for those in receipt of a widow or widower's contributory pension. This was a further step in the process of bringing the rate of the widow/er's contributory pension up to the level of the old age contributory pension. Cumulative increases since 1997 amount to about 60%. Also in Budget 2002, I increased the maximum rate of payment of widow and widower's contributory pension for those aged under 66 by 10.16 to 123.30 per week. I also increased the rates of widow and widower's non-contributory pension by the same amount. The maximum rate is now 118.80 per week for those aged under 66 and 134 per week for those aged over 66. Increases in these payments since 1997 amount between 36% and 56%. Increases in weekly payments came into effect in January of this year, a full 23 weeks earlier than normal.</P>
      <P>Widows and widowers are also benefiting from the changes in the free schemes which I announced in Budget 2001 and which provide for all persons aged over 70 years of age to have an entitlement to the full range of schemes regardless of their means or household composition. In Budget 2002, I announced further improvements to these schemes which will ensure that all recipients will now receive the full range of benefits available. Improvements have also been made in the payments available in the very difficult period immediately after a bereavement. In 1999, a bereavement grant of 635 was introduced. Where the deceased person was a social welfare recipient, arrangements are also in place to continue the payments to the widow/er for six weeks after the bereavement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Budget 2000, I introduced a new scheme, the widowed parent grant, to help with the special needs of widowed people with dependent chil<Col N="569" /> dren in the immediate aftermath of a bereavement. In Budget 2002, I increased the rate of this payment from 1,270 to 2,500. Since 1997, I have increased the monthly rates of child benefit, threefold and these increases are of particular benefit to widows and widowers with children. With effect from April 2002, monthly child benefit payments will be 117.60 per month for each of the first and second children and 147.30 per month for the third and subsequent children. The position with regard to social welfare provision for widowed people will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>Payments to people with disabilities in sheltered work services is not linked to the minimum wage and national agreement increases. People with disabilities attending sheltered work services currently retain their primary and secondary state disability benefits. Many service users also receive an additional weekly payment from service providers. If persons availing of these services were to receive the minimum wage they would lose their entitlement to state disability benefits.</P>
      <P>A working group established by my Department in August 2000 to draw up a code of practice for sheltered work is currently in the final stages of its assignment. The Working Group has been asked to specifically address the issues of the status and remuneration of people with disabilities in sheltered work services. These issues will be considered in depth when the working group makes its recommendations.</P>

      <P>he dispute in the Department's office in Letterkenny, which administers child benefit and treatment benefit, arose initially out of the filling of three additional temporary posts in the office by the recruitment of staff on short term contracts. Having commenced their industrial action in relation to the recruitment of temporary staff, the Civil and Public Service Union, CPSU then stated that its actions also covered its dissatisfaction with the implementation of a new computer system for the delivery of child benefit services. Following a series of discussions between the Department and the CPSU, the industrial action was suspended on 21 December 2001, pending the outcome of further negotiations. A draft agreement was finalised at a meeting on 3 January 2002 and was subsequently endorsed by a ballot of CPSU members. As a consequence, the full range of child benefit and treatment benefit services normally available has now been restored. The Department regrets the inconvenience experienced by the public during the course of the industrial action.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 831, 832 and 854 together.</P>
      <P>The current cadre of medical assessors in my Department comprises the chief medical adviser, deputy chief medical adviser and 18 medical assessors. These are fully qualified and experienced medical practitioners and registered with the Medical Council. Many have postgraduate qualifications in occupational medicine, some to specialist level. They are recruited via the Civil Service Commission and a condition of appointment is that they must have had at least six years experience in general medical practice.</P>
      <P>All medical assessors receive continuing medical education, by national and international experts, in human Disability evaluation medicine. Most are members of the Irish Society of Occupational Medicine. The chief medical adviser and his deputy also hold regular meetings and seminars in the course of which a range of medical issues and developments in the field of occupational medicine are discussed and guidelines formulated. The role of the medical assessor is to review applications for payment of illness related benefits, particularly where payment on a long-term or continuing basis may be involved.</P>
      <P>Initial claims for disability benefit are not generally assessed by a medical assessor but are paid on the basis of medical evidence from the persons' own doctor. As part of the normal controls on disability benefit payments, however, claims are referred to medical assessors from time to time to verify that the conditions of entitlement continue to be fulfilled and to prevent and detect unwarranted claims. Claims for long-term payments such as disability allowance and invalidity pension also involve an initial diagnosis by the person's own doctor but are submitted to a medical assessor before the claim is put into payment.</P>
      <P>In assessing the degree of incapacity the medical assessor reviews the history of the case, considers all available medical evidence, including any reports to hand from general practitioners and consultants and, where considered appropriate, carries out a medical examination. Where a person appeals against a decision on an illness related payment the case is referred to a different medical assessor for examination before a decision is made. Any additional specialist medical advise which the medical assessor considers necessary is also obtained in order to ensure that, the ultimate decision is based on sound medical evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The performance of medical assessors is moni<Col N="572" /> tored by the chief medical adviser to ensure that there is a reasonable level of consistency in the approach taken by medical assessors. Overall in 2001, of some 60,500 examinations carried out by medical assessors some 23% of those examined were found capable of work. The proportions found capable by each medical assessor ranged from 12% to 33%. I am satisfied that examinations by my Department's medical assessors are conducted in a fair, equitable, impartial and independent manner and to the highest standards in accordance with accepted medical practice and ethics.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 834 to 836, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to August 2001, orphan's contributory allowance and non-contributory pension were paid to foster carers by my Department on behalf of some children in foster care. Since then, new arrangements have been introduced which provide for the payment to be made directly to the health board, on behalf of, and for the benefit <Col N="573" /> of, each child in foster care. The payment is then passed on to the foster carer as part of the foster care allowance, which is paid by the health boards.</P>
    <P>These new arrangements do not affect the ownership of the payments. It remains the case that in determining entitlement for the non-contributory payment it is the child's means that are assessed and in the case of the contributory payment, it is the contribution record of the child's parents or step parents which is examined in order to determine entitlement to the payment. The arrangements do not contravene the governing social welfare legislation which provides that the payments may be made to the child's guardian or to some other person for the benefit of the child.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the conditions applying to the former disabled person's maintenance allowance, disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme was that the payment was not made to people who were in residential care or in hospital. People in this situation had their maintenance costs and an element of pocket money met through funding from the appropriate health board. However, since the take-over of the disability allowance scheme by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, this disqualification has been progressively relaxed, as follows: from October 1996, disability allowance is continued for up to 13 weeks where the person is admitted to hospital for treatment; with effect from June 1997 disability allowance was paid at half-rate for those in part-time residential care. In addition, people who come home for an extended holiday period of three weeks or more can qualify for disability allowance for that period; since August 1999 existing recipients of disability allowance who are living at home can retain their entitlement where they subsequently go into hospital or residential care; from May 2000, people in part-time residential care who had been entitled to half rate disability allowance since June 1997, became entitled to payment at the full rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, people who are living in community-based residences are eligible to receive disability allowance provided the relevant health board is not providing funding towards their maintenance. These improvements now mean that many of those who had previously been disqualified for payment under the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme because they were in residential care are now entitled to payment under the disability allowance scheme. Nevertheless, based on the limited data available <Col N="574" /> it is estimated there are still in the region of 4,000 to 5,000 people with disabilities in residential care who are not entitled to disability allowance. Many of these people receive a &ldquo;pocket money&rdquo; allowance from the health boards. The cost of abolishing the residency rule for this group is estimated to be approximately 32 million per annum.</P>
    <P>Despite the recent improvements, it is recognised that more needs to be done. The potential for further improvements in this area will continue to be examined in the light of the available resources and having regard to the Government's other priorities. These new arrangements do not affect the ownership of the payments. It remains the case that in determining entitlement for the non-contributory payment it is the child's means that are assessed and in the case of the contributory payment, it is the contribution record of the child's parents or step parents which is examined in order to determine entitlement to the payment. The arrangements do not contravene the governing social welfare legislation which provides that the payments may be made to the child's guardian or to some other person for the benefit of the child.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the various health boards and neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for the payment by a health board of exceptional needs payments in order to assist people with once off exceptional expenditure which, given the circumstances of the case, the person could not be reasonably expected to meet out of their normal weekly income. Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment. Payments are &ldquo;once-off&rdquo; and totally discretionary. Every decision in these cases is based on careful consideration of all the circumstances of the individual case taking account of the nature and extent of the need, the availability of an alternative source to meet the need, for example, entitlements from other State agencies, and also takes into account the resources of the household.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no facility under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to make payments in respect of the type of expense referred to by the Deputy. The expenses incurred in purchasing and maintaining a car for the benefit of a person with disabilities are not appropriate to the supplemen<Col N="575" /> tary welfare allowance scheme. The Department of Health and Children operates mobility allowance and motorised transport grant schemes for disabled persons. In addition the Revenue Commissioners grant a number of tax concessions for disabled drivers and passengers, under the disabled driver's and disabled passenger's (tax concessions) scheme.</P>

      <P>Payment of carer's allowance was disallowed by a deciding officer with effect from 10 August 2001 on the grounds that the person concerned did not satisfy the statutory condition of providing full-time care and attention as she worked in excess of ten hours per week. Following an oral hearing against this decision the appeals officer decided that the person concerned is entitled to carer's allowance with effect from 18 December 2001, when she ceased employment. She has been notified of this decision. Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the dissolution of the National Rehabilitation Board and the mainstreaming of employment and training supports within FÁS, new arrangements were implemented around mid-2001 for the payment of training allowances for people with disabilities who are in vocational training. The main effect of these new arrangements is to ensure that all people with disabilities participating in vocational training receive a proper training allowance, as recommended by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. This involved the discontinuance of the former arrangements whereby disability allowance had been used by training agencies, including the NTDI, as a form of training allowance. Such trainees are now entitled to the standard FÁS training allowance in substitution for their existing social welfare payments. They are also entitled to a weekly 31.74 training bonus from FÁS and to retain entitlement to all secondary benefits. On completion of the training, or where they are not in a position to finish <Col N="580" /> the training, entitlement to disability allowance is automatically restored.</P>
      <P>Where, following completion of a FÁS training course, or otherwise, people in receipt of disability allowance engage in rehabilitative employment or self-employment, the first 95.23 of their earnings &ndash; increasing to 120 from April 2002 &ndash; is disregarded for means test purposes. A recipient of disability allowance who wishes to engage in employment in the open labour market can avail of the back to work allowance. Under this scheme, participants can retain their social welfare payments on a sliding scale over three years &ndash; four years if they are self-employed &ndash; together with their earnings from employment or self-employment. As will be seen, therefore, a range of adaptations have been made to the disability allowance scheme in recent years so as to encourage claimants to participate in training programmes which are designed to increase their employability and to further encourage them to engage in employment opportunities where this is appropriate.</P>
      <P>FÁS training allowances are treated differently according to the particular nature of the social welfare scheme. For example, as both disability benefit and invalidity pension are contributory social insurance payments, they are, in general, not affected by any other income that the person may have, such as a FÁS training allowance. Disability allowance, on the other hand, is a means-tested payment and any other income which the person may have, for example, a FÁS training allowance, is in general assessed as means. Nevertheless, it is recognised that differences in the operation of the training and employment supports which apply to recipients of the various disability-related payments can be the cause of some confusion. This is one of a range of issues which are currently being examined as part of the expenditure review of the illness and disability payment schemes, which is being carried out by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. It is expected that this review will be completed by mid-2002. It is estimated that approximately 1,100 disability allowance recipients, 330 invalidity pensioners and 200 recipients of disability benefit are participating in FÁS training courses.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. The legislation governing the SWA scheme makes provision for a health board to make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. These payments are known as exceptional needs payments, ENPs. There is no automatic entitlement to an ENP. Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment. ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The South Western Area Health Board was contacted on behalf of the couple in question and has advised that prior to making an application for rent supplement the couple had independently secured their current accommodation. They informed the community welfare officer that they had borrowed money from a family member to pay the deposit and the first month's rent. They subsequently made an application for <Col N="582" /> an ENP to cover the cost of the loan. In the opinion of the health board the issuing of an ENP was not warranted as the need had already been met and accordingly the application for an ENP in respect of a rent deposit was refused.</P>

The person concerned will be advised of the date and venue for the hearing when the arrangements have been made.

      <Quest>the regulations in relation to child dependant allowance and child benefit for a person (details supplied) in Dublin 4; and if he will extend child benefit in cases like this while children are still in education.</Quest>

      <P>Child benefit is a universal payment which is payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years and continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability. In addition, where a parent is receiving a pension or other long-term payment <Col N="583" /> from my Department, child dependant allowances are paid up to age 22 where the young person remains in full-time education. In the case of short-term payments, child dependant allowances are currently only paid up to the age of 18. As a first step towards implementing the PPF commitment to extend these allowances to short-term payments where the child is under 22 and in full-time education, from April 2002, child dependant allowances will be paid to the end of the academic year in which the young person reaches 18.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of a widow's (contributory pension) and child dependant allowances in respect of four children, including a child aged 19 who is currently in full-time education. Child benefit in respect of the child concerned was paid up to and including the month of July 2001, when the child reached 19 years. Extension of child benefit to children aged 19 or over who continue in full-time education would have significant cost implications.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that it has been a priority of this Government to invest heavily in the child benefit scheme since coming into office. Under the three year programme of child benefit increases initiated in the 2001 budget, substantial resources have been dedicated to the scheme. By the time the final phase of increases is paid in 2003, expenditure on the child benefit scheme will have been increased to some 1.9 billion in a full year. Any further extension of the scheme would, therefore, have to be considered in a budgetary context, having regard to available resources and competing priorities.</P>

      <P>Last year, I brought forward the payment of child benefit increases by a full three months, from September to June, thus increasing the value of the child benefit increases provided for in last year's budget. This year, child benefit rates will increase in April, a further two months earlier than last year. In addition, in line with the change of the tax year to the calendar year, the effective payment date of weekly social welfare increases in 2002 has been brought forward to January, a full 23 weeks earlier than when we came into office.</P>
      <P>Under the three year programme of child benefit increases launched in 2001, we are committed to increasing the lower rate of child benefit to 149.20 per month, and the higher rate for third and subsequent children, to 185.40 per month by 2003. Delivery of the third phase of child benefit increases will cost an estimated 326.4 million in 2003. It would cost a further 108.8 million to bring forward payment of these increases to January. The question of aligning child benefit rates with social welfare improvements and income tax changes is, therefore, a matter for consideration in a budgetary context, with particular reference to the Government priority in regard to achieving the child benefit target rates set for 2003.</P>

      <P>The amount spent on advertising in national daily and Sunday newspapers, provincial papers, television, national radio and local radio in my Department from 1 September 2001 to date is 832,689, £655,796. In that period, my Department advertised on a broad range of social welfare related issues such as the introduction of the euro, the payment arrangements for the budget 2002 increases, the promotion of Departmental grant schemes, the relocation of Departmental offices and industrial relations issues. This is in line with my Depart<Col N="588" /> ment's view that advertising is vital in the effective delivery of social welfare services and in helping to ensure that our citizens are aware of their entitlements and are kept informed of changes and improvements as they occur across the broad range of schemes and other supports. Advertising in relation to the introduction of the euro and the budget 2002 improvements took the form of advertorials in the print media and television and radio commercials in the broadcast media.</P>
      <P>In relation to print advertising in the period in question, 237,237, £186,839, was spent on 52 advertisements in seven national daily newspapers at an average cost per publication of 33,891, £26,691. A total of 191,280, £150,645, was spent on 14 advertisements in five Sunday newspapers at an average cost of 38,256, £30,129. A total of 235 advertisements were placed in 50 provincial newspapers at a cost of 142,637, £112,336, an average of 2,853, £2,247, per publication.</P>
      <P>In relation to television advertising, there were approximately 373 slots on five television stations during the period in question costing 140,962, £111,017. The average cost per television station was 28,192, £22,203. There were 158 slots on three national radio stations amounting to 52,610, £41,434, at an average cost of 17,536, £13,811. In addition, there were 546 slots on 21 local and independent radio stations costing 67,963, £53,525, an average of 3,237, £2,549, per station.</P>
      <P>My photograph appeared in ten of the 301 advertisements placed in the print media during the period in question. The phrase &ldquo;A message from Dermot Ahern, TD., Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs&rdquo; was used on an estimated 1,052 of the total of 1,077 slots available on radio and television.</P>
      <P>I believe that my personal involvement in these campaigns emphasised the importance of the messages being conveyed and assisted in the effectiveness of the campaigns. As part of my ministerial responsibilities, I had a duty to ensure that my Department's transition to the euro ran smoothly and that, in particular, our customers were assured that they will not lose out financially as a result of the changeover. Similarly, I had a duty to inform our customers of the fact that budget increases in social welfare payments were effective from 1 January 2002 for the first time and of the special arrangements for the payment those increases.</P>

      <P>The person concerned, who is currently in receipt of carer's allowance, applied for an increase in respect of an additional care recipient. The application was disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that the care recipient was not in need of full-time care and attention and that the carer had no system of communication with the care recipient. She appealed against this decision to the social welfare appeals office and her case was considered by an appeals officer who has decided that an oral hearing of the appeal should be held. The person concerned will be advised of the date and venue for the hearing when the arrangements have been made.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <Quest>the reason unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit have the same payment rates; if a person entitled to unemployment benefit can now opt for unemployment assistance which will give fuel allowance and Christmas bonus; if not, the reason a person with a contribution record is being discriminated against and treated less favourably than a person on unemployment assistance; if he will reconsider the new situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to January 2002, whereas the long-term rate of unemployment assistance was the same as the unemployment benefit rate, the short-term rate of unemployment assistance was lower than that of other short-term social welfare payments, including unemployment benefit. With effect from January 2002, short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance rates have been brought into line with other short-term social welfare payments. This means that all short-term social welfare recipients on the maximum rate of payment now receive the same payment rate regardless of whether they have qualified on the basis of contributions or income.</P>
      <P>Although the rate of unemployment assistance is the same as the unemployment benefit rate, the long-term rate of unemployment assistance attracts secondary benefits, for example, fuel allowance and Christmas bonus payments, which unemployment benefit does not. In addition, those on long-term unemployment assistance are entitled to child dependant increases for children in full-time education up to age 22 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="590" /> Prior to 5 April 2000, a person who was entitled to the full rate of unemployment benefit was disqualified from receipt of unemployment assistance. This disqualification did not apply where a person was entitled to a reduced rate of unemployment benefit. In the latter circumstances, the person concerned could opt for unemployment assistance if, for example, he or she was eligible for a higher rate of payment than on unemployment benefit. However, a person on full-rate unemployment benefit, who had an underlying entitlement to long-term unemployment assistance, could not avail of that payment and the associated secondary benefits.</P>
    <P>Provision was made in section 27 of the Social Welfare Act, 2000 to remove this disqualification and allow an unemployed person to qualify for payment under either scheme. These arrangements ensure that eligibility for a contribution based unemployment payment does not preclude a person from availing of unemployment assistance if he or she wishes to avail of that payment. For example, a person who is both entitled to full-rate unemployment benefit and the long-term rate of unemployment assistance, may now opt for the latter payment in order to avail of secondary benefits such as fuel allowance and Christmas bonus.</P>

      <Quest>the capital projects financed by her Department in each constituency which commenced or were completed in 2001; the amount of money in each case; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out below on a county basis &ndash; except where a constituency consists of more than one county. The information refers to capital projects commenced or completed by the Department in 2001. It does not include regular ongoing capital works, such as maintenance, nor does it include capital grants made by the Department during the year, for example. It should be noted that while Waterways Ireland is a North-South implementation body all its capital projects are financed by the jurisdiction where the project is situated.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Deputy that Údarás na Gaeltachta currently has approximately 385 capital projects on hand of vastly different scale and type. Given the time constraints, it was not possible for An tÚdarás to provide a definitive list of projects completed in 2001. Therefore, in relation to Údarás na Gaeltachta, the reply includes only projects commenced during 2001.</P>

      <Quest>when and the reason she made temporary national monument preservation orders regarding monuments at Bettystown, Ardmulchan, Navan and Townparks, Navan, County Meath; the nature and historical significance of the monuments in question; the ownership of the monuments; the person or group responsible for their maintenance in each case; and if and when it is intended that the temporary preservation order will be made permanent in each case.</Quest>

      <P>The following is the information requested by the Deputy in respect of the three individual sites detailed in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning permission was granted with specific <Col N="594" /> conditions in relation to archaeological investigations for a development which lies within the archaeological extent of a recorded monument  &ndash; reference ME021: 010 cemetery &ndash; at Bettystown, County Meath. On a visit to the site an archaeologist from my Department reported that construction work had started on site without a licensed archaeological presence. Following this site visit a temporary preservation order dated 31 October 2000 was placed on the site to protect the archaeology. Following resolution of the matter the temporary preservation order was allowed to lapse after a period of six months.</P>
    <P>There is a recorded monument in State care in the townland of Ardmulchan. It is a ringfort or earthwork set on a high ridge overlooking the River Boyne. The monument was considered to be at risk due to quarrying and the use of machinery in the vicinity and a temporary preservation order dated 12 January 2001 was placed covering a buffer area around the site to prevent any further damage. Since this time regular monitoring of the quarry has taken place and agreement was reached with the landowner to have the boundary wall stabilised. In view of this the temporary preservation order has been allowed to lapse. The matter is, however, being kept under regular review.</P>
    <P>Development was proposed within a zone of archaeological potential at Athboy, County Meath &ndash; Site Monument Record No 29:023 &ndash; and adjacent to upstanding portions of the medieval town wall. The planning authority had attached a condition for archaeological monitoring to the grant of planning permission, while my Department had requested a full archaeological assessment due to the nature of the site It was reported to my Department that work had commenced on site in the absence of the appropriate archaeological mitigation. As a result of this report, and following detailed consideration of the matter, a temporary preservation order dated the 10 August 2001 was placed on the site in order to protect the archaeology and ensure that proper archaeological licensing procedures were followed. As these issues have now been resolved and work has re-commenced on site, the temporary preservation order is being allowed to lapse.</P>
    <P>All three of the sites referred to are in private ownership and, as such, responsibility for maintenance etc, rests with the owners and their agents.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 871 and 872 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lough Carra is designated as a special area of protection, SPA, under the EU Birds Directive, 1979, and also as part of a candidate special area of conservation, cSAC, under the EU Habitats Directive, 1992. Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, does not have information on wildlife numbers at Lough Carra in the precise form requested by the Deputy. Because of the importance of Ireland's wetlands for many species of birds which migrate here for the winter months, the main emphasis in counting wetland <Col N="596" /> birds is on winter counts, rather than numbers in the breeding season.</P>
    <P>The main source of information regarding trends in numbers and distribution of waterbirds in Ireland is the Irish wetland bird survey &ndash; I-WeBS &ndash; project, which is designed to collect and publish data on winter waterbird counts. Dúchas is a partner in the I-WeBS project along with BirdWatch Ireland and the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust. Each of the partners contributes data under the project, which is then co-ordinated and tabulated for publication. I enclose a copy of the latest available site specific I-WeBS information, which relates to the years 1997 to 1999. Dúchas does not have specific data on the number of breeding pairs of mink in the sanctuary.</P>

      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy, in relation to the implementation of the proposals for the development of the Grand Canal corridor with particular regard to the area around the listed lock house at Clonburris in Clondalkin is the day to day responsibility of Waterways Ireland, a North/South implementation body for inland waterways, set up under the British-Irish Agreement signed in March 1999.</P>
      <P>Waterways Ireland has informed me that it has implemented a number of proposals for the development of the Grand Canal corridor in the Clondalkin area. In particular, landing jetties have been installed at the ninth and twelfth locks and, as part of Waterways Ireland's NDP programme for 2002, they also propose to install landing jetties at the tenth and eleventh locks. Waterways Ireland had a recent meeting on site with a member of the Loc Canáil Foundation and they have agreed to work in co-operation with the local community in the development of the canal in this area. Waterways Ireland have no immediate plans for the restoration of the Omers lock house.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies of 12 December 2001 &ndash; No. 116 &ndash; and 29 May 2001 &ndash; No. 59 &ndash; on the matter. The vessel is owned by the Minister for Defence and my sole responsibility in relation to it relates to the issue of a licence to alter the vessel as required by the National Monuments Acts. Before taking my decision on the issue of the licence, I consulted my Government colleagues on the matter. The Cabinet and I agreed that the preservation of the memory of the <i>Asgard </i>would be best served through the vessel's restoration to full sailing condition. Accordingly, I authorised <Col N="599" /> the issue of a licence to alter the vessel. The licence requires close and continuing contact with the National Museum of Ireland in relation to the proposed alteration works.</P>

      <P>The total number of farmers who joined REPS and, therefore, no longer qualify for compensation from my Department for losses arising from sheep destocking, is 734. Had these people not joined REPS they would have received a total of £940,590, 1,194,302.93, in 2001.

      <P>In July 2000, a grant of £1.45 million was approved by my predecessor to Mayo County Council for the provision of a cablecar and associated services between Inishbiggle and the mainland at Bullsmouth. This grant was based on a total estimated construction cost of £1.6 million with Mayo County Council to provide the balance of £150,000.</P>
      <P>While it was hoped that construction of the cablecar would have commenced in the spring of 2002 and that the service would be fully operational by the spring of 2003, an objection was lodged with An Bord Pleanála last year against one of the compulsory purchase orders in respect of the land required for the project. A public hearing of this appeal took place on 11 September 2001, the result of which is currently awaited from An Bord Pleanála. Unfortunately, the project cannot be progressed further until the result of the appeal is known.</P>

The total expenditure on advertising, mainly for statutory and official notifications, placed by my Department with that company for the years 1997-2001 was 2,293,875, £1,806,573, broken down as follows:</P>

      <P>The capital programme being implemented by my Department is in part concerned with the conservation and preservation of our heritage and language and also with infrastructural and industrial development in Gealtacht areas. It also includes infrastructural works on islands and on the mainland from which locations islands are serviced. This programme is being undertaken directly by my Department and also through grant aid to groups and organisations in respect of projects relevant to my Department's remit, such as cultural development projects. While no opportunities have as yet been identified which lend themselves to be part of a public private partnership, this is an issue which both my Department and agencies reporting to it will keep under active review with a view to pursuing viable PPP opportunities as and when they arise.</P>

      <P>As stated in my reply to Question No. 408 of 20 November 2001, an application to grant island status to the island referred to by the Deputy was received by my Department from Donegal County Council in 2001. This application is currently under consideration by my officials and a decision is expected shortly. I should add that one of the criteria for granting of island status by my Department is that the island concerned must be cut off from the mainland daily by the tide. I wish to advise the Deputy in that regard that a grant of £26,200 or 50% of the cost was approved by my Department in 2000 to enable Donegal County Council to raise the level of the causeway serving the Island thereby making the island permanently accessible by road. I understand that this work is now complete.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 899 and 900 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Maynooth Castle was re-opened to the public with effect from 27 July 2001 following the completion by my Department of an extensive programme of works involving the adaptation and conservation of the ground floor and the provision of access to the <Col N="608" /> first floor. Preparation of an exhibition on the story of the castle is at an advanced stage and I am confident that it will be installed early in the 2002 season.</P>
    <P>In relation to future development at Maynooth Castle, the priority for my Department is the provision of toilets and guide accommodation and this matter is being pursued at present. In relation to possible further works to the castle itself the position remains that my Department will assess the needs of the site in terms of visitor numbers and facilities once the exhibition is installed later this year and only then can a determination be made as to the level, if any, of additional works required to ensure its successful operation. With regard to the area outside of the castle, the Office of Public Works has been asked to pursue the question of possible damage caused during the restoration with the contractor who undertook the work with a view to any necessary remedial action being taken.</P>

      <P>As I have already informed the Deputy in response to earlier parliamentary questions, proposals for the provision of visitor facilities are still at an early stage and it is not possible at this time to give a timetable for them. However, one of the objectives for my Department in 2002 in relation to Castletown House is to finalise the designs for these visitor facilities and to secure planning permission for the plans. I am confident that such facilities will greatly enhance the attraction of this historic property as a tourist destination.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 903 and 904 together.</P>
      <P>The preparation of commonage framework plans being carried out jointly by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is well advanced. Work has been completed on plans covering in excess of 380,000 hectares of commonage, or 78% of the total. For upland commonage in the six western counties to which the interim 30% destocking was applied, work is 96% complete. These figures reflect the position as at end-2001. Plans covering a very substantial proportion of the remaining area are well advanced and are nearing completion.</P>
      <P>For consideration of equity, preferred practice has been to defer publication of plans until they were completed for all commonage. In view, however, of the likelihood that for unavoidable and unforeseen reasons, plans for a small percentage of the total area &ndash; mainly lowland and coastal commonage &ndash; will not be completed until later this year. I am considering the possibility of putting all of the completed plans into the public domain in the coming months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 907 to 911, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Gin traps or spring traps are not legally defined under the Wildlife Act 1976 or the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000. However, the use, possession and importation of traps is regulated under the Wildlife Acts &ndash; section 34 of the 1976 Act as amended by the Wildlife Act 1976 (Approved Traps, Snares and Nets) Regulations, 1977, S.I. No. 307 of 1977. These regulations &ndash; which exclude gin traps &ndash; set out the type of traps, snares and nets which are approved for the taking and killing of any wild bird or mammal. The regulations also provide that it is an offence to import without licence or sell any trap, snare or net which is not a trap, snare or net described in the regulations. The regulations set out the parameters by which traps can be considered as approved traps under section 34 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, as amended, but do not provide for a specific approval or listing process for individual traps. Accordingly the number and name of individual traps which are approved by the regulations is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A licence is not required to import restraining <Col N="611" /> and killing traps &ndash; including spring traps &ndash; which comply with the regulations. A search of Dúchas records does not indicate that any licences have issued to import restraining or killing traps which do not comply with the Wildlife Act 1976 (Approved Traps, Snares and Nets) Regulations, 1977, S.I. No. 307 of 1977.</P>
    <P>In relation to Fenn traps, these are considered to be approved traps under the regulations and accordingly are not subject to licence. While there are no records available in relation to consideration of the Fenn trap under specific scientific criteria, records do indicate that wildlife service technical staff of the time recommended them for use and importation as far back as 1978.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 912 and 990 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, capital and staffing grant schemes for community based/not-for-profit groups are part of the Government child care funding initiatives administered under my Department's equal opportunities childcare programme, 2000 to 2006, aimed principally at meeting the child care needs of children whose parents are in education, training or employment.</P>
      <P>In May 2001, I approved a staffing grant of 133,322, £105,000, for this project, over a three year period. This grant award was made by me following the transfer of responsibility for out-of-school hours child care services from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to my Department early last year. This scheme was subsumed into the equal opportunities childcare programme. I understand that so far approximately 19,000, £15,000, of this staffing grant allocation has been drawn down by the project.</P>
      <P>My Department received a further application for staffing funding in June 2001 and, as a result, in November 2001, I approved a further 57,138, £45,000, towards the child care staffing costs of the project, bringing the total allocation to 190,461, £150,000, which is normally the upper limit for staffing grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that an appeal has been lodged since 15 January 2002. Accordingly, the project will be reassessed and reappraised and, once this assessment and appraisal process is complete, I <Col N="612" /> will review my decision. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on this request for additional funding.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may not be aware that I also approved a capital grant of 295,341, £232,600, for this project in November 2001. The award of this capital grant brings the total approved to date under equal opportunities childcare programme to Tralee community development project to 485,802, £382,600.</P>

The committee, which is chaired by my Department, is representative of Traveller interests, social partners and relevant Government Departments. At my request the issue of trespass by Traveller dealers and traders was discussed at the meeting of the committee in October last, and a sub-group of the committee was established to consider the matter more closely. The sub-group has had four meetings to date and a further meeting is scheduled to take place early next month. I understand that the work of the sub-group is at an advanced stage and will be finalised in the near future.</P>

However, I remind the Deputy that while the constitutional referendum was passed by a large majority, the Bill enacting the constitutional change has yet to be signed by the President. The Bill cannot be signed until a referendum petition, concerning prisoners' voting rights, which is under appeal to the Supreme Court is decided. I understand that the appeal is due to be heard next month.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Garda authorities that a working group, under the chairmanship of an assistant commissioner, has examined and tested various types of less than lethal weapons, which included live test firing of various projectiles. The group findings were submitted to the Commissioner, who directed the production of a detailed implementation plan, setting out proposed procedures, training, etc. This will be submitted to my Department in due course for consideration.</P>

    <P>The Deputies will appreciate that, from the above sums, sizeable amounts of money have been and continue to be made available to manage the visitors centres. However, there is a need to ensure that these centres are managed properly within agreed budgets. The purpose of these centres is to provide refreshments, a child minding service during the course of visits and limited counselling services for prisoners' families.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Religious Society of Friends are currently reviewing their operations at these centres from a financial-management control perspective. The Prison Service is financially contributing towards the costs of that review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been very significant developments in relation to the provision of affordable child care since 1997. This was the year in which the Government established the Partnership 2000 expert working group on childcare which was chaired by my Department. This group was charged with the responsibility of developing a national child care strategy for the development of the child care sector to meet the needs of society in general. The group made a series of recommendations in relation to the development <Col N="620" /> of quality child care services to meet the increasing demand by parents for child care places. The expert working group report was presented to Government in February 1999 and forms the basis of many of the developments in child care today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1998, my Department developed the equal opportunities childcare programme 1998-99, which provided funding under a broad range of initiatives from a social inclusion and equal opportunities perspective. The programme had a budget of almost 14 million for the period 1998 and 1999 and provided supports under a number of strands. Capital grants for the establishment, upgrading and enhancement of 106 community based child care facilities were approved under the programme as well as grants towards the cost of two senior level child care personnel in each of 25 identified flagship community projects. The balance was allocated to employer involvement in <Col N="621" /> child care provision, development of the national voluntary child care organisations whose membership base comprises service providers, development of a national child care census and database and a research project in relation to family friendly policies.</P>
    <P>This Government has identified child care as a priority area for investment in the National Development Plan 2000 to 2006 and initially made 317.43 million available under the plan. The importance of child care was further endorsed with an allocation of 33.65 million under the anti-inflationary pact. In addition, my Department was subsequently given overall responsibility for child care and this led to the transfer of further funding to my Department. As a result, I have now a total of 436.79 million available to me over the period 2000 to 2006 to develop the child care sector. This, as I am sure the Deputy will acknowledge, represents the most significant investment in child care by any Government in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>The primary objectives of this funding are to increase the availability and quality of child care places. This funding has an equal opportunities and social inclusion perspective and focuses on provision of child care to allow parents, particularly women, to avail of training, education or employment.</P>
    <P>On 28 April 2000, I launched the equal opportunities childcare programme, 2000-06, and announced the availability of capital and staffing grants for community-based/not for profit child care organisations. Capital grants for small scale self-employed/private providers catering for no more than 20 children were also made available for the first time. In October 2000, I was pleased to announce that capital grants are now available to private providers who cater for more than 20 children. Grants are also available for quality improvement projects such as local child care training models and innovative projects.</P>
    <P>Since I formally announced the availability of funding in April 2000, I have committed funding of almost 92 million to over 950 child care projects on the ground, both in the community and private sector. Almost 28,500 child care places are being supported by this tranche of funding which will include the creation of over 12,800 new child care places. The funding will also enable many of the services extend their hours of operation and enhance the quality of the child care provided. In addition, I have approved funding of over 13 million for quality improvement projects such as local child care networks, innovative projects, local child care training models, the childminders initiative and supports for the national voluntary child care organisations. Funding of almost 2.4 million has also been allocated to local partnerships up to December 2001. This brings the total amount allocated under the equal opportunities childcare programme to more than 107 million to date.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Finance, announced in budget <Col N="622" /> 2001 the first step in a three year programme to bring about the greatest increase in child benefit by any Government in the history of the State. Budget 2001 provided an increase in payment rates of over 50%. Budget 2002 marked the second year of this programme, providing for similar increases of 31.89 per month for first and second children and 38.10 per month for third and subsequent children. Following these latest increases, child benefit payment rates will stand at 117.60 and 147.30 respectively. This is approximately treble the rate which applied in 1997. In addition, the payment date for these increases will be further advanced to April of this year compared to June in 2001 and September in previous years. The cost of the budget 2002 increases is some 414 million in full year terms while the total cost, on a full year basis, of the three year investment programme is expected to be some 1.25 billion.</P>
    <P>The progress of my Department's equal opportunities childcare programme is confirmation of the Government's commitment to developing child care supply in Ireland. The measures in place, as outlined above, together with the increase in child benefit rates, reaffirm this Government's commitment to keeping child care at the forefront of its social agenda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since July 1997, the I have enacted an unprecedented amount of legislation designed to ensure that criminals will be caught, brought before the courts and dealt with accordingly. To date, 42 Bills have been enacted and there are eight currently awaiting finalisation in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The current strength of the Garda is over 11,700 and overall strength of the force is on course to reach 12,000 by the end of 2002 as promised in the programme for Government. This will represent the greatest number of gardaí in the history of the State. The Government has also approved 496 civilian posts in Garda stations which will release highly trained gardaí to operational duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since taking office, I have provided over 1,200 new additional prison spaces. The number of prisoners on temporary release has been reduced dramatically. Five years ago, 25% of the sentenced population were at large, mostly on unstructured temporary release from prison. Prisoners are no longer released on an unstructured temporary basis. Today, the temporary release figure is approximately 6%. Those not on struc<Col N="623" /> tured programmes have been temporarily released for valid compassionate reasons.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Oíche has been very successful in focusing attention on and promoting a proactive approach to public order and alcohol related issues within the Dublin region. A more visible Garda presence on the streets has been apparent to members of the public, particularly following public house and night club closings at weekends.</P>
    <P>In order to further enhance public safety and to aid crime detection, I have overseen a major expansion of Closed Circuit Television systems. CCTV systems are currently operating in and around O'Connell and Grafton Streets, and also Tralee town centre. A system is currently being installed in Cork city and a number of the cameras in the system are now fully operational.</P>
    <P>As part of the first tranche of the expansion programme, CCTV systems are to be installed in ten urban areas around the country. It is anticipated that these systems will be installed by the end of 2002. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course. I am also pleased to report that my Department has approved a request received from the Garda authorities for the purchase of a mobile CCTV unit.</P>
    <P>The results of these policies are to be seen in Dublin north. In his annual report for 2000, the Garda Commissioner outlines the performance of the Garda Síochána. The detection rate for the northern division in the Dublin metropolitan area was 42% compared to 40% in 1997. This report also highlights that there has been a significant decrease in crime in the area since 1997 as the total number of headline offences for 2000 in the area totalled 4,930 as opposed to the comparable total of indictable offences in 1997 totalling 8,439. This is a good indication of how successful Garda management has been in addressing crime in the area, especially when considered in the context of the recent large scale industrial development and population movement into the division.</P>

      <P>The role of my Department in relation to child care relates to services provided by third parties to parents for the care of their children. The findings of a survey conducted in 1998 by the ESRI on behalf of the Commission on the Family indicate that one in five households with children aged four years or less use the services of a crèche-nursery and that in almost half of these households the mother worked full-time <Col N="624" /> in the home, suggesting a desire on the part of those mothers working full-time in the home for their children to participate in pre-school services. My Department has been supporting the development of child care provision, including pre-school services, since 1994 from a social inclusion and equal opportunities perspective. The Government identified child care as a priority area for investment in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, which provides 317 million, £250 million, to the equal opportunities childcare programme of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Additional funding of 119 million, £94 million, has also been made available to my Department through Exchequer child care measures. This brings the total child care funding available from my Department, for the period 2000-2006, to 437 million, £344 million.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, prohibits discrimination in relation to employment, including access to employment, on nine grounds, namely, gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community. The Act should facilitate women who give up their employment to care for their children full-time in the home and who wish, at a later stage, to return to paid employment.</P>
      <P>Funding provided in the national development plan for my Department for positive action for women includes an element for projects which assist women returning to the labour force after long absences rearing their children. These initiatives are complemented by policies developed by my colleagues, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>The home carer's tax allowance, now a tax credit, was introduced in the Finance Act, 2000, in respect of those spouses of married one income families, jointly assessed, who work in the home caring for certain dependent persons including children. The maximum home carer's tax credit due for the tax year 2002-03 is 770.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is committed to continuing to provide the mechanisms to allow women who take time out for family reasons to continue social insurance contributions for pension purposes. The review of the qualifying conditions for old age contributory and retirement pension is examining the difficulties encountered by women in sustaining a social insurance record through a review of the homemakers scheme. Qualifying conditions have been eased to the extent that people with interrupted-reduced insurance records can qualify for pensions. A significant number of women have benefited from these measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child benefit increases announced in the recent budget will benefit all women irrespective of whether they are working in the home or otherwise. The increases in child benefit are as follows:<Col N="625" /></P>

    <P>These rates are effective from April 2002.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, I introduced legislation to increase the periods of maternity leave attracting payment from 14 weeks to 18 weeks and unpaid maternity leave from four weeks to eight weeks, for mothers commencing maternity leave or unpaid maternity leave on or after 8 March 2001. These increases were on foot of the report of the working group on the review and Improvement of the maternity protection legislation which I published on 28 February 2001. In the interests of equity, the period of adoptive leave attracting payment was also increased from ten weeks to 14 weeks and unpaid adoptive leave from four weeks to eight weeks. The Government also agreed to apply the recommendations of the working group to adoptive leave legislation where appropriate. These increases in leave and other recommendations of the working group will significantly improve conditions for mothers who wish to remain full-time at home with new born babies.</P>
    <P>The Parental Leave Act 1998, provides an individual and untransferable entitlement to both parents to 14 weeks unpaid leave from work to take care of young children. The leave must be taken before the child reaches five years of age, except in certain circumstances in the case of an adopted child. This legislation facilitates both parents to dedicate a short period to the full-time care of young children. In accordance with a commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, I announced the commencement of the review of the Parental Leave Act 1998, on 28 February, 2001. A working group comprising the social partners, relevant Government Departments and the Equality Authority was established to carry out the review. The group concluded the review of the Act on 29 November 2001 and a report will be published early in 2002.</P>
    <P>My Department allocated a grant of 7,618, £6,000, in 2001 to the organisation Women in the Home for development activities. In addition, funding was provided in 2000 towards the attendance of a representative of Women in the Home at the UN General Assembly Special Session Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the 21st Century (Beijing +5). Women In The Home has also received funding of 1,904, £1,500, from my Department under the national plan for women, 2001-05, consultation process grants scheme. The aims of women in the <Col N="626" /> home are to provide support and a forum for women working in the home through which they can have a voice and influence society.</P>
    <P>The draft national plan for women, 2001-05, was launched by the Minister of State with responsibility for Equality, Deputy Mary Wallace, on 16 October 2001. This publication is designed to guide and inform the consultation process which is now under way.</P>
    <P>The consultation process will be as comprehensive and wide-ranging as possible. It is intended that all relevant interests will be consulted including: women's groups; other non-governmental organisations, NGOs; the social partners; other stakeholders; women generally; government departments; other statutory bodies. The consultation process has the following objectives: it will inform women of Government commitments under the 12 critical areas of concern of the UN Platform for Action and Beijing Declaration, 1995; it will assemble proposals on the ways and means of measuring progress on the advancement of all women; and it will articulate a vision of how these proposals might be addressed in the future.</P>
    <P>Grants totalling 277,729 have issued to over 200 organisations to facilitate them in making submissions on the draft plan. The closing date for receipt of submissions is 15 February 2002. The consultation process will culminate in a number of public fora spread throughout the country in spring 2002. It is hoped to submit the draft final plan to Government for approval and publication as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    <P>The Government attaches great importance to the development of the national plan for women. In developing the plan, the Government is determined to ensure that the opportunity exists for the full participation of women in the social, economic and political life of the country. The plan will give the Government the opportunity to consolidate its commitments in relation to women's issues over the past four and a half years, and to make further progress in achieving gender equality for all women in Irish society. The national plan for women will enable the Government to work, in partnership, to develop and implement a meaningful vision for the future rooted in women's actual concerns and aspirations. The consultation process will provide an opportunity for women working full-time in the home to contribute to the development of the national plan for women.</P>

      <P>Whereas my Department provides a focal point for disability equality pol<Col N="627" /> icy and legislative development generally it does not have responsibility for the delivery or funding of services directly to people with physical disabilities.</P>
      <P>Over the past four and a half years this Government has continued to advance its equality agenda to improve the position of people with disabilities across a range of policy areas. My Department has been responsible for ensuring that the necessary legislative and infrastructural framework is in place to support this agenda.</P>
      <P>Achievements by my Department to date include the following: establishment of a disability equality section in my Department to provide a central focus for disability equality policy and legislation development; enactment of the Employment Equality Act 1998, which prohibits discrimination in employment on nine specified grounds, including disability and provided for the establishment of equality infrastructure; establishment of the Equality Authority which has statutory responsibility to work towards elimination of discrimination and the promotion of equal opportunities; establishment of the Office of the Director of Investigations which provides the main locus of redress of first instance for equality cases; enactment of the National Disability Authority Act 1999; establishment of the National Disability Authority, NDA, in June, 2000 to develop and monitor standards in services for people with disabilities and to advise on disability policy and practice; publication of the progress report on the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities in December, 1999; enactment of the Equal Status Act, 2000, which prohibits discrimination on nine specified grounds, including disability in relation to the provision of goods, services and facilities; introduction of mainstreaming of disability policy, which was launched by an Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, on 12 June 2000 &ndash; mainstreaming means the delivery of services for people with disabilities by the public bodies that provide the service for everybody else; establishment of and overseeing the work of a monitoring committee in relation to the 3% target level for the employment of people with disabilities in the public service &ndash; outside the Civil Service; and a programme of initiatives, since 1997, to create awareness of disability issues including annual National Disability Information Days which are co-sponsored by the EU. My Department also hosted disability awareness weeks in December 1997 and May 1999 which involved travel to various venues on a nationwide tour to heighten awareness around disability issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most recently my Department published the Disability Bill on 19 December 2001 as a positive action measure to enhance and underpin the ability of people with disabilities to participate more fully in everyday life through the removal of barriers and the provision of special supports where these are needed. Measures provided for <Col N="628" /> in the Bill cover a range of areas, including accessibility to public buildings and services, accessible transport services, assessment of need for health services, advocacy and public service employment. The Bill also deals with some emerging issues which affect people with disabilities including genetic testing for commercial purposes.</P>
    <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that while my Department is charged with providing overall support and advice on equality and indeed has made great strides in this regard, that all Departments and agencies have a key role to play in supporting equality of opportunity and bringing about a change in society within the principle of mainstreaming.</P>

      <P>I have received legal advice to the effect that a provision in primary legislation is necessary to transpose EC Directive 98/5 on the right of establishment of lawyers, in addition to regulations under the European Communities Act 1972. The necessary provision will be made by way of an amendment to the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill which is currently on Committee Stage, having been passed by the Seanad. I would hope that the Bill can be enacted as soon as possible. This will enable me to make the necessary regulations to give full effect to the directive. The delay in complying with the directive here should not impede an Irish lawyer from availing of its provisions in another member state which has implemented the directive as implementation does not depend on reciprocity.</P>

      <P>As I announced at the time of the last budget, the Neighbourhood Watch organisation is set to receive 100,000 in 2002. This will allow for the appointment of a national co-ordinator and support staff for the organisation. This follows on the recommendations of an evaluation of the Neighbourhood Watch, NW, operation, commissioned by my Department. This evaluation proposed the restructuring and reorganisation of neighbourhood watch to redefine and hone its objectives so that it continues to be a key actor in the overall fight against crime. A key part of this proposal is that greater linkages should be built between individual neighbourhood watch schemes to facilitate their administration and operation. The structure envisaged will create a network where previously there was a loose collection of disconnected schemes. While I am confident that the new national structure for neighbourhood watch will be of benefit to the individual NW schemes in County Meath, the additional funding will not be disbursed at a local level.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to say that the drafting of a Bill to transpose Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data is well advanced, and it is expected that it will be published by Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures to implement Directive 95/46/EC were required to be in place by October 1998 with member states having a further three years to ensure full conformity with its provisions. I regret that transposition of the directive has been delayed, in particular, because of its complexity. I understand that Ireland is one of a number of member states that have experienced difficulties in this regard. I should point out, however, that <Col N="630" /> many of the directive's provisions have already been given legal effect in this jurisdiction by the Data Protection Act 1988. Moreover, on 19 December 2001, I signed the European Communities (Data Protection) Regulations, 2001, which will give effect to certain additional provisions of the directive on 1 April 2002. These regulations amend the provisions of the 1988 Act and provide, in particular, that transfers of personal data to countries and territories outside the European economic area may only take place where adequate standards of data protection are deemed to exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 935, 943, 947, 951 and 1035 together.</P>
      <P>The person in question has made two separate applications to the Minister. The first is an application for refugee status and the second is an application for permission to remain in the State on the basis that he is residing here with his Irish citizen wife. As the person in question has been married to an Irish national for less than three years, he is not entitled to make a declaration of post-nuptial citizenship. The applicant can make an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided he can show that he has a period of one year's continuous residence in the State in the period immediately prior to his application and a total residence period of four years in the eight years immediately preceding that period. However, it would not be the policy of the Minister to grant such an application in the case of a person who is awaiting determination of an application for refugee status.</P>
      <P>In so far as an entitlement to work is concerned, the position is that the right to work for certain asylum applicants is based on the Government decision of 26 July 1999 which allowed applicants to seek employment once they had applied before that date, had been 12 months without a final determination and had been compliant with their obligations in the asylum process. I understand that the applicant in this case was not compliant with his obligations in the asylum process and, accordingly, was not entitled to avail of the provisions of the Government decision of 26 July 1999. I further understand that a letter to this effect issued to the applicant on 13 September 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="632" /> Applications for refugee status are dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996. Under that Act, two independent statutory offices were established to consider applications-appeals for refugee status and make recommendations to the Minister on whether such status should be granted. These two offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which considers applications for a declaration as a refugee at first instance and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which considers applications for a declaration in the event of an appeal. I will make a decision on the application for refugee status in accordance with section 17 of the Act when I receive the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, or, in the event of an appeal, of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    <P>The second application made &ndash; the application for permission to remain as the spouse of an Irish national &ndash; does not come within the ambit of the Refugee Application Commissioner's statutory functions but is solely a matter for me as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The approach taken in relation to that application was set out for the applicant in a letter from my Department to his solicitor dated 18 December 2001. The letter indicated that, in order to facilitate the applicant, the Minister was willing to consider the application simultaneously with that of his application for refugee status, rather than await the outcome of the refugee determination process. In order to process the application, however, temporary sight of the material held in relation to the application for refugee status is required by my officials in order to ascertain all available relevant information in relation to the applicant's identity, nationality and background and in order to ensure that information supplied in respect of both applications coheres in all material respects. This material has been received in recent days and full consideration will now be given to this latter application.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which young offenders are treated here; the extent of the problem in terms of numbers and rates of recidivism; the extent of the resources employed; and the further measures, treatments and resources which are proposed or are needed to ensure the effective rehabilitation and welfare of young offenders.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purpose of this question, young offenders are taken to be those under the age of 18 years. There were 94 young offenders in custody in Irish prisons on 29 January 2002. This compares to a total of 107 offenders in the same category on 26 May 2000. These figures illustrate that there has been a drop <Col N="633" /> in the number of such committals of persons in this age category in the intervening time period.</P>
      <P>The majority of young offenders are held in closed institutions, that is, St. Patrick's Institution, Dublin, Fort Mitchel Place of Detention, Spike Island, and Wheatfield Prison, Dublin. The regimes are liberal and as relaxed as possible within the confines of a closed institution. Staff-offender ratios are high, reflecting the relatively long out-of-cell periods in comparison with international norms. Legal provisions for the committal of young offenders under the age of 18 years will, however, change on the commencement of the relevant provisions of the Children Act 2001. This Act proposes that where a court imposes a period of detention on a child, it shall, where the child is under 16 years of age, order the child to be detained in a children's detention school &ndash; operated by the Department of Education and Science &ndash; and where the child is 16 or 17 years of age, it shall order the child to be detained in a place of detention &ndash; provided by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Under the provisions of the Act, separate, dedicated secure detention centres will be required for the accommodation of 16 and 17 year old offenders. The primary objective of these detention centres will be to provide a secure but supportive environment in which young offenders can develop the social skills necessary to avoid future offending. These new high quality, purpose built facilities will be the setting in which a progressive regime will be delivered tailored to the special needs of this group. It is intended to propose two facilities, one in Cork and one in the general Dublin area, to meet the requirements of the Act in this respect.</P>
      <P>Records are not maintained in a way which would allow for the provision of exact statistics on rates of recidivism. Recidivism is, however, a recognised phenomenon in all criminal justice systems. Measures in place to address recidivism include the availability of non-custodial options such as the juvenile liaison officer &ndash; JLO &ndash; scheme which is a Garda youth diversion scheme for young people at risk of offending. While the numbers cautioned through the JLO scheme has fallen by 26% over the last five years &ndash; see table below &ndash; it should be noted that, since its inception in 1963, 87.5% of those referred have not reoffended within their two year supervisory period.</P>

    <P>For young persons who have pleaded guilty or been found guilty of an offence at court, there are a wide range of non-custodial options, including <Col N="634" /> probation, deferment of sentence under supervision and community service orders. At any one time there are approximately 800 young persons serving various types of sentence in the community. In addition, there are 33 residential places, funded by the probation and welfare service, for offenders aged under 18 years. There is also a wide range of non-residential placements-projects available for this age group.</P>
    <P>Within the prison custodial system, there is a wide range of services in place aimed at providing offenders with the means to avoid becoming reinvolved in crime following their return to the community. This principle revolves around self improvement and a consequent increase in confidence and self esteem, leading the individual toward a non-offending lifestyle. The services provided include work skills, training and education and are matched, where possible, to individual aptitudes and abilities, sometimes unrecognised or untapped prior to imprisonment. There is, in addition, a comprehensive package of medical, psychological and other support services available to assist those suffering from particular problems such as drug addiction.</P>
    <P>Particular emphasis is, and will continue to be, placed on the rehabilitation of young offenders in custody and, accordingly, a wide range of services, which are alluded to above, are made available. A significant new development in relation to the whole aspect of prisoner rehabilitation is the provision for a new directorate of regimes which will be located in the new Prison Service headquarters in Clondalkin. The directorate will comprise a multidisciplinary team of staff with diverse responsibilities in relation to prisoner programmes. The directorate will be responsible for: ensuring appropriate living conditions for prisoners involving accommodation, catering, laundry and hygiene arrangements; enhancing positive sentence management incorporating access to prison based services and programmes and pre-post release support; ensuring availability of appropriate education, work, training, psychology, welfare and chaplaincy services for prisoners; and developing and implementing prisoner relapse prevention programmes.</P>
    <P>Department of Finance has also conveyed its sanction to fill the new post of director of regimes in the Prison Service to oversee rehabilitation measures for offenders in the care of that service. A competition to fill this position will take place shortly.</P>

      <P>My approach has been one of strong legislation backed up by the necessary law enforcement measures and supported by a partnership approach with local communities. This combination has resulted in significant drug seizures, major Irish drug trafficking organisations being dismantled and local communities being actively involved in dealing with problems in their own areas.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Building on Experience &ndash; National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008&rdquo; marks the first time that all elements of the drugs policy in Ireland have been brought together into a single framework with responsibilities clearly assigned. It sets out a policy framework through which all those involved in addressing this problem can work for the next seven years. My Department, in conjunction with the other relevant Departments and agencies responsible for delivering on drugs policies, will be actively involved in bringing the strategy forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 938 and 1015 together.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the damage and destruction caused by so-called joyriding in local communities, but, equally, I recognise that meaningful and long-lasting responses are only possible through a multi-faceted, multi-agency approach to the problem. In this context and from the perspective of the criminal justice system, I have made 126,974 available to the Priorswood task force on joyriding over a two year period to develop and progress a range of projects aimed at diverting young persons from joyriding. The funding was approved following the preparation of a comprehensive research report on the problem in the area, entitled &ldquo;Joyriding: A Local Response&rdquo;, which I had the pleasure to formally launch in February 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department also funds the WOODALE project, which is a Garda youth diversion project <Col N="636" /> operating in the Priorswood and Darndale areas. The project provides intervention programmes aimed at young persons, aged 10 to 18 years, who have become involved in criminal and/or anti-social behaviour, including joyriding, and who have been referred by the juvenile liaison scheme and the Probation and Welfare Service. I am advised that the project receives the active support of the participants' parents and has been the subject of favourable comment in both the local and national media.</P>
    <P>In addition to participation in the aforementioned initiatives, local members of the Garda Síochána in Coolock have adopted an extremely proactive approach to the problem. For example, a specific Garda resource unit to target joyriders has been established, comprising one sergeant and four gardaí, who patrol the area on a continual basis. The unit targets known joyriders and makes a concerted effort to execute warrants in respect of those unlawfully at large. I understand that its efforts have resulted in some of the most prominent joyriders being imprisoned.</P>
    <P>Moreover, Operation Oíche has been implemented in the Darndale-Belcamp-Moatview areas through targeted foot and mobile patrols by members of the Garda Síochána. Two gardaí patrol the area on foot between 2 p.m. and 10 p.m. daily, while one sergeant and three gardaí are deployed on mobile van patrol between the hours of 8 p.m. and 4 a.m. The operation has resulted in an increased uniformed Garda presence, which, I understand, has led to a decrease in the number of incidents of joyriding and antisocial behaviour.</P>
    <P>In terms of the city in general, my Department funds 21 other Garda youth diversion projects across Dublin, all of which aim to divert young people from involvement in criminal activity. Operation Oíche also operates across the city, as do related activities, such as Operation Bud, which seeks to identify and deter those who would facilitate the purchase of alcohol to under-age persons. I am satisfied that these and other, more broadly focused crime prevention strategies currently in place will continue to have a positive effect on the incidence of joyriding.</P>

      <P>The person in question arrived in the State on 2 February 2000 with her son and sought asylum. On examination by the Refugee Applications Commissioner, her case was deemed to be manifestly unfounded and she was notified of this decision on 9 June 2000. She appealed this decision and her appeal was refused by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal on 29 June 2000. An application for leave to remain was submitted by the person's legal representatives on 17 August 2000.</P>
      <P>The person in question was again informed on 23 November 2001 that it was proposed to make deportation orders in her case and that of her son. She was given the alternatives of either making representations within 15 working days setting out reasons why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, leaving the State before the Minister decides whether or not to order their deportation, or consenting to the making of deportation orders. Extensive representations were received in response to the correspondence of 23 November. The case file was very recently submitted to me for consideration and I have made a decision which is in the process of being communicated to the person in question.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 944 and 1022 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the recent case of Maughan <i>versus</i> the Glimmer Man Limited which is a decision of the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations under the Equal Status Act 2000.</P>
      <P>There has been a certain amount of misunderstanding concerning the actual finding of the equality officer in this case which has given rise to concern on the part of the licensed trade and, indeed, on the part of parents in relation to the licensing, opening and operation of licensed premises. For whatever reason, the impression that gained wide currency in the days immediately following the decision was that the equality officer had ruled, as Deputy Carey puts it, that children may be present in a licensed premises at any time provided they are accompanied by a parent or guardian.</P>
      <P>There were, however, some important qualifications in the decision itself which, unfortunately, were not sufficiently highlighted in the public discussion and in media coverage etc. which followed. What the equality officer found was that having a blanket ban on under 18 year olds being in pubs with their parents is a discriminatory policy against parents of under 18 year olds on family status grounds under the Equal Status Act 2000. However, the equality officer specifically stated that his finding should not be interpreted as meaning that publicans must, in all circumstances, serve parents when accompanied by their children under 18 years old. Instances are cited by the equality officer where a publican could be entitled to refuse service, e.g. where a parent was drunk or if a parent or under 18 year old were disorderly. Moreover contrary to the impression that appears to have been created, the validity of a partial ban, for example, allowing children on the premises before a certain hour was not considered at all in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under current licensing laws, the renewal of <Col N="639" /> liquor licences is conditional on the peaceful and orderly manner in which the licensed premises were conducted in the year ending on the expiry of the licence. In certain circumstances, the licensees may, therefore, be required to refuse admission or service but this power may not be exercised in an arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory way. Although the equality officer's ruling was, as I say, quite significantly qualified in ways that have not been widely understood, I have, in the interests of providing reassurance to parents and others concerned about the ruling asked my Department to examine the ruling and the implications that flow from it with a view to assessing the adequacy of existing legislative provisions in relation to these aspects of licensing law.</P>

However, the situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available I am assured by the Garda authorities that the needs of the Athenry area will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Under the Refugee Act, 1996, two independent statutory offices were established to consider applications/appeals for refugee status and make recommendations to the Minister on whether such status should be granted. The two offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which considers applications for a declaration as a refugee in first instance and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which considers applications for a declaration at appeal stage. A decision on the application in question will be made upon receipt of the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal as appropriate.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Garda Commissioner that a search of the property of the person concerned was carried out and that items of stolen property were recovered during the course of the search. The commissioner has advised me that because they were denied entry to the property, the gardaí involved were obliged to use force resulting in property damage. The commissioner also states, however, that no unnecessary force was used and no unnecessary damage was caused. In the circumstances, no basis has been identified on which a liability to make a compensation payment could be said to arise.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that recently I responded to correspondence received from the <Col N="642" /> chairperson of the organisation referred to. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on individual cases which have been or may be before the courts. The Deputy will appreciate that it is outside the scope of my official functions as Minister to give legal advice and that, as the courts are independent in the exercise of their functions, I cannot intervene in any way.</P>
      <P>In so far as the hearing of family law business generally is concerned, I might mention that a sub-committee of the Courts Service Board has been established to review the current procedure and manner in which family law is dealt with by the courts and to make recommendations to the board in relation thereto. If, arising from the work of this sub-committee, which is ongoing, the board decides to make formal proposals to me in relation to legislative change or any other matters which may lie within my area of responsibility as Minister, I will, of course, give such proposals my full consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards access orders, section 5 of the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1986, as amended, provides that, without prejudice to the law as to contempt of court, any person having the actual custody of a child, who has been given or shown a copy of a custody or access order made by the District Court relating to that child and who fails or refuses to give up the child to the person who has been granted custody or to allow the person entitled to access to have such access, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding 1,904.16, £1,500, or, at the discretion of the court, to <Col N="643" /> imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, open to the guardian of a child to apply to the District Court or Circuit Court for its direction on any question affecting the welfare of the child and the court may make such order, including an access order, as it thinks proper. The court is required to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</P>

      <P>I am assuming that the Deputy is inquiring as to the cities and towns where Garda CCTV systems have been installed to date, and where it is planned to install other systems in the future. Garda CCTV systems are currently in operation in the following areas: Dublin North Central, O'Connell Street, and its surrounding areas; Dublin South Central, Grafton Street, and its surrounding areas; and Tralee, County Kerry. A Garda CCTV system is currently being completed in Cork city and I understand in this regard that most of the cameras in the system are now fully operational.</P>
      <P>I announced late in 2000 that the number of Garda CCTV systems were to be extended. As part of the first tranche of this expansion, CCTV systems are to be installed in the following areas: Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. It is anticipated that these ten CCTV systems will be installed by the end of 2002. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> I am also conscious that some applications for CCTV systems which have been received by the advisory committee, established by the commissioner to evaluate CCTV applications, relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided to areas which are not rated as a high level Garda priority. To this end, I plan to introduce a grant scheme soon to cater for those communities who would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. While it will be up to the local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes, grant assistance will be provided. To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards will have to be met and the Garda will have to be allowed access to the system when and as they require it. Local authorities will have an important role to play. The details of this new scheme are currently being finalised and full details of the scheme including relevant conditions and grant levels will be announced soon.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 961 to 973, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the Patten Report relevant to co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland are being pursued. In particular I draw the Deputy's attention to the joint timetable agreed by the Irish and British Governments and published in December 2001 for the implementation of recommendations concerning North-South co-operation on policing matters, lateral entry and secondment.</P>
      <P>I would, furthermore, add that an inter-governmental agreement regarding the implementation of recommendations on co-operation between the two police services contained in the Patten Report is being drafted and is due to be finalised shortly. This will come before the Dáil in due course.</P>
      <P>As regards the other recommendations contained in the report, a number of which have been referred to by the Deputy, the position is that these recommendations were made in the context of political and policing circumstances unique to Northern Ireland. Notwithstanding this my Department will, of course, keep the recommendations contained in the report in mind, together with other relevant research and findings, in the ongoing development of policing policy in this jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the Data Protection Commissioner's Annual Report 2000 which was presented to the Oireachtas in September 2001, in which the Data Protection Commissioner made reference to the under-resourcing of his office. The staffing of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has been addressed. The sanction of the Department of Finance has been obtained for additional staff for this office and the filling of the posts is ongoing.</P>

      <P>The Government approved expenditure of £12 million, 15.24 million, over three years on CCTV. A provision of £4.185 million, 5.311 million, was included in the Estimates published for 2001 for CCTV projects. The Deputy may recall that I announced in November 2000 that ten areas would be provided with CCTV systems by the end of 2002 and further areas in 2003. The ten areas by alphabetical order are: Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dun Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Tallaght and Waterford.</P>
      <P>No direct expenditure on installing Garda CCTV systems in these centres has yet been incurred. My aim remains to have Garda CCTV systems installed in these centres by the end of 2002. The current position is that tenders have been received for Limerick, Galway, Bray, Finglas, Dun Laoghaire and Dundalk and contracts should be awarded soon. It is expected that tenders will be invited via the EU Journal within the next three months for Waterford, Athlone, Tallaght and Clondalkin.</P>
      <P>I will be announcing approvals for other areas in due course. A Garda CCTV proposal for Kilkenny has been received and is under consideration.</P>

      <P>In December 2000 my Department received an application under the Equal Opportunities Child care Programme, 2000-2006 for a capital grant for the construction of a community based child care facility from Mountwood Fitzgerald community development project. I assume this is the project to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>During the initial assessment of this application, my officials became aware that a proposal by Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for the redevelopment of the Mountwood Fitzgerald area, to include a child care facility, is also under consideration by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I understand from my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, that a revised design proposal is awaited from Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for this latter proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My officials are liaising with the Department of the Environment and Local Government in <Col N="657" /> relation to this revised proposal for Mountwood. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on the capital grant application under the equal opportunities child care programme.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may not be aware that I approved a staffing grant of 136,295, £107,341, in July 2001 to support out-of-school hours child care services in the Mountwood Fitzgerald community development project. This grant award was made by me following the transfer of responsibility for these services from the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to me early last year.</P>
    <P>A further application for staffing funding was received by my Department from the Mountwood Fitzgerald project in November 2001. This application has been forwarded to ADM Limited for a technical assessment prior to its referral to the programme appraisal committee. Once this assessment and appraisal process is complete, I will make a decision on funding.</P>

      <P>Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended in 1986, provides that I may grant a certificate of naturalisation at my absolute discretion if I am satisfied that the applicant: (a) is of full age; (b) is of good character; (c) has had a period of one year's continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, has had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; (d) intends in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and (e) has made, either before a justice of the District Court in open court or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State. Section 16 of the Act also provides that I can waive any or all of the statutory requirements set out above in certain circumstances, including where the naturalised citizen is applying on behalf of his-her minor child.</P>
      <P>The person referred to in the Deputy's question submitted an application for naturalisation in November 2000. This application was returned as he was not of full age at that time or was not the minor child of a naturalised Irish citizen. It now appears from the information submitted by the Deputy that, while he now meets the age requirement, the person in question falls just short of meeting the residency criteria set out in subsection (c) above.</P>

      <P>I am also informed that on 20 November 2001, a meeting was held in Ronanstown Garda station attended by gardaí and representatives of Quarryvale Football Club, Quarryvale Residents Association, Quarryvale Co-op and South Dublin County Council. As a result of this meeting, a co-ordinated action plan was devised involving the deployment of the Ronanstown Garda station public order van in the Quarryvale area, with specific emphasis on joyriding and public order offences in Quarryvale Park; and a commitment from South Dublin County Council to construct 17 ramps in the area and a metre-high perimeter wall around the park. This work is near completion.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that a core group of offenders has been identified and that, to date, eight youths have been arrested and are being prosecuted for certain offences.</P>
      <P>Quarryvale Park continues to receive a high level of policing and beginning on 28 January 2002, the services of Operation Assist are being utilised for a three-week period, to involve increased policing with the assistance of the Garda air support unit, Garda mounted unit and Garda dog unit.</P>
      <P>Finally, I am assured by the Garda authorities that the situation will continue to be monitored and that any problems identified will be addressed.</P>

      <P>Psychiatric services to prisons in the Dublin area are provided by doctors attached to the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum. At present a total of 21 clinical sessions per week are provided to the various Dublin prisons. There has been no decrease in this input recently. On the contrary, recent increases in staff resources allocated to the Central Mental Hospital have enabled a gradual increase in the <Col N="660" /> overall provision to Dublin prisons and, in particular, in the overall clinical supervision at consultant level in that setting.</P>
      <P>Eight full time psychologists and one part-time psychologist are currently employed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform providing a psychology service in the prisons and places of detention. Due to the recent resignation of one of the Dublin based psychologists it has not been possible to maintain the level of service previously provided in the Dóchas centre and the training unit. However, it is intended to fill this vacancy from an ongoing recruitment competition in the very near future. It is also intended to restructure the psychology service and sanction has been obtained from the Department of Finance to increase this service to an overall complement of one chief psychologist, three senior psychologists and 11 grade 2 psychologists thereby providing an improved service to prisoners and a better career structure for psychologists. This expansion of the service is to take place in the context of its transfer to the Irish Prison Service which will take direct responsibility for psychological services to prisoners in future.</P>
      <P>With regard to prison chaplains, at present one head chaplain, 19 full time chaplains, including one lay chaplain, and five part time chaplains are employed nationwide by the Irish Prison Service. The services of the lay chaplain complement the services of other chaplains. There are no plans currently to alter the level of chaplaincy services but as is the case with all services operating in the prisons and places of detention the services provided by Chaplains are kept under review.</P>

      <P>The position is that a non-EEA national &ndash; the EEA is comprised of the member states of the EU plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland &ndash; in respect of whom a work permit has been issued is required to register and obtain permission to remain in the State from his or her local Garda registration office. Following satisfactory registration, such a person will be provided with a Garda certificate of registration and a stamp will be placed in his or her passport indicating that they have permission to remain in the State up until a date which is consistent with the date of the expiry of the work permit. With the exception of visa required nationals, this documentation will generally be sufficient to secure their re-admission to the State should they <Col N="661" /> leave the State temporarily during the period of their permission to remain.</P>
      <P>In the case of a visa required national, a re-entry visa will also be required and this can be obtained from the Department of Foreign Affairs visa office in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Under Article 5(2)(f2&gt;b) of the Aliens Order, 1946, an immigration officer may refuse leave to land to a non-EEA national where he or she is satisfied that the person in question, although intending to take up employment in the State, is not in possession of a work permit issued to his prospective employer notwithstanding the fact that he or she has previously worked for that employer on foot of a work permit which has since expired. Consequently, it cannot be assumed that a person will be given leave to enter solely on the basis that an employer has applied for a work permit on his or her behalf, particularly in view of the fact that it would be open to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to refuse such an application if it failed to satisfy the necessary criteria.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the recent report of NESF on the re-integration of prisoners acknowledges and recognises the need for accommodation in the community to house ex-prisoners. The project referred to by the Deputy is a resettlement unit for female ex-prisoners which it is intended will house four women at a time. The unit will be overseen by a full-time professionally qualified manager and other qualified staff. It will be managed by PACE, Prisoners Aid through Community Effort, who have been involved with the resettlement of former prisoners for over 30 years. Some of the women will be on temporary release under the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release) Act 1960 and will be supervised by the Probation and Welfare Service. Other women who have completed their sentence will be assessed and, where they meet with the house requirements, may be given a room in the house, subject to availability. A sum of 63,000 has been allocated to the project. No commitment has been given in relation to other funding at this stage.</P>

In the circumstances, I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to meet a delegation from the local residents at this stage.</P>

Additional staff resources and significant administrative changes were introduced in the citizenship area of my Department during the course of 2001 with the result that the processing time for naturalisation applications has been reduced from two and a half years at the start of 2001 to 15 months by the years end.</P>
      <P>Applications for certificates of naturalisation are generally dealt with in chronological order as this method is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.

      <P>This offender has made repeated complaints about the way he perceives he has been treated by the authorities, and in particular the Prison Service. The allegations of ill-treatment in Wheatfield Prison on 27 October 2000 have been investigated thoroughly by the governor of that institution who concluded that these allegations were unfounded. In this regard, statements were made by a number of prison officers, all of whom were either not aware of or deny the allegations made by the prisoner and his family. During the course of the investigation, a security camera video tape of the alleged incident was examined and, despite the allegations, there is no evidence of aggressive behaviour by any of the prison officers present. This matter was also investigated by Garda at Ronanstown Garda station and a file forwarded to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. No prosecution ensued.</P>
      <P>This offender's other complaints have similarly been investigated by prison management and have also proved to be either without substance or trivial in nature. To emphasise this, I would like to state that in November and December 2000 he made 30 complaints regarding ill-treatment during his time in custody to the visiting committee in Mountjoy Prison. Each of these complaints, which included accusations that his newspapers had gone missing and that the prison library refused to make photocopies for him, were fully investigated.</P>

Known offenders are constantly being targeted and this will continue. The Garda are very conscious of the concerns of the residents in the area affected and they will not be found wanting in alleviating their concerns.</P>

      <P>In June 1999, in response to requests for an enhancement of the clearance system for employment related to children or vulnerable persons, I announced that the Garda Commissioner was undertaking a comprehensive review of Garda clearance arrangements in this area. As a result, it was decided that a central vetting unit should be established within the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unit was established on 2 January 2002 and is based at the technical bureau, Garda Headquarters, Phoenix Park, Dublin 8. The primary role of this unit is to check prospective employees who as part of their duties will have substantial access to children or vulnerable adults. The unit liaises with the various health boards throughout the country in carrying out this work. The unit also liaises with the Police Service of Northern <Col N="667" /> Ireland on a daily basis in relation to checks on prospective health board employees who have been domiciled in Northern Ireland, and equally the Police Service of Northern Ireland liaises with the unit regarding applicants for positions in Northern Ireland who have been domiciled in this jurisdiction. The new unit will provide the basis for the development of an enhanced employee clearance system with the objective of meeting growing demands in this area.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in Northern Ireland a consultation paper has been published on proposals for a Protection of Children and Vulnerable Adults Bill, but this work is, I understand, being carried forward by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. In that context I will bring to the attention of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children the Deputy's suggestion that the matter might be raised at North-South Ministerial Council level.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Director General of the Irish Prisons Service that the group which he established to examine the future role of Shanganagh Castle will submit their final report to him in the near future. As I indicated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 158 on 22 <Col N="668" /> November 2001, this group was set up to examine existing and alternative options for Shanganagh Castle in the light of the very considerable decline in young persons suitable for transfer to this centre in recent years. When this report is received, its recommendations will be considered carefully prior to making any decision regarding the future of this institution. In the event of major changes being proposed at this centre a three to four month consultation period will ensue before any final decisions are made.</P>
      <P>It would be inappropriate for me to comment as to the future role of Shanganagh Castle in advance of the recommendations of the review group being presented and considered by the board of the Prison Service. However, I can assure the Deputy that there are no plans at this time to close Shanganagh Castle.</P>

      <P>At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course. As I have indicated previously, an application for a Garda CCTV system in Castlebar is being considered in the context of this programme.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I am responsible for ensuring that the Garda Síochána are adequately resourced in terms of personnel and equipment. When I took office, the strength of the force was in the region of 10,800. By the end of this year, Garda strength will be 12,000, an all-time record high. In order to maintain this number I recently approved the holding of a new Garda competition, details of which will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources to individual areas, that the assistant commissioner, human resource management, in consultation with divisional officers, arranges for the allocation of Garda personnel throughout the State. He is aided in this regard by a model known as the Garda establishment redistribution Model, GERM, which is a scientific, rational and pragmatic model and is the most effective means of distribution Garda personnel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1997, my Department has been involved in a range of measures to tackle drug misuse. The Deputy will be aware that local drugs task forces &ndash; LDTFs &ndash; were established in 1997 in the areas experiencing the highest levels of problem drug use. They comprise a partnership between the statutory, voluntary and community sectors and, together, they draft and implement local area action plans which incorporate a range of measures in relation to treatment, rehabilitation, education, prevention, and curbing local supply. There are 12 task forces in the Dublin area, one in Cork and one in Bray, which was designated as a LDTF area in 2000. The LDTFs are now starting to implement their second round of action plans for which over 11 million has been allocated by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion since the beginning of 2001. In addition, over 120 projects from the first round plans have been mainstreamed through the relevant Departments and agencies, thereby ensuring their continued funding.</P>
      <P>The National Drugs Strategy, 2001-2008, which was launched in May 2001, is the first time that all elements of drugs policy in Ireland have been brought together in a single framework. The strategy clearly assigns responsibility to the different Departments and agencies involved in drugs policy under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. Under the strategy, a series of 100 actions have been developed which are designed to drive the strategy forward.</P>
      <P>The strategy recommends the setting up of regional drugs task forces. These will be set up in every health board area and will bring together the relevant statutory, voluntary and community sectors. Once established, they will be responsible for putting in place a strategy to tackle drug misuse specifically for their regions. The national drugs strategy team participated in a series of seminars last September to assist in this process and work is under way in the regions to progress their establishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Advisory Committee on Drugs was established in 2000, under the auspices of my Department, to advise the Government in <Col N="680" /> relation to the prevalence, prevention, treatment and consequences of drug misuse. The committee is currently overseeing a three year prioritised programme of research and evaluation of the extent, nature, causes and effects of drug misuse in Ireland. Its first report, Drug Use Prevention: An Overview of Research, was published in early December 2001. The committee will be publishing other pieces of research on drug-related issues during the course of 2002.</P>
    <P>My Department also chairs the national assessment committee for the young peoples facilities and services fund &ndash; YPFSF. The fund was established in 1998 to assist in the development of preventative strategies and initiatives in a targeted manner through the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The object of the fund is to attract at risk young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse. The target group for the fund is 10-21 year olds who are marginalised through a combination of risk factors relating to family background, environmental circumstances, educational disadvantage, and involvement in crime and-or drugs. To date, approx 59 million has been allocated under the fund to a range of facility and services projects in the local drugs task force areas and designated urban areas.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the RAPID programme is a focused initiative by the Government to target the 25 most concentrated areas of disadvantage in the country. The programme will ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the designated areas through targeting State resources available under the national development plan. The programme also seeks to build on the experience gained through a range of other initiatives, including the integrated services process, by facilitating closer co-ordination and better integration in the delivery of local services, thereby ensuring the best possible use of existing resources to bring about real and practical improvements for local communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area implementation plan for the Dublin northside RAPID area, which encompasses Darndale, Belcamp and Bunratty Road areas, has been completed and I understand that it will be submitted to the social inclusion monitoring <Col N="681" /> group of the Dublin city development board for approval at its next meeting. Once approved, the plan will be submitted to the national co-ordinator for the programme at ADM Ltd. for dissemination to the relevant Departments and agencies for implementation.</P>

      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project. These, in order of progress, are: preliminary report; contract document; tender; and construction. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works &ndash; Office of Public Works &ndash; evaluates each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated only when <Col N="682" /> tenders have been received for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>
      <P>In relation to Drogheda swimming pool, I approved the preliminary report submitted by Drogheda City Council in relation to the proposed refurbishment of the pool in April 2000. However, following assessment of the pool by consultants appointed by the city council, my Department was informed that the city council would submit a revised preliminary report for a new replacement pool on the existing site, rather than proceed with its original refurbishment proposal. Drogheda City Council submitted a revised preliminary report for the replacement pool to my Department and it was sent to the Office of Public Works for assessment in December 2001. Further consideration will be given to the report by my Department following this assessment.</P>
      <P>The work proposed by Drogheda City Council will include a main pool sized at 25 metres by 10.5 metres with five lanes, a teaching pool to incorporate a toddler pool, a spa pool, sauna, steam room, spectator area, studio and crèche.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in 1998, the young peoples facilities and services fund was set up to develop sport and recreational facilities and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The guidelines for the operation of the fund, which were agreed by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, provided for the establishment of development groups in local drugs task force areas comprising representatives from the local drugs task force, the local authority and the VEC to develop local integrated facilities and services plans. The views of the local drugs task forces were sought in relation to each of the plans which were then submitted to the national assessment committee for consideration. To date, over 59 million has been approved by the Cabinet <Col N="684" /> Committee on Social Inclusion to support measures under the first round of funding.</P>
      <P>In relation to the next round of funding under the YPFSF, the Deputy will be aware that development groups have been asked to submit proposals in relation to capital projects by mid-March 2002. The role of the development groups in relation to the second round of funding remains unchanged.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1076 and 1080 to 1086, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already outlined to the Deputy on previous occasions over the past few years the national lottery-funded sports capital programme, administered by my Department, provides financial assistance to clubs-organisations for the provision of sport and recreational facilities. The <Col N="688" /> aims and objectives of the programme are to: develop an integrated and planned approach to the development of sport and recreational facilities; assist voluntary and community organisations with the development of appropriate facilities in appropriate locations that will maximise use in terms of participation in sport and recreation; prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities, and encourage the multi-purpose use of facilities at national, regional and community level by clubs, community organisations and national governing bodies of sport.</P>
    <P>The programme is advertised annually and applications for funding from clubs-organisations have to be made on an individual basis. All applications received are assessed in accordance with a detailed set of criteria outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. The criteria are as follows: the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will increase the levels of active participation in sport-recreational sport and-or result in improved standards of sporting performance; the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will serve to increase participation in disadvantaged areas; the technical merits of the project i.e. does the project comply with standard technical specifications from the relevant governing body and statutory authorities; the financial viability of the project, that is in addition to lottery funding, has the club-organisation sufficient funds or firm commitments for funding to complete the project within a realistic time frame; the level of local funding available; given realistic projections of income from the project, the extent to which the applicant will be able to maintain the project after completion; the level of socio-economic disadvantage in the area, as defined by ADM Ltd's indicators, and the current and planned levels of sport and-or recreational sport facilities in the area; the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds, having regard to the range of existing facilities in each county; the extent to which applicants have consulted with other clubs, community groups, schools and the local authority in developing their proposals and the outcome of these consultations; in the case of projects aimed at attracting people from disadvantaged areas, the strategies to be used to attract them; the need to achieve an equitable spread of funds among different sports and community groups; the priority of proposed improvements-facility in relation to the club-organisation's existing facilities; and the priorities for their individual sports, as identified by the NGB.</P>
    <P>Through these criteria, every effort is made to achieve a balanced geographical spread of funds to benefit all types of eligible projects in all categories, having regard to the existing range of facilities in each county while also affording priority to projects in disadvantaged areas aimed at increasing participation, particularly for young people. Where appropriate, my Department also consults the Irish Sports Council, other Depart<Col N="689" /> ments and local authorities in relation to their respective priorities for the provision of sporting facilities.</P>
    <P>The sports capital programme for 2002 was advertised on 25 and 26 November 2001, with a closing date of 4 January, 2002 for the receipt of completed applications. In excess of 1,300 applications were received, including 45 from clubs-organisations in Kildare. All applications are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>
    <P>Under the swimming pool programme administered by my Department, grants of up to £3 million are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. These revised grant levels will operate to the end of the current three-year programme in 2002. My Department will be in touch with each local authority when the swimming pool programme is being re-opened, as applications are not being accepted at present under this programme. The last date for accepting preliminary proposals under the present programme was 31 July 2000 and there are 46 applications for refurbishment, replacement and new pool proposals still being processed under this scheme.</P>
    <P>Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, and sauna and steam room. Grants are allocated when tenders have been received for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation. Proposals must comply with the standards laid down in the Department's procedures for the planning, approval and financing of swimming pools and technical guidelines.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the sports capital programme and the swimming pool programme are designed to help local authorities, sports clubs and community organisations to address the amenity and recreational needs, both indoor and outdoor, throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>In January 2000, the Government announced its intention to provide a campus and stadium at a site in Abbotstown. Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Ltd, CSID, estimated that the cost of this project would be 698 million, <Col N="690" /> £550 million, of which some 444 million, £350 million would be required to be provided by the Exchequer. Since then the High-Point Rendel overview, completed at the Government's request, examined the Exchequer allocation which would be necessary to complete the project. I do not intend making any statement on this report or its contents until the Government has considered this report and its implications for current plans for the Campus and Stadium Ireland project. Meanwhile there are a number of other ground developments throughout the country being assisted under the sports capital programme and grants awarded to GAA county grounds, Eircom league soccer and AIB league rugby grounds in 2001 are shown in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>Grants totalling 25.39 million were also paid to the Gaelic Athletic Association in respect of the development of Croke Park in the years 1998, 1999 and 2000. In addition, in 2001 an allocation of a further 19.05 million was made to the Gaelic Athletic Association to ensure that Croke Park will be ready to host the opening and closing ceremonies for the Special Olympics World Summer Games 2003.</P>

      <P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, administered by my Department, provides financial assistance to clubs-organisations for the provision of sporting and recreational facilities. The aims and objectives of the programme are to: develop an integrated and planned approach to the development of sport and recreational facilities; assist voluntary and community organisations with the development of appropriate facilities in appropriate locations that will maximise use in terms of participation in sport and recreation; prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities; and encourage the multi-purpose use of facilities at national, regional and community level by clubs, community organisations and national governing bodies of sport.</P>
      <P>The programme is advertised annually and applications for funding from clubs-organisations have to be made on an individual basis. All applications received are assessed in accordance with a detailed set of criteria outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. An application for funding was received from the organisation in question under the 2001 sports capital programme. Following assessment the application was deemed ineligible on the grounds that the applicant did not have the minimum local contribution and a feasibility study, which was required under the conditions of the programme given the estimated cost of the project, had not been carried out.</P>
      <P>The sports capital programme for 2002 was advertised on 25 and 26 November, 2001 with a closing date of 4 January, 2002 for the receipt of completed applications. St. Joseph's School has not submitted an application under this programme. The 2003 sports capital programme will be advertised towards the end of this year and it will be open the club to apply for funding at that time if it so wishes.</P>

      <P>The issue of the criminal status of former residents of reformatory and industrial schools was discussed in some detail at the recent Committee Stage debate on the Residential Institutions Redress Bill. Many Deputies expressed concern that children who were committed to the institutions for reasons which had nothing to do with committing offences appear to have a criminal record. If that is the case then it is unfair to the people concerned. I am having this matter investigated and, if necessary, I will bring forward appropriate amendments on Report Stage of the debate on the Bill.</P>

      <Quest>the strategy being pursued by the Government to address the problem of children being bullied by other children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government takes the issue of <Col N="693" /> bullying very seriously and is addressing the issue on a number of fronts. The national children's strategy &ldquo;Our Children, Their Lives&rdquo; which was launched in November 2000, is a major Government initiative to improve the quality of all children's lives. It is a 10-year plan, which covers a wide number of areas relating to children's well-being. The Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Mary Hanafin, has responsibility for overseeing implementation of the strategy and she will report to the Cabinet Committee on Children, which was formed in 2000, on progress being made. The National Children's Office will co-ordinate the implementation of the strategy, which will need the co-operation and assistance of the statutory and non-statutory sectors, the general public and children themselves.</P>
      <P>The national children's strategy has three national goals as follows: National goal 1 &ndash; children will have a voice in matters which affect them and their views will be given due weight in accordance with their age and maturity. A key proposal under this goal is to give children a voice at local level in education, health, local government and community organisations and at national level through the Dáil na nÓg. This will allow children to discuss the issue of bullying and to contribute to strategies for its prevention. This goal also provides for the establishment of an Ombudsman for Children, whose functions will be to promote the welfare and rights of children, to investigate complaints from children on issues that affect them and to consult with children on issues of importance to them. This will allow children to raise the issue of bullying with the Ombudsman for Children.</P>
      <P>National goal 2 &ndash; children's lives will be better understood; their lives will benefit from evaluation, research and information on their needs, rights and the effectiveness of services. A wide range of research on children's issues will be carried out and published under this goal and this may include research on bullying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>National goal 3 &ndash; children will receive quality supports and services to promote all aspects of their development. There are 14 objectives and 117 measures under this goal divided into three groupings: (i) all children have a basic range of needs; (ii) some children have additional needs; (iii) all children need the support of the family and community. Fulfilling these objectives will have a positive effect on reducing the instances of bullying, by improving the lives of children who are perpetrating the bullying and also assisting the victims of bullying. In particular the objective &ldquo;Children will benefit from and contribute to vibrant local communities&rdquo; will provide community support for children and families which will help them to overcome difficult family and social circumstances, which in turn should reduce the instances of bullying. The objective &ldquo;Children will benefit from a range of educational opportunities and experiences which reflect the diversity of need&rdquo; is being implemented in the main by the Department of Education and Science <Col N="694" /> which has specific strategies in relation to bullying in schools.</P>
    <P>Individual school management authorities are responsible for implementing effective policies to counter bullying in schools. In 1993 my Department issued &ldquo;Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour&rdquo; to all primary and post-primary schools. The purpose of the guidelines was to assist schools in devising school based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness of the problem among school management authorities, staff, pupils and parents. A further circular in 1994 reminded school authorities of their responsibility in formulating a written code of behaviour and discipline, which should include specific measures to counter bullying behaviour.</P>
    <P>The report on discipline, commissioned by my Department and completed by Dr. Maeve Martin, deals comprehensively with the issue of discipline in schools, and sets out models of best practice in this area. A copy of the report has been made available to all schools. Furthermore, where staff within my Department receive telephone calls regarding instances of bullying, advice and assistance is offered by staff to the callers. In addition, my Department will examine specific complaints regarding alleged instances of bullying behaviour, but only after every effort has been made at school level to resolve the matter. The National Educational Psychological Service is also available as a support service to schools in relation to individual students who encounter difficulties.</P>

The VTOS programme was designed for long-term unemployed people with minimal or no qualifications. The number of approved places on the programme is limited, currently standing at 5,000, and demand exceeds supply. In these circumstances, I regret that a departure from the VTOS eligibility criteria in individual cases would not be possible.</P>

      <P>The allocation for post-primary buildings in 2002 is 182.31 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving the accommodation situation in post-primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997. Because of the greatly increased level of investment in the post-primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity. A PE Hall is being provided at Palmerstown Community School, Dublin 20 as part of the Government's programme and is currently at stage 4-5 in architectural planning. It will continue to the next stage as soon as possible under the expanded building programme.</P>

As the Deputy is aware the next steps in the development of the academy will be the appointment of a governing authority and a president. The position on the achievement of a regional spread for the academy is that the academy will be set up on a nodal basis, incorporating: a headquarters and significant facilities on a site to be provided on the DCU campus; a Limerick campus developing the existing Irish World Music Centre at UL; an under-graduate professional dance facility based at the Firkin Crane Dance Development Agency in Cork. Once established, it is envisaged that the academy will establish links with other providers of performing arts education and training throughout the island.</P>

      <P>Under arrangements recently introduced, telephone lines to the special education section of my Department will remain open all day on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Access to the section is restricted on Tuesdays and Thursdays. These arrangements have been introduced on a temporary basis to enable the section to process the large volume of applications for support which are currently on hand. The arrangements are being monitored on an ongoing basis. These arrangements are necessary so that children for whom special services have already been requested will receive a speedy response to their special needs.</P>
      <P>The Government's decision to immediately meet the assessed needs of children with special needs, to increase the number of resource teachers assisting children with special needs from 104 to more than 1,000 and the number of special needs assistants from less than 300 to over 2,800 has greatly increased the demand. This is making up for the lack of investment over many years. Further such resources are being allocated daily in response to assessed needs. The measures outlined above are intended to facilitate this process.</P>

The managerial authorities and the teacher unions will be advised of the position regarding the allocation of posts in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intake of undergraduates to primary teacher training colleges has been doubled from 500 in 1996-97 to 1,000 in the current academic year. The intake to the undergraduate training course for primary teachers will continue at the current level of 1,000 for the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 academic years. In addition there are 280 students on an existing postgraduate course. A further postgraduate course with 440 places will commence in January-February this year. This brings to 1,382 the number of places made available on primary teaching postgraduate courses by the present Government. I have also introduced further measures to increase the number of trained personnel in primary schools. B.Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic sub<Col N="699" /> ject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
    <P>Primary teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU trained teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language. In addition, for the period of two years from 1 September 2000, teachers trained outside the EU whose qualifications are accepted by my Department will be granted provisional recognition for five years on the same basis as EU trained teachers.</P>
    <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the full-time course of three years duration at St. Nicholas', Dun Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, or the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full time course in the AMI College, are recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers and are recognised to teach in certain categories of special schools and classes.</P>
    <P>The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
    <P>The teacher supply and demand issue at second level is very complex. Analyses undertaken by my Department in 1997 indicated that there are regional and subject variations. Schools in certain locations have more difficulties in recruitment while specific subjects may pose particular difficulties. A further complicating factor is that vacancies in second level schools usually require specific subject combinations. The total number of places on the higher diploma in education course has increased by 25% since 1997-98, to 1,000 places currently. My Department is continuing to review the supply and demand for second-level teachers on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is 153.6 million which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving the accommodation situation in primary schools. Because of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
      <P>A proposed building project for Scoil Eoin Baiste will proceed to architectural planning and to the preparation of tender documents, as soon as it is possible to do so, under the expanded building programme.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that some schools face financial difficulties as a result of the phasing out of community employment schemes; if the details of the transitional arrangements to be put in place have been worked out; if he will examine the case of a primary school (details supplied) in Dublin 5 which is due to lose a caretaker on 25 January 2002 and which requires an extra budget of £40,000 approximately to maintain existing services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance to schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Responsibility for the operation of community employment schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million, 58,407,951, per annum to my Department on a phased basis between 2001 and 2003, as the FÁS school-based community employment schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department received a total of £32 million, 40,631,618, for the 2001-2002 school year.</P>
      <P>My Department has now issued circulars to all primary schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements. In line with the new arrangements, the level of funding provided by my Department to the school in question has increased from the £40, 50.79, per pupil that applied in the 2000-2001 school year to the £80, 101.58 per pupil that applies in this school year. The payment at the rate of £80, 101.58, per pupil will issue to the school in February. I am setting aside £2 million, 2,539,476, to respond to the difficulties which may be experienced by some schools.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, schools that used CE participants <Col N="702" /> as classroom assistants to assist with the care of pupils with disabilities should note that my Department has a special needs assistant scheme in place for such purposes. School authorities may apply for the services of a special needs assistant to assist in catering for pupils with special care needs arising from a disability. Further details on the operation of the special needs assistant scheme are available from Special Education Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, County Westmeath.</P>
    <P>If the school referred to by the Deputy wishes to make a submission to me on this matter, it will be examined in the context of difficulties that some schools may be experiencing as a result of the withdrawal of CE schemes. It is important that the submission would contain full details on the background to the situation pertaining in this school, including details of when CE participants in the school are due to complete their periods of employment on such schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grants. The action group considered that the target group of &ldquo;those most in need&rdquo; could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education, that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22. The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students aged 23 and over.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that he or she must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants. My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post-leaving certificate courses: &ndash; the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and Maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate &ndash; PLC &ndash; courses.</P>
      <P>All four schemes have similar provisions, relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
      <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, he or she may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. The person, to whom the Deputy refers, has appealed, to my Department, the decision taken by the VEC in his case. My Department has upheld the VEC's decision, as the reckonable income exceeds the income threshold set down in the criteria and, also, there is no child dependant allowance &ndash; CDA &ndash; payable in respect of the candidate.</P>
    <P>The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from 2.49 million, £1.964 million, in respect of the 2000-01 academic year to 7.49 million, £5.9 million, in respect of the 2001-02 academic year.</P>

This is due to the unprecedented increase in the level of support being provided by my Department for children with disabilities and the consequent increase in the number of payments being processed. My Department is currently reviewing its procedures in this area with a view to expediting such payments in the future.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is 153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving the accommodation situation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997. Because of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>

      <P>Textbooks and activity books are not part of the prescribed curriculum for schools. However, schools are free to use textbooks and other support material to support the implementation of the curriculum. My Department does not recommend specific textbooks for use in schools. The selection of books and other materials to support teaching and learning is a matter for school authorities and teachers. The withdrawal of such material is also a matter for school authorities rather than my Department.</P>
      <P>Editors of textbooks and activity books for use in primary schools select the content of such books. The material selected for inclusion in textbooks reflects the personal preferences of the editors. When selecting material for textbooks, editors are required to follow guidelines drawn up by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).</P>
      <P>I have referred the textbook to which the Deputy refers to the NCCA to determine whether it conforms to its specifications for textbooks for the English curriculum for primary schools. The advice to me from the NCCA is that the poem in question, and the approach suggested for teaching it do not conflict with the objectives of the English curriculum. The NCCA noted, however, that from the range of poetry suitable for use in primary schools available to publishers, there are many examples of considerably higher quality than this poem. I concur with this view and I would urge teachers and boards of management to avoid such offensive material when engaging in thought provoking sessions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1122 and 1380 together.</P>
      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is 153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving accommodation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997. Because of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
      <P>The commencement of architectural planning for new school building projects will be contingent on the level of funding available for primary buildings in 2003 and the application from Tiermohan National School will be reviewed at that stage.</P>

    <P>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods): I referred the textbook and the concerns about one poem to the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment &ndash; NCCA &ndash; the statutory body with responsibility for curriculum and assessment in schools. I asked the NCCA to establish whether the textbook conforms to the NCCA guidelines for publishers. The advice to me from the NCCA is that the poem in question, and the approach suggested for teaching it, do not conflict with the objectives of the English curriculum. The NCCA noted, however, that from the range of poetry suitable for use in primary schools that is available to publishers, there are many examples of considerably higher quality than this poem. I concur with this view.</P>
    <P>My Department does not recommend specific textbooks for use on schools. Textbooks and activity books are not part of the prescribed curriculum for schools. However, schools frequently use textbooks to support the implementation of the curriculum. The selection of these books and other materials to support the implementation of the curriculum is a matter for school authorities and teachers. The withdrawal of such material is also a matter for school authorities rather than my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1124, 1153, 1156, 1175, 1189 and 1248 together.</P>
      <P>Significant and complex issues arise in relation to access to the teaching profession by people with disabilities. I am making arrangements to establish a working group to examine and review the present arrangements in consultation with relevant interests, and having regard to best international practice in this area. I am asking the group to expedite its work and report to me at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, the courses run in the State that allow for appointment to a permanent post in a primary school are the three-year bachelor of education degree and the full-time 18-month graduate diploma in primary teaching. Both of these courses are run in the colleges of education, <Col N="715" /> which specialise in the training of primary teachers.</P>
    <P>The bachelor of education degree programme offered at the colleges of education is designed to equip teachers to teach the full range of subjects in the Irish primary school curriculum. Teachers who have obtained a B.Ed degree from these colleges are permitted to teach in all national schools where they are required to complete a successful probationary period leading to full recognition as a primary teacher.</P>
    <P>During the bachelor of education programme, students must develop competencies in the full range of subjects to be taught in national schools, including Irish, and the award of the B.Ed degree signifies that the teacher involved is competent to teach all subjects on the curriculum. Consequently, the study of Irish is a core component in the B.Ed programme, and students entering colleges of education are required to have a minimum competence in this subject in their leaving certificate examination. At present there is no undergraduate course in the State specifically designed to train candidates, either hearing or deaf, to teach deaf children.</P>
    <P>My Department will grant restricted recognition to the following categories of teachers: teachers who trained outside the State, including teachers who trained outside the EU, with a recognised primary teacher qualification for teaching the aspects of the primary school curriculum to pupils aged 4 to 12 years; teachers with the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full time course in the Association Montessori Internationale &ndash; AMI &ndash; College, Mount St. Mary's, Milltown, Dublin 14; teachers with the national diploma or degree in humanities in Montessori education from St. Nicholas Montessori College, Dun Laoghaire, which is accredited by HETAC. I have had inquiries made in relation to entry requirements to the two Montessori colleges and I understand Irish is not an essential subject for entry to the Association Montessori Internationale &ndash; AMI &ndash; College in Milltown.</P>
    <P>Teachers with restricted recognition are eligible to teach only in certain categories of special schools, such as special schools for hearing impaired children, and in special classes in mainstream schools, i.e. in situations where Irish is not a curricular requirement.</P>

      <P>I mí na Nollag seo caite, d'fhógair mé bunú na Comhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta faoi alt 31 den Acht Oidea<Col N="716" /> chais, 1998 chun an t-oideachas trí mheán na Gaeilge agus múineadh agus foghlaim na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn. Tabharfaidh an Chomhairle raon feidhmeanna comhairleacha agus tacaíochta uirthi féin maidir leis an oideachas trí Ghaeilge agus le múineadh na Gaeilge. Orthu sin beidh pleanáil agus comhordú téacsleabhar agus áiseanna foghlama agus forbairt polasaithe chun soláthar oideachais trí mheán na Gaeilge i scoileanna aitheanta i gcoitinne agus i scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht a éascú. Beidh 23 bhall sa Chomhairle agus Breandán Mac Cormaic ó Ghaelscoileanna, atá ceaptha mar Chathaoirleach, san áireamh. Tugtar faisnéis faoi bhallraíocht na Comhairle san aguisín atá ag gabháil leis seo. Tiocfaidh an Chomhairle le chéile go luath chun tús a chur le réamhobair ullmhúcháin agus phleanála.</P>
      <P>Tá obair an cheathrair oide atá ceaptha chun ábhair a bheidh oiriúnach do theagasc na Gaeilge i scoileanna Gaeltachta agus i scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge a dhearadh, ag dul ar aghaidh go maith. Tá an obair dréachtaithe maidir le sraith ceachtanna do Naíonáin Shóisearacha beagnach críochnaithe. Tá sé i gceist tosú go luath ar phíolótú agus ar thástáil na gceachtanna sin i roinnt scoileanna Gaeltachta agus i roinnt Gaelscoileanna. Táthar i dteagmháil le saineolaithe teangeolaíochta maidir le leasú na gceachtanna sin lena chinntiú go mbeidh siad ar ardchaighdeán. Tá moltaí á gcur le chéile maidir le hábhar tacaíochta a oirfidh do na ceachtanna.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1127, 1194, 1350 and 1401 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The loading on all school buses is determined by the relevant sections of the Road Traffic Regulations (Construction, equipment and Use of Vehicles) which are laid down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Under PSV, Public Service Vehicle regulations, the licensed carrying capacity of all vehicles engaged in school transport is based on a ratio <Col N="718" /> of three pupils for every two adult seats. Under existing regulations, passenger seat belts are not compulsory in buses, including those operated under the school transport scheme.</P>
    <P>Safety on school transport is of paramount importance to my Department and Bus Éireann, who operate the scheme on behalf of my Department. Great care is taken to ensure that loading does not exceed the maximum legal carrying capacity of the vehicles. All vehicles operating under the school transport scheme are required to meet the statutory regulations as laid down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Where vehicles have more than eight adult seats and are more than one year old, they are required to pass that Department's annual roadworthiness test. The test is carried out as directed by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, in test centres authorised by that Department. Only buses that have passed this test are used in school transport operations. Bus Éireann carry out regular checks to ensure that certification with regard to roadworthiness is up to date.</P>
    <P>Contractors employed by Bus Éireann to provide services under the school transport scheme must satisfy strict criteria and must hold a road passenger operator's licence. Vehicles nominated for use under the scheme must be suitable for the conveyance of school children and must have complete and current documentation, including proof of insurance cover, in respect of both buses and drivers as required by law. The vehicles have to be kept and maintained in a safe and roadworthy condition and to comply in all respects with the Road Traffic Acts.</P>
    <P>The safety aspects of school transport, including the three for two seating ratio and the provision of seat belts is being examined by the school transport section of my Department together with Bus Éireann and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. This report will be completed very shortly. Consideration will than be given to the question of what improvements can be put in place to further improve the safety of the children who use the service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1128 and 1129 together.</P>
      <P>There are five special schools for young offenders under the aegis of my Department. They are Trinity House, Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin, Oberstown Boys Centre, Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin, Oberstown Girls Centre, Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin, Finglas Child and Adolescent Centre, Kildonan Road, Finglas West, Dublin 11, and St. Joseph's Special School, Ferryhouse, Clonmel, County Tipperary. I have not received any allegations of the type referred to by the Deputy in relation to those schools. My colleague the Minister for Health and Children has statutory responsibility for the operation of the health boards.</P>
      <P>I am concerned to ensure that the highest standards of care and child protection are provided for the young people in the care of these schools and that any complaints are investigated thoroughly by the relevant statutory authorities. Each of the schools has formal procedures in place for the investigation of any such complaints. A senior management member is appointed in each school to serve as the designated child protection officer to ensure that all complaints are appropriately investigated and passed on to the relevant statutory bodies such as the Garda and-or health authorities for formal investigation where required. The procedures do not involve reporting individual complaints to my Department.</P>
      <P>As an additional safeguard to enhance the levels of child protection, my Department is currently developing formal standards governing the operation of these schools. The introduction of these standards will be followed by a system of independent inspection of each of the schools concerned. These standards will form the basis of a forthcoming pilot inspection in one of the schools. Independent inspection will provide further assurance that the complaints systems procedures are being followed and help to identify any weaknesses and deficiencies that may exist.</P>

      <P>The English curriculum and teacher guidelines, developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and approved by my Department, identify the range of learning experiences that primary education should provide for children. The curriculum is quite specific about how children should be enabled to interpret and to respond to literature.</P>
      <P>The programme for pupils in fifth and sixth class states that children should have opportunities to distinguish between fact and opinion, bias and objectivity, in text, including the media. The programme also requires that children should be enabled to discuss ideas, concepts and images encountered in literature. Because of the range and the complexity of messages aimed at children, it is important that children should learn to read critically, to reflect on the views expressed in books and media and to discriminate between fact and opinion.</P>
      <P>The curriculum also states that children should be enabled to relate the ideas and emotions conveyed in texts to their own experience. Both the curriculum and the guidelines recommend that children should be encouraged to respond to text in a variety of ways, including through discussion, writing, the visual arts and drama to issues that they encounter in literature.</P>
      <P>The poem in question presents a view of older people that I certainly do not share. I can, however, envisage how such a poem could be used to challenge children to examine and reflect on the representation of older people in the poem and to respond critically to it. The poem could form the basis for a lesson designed to teach children to read critically. Teachers, however, will find other poems of greater literary merit to achieve the same purpose. I urge teachers and boards of management to avoid such offensive material when engaging in such thought provoking sessions.</P>

      <P>My Department understands that there are two courses offered at the Salesian College of Horticulture, Warrenstown, County Meath: (i) The certificate in horticulture. Students attending the college are eligible to apply for grant assistance from Teagasc, the agriculture and food development authority, in respect of this course; and (ii) the diploma in horticulture. This course is an approved course under the terms of the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees, 2001, which is administered by the vocational education committees, under the aegis of my Department. Students attending this course <Col N="722" /> are eligible to apply to their relevant VEC for grant assistance under the terms of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Decisions on applications under the third level maintenance grants scheme are taken by the vocational education committees, based on the terms of the scheme which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
      <P>It is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</P>

      <P>A transport grant towards private transport arrangements was sanctioned for the parents of the pupil in question at the start of the current school year as there was no suitable school transport service available. The child's parents did not avail of this grant.</P>
      <P>Following discussions involving Bus Éireann, which operates the special school transport system on behalf of my Department, the school authorities and the parents, the pupil is now linking up with a school transport service seven miles from his home. My Department has approved a transport grant towards private transport arrangements from the pupil's home to the pick-up point. The child's parents have been notified of the revised arrangements.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As a rule, primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than 1.5 miles to travel to a pick-up point. Pupils living off the main route of service are generally expected to make their own <Col N="728" /> way, or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1151 and 1152 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by this Government to the building programme at all levels. The capital allocation in the current year is 182.309 million and 153.6 million for post-primary and primary levels respectively. This is four times the allocation made by the previous Government in 1997. This level of funding has enabled my Department to undertake a record number of building projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures for 2003 and 2004 for capital expenditure at primary and post-primary levels referred to by the Deputy are only indicative projections on a no policy change basis based on technical adjustments to the 2002 Estimate rather than a definite policy position. The figures for 2002 at the corresponding stage in the budgetary process at end 2000 were 43% and 29% higher than the indicative 2002 Estimates allocations. Therefore, <Col N="729" /> the Deputy will appreciate that these indicative figures are by no means a policy commitment of the Government to reduce capital expenditure in future years in respect of first or second level education.</P>

    <P>Although the pupil-teacher ratio in Ireland is still above the average for European countries at primary level, it has been reduced very significantly at this level over the last decade leading to a considerable narrowing of the gap with the rest of Europe and the OECD. The Deputy may be aware that this Government has introduced a range of initiatives to help reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools. From a figure of 22.2 in the 1996-97 school year, the ratio has been reduced to a projected 19.0 in the current year. This has been achieved by the retention of the demographic dividend each year, together with the creation of additional teaching posts to improve the staffing schedule, to tackle educational disadvantage and to assist children with special needs.</P>
    <P>The additional posts introduced since 1997 are as follows:</P>

    <P>In recent years, improvements to the staffing schedules have facilitated major reductions in class sizes. The staffing schedule for the school year 1999-00 was structured to ensure that all primary schools would operate to a maximum class size of 30 pupils. Ultimately, however, the organisation of classes within each school is a matter for the board of management.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to provide for further reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio. Priority will continue to be given to pupils with special needs and those from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>

Significant funding has been made available by this Government under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to address the problem of early school leaving.</P>
      <P>I have provided a total of 22.5 million for these school completion initiatives in 2002.

      <P>Deaf children in general have enormous difficulty in acquiring a first language. As English is the preferred medium for the vast majority of deaf children, it is felt that the greatest emphasis should be placed in acquiring oral and written competence in English. Because of the difficulties some children have in acquiring a first language, English, exemption is given from the study of Irish to certain categories of children with special educational needs, including deaf children.</P>
      <P>Where children who are exempted from the study of Irish wish to pursue Irish, it is open to them to request their schools to provide instruction in Irish. My Department will provide support in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>Significant and complex issues arise in relation to access to the teaching profession by people with disabilities. I am making arrangements to establish a working group to examine and review the present arrangements in consultation with relevant interests, and having regard to best international practice in this area. I am asking the group to expedite its work and report to me at an early date.</P>
      <P>At present, the courses run in the State that allow for appointment to a permanent post in a primary school are the three year bachelor of education degree and the full-time 18 month graduate diploma in primary teaching. Both of these courses are run in the colleges of education, which specialise in the training of primary teachers.</P>
      <P>The bachelor of education &ndash; B.Ed &ndash; degree programme offered at the colleges of education is designed to equip teachers to teach the full range of subjects in the Irish primary school curriculum. Teachers who have obtained a B.Ed degree from these colleges are permitted to teach in all national schools where they are required to complete a successful probationary period leading to full recognition as a primary teacher.</P>
      <P>During the bachelor of education programme, students must develop competencies in the full range of subjects to be taught in national schools, including Irish, and the award of the B.Ed degree signifies that the teacher involved is competent to teach all subjects on the curriculum. Consequently, the study of Irish is a core component in the B.Ed programme, and students entering colleges of education are required to have a minimum competence in this subject in their leaving certificate examination. At present there is no undergraduate course in the State specifically designed to train candidates, either hearing or deaf, to teach deaf children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department will grant restricted recognition to the following categories of teachers &ndash; teachers who trained outside the State, includ<Col N="736" /> ing teachers who trained outside the EU, with a recognised primary teacher qualification for teaching the aspects of the primary school curriculum to pupils aged four to 12 years; teachers with the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full-time course in the Association Montessori Internationale, AMI, College, Mount St. Mary's, Milltown, Dublin 14; teachers with the national diploma or degree in humanities in Montessori education from St. Nicholas Montessori College, Dún Laoghaire, which is accredited by HETAC.</P>
    <P>I have had inquiries made in relation to entry requirements to the two Montessori colleges and I understand that Irish is not an essential subject for entry to the Association Montessori Internationale, AMI, College in Milltown.</P>
    <P>Teachers with restricted recognition are eligible to teach only in certain categories of special schools, such as special schools for hearing impaired children, and in special classes in mainstream schools, i.e. in situations where Irish is not a curricular requirement.</P>

      <P>An application for school transport for the pupil in question was received in my Department on 29 September 2001. As there was no suitable school transport service available, my Department approved a transport grant for the family on 5 November 2001.

      <P>My Department subsequently requested Bus Éireann, which operates the special school transport service on behalf of my Department, to investigate and report on alternative transport arrangements for the child. The Bus Éireann report, which has now been received by my Department, contains proposals to address the transport needs of the child in question and two other children in the area.

      <Quest>the reason an application by a person (details supplied) in County Cork for a third level grant has been refused.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1657/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>(Dr. Woods): My Department funds three means tested maintenance grant schemes for third level <Col N="746" /> education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions, the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees.</P>
    <P>The statutory framework for the higher education grants schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. Local authorities, on behalf of my Department, administer the schemes, which are reviewed annually by my Department. The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered, on behalf of my Department, by the vocational education committees. All three schemes have broadly similar provisions relating, for example, to age, residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
    <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. It is not open to me or my Department to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases. Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department. Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students in approved third level institutions through the student assistance/access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF aided, are to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary <Col N="747" /> and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from 2.49 million, £1.964 million, in respect of the 2000-01 academic year to 7.49 million, £5.9 million, in respect of the 2001/02 academic year.</P>

Under this scheme, the school employs a full-time caretaker while my Department reimburses the school authorities in respect of the salary costs of the person in question. While the post is fully funded by my Department, the caretaker involved is an employee of the school authorities.</P>

      <P>I have read with interest the Scoil report referred to by the Deputy. There are no plans at present to carry out a comprehensive survey of all students at second level as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Education Act, 1998, provides for the establishment of student councils in second level schools as a means of giving students a voice in the operation and life of their school. While the Act does not specifically provide for the establishment of a national body of student representatives, the terms of the Act do not preclude the establishment of such a body and I do not believe that such an amendment is required. Indeed, during the course of last year a new body, the Union of Secondary Students of Ireland &ndash; USSI &ndash; was established to represent and articulate the views of second level students at national level.</P>
      <P>It is most important for students to have the opportunity to express their views on matters of concern to them, be that at school or national level, and the establishment of the USSI is a welcome initiative. I recently met with representatives of the union to listen to and discuss their concerns and I have asked my Department to consider appropriate means for providing practical support and assistance to this new body.</P>

      <P>Section 14 of the Education Act, 1998, provides for the establishment of boards of management at both primary and second level for the purposes of ensuring that a school is managed in a spirit of partnership. The Act provides that the composition of boards of management shall be agreed at a national level between patrons, parents associations, school management organisations, teacher unions and the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>While the legislation does not preclude the possibility of student representation on boards of management, I am of the view that partnership with the student body in the management and operation of schools can best be achieved through the development of student councils. Section 27 of the Education Act makes provision for the establishment of student councils in post primary schools with the aim of promoting student involvement in the affairs of the school in co-operation with the board of management, parents and teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role for student councils envisaged in the <Col N="749" /> Act is one that offers a real opportunity for students to play an integral and important role in the school community. While student councils have already been established in many schools, it is my wish that students in all post primary schools are provided with such an opportunity. Accordingly, in line with the provisions of the Act, I have asked my Department to prepare guidelines to assist boards of management in drawing up appropriate rules for the establishment of a student council having regard to the particular needs and circumstances of the school. Following recent consultations with the partners in education, the guidelines are now at an advanced stage of preparation and I expect to be in a position to issue them to schools in the near future.</P>

      <P>I have read with interest the Scoil report presented to me by the author. One of the author's proposals is that the current leaving certificate be replaced by an examination to be called the higher school certificate where students would study three or four subjects of their own choice with no compulsory subjects.</P>
      <P>I point out to the Deputy that of the three leaving certificate subjects which the author deems compulsory at present, that is, Irish, English and mathematics, only Irish is in fact compulsory. According to the rules and programme for secondary schools, the approved course for recognised senior pupils presenting for the established leaving certificate must include not less than five of the 31 subjects listed under section IV, paragraph 2(b), of which one shall be Irish. All other requirements are dictated by matriculation considerations rather than by the conditions set down by my Department.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at present to implement the proposal presented in the Scoil report. The NCCA, National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, advises my Department on all matters relating to curriculum. The advice of the council at present is that the leaving certificate as it stands provides students with a broad and balanced education which prepares them for further study and also for life. The practice of specialising in very few subjects early in life would make for a narrow education which, although it might satisfy the immediate needs of entry to third level, would prove limiting in further life.</P>

      <P>It has been the practice of my Department since the mid-1990s to create such groups of advisers where new programmes or revised syllabi are being introduced to second level schools. These advisers are teachers on secondment whose full-time task it is to provide support on all aspects of the implementation of the particular programme or subject in the classroom, including the content of the programme or syllabus, teaching and learning methodologies and modes of assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such teams of advisers have been created to date for teachers of the junior certificate school programme; the transition year programme; the leaving certificate vocational programme; the leaving certificate applied; social, personal and health education; civic, social and political education; junior certificate mathematics; and religious education. Teams have also been created for the following subjects at leaving certificate level: business, music, English, physics, chemistry, biology and home economics. Where <Col N="752" /> continued support for a subject or programme is deemed necessary, it is offered through the second level support service which operates on a regional basis. There are no plans at present to use subject advisers to help in the process of internal assessment and examination moderation.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that a broader range of subjects could be provided if a number of schools in an area worked together on curriculum provision. The logistical dimensions of this idea have been explored in detail by the Commission on School Accommodation. While it is true that students could experience a greater choice of subjects and programmes through this sharing of resources, the practical and logistical considerations might pose problems that would outweigh the benefits of the idea. It is also true that students belong in a particular way to their own school and subscribe to its ethos. Schools that are in close proximity to each other often co-operate to provide subjects such as physics or chemistry for students from both schools in an organised, non-disruptive manner.</P>

    <P>(Dr. Woods): The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is 153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates the Government's commitment to improving the accommodation situation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997.</P>
    <P>Due to the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since the Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
    <P>Architectural planning for a new three classroom school for Glenahulla has been completed. Tenders will be invited, as soon as it is possible to do so, under the Government's expanded building programme.</P>

      <QRef>[1733/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>(Dr. Woods): Subsequent to my investigation of this case and my reply of May 2001, the NEPS psychologist assigned to the school attended by the pupil in question visited the school in June 2001. He discussed the pupil's needs with the school principal and learned that the pupil was already receiving resource teaching and making satisfactory progress. It was agreed that the principal would notify the psychologist if there was any change in the situation or cause for concern.</P>
    <P>In November, the pupil's mother contacted NEPS requesting an individual psychological assessment. It was explained that his needs had been investigated and that his progress was satisfactory. However, given her concern, a meeting was immediately arranged for her with the NEPS psychologist and the relevant school staff. A range of information and possible future options for the pupil were discussed at the meeting.</P>
    <P>NEPS is satisfied that the pupil's educational needs are being met within the school. An indi<Col N="755" /> vidual psychological assessment at this time would not effect any improvement in the support being provided to him. However, school personnel will monitor his situation and will inform their NEPS psychologist at once if they have any cause for concern.</P>

    </Qst>
    <P>(Dr. Woods): The scheme for commissioning psychological assessments has been operating since September 2001. My Department provides funding for this scheme with the main objective of allowing access to psychological assessments for those schools to which the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, does not yet offer a service. Schools that have access to the full NEP service, such as the school referred to in the question, are normally allowed to avail of the scheme only under exceptional circumstances. However, in recognition of the disadvantaged nature of the catchment area of the school, I asked NEPS to re-examine this particular instance.</P>
    <P>NEPS has now authorised the commissioning of four psychological assessments for the school and will pay the psychologists immediately on receipt of the appropriate documentation from the school principal.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1228 and 1234 together.</P>
      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is 153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving the accommodation situation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="761" /> Because of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
    <P>An extension to St. Etchen's national school including the provision of a bus pull-in and car parking facilities is currently in architectural planning. The project will continue to the preparation of tender documents and the invitation of tenders, as soon as it is possible to do so, under the expanded building programme.</P>

      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme is confined to adults over 21 who are in receipt of unemployment assistance/benefit, a one-parent family payment, disability allowance/benefit or signing for credits. A person must be in receipt of one of above allowances for at least six months in order to be eligible to join VTOS. Dependent spouses of these categories are also eligible. Time on FÁS can count towards this six-month requirement. However, in order to receive a training allowance, a person must be getting a relevant social welfare payment immediately before starting the programme. The training allowance replaces the social welfare allowance for the duration of the programme. If the person in question has fulfilled these requirements in September, 2002, she will be eligible to join the VTOS. However, where demand for participation on the programme exceeds supply, as is the position generally, it is a matter for the vocational education committee to select participants from among the applicants.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in primary and secondary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in primary and secondary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. While my Department funds these posts, the management authority of each individual school is the actual employer.</P>
      <P>The 1978 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded in the PESP Agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>This scheme provides funding to primary and second level schools on the basis of <i>per capita </i>grants with additional grants towards secretarial services. This funding by its nature is flexible and gives schools discretion as to the manner in which such services are provided. Secretaries employed by schools are employees of the individual schools. Individual school authorities are best placed to assess staff training requirements, including the issue of special computer training courses.</P>
      <P>In collaboration with the various school management bodies, a new training initiative dealing with computerised school administration is currently being implemented in second level schools. This initiative is funded by my Department and is being run in conjunction with NCTE and CCM Software Services Limited. The initiative provides 20 hours training for each second level school. There are a number of different training modules and each school may nominate a member of staff, who may be the secretary, as appropriate, to attend each module.</P>

      <P>My Department commissioned the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to conduct a survey of radon levels in primary and second level schools in 1998.

      <P>The survey was carried out in three phases.

All schools were invited to participate. Radon levels in 80 schools in County Kildare were measured during phase 1. A small number of schools that had not responded to the original invitation to participate were included in phase 3, following further contact by the RPII.</P>
      <P>Active radon mitigation systems have been installed in three schools in County Kildare that participated in phase 1 where radon levels in excess 400Bq/m3 were measured.

      <P>The Deputy may be aware of The White Paper on Early Childhood Education &ldquo;Ready to Learn&rdquo;, which sets out a comprehensive strategy for the development of early childhood education for all children aged from birth to six years. The question of developing and funding initiatives for particular pre-school sectors or the extension of the early start project to additional schools will be considered by the newly-established Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education in the context of the implementation of the White Paper.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will already be aware that in January 2001 I launched a major new programme, &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo;, to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The new programme will be run over a three-year period and will cost some 33 million with the allocation of more than 200 teaching posts.</P>
      <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the new programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils will be supported, where necessary, over the three-year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes, infants through second class, and a pupil teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes, third through sixth classes.</P>
      <P>The school in question has been included in the urban dimension and will be allocated supplementary grant aid over the three-year period, towards providing additional educational supports for the pupils concerned. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the schools as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where schools expressed concern about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they were advised to make representations to my Department outlining their circumstances. <Col N="769" /> Schools were informed that these representations would then be referred to the Educational Research Centre for consideration and my Department would then consider the position of these schools.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the approach outlined, representations from the school in question were forwarded to the Educational Research Centre. My Department has now received a report from the Educational Research Centre and the situation of this school and other such schools is currently under consideration. The school in question will be informed of the outcome in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions: the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statutory framework for the higher education grants schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. It is the local authorities which, on behalf of my Department, administer the schemes, which are reviewed annually by my Department. The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered, on behalf of my Department, by the vocational education committees. All three schemes have broadly similar provisions, relating, <Col N="771" /> for example, to age, residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
    <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>It is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from 2.49 million, £1.964 million, in respect of the 2000-01 academic year to 7.49 million, £5.9 million, in respect of the 2001-02 academic year.</P>

      <P>In 1996, the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states. Prior to this, grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in the Republic and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>In general, the approved courses in other EU member states are full-time undergraduate courses of not less than two years duration pursued in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. There are a number of excepted courses including those in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine and teacher training courses including those leading to the award of bachelor of education.</P>
      <P>The sports science degree programme in the college in question is an approved course for purpose of the higher education grants scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to qualify for grant assistance a candidate must satisfy the relevant conditions of the student support schemes in regard to age, residence, means and nationality. The candidate in question is advised to apply to the relevant local <Col N="773" /> authority to have his or her eligibility for grant assistance assessed.</P>
    <P>Grants are not payable in respect of tuition fees for courses attended outside of Ireland. However, since the introduction, in 1998, of undergraduate tuition fees in the UK, students from this State can apply to the relevant authorities in the UK for grant assistance towards their undergraduate tuition fee. My Department understands that students who apply through the Universities and Colleges Admission Services for courses in England and Wales receive a preliminary assessment form, which must be completed and returned to the appropriate authorities in order that their eligibility may be assessed. The person in question should be advised to complete and return this form to the relevant authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Finance Act 2000, as amended by section 29 of the Finance Act 2001, provides for the introduction of tax relief for undergraduate tuition fees paid in colleges outside of Ireland. This relief, which is available from the tax year 2000-01 onwards, will apply at the standard rate of tax. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from local tax offices.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1255, 1261 and 1263 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommend<Col N="775" /> ations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grants.</P>
    <P>The action group considered that the target group of those most in need could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education &ndash; that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22. The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students aged 23 and over.</P>
    <P>In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that s/he must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants.</P>
    <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post leaving certificate courses: the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees, maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses. All four schemes have similar provisions, relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
    <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, s/he may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the students, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that s/he has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, s/he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his/her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>I will arrange for my Department to forward to the Deputy full details of the eligibility criteria for the special rates of maintenance grant. The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to <Col N="776" /> assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance/access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this Fund from 2.49 million, £1.964 million, in respect of the academic year 2000-01 to 7.49 million, £5.9 million, in respect of the academic year 2001-02.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 370 of 11 December 2001, a full-time caretaker will be provided under the 1978-79 scheme.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. I can confirm that, as per my Department's records, the school referred to by the Deputy has the services of a full-time caretaker under this scheme. The 1978-79 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded in the PESP Agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme now referred to as the ancillary services grant.</P>
      <P>The ancillary services grant provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard per-capita grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. The school referred to by the Deputy receives funding towards the cost of secretarial services under this scheme. The level of funding provided by my Department to the school has increased from the 25.39, £20, per pupil that applied in the 2000-2001 school year to the 50.79, £40, per pupil that applies in this school year. The payment at the rate of 50.79, £40, per pupil will issue to the school in February.</P>

      <P>My Department provides &ldquo;deduction at source&rdquo; facilities for teachers, whose names are on my Department's second level teachers payroll system, in respect of payments due to a number of organisations, including teacher unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" /> In order to ensure the smooth operation of this system, it is necessary for the relevant section in my Department to pass on information that will affect the reconciliation of payments to the organisation concerned. In this regard, where a teacher instructed the relevant section to cease deductions, a copy of that instruction was forwarded to the organisation concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to the case referred to by the Deputy, a copy of the teacher's instruction to cease deductions was forwarded to the ASTI in the normal way. Unfortunately, the necessary amendment to the payroll system was not put into effect and the deductions continued. This situation has now been rectified and a refund of the deductions made since the date from which the teacher's initial instruction could have been effected will be included with the salary payment due to this teacher on 7 February 2002.</P>
    <P>In light of the circumstances of this case, the practice of sending copies of individual teacher's instructions to the organisation concerned has been stopped.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1262 and 1265 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grants.</P>
      <P>The action group considered that the target group of &ldquo;those most in need&rdquo; could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education &ndash; that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22. The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students aged 23 and over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department forwarded full details of this initiative to the local authorities and vocational education committees, in July 2001, with a <Col N="779" /> request that payment be made with effect from the 2000-01 academic year.</P>
    <P>Finalised data in relation to both the 2000-01 and 2001-02 academic years on the numbers benefiting under the initiative, and the total expenditure involved, are not available within my Department, as a number of local authorities and vocational education committees have yet to complete the assessment process in respect of students applying for the special rates of maintenance grant.</P>
    <P>I will arrange for my Department to forward the finalised data to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>It has not been the practice for my Department to request the local authorities and vocational education committees to furnish statistical data on the total numbers applying for maintenance grants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as 'top-up' grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> The action group considered that the target group of &ldquo;those most in need&rdquo; could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education, &ndash; that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22. The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students aged 23 and over.</P>
    <P>In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that s/he must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants. My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post leaving certificate courses: the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees, maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses. All four schemes have similar provisions, relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern he award of a grant.</P>
    <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, s/he may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that s/he has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, s/he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his/her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved insti<Col N="790" /> tutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance/access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this Fund from 2.49 million, £1.964 million, in respect of the academic year 2000-01 to 7.49 million, £5.9 million, in respect of the 2001-02 academic year.</P>

A schedule of overall accommodation will be drawn up shortly in consultation with the school authorities.</P>
      <P>The schedules of accommodation will provide details of the extent of accommodation needed by the new community school, so as soon as these are available, my Department will be in a position to approve the commencement of architectural planning.</P>
      <P>This is an unusual situation in that the vocational school and the post-primary school amalgamating into the proposed new community school already share pupils and facilities and operate from a single timetable. In these circumstances, my Department with the agreement of all parties has communicated mainly with the County Leitrim VEC in connection with this project. It is envisaged that as the project develops and following the establishment of a board of management for the new community school that communication will then be with the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The early start pre-school pilot project is in place in 40 selected schools in designated areas of disadvantage. It is aimed at children who are considered to be most at risk of not reaching their potential and are aged between three and four years.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware of the White Paper on early childhood education, &ldquo;Ready to Learn&rdquo;, which sets out a comprehensive strategy for the development of early childhood education for all children aged from birth to six years. The question of developing and funding initiatives for particular pre-school sectors or the extension of the early start project to additional schools will be considered by the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education which I recently established.</P>
      <P>Until recently, the principal mechanism for addressing the effects of socio-economic deprivation in primary schools was the disadvantaged areas scheme which provides special teaching assistance and extra funding to schools in designated areas of disadvantage. The school referred to by the Deputy is participating in the disadvantaged areas scheme. Under this scheme, the school is benefiting from the services of two disadvantaged concessionary teachers and a shared home-school-community liaison teacher. The school also qualifies for special supplementary capitation funding at the rate of £30 per pupil and a refund of the television licence fee.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will already be aware that in January 2001 I launched a major new programme, Giving Children An Even Break', to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The new programme runs over a three-year period and will cost some 33 million with the allocation of over 200 teaching posts.</P>
      <P>Schools participating in the programme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. Schools already in receipt of additional resources under the disadvantaged areas scheme, including the school referred to, retain their entitlements under that scheme, and receive extra funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the new programme. The school in question has been included in the urban dimension and is <Col N="792" /> eligible to receive 3,912.06 in respect of the current school year, towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned. This funding is in addition to the 10,780.08 for the current school year that the school received under the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
    <P>Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils are being supported, where necessary, over the three-year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes, infants through second class, and a pupil teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes, third through sixth classes. In line with normal staffing arrangements for national schools, teacher post allocations for the purpose of the new disadvantage programme in respect of the current school year have been determined by reference to enrolments in junior and senior classes at 30 September 2000. On the basis of this approach, the school in question does not require the allocation of new disadvantage programme posts for the current school year.</P>
    <P>Where schools expressed concern about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they were advised to make representations to my Department outlining their circumstances. Schools were informed that these representations would then be referred to the Educational Research Centre for consideration and my Department would then consider the position of these schools.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the approach outlined, representations from the school in question were forwarded to the Educational Research Centre. My Department has now received a report from the Educational Research Centre and the situation of this school and other such schools is currently under consideration. The school in question will be informed of the outcome in the near future.</P>

      <P>The allocation for post-primary buildings in 2002 is 182.31 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving the infrastructural needs in post primary schools.</P>
      <P>Due to the greatly increased level of investment in the post primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's post-primary buildings unit has agreed in principle to the redevelopment of Tullow community school, County Carlow. All the options for the delivery of modern classroom accommodation will be considered following the <Col N="793" /> appointment of a design team to commence architectural planning for this major building project.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the free fees initiative, whereby the State meets the tuition costs of eligible students, an approved course is defined as a full-time undergraduate course of a minimum duration of two years in an approved third level institution. Distance education courses are not approved courses under the terms of the free fees initiative.</P>
      <P>Tax relief is, however, available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved distance education courses provided in Ireland by approved colleges or institutions. An extension of the scope of the free fees initiative to provide for students pursuing distance education courses, on a similar basis as currently exists for full-time students, could only be considered having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector.</P>

      <Quest>the situation regarding third level free fees for a person who has a degree in rehabilitative studies from a UK university and now wishes to qualify as a physiotherapist here; the fees assistance which is available here for courses (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the free fees initiative, my Department meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges.</P>
      <P>Eligible students are those who are first-time undergraduates, hold EU nationality or official refugee status and have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved course. Tuition fees are not paid in respect of students who already hold an undergraduate degree and are pursuing a second undergraduate degree, irrespective of whether funding was previously awarded.</P>
      <P>My Department understands that the person, to whom the Deputy refers, already holds a degree in rehabilitative studies from a UK University. S/he would not, therefore, be eligible to avail of the free fees initiative to pursue further study at undergraduate level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> With regard to eligibility for financial assistance, grants towards maintenance and, where applicable, fees, under the higher education grants scheme, the position is that, generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, and nationality. An approved course for the purpose of the higher education grants scheme means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration and a full time postgraduate course of not less than one years duration pursued in an approved institution.</P>
    <P>Similar to the free fees initiative, under the terms of the higher education grants schemes students who already hold an undergraduate degree and are pursuing a second undergraduate degree are not eligible for grant assistance, irrespective of whether or not funding was previously awarded. The scheme also provides that grants may not be paid to students who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are pursuing a second postgraduate qualification at the same level. However, students who are progressing to a further postgraduate course at a higher level, and which represents progression from the level at which the previous qualification(s) was attained, are eligible to be considered for funding.</P>
    <P>The University of Ulster is an approved third level institution for the purposes of the higher education grants scheme. Accordingly, students pursuing approved full-time postgraduate courses at the college are eligible to be considered for grant assistance, subject to the usual terms and conditions of funding. My Department understands, however, that the course referred to by the Deputy, a masters degree in physiotherapy at the University of Ulster, is only available as a part-time course, in which case, it would not meet the definition of an approved course under the terms of the higher education grants scheme.</P>
    <P>Tax relief provisions on the payment of tuition fees, at undergraduate and postgraduate level, have been introduced in recent years. Further details and conditions in relation to these tax reliefs are available from local tax offices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's White Paper on Adult Education: Learning for Life, published in August 2000, set out a comprehensive range of over 80 policies and actions for the development of the adult education sector, which are being implemented on a phased basis in the light of resources available.</P>
      <P>Progress is under way in a range of areas, for example: The National Adult Literacy Strategy is progressing apace with the number of students in VEC schemes having increased from 5,000 to 18,862, and with some 235,000 people per week watching the second TV series READ WRITE NOW. There have also been strategic developments in the quality of the service, with strengthened links with other agencies, greater flexibility, an expansion of options and venues, a nationally certified staff development programme, a quality framework and research on assessment.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the back to education initiative, providing a major expansion of part-time options under PLC, Youthreach, and VTOS programmes principally aimed at young people and adults in the population with less than upper secondary education, will commence shortly. Some 4,000 places will be filled initially and a further 2,000 in September 2002. This will be expanded further in subsequent years with the aim of having 20,000 extra places per annum in place by 2006.</P>
      <P>The National Adult Learning Council will be established in March as an executive agency of the Department of Education and Science. The council will include representation from education and training, industry, trade union, community and voluntary interests and learners. It will develop co-ordinated adult learning strategies across a range of levels and sectors, support quality, monitor the implementation of an agreed strategy, engage in research and support international co-operation.</P>
      <P>A national team of 35 community education facilitators will be appointed shortly to support the development of community education groups, network providers, help them access funding, support and monitor quality and encourage partnerships with the statutory sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Phases 1 and 2 of the development of an adult guidance service are under way, with a service <Col N="796" /> now operational in 19 areas. Phase 3 will commence in 2002. The aim is to have a comprehensive national service in place by 2006. A review of the organisational, management, administrative, technical and ancillary support services for post leaving certificate courses is nearing completion.</P>
    <P>New arrangements have been introduced for schools to encourage the development of adult self-funded part time courses, providing for posts of responsibility, a once-off grant scheme, and for profit from fee income to be re-invested in adult learning.</P>
    <P>An educational equality initiative which addresses gaps in the system for disadvantaged groups and pilots new approaches with a view to mainstreaming is now in place. A feasibility study is under way for the development of a further education management information system which will enable the progress of specific groups, such as lone parents, travellers etc to be monitored over time.</P>
    <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education has been published and top up maintenance grants have been introduced for students most in need. The National Qualifications Authority and the Further and Higher Education and Training Awards Councils have been established on a statutory basis to provide a unified framework for the accreditation of all non-university vocational education and training at further and higher levels. This is a vitally important development, which will assist in the longer term in enhancing quality and relevance, providing for streamlined progression pathways, and for mechanisms for the accreditation of prior learning and work based learning.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding <Col N="808" /> towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in the school referred to by the Deputy under a 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in primary and secondary schools and caretakers in primary schools. Under this scheme, the school employs a full time secretary and a full time caretaker, while my Department reimburses the school authorities in respect of the salaries of the people in question. While these posts are fully funded by my Department, the secretaries and caretakers involved are employees of the individual school authorities.</P>
      <P>This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme which is now referred to as the ancillary services grant. The grant provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. However, schools which already have the services of a full-time secretary or caretaker employed under my Department's 1978-79 scheme are not currently eligible for additional funding from the grant as the main purpose of the grant is to provide funding to schools that do not otherwise have secretarial and caretaking provision in place.</P>
      <P>In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under community employment schemes, I recently secured the transfer of 58,407,951 per annum to my Department on a phased basis between 2001 and 2003, as the FÁS school-based community employment schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to primary schools.</P>
      <P>I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from 50.79 per pupil per annum to 126.98 per pupil over this school year and the next. With effect from September 2001, the grant has been increased from 50.79 to 76.18 per pupil. This has been further increased to 101.58 per pupil with effect from January 2002. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or less has been increased from 3,047.37 to 6,094.74, while schools with 500 pupils or more will increase from 25,394.76 to 50,789.52 per annum. I am setting aside 2,539,476 to respond to the particular difficulties which may be experienced by some schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes <Col N="809" /> takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>

      <P>Individual school management authorities are responsible for implementing effective policies to counter bullying in schools. In 1993 my Department issued Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour to all primary and post-primary schools. The purpose of the guidelines was to assist schools in devising school based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness of the problem among school management authorities, staff, pupils and parents. A further circular in 1994 reminded school authorities of their responsibility in formulating a written code of behaviour and discipline, which should include specific measures to counter bullying behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under health and safety legislation, school management authorities are responsible for providing a safe environment for all personnel present in the school, including pupils. In a circular relating to guidelines on violence in schools, issued by my Department in 1999, schools were advised of their duties in this area and of the need to take positive measures to prevent and minimise the risk of violence within the school environment. In particular, the attention of schools <Col N="810" /> was drawn to the need for effective school policies on school discipline and bullying. The circular advises schools that these policies should be reviewed on a regular basis and suggests that the early identification and resolution of weaknesses in school policies generally lessens the threat of violence in the school.</P>
    <P>The report on discipline, commissioned by my Department, and completed by Dr. Maeve Martin deals comprehensively with the issue of discipline in schools, and sets out models of best practice in this area. A copy of the report has been made available to all schools. While management authorities are not required to notify my Department of bullying cases in schools, my Department regularly receives telephone calls reporting alleged instances of bullying. These calls generally are informal enquiries and Department staff offer advice and assistance to the callers. In addition, my Department will examine specific complaints regarding alleged instances of bullying behaviour, but only after every effort has been made at school level to resolve the matter. The national educational psychological service is available as a support service to schools in relation to individual students who encounter difficulties.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance to schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under community employment schemes, I recently secured the transfer of 58,407,951 per annum to my Department on a phased basis between 2001 and 2003, as the FÁS school-based CE schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department received a total of 40,631,618 for the 2001-02 school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from 50.79 per pupil per annum to 126.98 per pupil over this school year and the next.

    <P>My Department has now issued circulars to all primary schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements. These circulars clearly indicate that the grants to schools are not directly linked to any particular pay scale and that the pay and conditions of personnel employed by schools are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities. I am setting aside 2,539,476 to respond to the particular difficulties which may be experienced by some schools.</P>

      <P>The recommendations of the Oireachtas joint committee Report on School Transport have been considered in my Department. A number of improvements were put in place in 2001 by my colleague, Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea. These included reducing the qualifying distance for eligibility for school transport for primary school pupils aged ten and over from three to two miles, so that all primary pupils are treated equally for eligibility purposes. The number of eligible primary pupils required to establish a new school bus service has been reduced from ten to seven. All school transport vehicles now have a communication system on board. The travelling and waiting time for post-primary pupils has been reduced from three to 2.5 hours. Where feasible students who are on the early pick-up from their homes are the first to be dropped home in the evening and <i>vice versa.</i>The safety aspects of school transport are currently being examined by the school transport section of my Department together with Bus Éireann and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. This report, which will <Col N="812" /> be available very shortly, will address issues such as the three for two seating arrangement and seat-belts.</P>

      <P>As the course in question is part-time, no assistance with participants' fees is currently available, except under the back to education initiative outlined below. In my White Paper on Adult Education, Learning for Life, a key priority is to expand access to adult education, particularly for people with less than upper second level education. As there are 1.1 million adults with less than upper second level education, my priority is to extend free tuition for part-time courses to those who are unemployed, medical card holders, in receipt of means tested welfare payments or family income supplement and their dependants, on a phased basis as resources permit. A back to education initiative in further education, with 6,000 new places across programmes in the further education sector is being implemented this year. However, the course in question here is not part of the further education system and is not aimed at this target group.</P>
      <P>It is open to the centre to apply to the Higher Education and Training Awards Council for recognition of the course under the tax relief scheme, as those who are employed and attending the course may be eligible for tax relief on their fees. This applies to nationally certified third level courses of at least two year's duration in recognised colleges. Individual cases would be a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>A response to the representations made by the Deputy on behalf of the student in question will issue from my Department shortly. The position with regard to the financial assistance available for third level study is that my Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions. These are the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statutory framework for the higher education grants schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. It is the local authorities which on behalf of my Department administer the schemes, which are reviewed annually by my Department. <Col N="821" /> The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered on behalf of my Department by the vocational education committees. All three schemes have broadly similar provisions relating, for example, to age, residency and means, which govern the award of a grant. In general, the objective of the schemes is to assist as many students as possible in obtaining at least one undergraduate and one postgraduate degree.</P>
    <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has to date been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that s/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, s/he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may itself in exceptional circumstances seek clarification on issues from my Department. It is not open to me or my Department to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Under the free fees initiative, my Department meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges. Eligible students are those who are first-time undergraduates, hold EU nationality or official refugee status and have been ordinarily resident in a EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved course. Tuition fees are not paid in respect of students who already hold an undergraduate degree and are pursuing a second undergraduate degree, irrespective of whether or not funding was previously awarded.</P>

A proposed building project for Gaelscoil Uí Fhiach will proceed to architectural planning and to the preparation of tender documents, as soon as it is possible to do so under the expanded building programme.</P>

      <P>A joint biosciences and electronic engineering building is currently under construction in the National University of Ireland, Maynooth (NUIM). The 5,128mf7&gt;2 building will accommodate researchers in biosciences specifically in the areas of immunology and bioengineering and agro-ecology (3,193 mf7&gt;2), together with creating space <Col N="824" /> for 300 students in the recently created Department of Electronic Engineering (1,935mf7&gt;2). The Government is committed to the support of research in third level institutions and this project is part funded under cycle one of the programme for research in third level institutions, co-funded from the European Regional Development Fund and it will also receive funding under the skills round two programme under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, together with funding from private sources.</P>
      <P>Funding under the NDP has also been allocated for infrastructure works to facilitate the development of the joint biosciences/electronic engineering building. My Department is currently considering a request for funding for a telecommunications, education and community resource centre, TECRC, in NUIM.</P>

My Department's post-primary building unit has indicated to the school authorities that consideration is being given to formally approving the tender recommended for acceptance by their design team. This approval, however, is subject to confirmation that the contractor can meet the standard contractual requirements, including for example evidence of tax clearance and membership of CIF. Confirmation of these items is awaited before the formal approval to the placing of the contract can be considered. The facilities proposed will include eight general classrooms, seven specialist classrooms and administration office, toilets, cloaks and locker areas and stores.</P>

      <P>An old age contributory pension is payable by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to a person who has reached age 66 and satisfies the contribution requirements. These include the requirement that the person must have paid a minimum number of full rate social insurance contributions over the course of their working life to age 66. Prior to the introduction of full rate social insurance for public servants in 1995, pensionable teachers paid PRSI at a modified rate. Modified contributions do not help teachers, or public servants generally, to meet the contribution condition for old age contributory pension to which I have referred but give teachers cover for widows' or widowers' contributory pension and orphans' contributory allowance.</P>
      <P>A female teacher who retired on marriage from pensionable teaching service and who had at least 5 years of such service was eligible for the receipt of a marriage gratuity. It is an obsolete superannuation benefit which was available to teachers who entered service in the 1960s and earlier. A teacher who returned to teaching after marriage could re-instate her earlier service by repaying the marriage gratuity together with compound interest where applicable. Rather than return to teaching, it was also, of course, open to her to engage in employment outside the public service in respect of which social insurance contributions at the full rate were payable.</P>

      <P>None of the primary schools in Celbridge is yet in receipt of a service from the NEPS. They are, however, entitled to avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments. I announced funding for this initiative last June. It allows schools that do not yet have access to the NEPS service to commission psychological assessments from private practitioners. The number of assessments per school is determined by the number of pupils, to a maximum of two per 100 pupils enrolled. I recently announced an acceleration of the development of NEPS and it is anticipated that the NEPS service will be available to all schools by the end of the school year 2002-03.</P>

This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997.

The current status of these building projects is that the extension and refurbishment programme at St. Mary's college has been completed, while the building programme for meánscoil Iognáid Rís is in architectural planning. The need to extend and refurbish St. Patrick's post-primary school has been agreed in principle with the school's management authority, County Kildare Vocational Education Committee.</P>

The initial project is testing the PPP process in respect of post-primary school provision. As the Deputy will be aware, PPP projects encompass the design, build, financing and operation of capital facilities. I am sure the Deputy will agree that it is prudent to keep all options open and accordingly my Department requested the board of management to postpone, for the time being, the process of appointing of a design team.</P>

    <P>I would point out to the Deputy that all figures are provisional. Some schools have not yet returned data to the Department for the 2001-02 school year. Data in respect of the outstanding schools has been entered on a provisional basis using last year's enrolments for each school by programme studied.</P>

      <P>In my reply to the Deputy's Parliamentary Question No. 187 of 6 December 2001, I indicated that the arrangements for the payment of maintenance grants under the higher education grants scheme are a matter for the local authorities, which are statutorily entrusted with the administration of the scheme under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968. With regard to the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as top-up grants, my Department has forwarded full details of this initiative to the local authorities with a request that payment be made with effect from the 2000-01 academic year.</P>
      <P>Arrangements for payment of the special rates are a matter for the local authorities. My Department understands that Kilkenny County Council has commenced processing applications for the special rates of maintenance grants and hopes to issue payments in respect of successful applications shortly.</P>

      <P>The Central Applications Office is a company limited by guarantee which was established in 1976 to accept applications for admission to undergraduate courses in higher education institutions. It is an organisation representative of higher education interests and is controlled entirely and jointly by them. I have no function in relation to the operation of the CAO.</P>
      <P>However, the CAO has kindly supplied the following information in relation to the Deputy's inquiry. CAO fees are not waived as a rule as this would simply mean that other applicants would have to bear the waived charge. Where a recheck results in an upgrade and this gives a level of points which would have merited an offer of a place if known at the normal time, one of two courses of action is taken. Either the applicant is offered the place for the current academic year or a deferred place is offered for the following year. The latter is the case if there is insufficient space in the course or if it would be disadvantageous to the applicant to start late. In fact, deferral in such cases is very rare. Where it occurs, the admitting institution usually does not require CAO application in the following year so the question of another application fee does not arise.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is 153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving accommodation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997. In view of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is being refurbished as part of the Government's programme as is currently in architectural planning. It will continue to the preparation of tender documents and the invitation of tenders, as soon as it is possible to do so, under the expanded building programme.</P>

While my consent to the patron's request to dissolve the board of the school in question was given in November 2001, it now appears that the procedures outlined in section 16, which should have been followed by the patron, may not have been followed in full. In the circumstances, my officials have written to the patron and requested clarification on the matter. On receipt of the patron's response, this matter will be further considered within my Department.</P>

      <P>The Deputy referred to two schools in the details supplied. The position in regard to the first is that enrolments have declined from 44 in the 1996-97 school year to 26 at present. Given that the long-term enrolments of a school are the main factor in determining the extent and type of accommodation to be provided, my Department is undertaking an assessment of the future enrolments at the school in question before proceeding further with the project. My Department will write to the school authorities when this assessment has been completed.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second school, a new school is proposed as part of the Government's programme and the project is currently in architectural planning.
