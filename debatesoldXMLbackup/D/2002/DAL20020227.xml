      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach shares the concern of every Member at the possibility of a further outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom. He will be aware that the original outbreak was attributed to the removal and disposal of swill without due regard to safety standards. Is the Taoiseach aware of a court case in Tipperary yesterday evening in the course of which persons were convicted for the unauthorised collection of swill? In their defence they stated that the Minister for Defence, when they approached him, said the case would not come to court and that he would take care of it. In view of these allegations, will the Taoiseach ask the Minister to make a statement to the House today and to answer questions from Members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be aware that there is a threat of foot and mouth disease breaking out again in the UK. Fortunately, the preliminary tests appear to suggest that an outbreak will not occur. Nobody in rural or urban Ireland will forget the heroic efforts of the entire community to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease in this jurisdiction. Indeed, many businesses lost substantial revenue flows and jobs were lost in the tourism industry following the solidarity expressed and displayed by the entire community with the agricultural sector in that moment of peril.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not regard it as incredible that the Minister for Defence was cited as a witness in the court case mentioned earlier? Serious questions must be asked. There may well be a good explanation for what happened but the Members are entitled to hear it. The House must hear what version of events the Minister for Defence wishes to put on the record. The matter cannot stand as it is. Whether these are credible witnesses or whether the people who were convicted were attempting to implicate others are matters for other places to decide, but what must be heard in this House&mdash;</P>

      <P>I call the Taoiseach, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked two questions. The first relates to the foot and mouth disease case in north Yorkshire. The Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in Great Britain has banned livestock movements within an eight kilometre, five mile, radius of the farm as a precaution after suspect lesions were found in the mouths of two sheep. They were examined as part of an inspection visit by the Department when farms restock. Animals on the farm were slaughtered last August as part of a contiguous cull. It may take up to three days to obtain final results but, in the meantime, the sheep have been slaughtered as a precaution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the not the question the Taoiseach was asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Other precautions have been taken in the UK since the suspect animals were identified yesterday. The suspect farm is being sealed off and all livestock movements within a five mile radius are being halted. Farms that supplied sheep to the suspect farm are being traced and they will be placed under restriction and thoroughly inspected. The UK is continuing to operate retention periods for bought in stock. The preliminary results were negative.</P>
      <P>As I stated in reply to questions last week about easing regulations, we must continue to be on alert in this country. That has always been the advice and we should continue so advise. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has issued a more lengthy statement, which I will not repeat, unless the House wants me to do so. I recall well Deputy Noonan's statement last year that there was a strong possibility that one of the main reasons there was a foot and mouth outbreak in the first place was that raw food had been thrown in garbage bins which was then fed to pigs. That was one of the main suspected reasons for the outbreak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to yesterday's events, the Minister for Defence was called as a witness in a case and he gave his evidence in court. The court accepted <Col N="940" /> his evidence and the Minister made it absolutely clear &ndash; he told me here earlier that I can say this because we do not normally talk about what goes on in the courts &ndash; that he has always complied with requests and co-operated with the Garda. He totally denied the matters that were stated against him and the court accepted that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>What was central to the case yesterday was the unauthorised collection of swill and there was a conviction as a result, but the allegation being made is that when those who were accused of the crime were first summonsed, they approached the Minister for Defence and the Minister gave them assurances that the case would not appear in court and that he would take care of it. The Minister, taking all the circumstances into account and against the background of a possible further outbreak of foot and mouth disease, should be given the opportunity to come into the House to make a statement on the record and take questions from the Opposition. We all know that people come to our constituency clinics and we have no control over who comes in the door to a clinic. We know the circumstances of the requests that are often made in clinics, but there is a straight conflict here. The view&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach may be aware of another court case where a former school principal in his mid-80s, who was given a three year sentence for admitting 23 child sex abuse offences against eight victims, had his sentence suspended in the court of appeal. One of the grounds for the suspension was that the court accepted the evidence of a psychiatrist whose view was that the person in question was elderly, in poor health and potentially suicidal. Does the Taoiseach not find it a contradiction that he and the Government are trying to remove the protection of suicide as a defence in the forthcoming referendum for people who could very well have been the victims of this particular school principal and who, as a result of his abuse, might have found themselves with an unwanted pregnancy?</P>
      <P>As a result of what he is trying to do, the right to a termination in this jurisdiction for such victims because of their suicidal condition, which the Supreme Court gave to them back in 1992, could be removed. Does he want to remove that right from them at the same time as a court recognises the threat of suicide by the perpetrator of a crime and grants leniency in the form of a suspended sentence while the victims of that crime could potentially be denied the compassion and rights which the Supreme Court granted to them and which the Taoiseach now wants to take away? Does that raise questions for him in the dying days of this ill-fated campaign to amend the Constitution by way of a referendum next Wednesday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will recall that in 1992 when a similar referendum was put to the people, they were asked to reply to three questions and they were sophisticated enough to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for the right to travel and the right to information and to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; to a proposition to roll back the X case. On reflection, does he agree it would be more appropriate if the Government had arranged on this occasion, when four different questions are being put to the people, to put them individually to allow people to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; to each of four questions rather than to roll them all together and put a composite question where a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or a &ldquo;No&rdquo; will not reflect their views?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The people are being asked to insert two articles in the Constitution. The first of <Col N="942" /> those will give constitutional protection to a new law, the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Bill. The details of that legislation are before the people and they are well aware of what is in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Quinn, the Government's final proposals were based on what experts said at the all-party committee. Various experts indicated that suicide as a result of pregnancy was rare and that incidence of suicide was lower among pregnant women than in the general population. They said that experience from abroad was that a change in the law, to deal on compassionate grounds with a small number of exceptional cases could be exploited to allow wider application.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The evidence at the all-party committee indicated the medical response to a <Col N="943" /> pregnant woman considered to be at risk of committing suicide would be to help and support her, treat her underlying medical condition and not to offer an abortion. That is why the Government with all-party agreement set up the crisis pregnancy agency and gave it resources so that this issue can be treated in a more humane way in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no evidence given to the all-party committee that doctors had ever carried out an abortion in Ireland on the basis of a suicide threat, if it has ever happened. In a debate here two weeks ago, Deputies Quinn, Noonan and Mitchell said they did not see any reason for that. Deputy Quinn would say that although it has not happened in ten years, it should still remain there. Far from agreeing with his logic, the longer this goes on, the more I disagree with him. I know and accept his position as a pro-choice individual. I saw what he said in the paper today and I admire him for that, but I am of the opposite opinion.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach now express his regret for attempting to use, as a justification for rolling back the rights of women here, the impression that there is agreement within the psychiatric profession that suicide is not a threat to the life of a pregnant woman in certain cases of an unwanted pregnancy, given that the two quoted psychiatrists who apparently came out in support of the Government's position have been contradicted by other psychiatrists, some of whom have been on the radio today? Will the Taoiseach explain why he finds himself in conflict with the compassion of the courts, which can extend a suspended sentence on appeal to a child abuser on the grounds that the abuser might be suicidal, but he wants to remove the same kind of compassion from the discretion of the courts to a victim of that abuser who herself may be suicidal? What kind of republic is this that comes down in favour of the abuser and against the plight of the victim? Is this the kind of Ireland the Taoiseach wants to see for young women in the twenty first century? What kind of republic is that? Where is the choice in that for the victim?</P>

      <P>Yesterday my colleague, Deputy Howlin, offered the Government co-operation which I would like to repeat. The Government recently announced the appointment of three members to the Flood tribunal who will become Circuit Court judges. As we know, the practice of the Bar means these people will no longer be able to work as senior counsel and barristers and they will not be able to take up their posts until they become judges. Deputy Howlin published a two section Bill to increase the number from 27 to 30 to provide for the establishment of the extra resources which the House wants to give to the tribunal we collectively established. We could agree to that measure tomorrow without debate because there is no dispute on the net point of moving from 27 to 30 to enable these people to resume their official functions as members of the Flood tribunal.</P>
      <P>The alternative is to make it part of the Courts and Court Officers Bill, which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will recognise as substantial legislation and which would require a different level of scrutiny. There is no dispute in the House about the extra three persons required. We are offering agreement to pass the Bill without delay or debate, other than a summary debate tomorrow, so that it can leave the House and go to the Seanad to enable these people to take up their functions. I ask the Government to give urgent consideration to this measure in light of the fact that in the first three weeks of March the House will only sit for five days. The work of the tribunal will be delayed as a result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second Social Welfare Bill to be introduced since the introduction of the budget. Most of the welcome increases in payments announced in the budget have already been put through. It is great that these increases are being introduced so early in the year. It was only seven or eight years ago that budget increases were paid to social welfare recipients in late July. Governments and Ministers have since tried to move the date of payment forward. Initially it was moved forward by a week or two and by 1995, payments were being made by mid-June. By 1998, payments were being made in early June and further progress meant they were paid in later years by early May. Last year, payments were made in early April and this year they were made on 1 January. There is no doubt that people on social welfare payments have done very well in the past five to seven years, particularly when one considers that in 1994 they received their increases in late July whereas they now receive them from early January.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the Minister has done extraordinarily well in recent years, particularly when one considers that the total amount distributed in social welfare payments has risen from £4.5 billion to £7.4 billion this year. There will also be an additional package of £850 million in 2002. The cry of those who cater for the needs of poorer people in recent years has been that the social welfare package did not match the tax package. This came about as a result of different circumstances. It is good that the social welfare package for this year is on a par &ndash; if not greater than &ndash; the tax package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People on social welfare payments have done very well in recent years. More than 100,000 people, many of whom were long-term unemployed, have been taken off the live register. Enormous progress has been made. When Opposition Members refer to life and progress in <Col N="956" /> recent years they often talk about a drop in people's quality of life. However, comments on quality of life are biased by who is doing the judging and whom they are judging. If we consider a well-to-do, upper middle class family, whose children may have been reared to qualify as doctors, accountants, solicitors and barristers and who may have been immune to the vagaries of recession and every day life that effect everyone else, then the past two years or so may have led to a reduction in their quality of life particularly if this is judged in terms of the time spent sitting in traffic, etc. However, I represent a constituency in which there are pockets of under privileged people. If we consider this matter from the point of view of the families in these areas, seven or eight years ago the fathers were long-term unemployed and their children got up each morning and saw them lying in bed or hanging around the house. These people had no hope, no motivation and nothing to do. Now, those kids see a totally different life. They see their fathers and, in many cases, their mothers also going out to work and making a useful contribution to their family, their community and their country. The spirit, motivation and lifestyle of those kids has been transformed and marvellous improvements have been made in that regard. Without focusing specifically on any area, there are certain well known tower blocks in my area. A frequent complaint which the local authority has had to meet in the past 18 months is the need for extra car parking spaces at those tower blocks. Ten years ago, it was a novelty to see a car outside one of those blocks but now extra parking spaces have had to be provided in response to pressure from the residents, so somebody must be doing well. Those people would be classified as poor and under privileged and now their quality of life has been greatly improved. Those who comment unfavourably on that situation tend to view it from an upper middle class point of view.</P>
    <P>There have been enormous increases in child benefit this year and last year. This year, the payments will be made in May and backdated to April. They have been brought forward by five months, compared to previous years. Organisations such as the Combat Poverty Agency recognise and appreciate the Government's action, particularly over the past two years, in targeting child benefit. The real effects of poverty are felt by families and that measure has greatly improved their situation. Old age pensioners have had considerable increases and that has been entirely due to political action, not from any of the organisations outside this House, those in the voluntary sector or platform of the PPF. Those groups do not seem to shout for the old age pensioners. When we said, five years ago, that we would raise the old age pension from £74, as it was then, to £100 over a five year period, there were sceptical comments from the Opposition side that we would not achieve that. Yet, at a time of low single figure inflation, not alone have we reached £100 but we have reached £116. The <Col N="957" /> yearly increases have been very significant &ndash; £10 this year and last year and £7, £6 and £5 in the preceding years. One can compare that to the performance of the rainbow Government &ndash; £3, £2.20, and even £1.80 in 1995.</P>
    <P>Perhaps people on the Opposition side deserve some sympathy in their efforts to find a few valid points of criticism to offer. It is really very difficult for them but one can only do one's best. While I have had not had any training in the acting profession, others have and no doubt they will put on a show. However, one detects that their comments are rather muted and of the tongue in cheek variety. The increases have been enormous and that is only right and proper. I hope the next Government, of whatever composition, will continue that trend. The elderly in our society are the most deserving. They put their shoulders to the wheel and made sacrifices when conditions were not so good.</P>
    <P>A few speakers referred to carers and their association. The number of people on carers allowance has more than doubled in the past five years to the present figure of almost 20,000 and many others have benefited from the carers' tax allowance which was introduced three years ago. We would like to extend it &ndash; one will always find people doing a great job in caring but not getting any recognition for it. I draw a distinction between the Carers' Association and the people I meet who are very genuine, sincere carers. My priority, at this stage, is not necessarily the income disregard but rather to give some recognition and payment to people who may be in receipt of another social welfare payment. That is a far more pressing cause, but the Carers' Association has not pursued it at all. That body seems to be totally influenced by a few of its leading members who are pushing their own case, to the exclusion of those already on social welfare benefit who are the really genuine carers, including widows, long-term unemployed or people on invalidity benefit. They do a marvellous job and they are the people who should get some recognition and payment, even if only the respite care annual payment of £500 as an initial payment. The Carers' Association seems to have been taken over by a clique within its membership and it seems it does not press the interests of the majority of carers, the people I meet who have the greatest need.</P>
    <P>The social welfare increases in recent years have been particularly beneficial to women, including widows. The increase in the qualified adult allowance last year and this year has been marvellous, as have the payments to those in the pre- 53 category. I know of an 87 year old woman who got her pre- 53 payment last year. She had been married at 24, her husband was an ESB officer and had a reasonable salary but now, at 87, she has got her first payment in her own right, in her own name. It is not simply a matter of money, as her husband has a good pension from the ESB, but rather the recognition in the form <Col N="958" /> of a payment in her own right after all of 63 years, which gave her great joy and pleasure.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs on introducing payments which recognise the hard work which women have done in the family home over many years. I hope the initiative which has been taken in relation to the qualified adult allowance will continue. While there has been much emphasis on individualisation of the income tax system, we also need individualisation of the social welfare code so that the spouse, usually a woman, will have proper recognition in her own right. Issues concerning payments to widows arise frequently in the Joint Committee on Social, Community and Family Affairs and I agree that widows deserve to have their position improved. In a recent presentation, the question was asked as to what increase could be given on payments to widows if workers were given the option of paying 0.1% extra in their PRSI contribution and the figure was of the order of £50 per week. Rather than simply calling for an increase by reference to historical payments, something along those lines should be discussed, whereby people could have the opportunity of opting for an extra PRSI contribution for that purpose. Many people recognise that widows deserve better assistance and I believe many would make that contribution if given the option. I hope the idea will be followed up by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Ó Caoláin. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I am glad the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is present. I compliment the officials in his Department, whom I have found most courteous, helpful and efficient in any dealings I have had with them. Departments are often criticised in this House and where credit is merited it should also be given. Social welfare fraud was debated yesterday and Department officials often have to deal with people who are defrauding the system who must be dealt with firmly. The problem is that sometimes genuine people are dealt with too firmly which can lead to hardship, worry and stress. I ask that this be taken into account so that people who genuinely make mistakes or are totally innocent and are being asked questions are spared stress. Many people get worried when officialdom comes knocking. That is not to say we should take it easy on those who are setting out to defraud the system. We should treat those people firmly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been made of the quality of life issues to which the previous speaker referred. We have perhaps turned from a society into an economy and there is a struggle between being a community based society and being driven by economics. When a society is being driven by economics very often the human factor gets left aside. This is particularly evident when we deal with families and children. Child care costs have more than doubled since 1998. The main issue <Col N="959" /> regarding child care is the provision of places. It is causing huge stress in families. It is only right that we compensate families by increasing child benefit and I acknowledge that it has been increased dramatically in recent years. If it had not happened, families with children would have found it impossible to carry on. At present they are finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet. In many cases both parents have to work outside the home because of the costs of providing housing.</P>
    <P>Under this Government, the cost of providing housing has soared as have the costs of child care. Many families have to leave their homes at 7 a.m., pull children out of their beds and travel long distances in heavy traffic to child care facilities &ndash; if they can find them &ndash; perhaps eating their breakfast in the car on the way. This is surely having a detrimental effect on their quality of life. Even primary school children are coming home from school in the evening and there is nobody home &ndash; they are latch key children. This is also causing major problems and stresses for families and we must start addressing the need for proper child care otherwise we are storing up all kinds of social problems for the years ahead. I have come across cases where people are paying up to &euro;1,000 per month for two children to be looked after. In this context it only right that child benefit be increased.</P>
    <P>I am trying to work out the logic of the statement in the press release issued by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs which refers to the remarkable turnaround in the economy as a result of the Government's prudent management. It led to an accumulated surplus of more than £1 billion &ndash; as it was in the social insurance fund &ndash; which was then used to balance the books. Commentators will want to find out why, at a time of unprecedented economic activity, the Government managed to finish its term with a huge deficit which seems set to grow further. Unfortunately the people who suffer when this happens are the people at the lower end of the ladder. The Government has turned the economy around but we are now facing major problems indicated by the need to raid the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to the plight of unmarried mothers renting houses and in receipt of rent subsidies and who, if they marry or have their partner living with them, will lose that benefit. There are situations where women and their husbands to be or boyfriends have to live apart &ndash; and must move in at night clandestinely and under cover of darkness. This situation is not good and must be examined. We must assist couples who find themselves in the terrible predicament whereby, if a woman is living in a house and in receipt of rent subsidy with one or two children, she cannot afford to co-habit with her partner because that would make them worse off financially. Could the Minister address that when he makes his final remarks?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" />Some work is being done on community development projects across the country but I ask that more be done. We must drive this initiative. We have a problem in that teenagers between the ages of 12 and 16, 17 or 18 have nowhere to go and nothing to do in the evenings. I acknowledge that sporting clubs are doing great work for younger people across the country but they need to be given more resources. I am referring to a youth service. We have a large population of young people and they have a right to go out at night, socialise and meet their friends and peers safely. However, there is nowhere for them to go except public houses and street corners. If they hang around the streets people will complain about noise and older people will be intimidated so we need to tackle this issue.</P>
    <P>Young people deserve to have youth clubs and facilities where they can get involved in projects and have discos and it important that we facilitate that. I ask whatever Government is in power after the general election to address the area of services for teenagers between the ages of 13 and 18. The youth organisations are doing great work but they are not adequately funded. The community development projects are helping in some ways but they need more help and assistance.</P>
    <P>Third level education costs is an issue which is arising more and more. Young people are finding it more difficult to survive at third level. Their college grant often barely covers or does not cover the accommodation costs and young people have nothing to fall back on. Our colleagues in the House will suggest they go to the Society of St Vincent de Paul or some other organisation for assistance but we need to start focusing on this area as people are dropping out of third level education because they cannot afford to continue. Some students have to work in part time jobs for the same reason. We need to look at this neglected area from a social welfare perspective.</P>
    <P>Medical costs form a big issue for families. A visit to a GP can cost &euro;35 and often families do not go to GPs because they cannot afford it and wait until the last minute when it is too late. We need to examine medical costs &ndash; particularly where children are concerned &ndash; and do more in the area.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the main issues I am concerned about as well as some others including child care, the cost of housing and unmarried mothers and the pressures they are under. There is another issue which concerns widows. A widow on a non-contributory pension may be a young woman who wants to take up employment but will find that the payment is reduced if she does, so there is a disincentive for these people to take up work. Perhaps something could be done in that area. Perhaps the payment could be continued for a certain length of time or the widow might be allowed to receive the payment and earn a certain amount of money as well. I know a number of widows who cannot work because they will be financially worse off if they do &ndash; especially those in receipt of a non-contributory widow's <Col N="961" /> pension. Perhaps it is something which the Minister could address.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a number of points in regard to the Bill before us. As I stated at the time of the debate on the budget measures, I welcome the increases in child benefit. However, unlike some payments that were brought forward to the start of the new social welfare and tax year, child benefit increases only come into effect as of April of this year and recipients have to wait until May to receive payment. Mothers and children are equally deserving of having their allowances brought forward to the start of the year. The early months of the year, particularly the January to March period, is the time of greatest financial hardship for many families as the outlay of the Christmas period leaves them struggling. A January increase this year, rather than an April one paid in May, would have made a significant difference at a time of great financial distress. It was a missed opportunity and one I note with regret.</P>
      <P>The repercussions of the euro changeover also need to be highlighted. The changeover has undoubtedly brought about an increase in the real cost of living. This is instanced in many ways, including in terms of fees paid for services to a multiplicity of agencies. Five pounds is often regarded as &euro;10 and the small coinage is viewed as more of nuisance value than of real value. I am concerned that may well have been the intention and due to its almost valueless nature, both in terms of size and buying power the smaller coins may ultimately be withdrawn. I fear there is an agenda towards that aim both here and in other European countries where in at least one case the lower coinage valuation has not been introduced. I have no doubt the circumstances I have described were anticipated.</P>
      <P>I remember the previous currency changeover in 1971. I was a cashier in a bank at the time and recall the difficulty of handling two different currencies. The situation was made more demanding then because we were changing from a pound with 240 pence to one with 100 pence. At least the current equivalence was not so problematic. The promises made that the euro changeover would not have any effect on the cost of living does not hold up to scrutiny. There is a long list of areas that are not taken into account such as visits to a doctor's surgery or what one presents to a priest for the signing of a mass card. One does not usually jingle coins at these people and a &euro;5 note does not seem to satisfy in the way £5 might have done in the past, or whatever multiple of same. So much has been rounded up that it makes a nonsense of Government spokesperson's claims that all such instances would be challenged and reversed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many claim that the increases introduced in January were something to which they were entitled, in any event, and that it was only a coincidence that it ran in line with the euro changeover. That has to be challenged. There should <Col N="962" /> have been some embargo on increases in every area over a period of time when the euro came into effect. What measures does the Minister intend introducing now to compensate the most vulnerable in society for this extra strain on their already over-stretched entitlements. Some further measure is required at this juncture over and above those announced in the Budget 2002 address in order to compensate people who find themselves in straitened financial circumstances, the people who are most deserving of our support and compassion.</P>
    <P>I would appreciate if the Minister would respond later to what I perceive are anomalies in the system that are a cause of concern to me. Widows and widowers are entitled to additional benefits with their payments, such as free telephone rental, free television licence, free ESB units etc. I agree that these payments should be made, irrespective of age, but the case of widowed people is in stark contrast to that of lone parents. In many parts of the country a single-parent family can live beside the family of a widowed spouse with the same difficulties that life presents, but because one has lost a partner due to accident or ill-health and the other does not have a partner they are treated differently. This merits re-examination in regard to the basic similarity of being the sole parent struggling to meet the needs of children. Why is there not parity between the status of widow and lone parent and why do we draw a distinction? Are they not both dealing with the same set of problems presented by life.</P>
    <P>Another anomalous situation is that of those who would otherwise qualify for additional supports but who are denied because of the permanent or occasional presence of a family member in the home. Such people have to forego the benefits of free television licence, telephone rental, and ESB units, despite there being invariably no evidence to support the case that the family member is contributing to the overall cost of the family household. If it is not the intention of the Government to address this on a 100% basis then it may be within the gift of the Minister to explore a percentage approach of the cost in regard to these entitlements being allocated to the otherwise qualifying recipient. I urge the Minister to explore this area.</P>
    <P>I deplore the situation where an increase in the hourly rate of pay for someone who is an adult dependant leads them to reduce their hours because of the knock-on effect on the adult dependant allowance. That is a fundamental flaw that needs to be addressed. A much more generous easing entitlement should be allowed for people in such a position. I call on the Minister to take those points on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record of this Government in improving the lot of people dependent on social welfare and that of the less well-off will go down in history as <Col N="963" /> one of the best in the lifetime of the State. Only this morning we heard, on radio, a number of groups dealing with the less well-off accept that considerable progress has been made in that area. We all accept the need to ensure that those who depend on social welfare for their income should be looked after. That has not been in doubt among politicians on all sides of this House, but sometimes it has been easier to talk about it than to act. This Minister has acted over the past five years to improve the lot of the people he represents at the Cabinet table. After all, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is the social welfare recipient's lifeline to Government.</P>
    <P>There have been unprecedented social welfare increases over the lifetime of the Government and a number of schemes which are very important to those who benefit from them have been expanded. While achieving this, the Government has ensured that the needs of those who face the greatest hardship have been attended to. This year's increases are unprecedented and those that have been made over the past five years have led to a higher standard of living for social welfare recipients. There are a number of categories of social welfare. When this Government took office it stated that the minimum old age pension would be £100 per week by the time its term had ended. Some said that was completely unrealistic, but looking at the rates that are to be paid to pensioners under this legislation it is obvious that goal has been well and truly exceeded. That is of enormous benefit to pensioners and none of us will grudge them anything they get. They have made their contribution to society and worked to build the country we have today. They are entitled to the maximum that can be paid. The fringe benefits that attend payments are the envy of every other European country. We provide free travel, electricity allowance and numerous other allowances to people in receipt of social welfare payments. There is an onus on every Member to ensure that these people are looked after properly and it is nice to note that nobody has been critical of the increases this Bill proposes.</P>
    <P>There are specific groups on whose behalf substantial progress has been made over the years. Carers have seen quite a change in their circumstances during the life of this Government, but even that change is not enough. The time they put into looking after those for whom they care is unquantifiable in monetary terms. I hope we continue to broaden the income bands with regard to carer's allowance as that, in the long-term, will lead to major savings for the State. People would not have to be cared for in institutions, or hospitalised, as their families could care for them to a greater extent. There is a need for not only by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, but also for health boards and other agencies concerned to provide a back-up service to full-time carers. People say <Col N="964" /> carers are never paid. I agree that, irrespective of what allowance they are granted, they will never be sufficiently compensated for the efforts they make for the people they look after.</P>
    <P>Another major achievement of the Minister has been the introduction of pensions at a reduced rate to those who made contributions up to the age of 53, but not thereafter. That has been a significant supplement to the incomes of many and it is only fair that those who made contributions should benefit from them. The changes the Minister has made should be lauded by this House. The people who are benefiting felt they had been forgotten, but the Minister came to their rescue. Some might say they receive the full pension, but most of them appreciate what they have been given. The same applies to those who had not made the required ten years' contributions. The improvements that have been made to provide them with reduced pensions is something they appreciate. In many cases they were unable to fulfil the conditions of the regulation because they were too old when it was introduced to bring their social welfare contributions up to the level demanded.</P>
    <P>We must also look at the other changes made during the Minister's tenure. Child benefit increases, this year especially, have meant that people have been better able to provide for their families and to ensure that no hardship will be endured. Children are very expensive and becoming more so. More and more advertising is forced on them and the &ldquo;keep up with the Joneses&rdquo; element in child rearing causes financial stress. We all accept that parents want to provide their children with as much as possible and that is admirable.</P>
    <P>The increases in social welfare benefits are such that people realise this Government was prepared to put in the necessary funding. There are still anomalies which we all come across in our daily work as politicians, but no matter how far we progress the social welfare system, we will never be able to get it to run perfectly. We have to admire the service the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs provides to the Members of this House. Its efficiency is to be praised. It returns quickly to Members with answers to the problems we have to deal with on behalf of our constituents and the efforts of its officials are to be complimented.</P>
    <P>Widows have been mentioned and we all have a special regard for them. When a widow is bereaved, in many cases she still encounters the same costs as when her spouse was alive and they had a double income. I hope widows pension will be brought to the same level as other pensions. While this Minister has increased the rate of increases to widows to try to balance the payments, I still feel that widow pensions should be on a par with other pensions. I want the next Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to move this on and I hope that Minister will be the incumbent. The electorate will have <Col N="965" /> the say as to who will form the Government after May.</P>
    <P>When we look at the rate of increases we have to appreciate that a £10 per week increase is being provided to 205,000 pensioners. Few realise that there is that number under that category alone who will receive an extra £10. In total, there are approximately 900,000 recipients of social welfare who have 129,000 qualifying dependants. In fact, one million people or one quarter of the population benefit from the social welfare system. When one considers the number concerned, it is easy to think that we do not do enough. However, there is a limited budget and in the circumstances the increases must be targeted. This must be accepted by everybody.</P>
    <P>In the budget the Minister especially targeted the old and the young. The increases given to all other social welfare recipients are more than in line with inflation. They are also in line with increases which will be given under the various programmes for those in employment. While I welcome these increases, perhaps there is a need for us to look down the road at further targeting because there will still be certain sections of the community who may find that they are excluded.</P>
    <P>The back-to-work and back-to-education allowances should be open to anybody over 45 years of age. The reason I say this is that in many cases women who have reared their families now want to return to education to do the things that they might not have been able to do previously, but for financial reasons are not able to take up some of the schemes available. This is something which needs to be addressed and looked at on a targeted basis. The people concerned can make an enormous contribution when they return to the workforce at a later stage and should be given the opportunity of returning to it.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other issues at which we must look in the context of social welfare. The plight of lone parents is a growing problem for us all. They have the problem of deciding whether to return to work or stay at home. We need to look at the social consequences of some of these decisions. I hope the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs might even conduct an examination of the position of lone parents in the social welfare system. The people concerned encounter major problems in finding accommodation and maintaining a standard of living for both themselves and their children. We must accept that, in addition to lone parenthood, marriage breakdown has become much more common in Ireland.</P>
    <P>When we deal with these categories we should be extremely sympathetic. These are people who, due to no fault of their own, can find their circumstances have changed totally overnight. One day they can be in a steady relationship with a husband or wife and two days later find that they are lone parents. This can happen to either partner. We must look, therefore, at providing a system suitable in both circumstances. While I recognise <Col N="966" /> that tremendous improvements have been made to the provisions for lone parents during the year, like in the case of carers, we need to improve the lot of those who find themselves in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that this year social welfare increases will take effect from 1 January. This is a change to which we all aspired. During the years we heard Ministers say increases would come into effect in the month of July, June and then May. The Minister has provided that the increases will take effect from the same day as the change in tax credits. I welcome this change and hope it will always be continued into the future.</P>
    <P>It must have taken tremendous effort on behalf of the Minister to ensure the introduction of this provision. No doubt the Department of Finance would prefer if the increases were introduced much later in the year, but the fact that recipients are now paid social welfare increases from the same day as those in employment benefit from changes in tax credits is a sign of tremendous progress. It is a sign of progress in the entire social welfare system. When one thinks about it, ten years ago changes in social welfare did not take effect until the month of July. The Minister has worked to bring the date forward and in 1997 the increases came into effect in the month of June, two months after the changes in the taxation system took effect. This year the social welfare changes have been brought forward to coincide with the introduction of the tax credit changes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in family income supplement which encourages people to go to work and take up jobs on wages marginally higher than their social welfare payment. I compliment the Minister on putting in place this incentive.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes introduced for people with a disability and those in rehabilitation. In my constituency the increase in the amount those on NRB and FÁS courses can receive tax free without affecting their social welfare payments has been welcomed. The level of disregard has increased from £35 in 1996 to £94 in 2002.</P>
    <P>People do not realise that total social welfare expenditure will increase by 20% this year, a large increase. We all realise it has taken such an increase to do what needed to be done. Those who are able to earn a living without being dependent on social welfare have a duty to look after those in society who are less well off. We have a duty to ensure their income is sufficient to maintain themselves and their families and allow them to live in reasonable comfort. Those on social welfare feel insecure because they do not enjoy the security of having a job. In many cases they try to save and affect their standard of living to an extent none of us would appreciate.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will be considering further decentralisation. I might at this stage suggest that, in view of the fact that there are social welfare offices in Longford, Sligo and Letterkenny, the next time we might bridge the gap and use Car<Col N="967" /> rick-on-Shannon as a base for decentralisation for the Department.</P>

He has also ensured that those who could leave the welfare system and return to work have been encouraged to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Connaughton.</P>
      <P>We know the Minister's name because of all the broadcasts in recent months and the messages issued by his Department. He has built on a foundation put in place by previous Ministers in the past 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also fair to say the social welfare system has become streamlined to a great extent with the use of technology and to the benefit of most people. In my early days as a public representative in the House, the fear of God was put into applicants for the old age pension or those undergoing reviews for farmer's dole, unemployment assistance, pensions and so on. The pensions officer in rural areas wielded enormous power. There were stories, rumours and allegations about how hens, ducks or whatever else could make the difference between getting a pension or not. Circumstances have changed greatly. I remember my involvement as a national public representative in the bilateral agreements between Ireland, England and the United States. They came to fruition during Mr. Haughey's time and benefits were recognised in both jurisdictions which meant those who left the country because of economic necessity, worked in England and <Col N="968" /> the United States and sent money home to keep their families here alive were eligible when they returned home to be considered for a range of benefits for the elderly. That was a recognition by Governments of the valuable part played by these men and women who left the country many years ago and wanted to retire to a much changed place.</P>
    <P>There is something the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs can do for the navvies in Britain, many of whom live in doss houses and are afraid to come home because their lifestyles have deteriorated and they are alcoholics or suffer a range of social ailments. Some movements throughout the country are very good in this area and the Department, together with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Díon group, could do more. A database should be provided or made available to locate these people and offer them some comfort or the odd trip to Ireland to maintain contact with relatives and friends who may still be alive.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the change in registration for births and marriages. I bring to the Minister's attention a case of which I am aware and with which he may be able to assist. It concerns a couple who had three children &ndash; two girls and a boy &ndash; before they were married. The children retained the mother's maiden name. When the couple married, it was possible for her to change the surnames of two of her children from her maiden to her married name. The boy was born after the legislation concerning births and marriages was changed and updated in October 1997. The boy retained the mother's maiden name as distinct from the other two children who now have her married name. I have contacted the General Register Office about this. There is a legal impediment which means the law will need to be made more flexible to cater for this. The Minister's officials may be aware of the case. I will send details of it to him and perhaps he might use his good offices to see if this can be resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It may require an amendment to the 1997 Act. It should be done because it can happen that three children of the same family can have different names.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also interested in the issue of the public service identity. This is leading to a point where everyone will have a public service identity. Section 12 could be extended to include &ldquo;within the meaning of a specified body or location such places as a public house or night-club&rdquo;. Forged identity cards are frequently used by people in night-clubs, hotels and public houses. Gardaí find that people who are under-age use forged identity cards to obtain drink. This can result in the courts closing down these places for a period which is to the detriment of the proprietor despite the fact that he or she may have made an effort to ensure the person was over the legal age. The public service identity will include surname, forename, date <Col N="969" /> of birth, place of birth, sex and so on, and this is information relevant to the authentication of a person's identity when he or she conducts business with a public service or other service.</P>
    <P>If the definition of public services were to be extended to include facilities for the entertainment of the public, the public service identity could be valuable. If the technology were in place at the entrance to these facilities, a swipe card such as is used by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for a range of purposes could also be used to authenticate and validate the age and identity of people and ensure they met the entry requirements or other such conditions. I do not hold any brief for those who suggest this would be a diminution of civil liberties. A social malaise is affecting our country because of alcohol and substance abuse. In this context, it is something which could be examined.</P>
    <P>I have raised the point with the Minister on a number of occasions that the Department offers free travel facilities to everyone who is of pensionable age but that many pensioners are unable to use the facility because no public transport is available and neither is there private transport on which the Department has given its consent for people to use their free travel passes. For example, a number of elderly people living in the Tourmakeady-Finny area bordering Mayo and Galway, which is a wild, beautiful and mountainous area, never have the opportunity to avail of what the State gives them, which is a recognition that they are elderly citizens and that they have a right to travel free on public transport within the country. They can never avail of it because there is no public transport and neither is there any private transport which they can use with the official sanction of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I raised this issue before and it should be possible to offer these people a voucher twice a month to travel with a validated taxi service to the nearest town. It would not just be for this purpose. It would also mean elderly people would be able to look forward to going to the local town, visiting the church or their friends and doing their shopping. It would be a day out from the confinement of their homes. It is wrong that, while the State is sufficiently caring and broad-minded enough to recognise that, because these people are of a certain age, they should have the right of free travel, they cannot avail of it during their pension years. For the relatively small amount involved, a licensed taxi driver should be able to take these pensioners to their local towns twice a month for the purposes I have mentioned. It would not only be for social good and a mental challenge but would also give them the opportunity to do themselves up, do some shopping, visit the church and their friends and so on. It is feasible to add a voucher to their pension books to allow them to do that.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not concentrate on this issue when I mentioned it to him previously but I know he will now. We have received messages from a <Col N="970" /> Dermot Ahern who purports to be an understanding Minister and I am sure he is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

      <P>I am sure he understands that, in the far-flung regions of the country, there are people who are given this recognition by the State of a free travel pass but unfortunately cannot use it. It is wonderful to see the more experienced people in our community who have the free travel availing of it. They travel throughout the country and that is to be commended and built upon. My suggestion is one means by which we could grant equality of opportunity to pensioners who cannot avail of the free transport scheme.</P>

      <P>Even though it was a great time to be Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and he could take decisions no one before him could take, he turned his back on a certain category of people. I would be the first to acknowledge that the basic old age pension which is now in place is no more than people deserve. Despite the gloss the Minister put on it, many elderly people say to me that they were delighted to receive the increase in the old age pension but the cost of living is creeping up. In a few months' time the increase will not be as glossy as the Minister pretends. If one takes into account grocery bills, the price of food and so on the cost of living <Col N="971" /> continues to increase. Neither did the change-over to the euro currency help the situation.</P>
      <P>There are a few categories of people on whom the Minister has completely turned his back. These include carers.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to what the Minister had to say, therefore, he should pay me the courtesy of listening to what I have to say.</P>
      <P>There are 100,000 carers here. Some suggest there are more. Following the budget and the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 19,500 of the 100,000 carers will receive assistance to look after their disabled friends and relatives. That is only a drop in the ocean. If one were to relate this to individual families the figures are even worse. Irrespective of one's income, some one must do the caring 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. Given the way in which the assessment for carer's allowance is carried out and given the increases in wages and salaries, even though the guidelines and thresholds have been increased, the numbers of people coming into the system as carers who are entitled to the carer's allowance is beginning to level out. Like many of the other social welfare recipient groups, it will level out at a particular level and the most one can expect under the present system is approximately 20,000. This begs the question about the other 80,000 carers and who cares for them? What does the Minister propose to do in regard to these huge problems? I am aware of constituents of mine who are relatively small farmers and, because of the way in which the assessment was carried out, they were deemed to be ineligible, even though the mother spends at least 24 hours a day caring for her mother-in-law. This is the way life is structured particularly in rural areas. If this woman's health does not stand the strain and the person who is being cared for is sent to one of the State nursing homes, such as St. Brendan's in Loughrea, I understand the cost to the Exchequer could be as high as £600 or £700 a week. A huge number of people are very bitter as a result of this system. There is nothing in the Bill for this type of carer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand the way in which governments, particularly this Government which had so much money, dealt with the various allowances for mentally handicapped people. I have no time to consider each allowance, but I will to refer to respite care. The Minister made available a respite allowance, which I welcome. The problem in regard to the mentally handicapped, particularly those in east Galway and the Ballinasloe area, is that the opportunities for respite places are not available. This means a number of parents of special children may be able to avail of respite care only once every six months. This is a very poor reflection on a Government which has so many resources at its disposal. This aspect is <Col N="972" /> raised daily and I do not blame parents for being bitter.</P>
    <P>Another issue to which I refer is child benefit. I congratulate the Minister because I have always believed this is one of the most important ways of getting badly needed funds on a weekly and monthly basis to people on low incomes. This is as direct a route as possible for paying mothers of such families. We would all agree that, by and large, it is mothers who take so much responsibility for the upbringing of children. This should not necessarily be the case, but that is how it is. This does not mean families are either rich or poor but, unfortunately, women in some families with a so-called good income may have nothing other than the child benefit.</P>
    <P>I raise with the Minister the question of women who were in the Civil Service in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and up until the 1980s. A number of women recently approached me who worked as telephonists in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs up to 1985. These people were not paying the stamp or insurance contribution which would entitle them to a pension on reaching the age of 66. A great number of them are very sore about the fact that while their input into the State was as great as anyone else's, because of a series of factors which developed, they are now forgotten. There is nothing for them unless they had personal pension funds or were employed in later years in insurable employment. These people cannot understand why it is not possible for the State to recognise their input down through the years at a time when they need it most.</P>
    <P>There are a number of issues in regard to the farm assist scheme, but in fairness to the staff of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, in so far as queries from Deputies are concerned, there is a good system in place for answering queries quickly. It is to their credit that they operate in this way. I would like the Minister to convey that message to them. I hope he will try to expedite the oral appeal system &ndash; a good system &ndash; because applicants are waiting too long.</P>

        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>: </b>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words about the Bill and compliment the Minister on his work in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs over the past five years. I think I heard him say he has implemented his sixth budget. If one looks at the record of different Ministers for Social, Community and Family Affairs during the years, one will find that very few remained in the Department for that length of time. Remaining in the Department for that length of time is good because continuity and the ability to implement one's own ideas and policies and the ideas and policies of different organisations are very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the &euro;850 million social welfare package announced in the budget, a substantial amount of money. It is important that it be spread across the different sectors pertaining <Col N="973" /> to social welfare to bring the key improvements required to those on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The limit in the means test for carer's allowance has been increased. There are now about 20,000 receiving payments compared to 9,000 in 1997. I am glad that we have moved on and that a substantial amount of the moneys available to the Government has been allocated to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>The Celtic tiger, about which we have heard so much in the past five years, brought many benefits to a wide sector of the community. I have been a Member of the Dáil since 1982. In the 1980s difficult decisions had to be and were made by different Governments. In that decade many on very low social welfare payments received very small increases. They made substantial sacrifices. It is only right that now in a time of plenty social welfare payments should be and have been increased to benefit those on disability benefit, old age pension, widower's allowance, unemployment assistance &ndash; including the long-term unemployed &ndash; and other groups which depend on social welfare. We should not have to make apologies to anybody for doing so. As I said, in the 1970s and 1980s the people concerned had to make significant sacrifices, as did those in employment, because jobs were very scarce and those who were working received very small wage increases at the time. Everyone had to tighten his or her belt. I compliment the Minister for recognising the role played by old age pensioners, in particular, in building the State and ensuring they now have a decent standard of living. I hope this will continue in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Substantial increases in child care and child minding costs have become an emotive issue in recent years. Substantially increasing child benefit rates is probably the best and fairest way of ensuring people can afford to pay for child minding. It is the most equitable system. I thank the Minister for more than trebling child benefit rates since 1997. I will not engage in bashing the last Government because what is most important is that we continue to increase substantially the payments for those in the social welfare system when moneys are available.</P>
    <P>The increase in the carer's allowance disregard has been very welcome with the result that the Minister has brought a substantial number of extra carers into the scheme. He stated there is to be further dialogue between the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Health and Children in terms of carer's allowance and keeping elderly persons at home and in the community. That is how it should be. We hear a lot of talk about the high costs involved in keeping them in hospital. One hears different figures, ranging from £1,000 to £5,000 per week. I do not know what the actual figure is, but every so often we read of the high costs in the newspapers.</P>
    <P>If there was a more user-friendly system operating between the Department of Social, <Col N="974" /> Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Health and Children in terms of carer's allowance, elderly persons would be able to stay in the community. More would be able to keep them at home. This needs to be addressed because the Department of Health and Children is dealing with certain aspects of the issue while the Department of the Environment and Local Government deals with disability grants. Local authorities have other responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I find that, in my local authority, it takes a long time to have an extra bedroom, a wheelchair-friendly toilet or shower system put in place. To get approval from a local authority can sometimes take one year. Frequently, elderly persons are not able to remain in their own home and have to enter a nursing home or geriatric hospital as a result. There should be far more communication between the relevant Departments and local authorities where social welfare is concerned. I welcome the fact that the Minister has instigated a study in this regard, but ask that reporting be done as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the initiative taken by the Minister in respect of the respite care grant which has given an opportunity to those minding the disabled or physically challenged people on a full-time basis to take a few weeks' holidays. I also welcome the increase this year which is very worthwhile. One has to be in receipt of carer's allowance, but there are persons just beyond the limit. I suppose that, no matter where one draws the line in creating a limit, there will be those who will not qualify. I came across a woman recently who has been minding her son for 27 years and has never had a holiday in that time. Her husband is in a reasonable, but not a great job. She does not qualify for the respite care grant. She tells me that she is about £10 over the limit to qualify for carer's allowance. As a result, she loses everything. Perhaps there should be a graduated payment. Certainly, in cases such as this, there is a need for less bureaucracy and a little more flexibility. If special cases are made, the Minister should be able to look at them.</P>
    <P>In my home town there is a group, in which I am involved, which is trying to establish a respite house. The Department of Health and Children is involved, as is the Department of the Environment and Local Government because one has to apply for grants through the local authority in respect of voluntary housing. The social welfare sector is involved with regard to respite care grants through the community grants system, etc. Again, there are three bodies involved which we are trying to pull together. It is very difficult at times to get all of them thinking at the one level.</P>
    <P>There is a need for respite care centres throughout the country in which parents could place their physically challenged children for a week or two while they go on holidays or do other things, such as attend a wedding. Certainly, when one sits down with those involved and hears their stories it is frightening at times to know that they are are minding a son or a daughter with <Col N="975" /> very little reward for practically 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Again, I praise the Minister for recognising that there was a need for a respite care grant and the need to increase it. I hope, even if one does not qualify for carer's allowance, there will be more flexibility to allow, in certain circumstances, payment of a respite care grant to allow people to take a holiday.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I have a problem with social welfare officers. For many years I have complained about the attitude of some social welfare officers. Some, particularly younger ones, act like little gods in their communities, hassling, harassing and putting enormous pressure on social welfare claimants. They appear to put particular pressure on people claiming benefit for the first time in years and who have been working all of their lives but, through no fault of their own, find themselves out of work. When, for example, applicants have to transfer from unemployment benefit to unemployment assistance they are subjected to unreal harassment and hassle and have to face mind-boggling bureaucratic nonsense. If they have received a modest redundancy payment they are obliged to produce documentary evidence of it, and receipts to show where it has been spent. There is a need for less bureaucratic nonsense from social welfare officers. It may be that they are obliged to behave in this way but their attitudes are often not client-friendly. I ask the Minister to examine this matter.</P>
    <P>Many farmers on small incomes are not aware of farm assist and family income supplement. I do not object to the Minister's campaigns to advertise the social welfare benefits or to seeing his photograph on leaflets. There may even be a need for another batch of advertisements to publicise farm assist and the family income supplement. A substantial number of people are not availing of these two schemes because they are not aware of them.</P>
    <P>Free telephone rental should be available to people who live in nursing homes. Deputy Ring has been vocal on this subject and I have written to the Department on the matter. Many residents of nursing homes have private rooms with a telephone. These residents enjoyed the free telephone rental while they lived in their own homes and it should not be too difficult to adjust the scheme to enable them to avail of it when in nursing homes. Mobile 'phones are costly. Despite the entry of a second provider in the Irish market there still appears to be a monopoly with regard to mobile 'phone charges.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny raised the question of free travel vouchers for old age pensioners and I raised this matter myself during the budget debate. In my constituency many people living in isolated areas do not avail of free bus travel. I have spoken to pensioners who have never used their free travel passes on a train or bus. How many of those who are entitled to free travel have never availed of it? A voucher system should be available to people in rural areas to pay a taxi or hack<Col N="976" /> ney. Many rural areas now have a mini-bus or hackney service and many people in my constituency pay between £7 and £10 to take them into Enniscorthy or Wexford every Friday to collect their pensions. People who can show they are unable to avail of free public transport should receive an annual payment which could be added to their pensions.</P>
    <P>In the past year there has been approximately 1,000 job losses in County Wexford. The statutory redundancy payment is very small and it is time for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to bring this payment up to date. It bears no relation to current wage and salary rates.</P>
    <P>Many of the 200 people who lost their jobs in Wexal in Enniscorthy last summer and sought the back-to-work or back-to-education allowances to set up their own businesses or to help them to become re-employed were told they did not qualify because they had not been long enough in receipt of social welfare payments. The system encourages people to remain unemployed to avail of back-to-work or back-to-education allowances. There should be more flexibility in this area. People want to get back to the work environment immediately. I know of people who worked in Wexal for 25 years and they are not people who are inclined to stay on social welfare. They want to get back to work and it is important that we encourage them in that. The obligation to remain unemployed for a period to avail of schemes should be examined by the Minister. He should examine this matter in conjunction with the updating of redundancy payments. The Ministers for Social, Community and Family Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment should come together to update redundancy payments and make qualification for the back-to-work and back-to-education allowances less bureaucratic.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the free fuel allowance. However, when the Minister returns to office after the general election I hope he will consider a further increase in this allowance. The increase is welcome but more is needed.</P>
    <P>Many groups have availed of the grants for voluntary and community groups. In my town major changes have been brought about by women's groups and others which have availed of grants from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. This grant system should continue but it should be made more flexible. Assessors of applicant groups could be more flexible and take account of the fact that many groups are operating in disadvantaged areas and are doing tremendous work. The Minister met members of the Templeshannon community development group from Enniscorthy when he visited Wexford last week. This group of women came together in a severely disadvantaged area and are providing much needed services, including computer, back-to-school and child care services. It is important that such groups be encouraged and further grants made available, perhaps in a less bureaucratic way. I thank the Minister for introducing the grant system. It is a worthwhile and innov<Col N="977" /> ative system which has been maintained by the past two or three Governments. I hope extra money will be made available to allow groups such as the Templeshannon group to continue and prosper in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill. The payments and the efficiency of the Department in dealing with public representatives have improved a great deal. I compliment the Minister and his Department on how they deal with parliamentary questions. The information sheet we receive on a regular basis is useful and makes it easier for Members to help their constituents. I have seen many changes since my election to the House and great progress has been made.</P>
      <P>The increases in child benefit are welcome. It is an important method of channelling funding to children, generally through the mother. The benefit has worked well in terms of eliminating poverty and channelling funding directly to where it is needed. For a long time the child benefit payment was low and it is probably still low compared to the UK. Hopefully, however, it is on an upward trend.</P>
      <P>Child benefit has been mentioned in connection with child care but if one is to hope that child benefit payments will cover the cost of child care, there is a long way to go. The recent increase of £25 per child would not keep a child in a crèche for one day a month. More needs to be done in the child care area. I do not wish to appear ungrateful but we need to be more imaginative in terms of developing more places and introducing quality assurance schemes. More needs to be done in addition to the existing child care regulations. I hope Fianna Fáil in the run-up to the next election will outline what it proposes to do in that area.</P>
      <P>Child care is still a serious concern, not just for women who work outside the home but for all parents. It is a constant headache trying to access affordable, reliable and efficient child care. It is a frustrating issue because it is affected by other Departments, such as the Department of Health and Children and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Everybody is aware of the difficulties involved in making planning applications, an area that needs to be streamlined.</P>
      <P>There should be a more imaginative approach. One of my party's proposals is consideration of a direct payment to child care providers or those working in the industry. Historically, it is a low pay industry. There are many courses available where young women, and some young men, secure qualifications in child care but when they discover how low the wages are in the industry they often leave the sector or go abroad. That is a shame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is accepted that we need to encourage more women into the workplace but we must do something imaginative to support those women and to ensure they have the necessary child care pro<Col N="978" /> vision. I carried out a small survey in this regard in my constituency recently. Many people told me their reason for not working outside the home was that they could not take the headache and stress of not having child care or of getting a telephone call on a Friday night to tell them the crèche is no longer operating or that the child minder will not be available to mind the children on Monday morning. What does one do? It is a concern for parents. Some are fortunate enough to have the option of not working outside the home but others have no choice because of their financial commitments.</P>
    <P>More must be done in this area. We are often told how well this area is managed in other European countries but we have a unique system in which other mothers will take in children and mind them. That is something we need to watch because much of it takes place in the black economy. Nobody condones that but at the same time we should not ride roughshod over a system that works well.</P>
    <P>The extension of paid and unpaid maternity leave is most welcome. If one can avail of unpaid leave, one can have up to six months maternity leave. It is difficult to go back to work when one has a very young baby. There are sleepless nights and the baby has not yet settled into a pattern. Ireland has one of the lowest breastfeeding rates in Europe so extending maternity leave will, hopefully, encourage breastfeeding. There has been pressure on mothers to go back to work when they and their babies are not ready, particularly if the mother wishes to continue breastfeeding the baby. The six months leave, for those who can avail of it, will be most welcome in that regard. It will also help women to remain in the workplace should they choose to do so.</P>
    <P>I put down a parliamentary question on paternity leave recently. Paternity leave is unpaid but it is a valuable and progressive measure introduced by the Minister. However, there is a low uptake of the leave according to the figures I received. Is that because people are unaware of it or because it is unpaid? It is a worthwhile provision and it is something that should be encouraged. It recognises that men have a strong role to play in the care and development of their children.</P>
    <P>The respite care grant is dealt with in the Bill. The carer's allowance is the subject of much correspondence to public representatives. A carers' group from my constituency visited the Dáil recently. Carers do valuable work for the community and the people being cared for. A number of speakers have made the important point that if carers were not available to care for dependent children, adult dependents or elderly parents or relatives, the State would not be able to cope. We all value the work of carers but they are frustrated and angry that their work and the contribution they make is not being recognised and does not have an independent value. A second income in the household is taken into consideration for payment of the allowance. That is <Col N="979" /> wrong. We should recognise carers and the valued contribution they make.</P>
    <P>The lack of respite care facilities is a problem. There is a respite care grant but accessing a respite care facility is extremely difficult. There are not many places available. It is probably easier for elderly parents. Disabled children and adults, however, find it extremely difficult to access respite places. Today there will be a march in Cork by parents of autistic children and their children. It is one of a series of protests. Today they are protesting against the lack of services like occupational and speech therapy. Another march will protest against the lack of respite care facilities. That must be dealt with. Many people cannot gain access to respite care facilities and much more needs to be done in this area. Disability groups have raised the issue of the lack of access to respite care.</P>
    <P>The position of widows has improved but young widows feel their needs are not recognised. I regularly meet young widows when I am canvassing. Their income is less than that of widows aged over 66. Young widows are in a difficult position as some of them still have dependants living at home with them. They feel they are not recognised because they cannot take up work given that they must care for their dependants. More should be done for widows aged under 66 and the free schemes should be extended to cover them. That would be an additional support in the difficult scenario in which they find themselves. They will obviously avail of child benefit if they are entitled to it. Young widows are on their own and they have the same expenses as any other adult who must keep a roof over his or her head and the heads of his or her dependants. An extension to them of the free schemes and free travel in particular, is worth considering.</P>
    <P>I live in an urban constituency and those who avail of free travel, particularly the elderly, cannot do so until 9.30 a.m. and are not able to avail of such travel between 4.30 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. Many must travel across Cork city to University Hospital Cork for appointments with consultants and doctors. Generally such appointments are early in the morning and in order to fulfil them, people must be on the road early and cannot avail of the free travel. I have spoken to representatives of Bus Éireann who say the reason for this is capacity and they must make seats available for people who travel to work. However, people who are entitled to free travel feel aggrieved about this, particularly if they can prove they have a doctor's appointment and have a reason to travel early in the morning. There should be flexibility in this regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the free fuel scheme, which had not been addressed for a long time. Perhaps the Minister will consider extending the scheme to cover some of the summer months because the weather during the summer is not great. Quite often the months of May, June and <Col N="980" /> August can be cool and elderly people need extra heat. An extension of the scheme would not be a huge burden on the Exchequer. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility to work out something in this area.</P>
    <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Belton.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Clune for sharing time. I will refer only to the carer's allowance and, in particular, to cases where the carer and the person being cared for do not live together. The Minister amended the scheme so that the carer did not have to live with the person being cared for in order to qualify for the allowance and that was fair. There are cases where people who live adjacent to those they care for are allowed to avail of the scheme and that makes a great deal of sense but there is a problem with the terms of reference of the scheme, which is regularly pointed out by social welfare inspectors. They state the person being cared for must be in receipt of full-time care. I hope the Minister will refer to this when he replies.</P>
      <P>The inspectors are people of the world and they want to help claimants but they are in a dilemma. Full-time care is now defined in terms of a certain number of hours but I will not go into that. However, I am aware of two cases which are under appeal and I am annoyed and upset because the people involved are genuinely providing care to elderly people living beside them while looking after their own families. They call on the elderly people they care for in the morning and help to ready them for the day. They return at lunch time and in the evening to ensure the elderly people are all right. This means the elderly people can stay in their own homes and they are provided with a caring service. The Minister and his officials can argue that person should be cared for on a full-time basis but that is not practical because in many cases those who are cared for do not need care 100% of the time.</P>
      <P>The people to whom care is provided are medically certified to qualify under the scheme. The medical certificate states clearly they have qualified under the scheme but there is still an anomaly because the person giving them care does not qualify for the carer's allowance because they are not providing care 100% of the time. However, we are not dealing with machines. We cannot be rigid when we are dealing with the needs of people who are vulnerable and who have been medically certified as being in need of care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is a good man to give messages as he has spent the past three months doing so. I want him to give a directive to his staff that in circumstances where a person has been medically approved for care under the scheme and a carer is available adjacent to that person, the Department will be more flexible regarding the regulations and will be totally on the side of the person who is being cared for. There is more emphasis on regulation than on people. There is no doubt the Department has to operate within regulations but I am highlighting a dilemma that exists for carers. <Col N="981" /> From a humanitarian point of view, if a person qualifies on a medical basis for care under the scheme and a carer is available nearby everything should be done so ensure he or she receives an allowance under the scheme.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Clune for allowing me to raise this urgent matter. I have two cases pending under this scheme and I hope the Minister will live up to his word. He is good man for giving out messages and, therefore, I hope he gives out the right message in these circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are further good messages in regard to the increases in child benefit and respite care grants. I hope Opposition Members will not be whipped into the House to vote against these increases later, as they were when the increases for the elderly were put before the House. I particularly welcome the increases but I also welcome the changes to the social welfare code and the register of births and deaths Act. We have now come in from the dark ages and this area is to be computerised, which was long overdue. This will make life easier for the staff involved whom I compliment in particular those who deal with Deputies' queries. They have always been most helpful and the modernised system will facilitate them.</P>
      <P>Other Deputies have mentioned the Government's record on various issues. This Minister has a record second to none. Later, I will compare his record with that of the so-called rainbow Administration. As we improve the circumstances of many groups, certain anomalies will arise. The Minister needs to keep an eye on these and be flexible enough to move speedily to ensure justice is done and people benefit, as they need. A special case must be made for young widows and this area should be reviewed.</P>
      <P>In the past many people on the doorsteps complained about the treatment of social welfare recipients, whereby announcements were made on budget day but payments would only be made four, five or six months later. The final proposed budget of the rainbow coalition would have pushed these payments out to October, which would have been disgraceful. However, people have now been paid in January and this has been very widely welcomed. I know some catching up is required this year and it took six weeks to adjust computer systems for the euro changeover, etc. Although it has been expensive to implement this, it is the people's money and they are entitled to it. I praise the Minister and the Government for this welcome change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any administration must be responsible in allocating funds and dealing with its work. It must ensure funding is available for all payments. This administration has worked very diligently with all sectors of society, the farming community, business, industry and commerce to have people work to get money into central coffers for such payments and not to let us run into debt. I deeply resented the hypocritical comments made last week by one of the leaders of the Opposition, <Col N="982" /> Deputy Noonan, about setting up a sanitary department within Government to clean up after a Fianna Fáil led administration. He made a grossly unfair reference to the past, but when we refer to the record, we are accused of mismanaging historical facts.</P>
    <P>In October 1986, four years into an administration including Deputy Michael Noonan, and after the supposed clean up, this country had the worst debt ratio per head on the planet. It was worse than banana republics, Third World countries or anybody whose economy had been monitored and counted. Our debt ratio was 126% of GDP and we were technically bankrupt. With modern trading laws, if the country were a company it would be prosecuted. It was grossly irresponsible. In October 1986, there were 232,400 unemployed people. The preliminary report of the 1986 census, published by the CSO, an independent body, showed emigration stood at its highest rate for 20 years. The figures indicated the net outflow of people had increased by 31,000 since 1981 and 1982 when Fianna Fáil was in Government.</P>
    <P>I do not like mentioning such historical facts &ndash; we should be up to date. There is great news in the facts of this year, last year and the previous one. However that scandalous statement got significant attention and I can understand why the people are deemed to be cynical about political statements. I have quoted CSO figures and we were all concerned at that time. People said we could not recover from that, but a Fianna Fáil led administration did help us and we got the Tallaght strategy and other things. By any economic measurement, we were bankrupt at the time and I resent being told that Deputy Noonan or anybody else came in and cleaned up.</P>
    <P>Although we should not forget the great improvements that have taken place, I will continue to make a case for people. The carer's allowance was ineffective before the time of the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern. The benefits are now huge and the increase in the respite grant was critical. These measures will benefit 21,000 carers and will cost an additional &euro;3 million. There are various estimates of the number of full-time carers &ndash; I have heard figures up to 100,000. A detailed analysis of this should be carried out to determine who needs financial assistance. The argument against eliminating a means test is that we need to target what money is available. I accept that its complete abolition would cost an estimated &euro;132 million in a full year. I look forward to the day when we can announce the abolition of that means test. For years, I campaigned to abolish the means test for old age pensioners because it was degrading. People who had contributed all their lives deserved better treatment from the State. I will campaign to abolish the means test when we can afford it.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the work of the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern. He is fully entitled to put his picture on any advertisement that goes out. Those of us who have been here since the mid <Col N="983" /> 1980s have seen how slowly the improvements were made before he came to office. I am very pleased with him. I agree with my constituency colleague, Deputy Clune, that young widows are a special category because they have large outgoings such as home heating, education and transport costs. Improvements have been made since the time Deputy Woods was Minister for Social Welfare. He took a special interest in that area and worked with them.</P>
    <P>We must be innovative in the way we deal with issues. We must deal with the issue of free travel in rural areas where people are isolated. Modern society is changing. There were times when people were happy to make their own entertainment in places such as Glencar or the Black Valley in Kerry. Society revolved around a game of cards, such as &ldquo;45&rdquo; or &ldquo;110&rdquo;, and a couple of bottles of stout. However, society has changed and we must move with the times. People now go to community halls five, ten or 15 miles away. We are working to provide satellite day care and health centres. Large sums of money are being spent, but we must be able to transport people to these places. Great changes have been made, but people must have a vision. I think it was Mick O'Connell's wife, who is a nurse on Valentia Island, who got the first social welfare funds for a minibus. The drivers were employed on a community employment scheme. They looked for the same money which would be given to CIE for free travel and they felt it was justified. Such methods should be used throughout the country. The community and the voluntary sector are willing to get involved in the provision of school buses, etc. There will be full support from the Administration for it.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are concerned about old age pensioners are happy about what is happening. People were whipped in to vote against the 10% increase for the elderly, which was scandalous when one considers what Deputy De Rossa gave when he had responsibility for that area. The rainbow coalition increased old age contributory pensions by 9.9% during its term in office. The present Administration increased them by 48.7%. People will talk about inflation, but the rainbow coalition increased the old age contributory pension by only 4% in one year. The current Administration increased it by 23.9%. Those are real increases. We can deal with inflation. Arguments will still be made for further increases. However, we must be willing to target specific areas, such as those who need transport and special food. The rainbow coalition increased non-contributory old age pensions by 10.7% during its term in office, while the current Administration increased them by 85.3%. I am proud of that achievement.</P>
    <P>I had to circulate a newsletter to my constituents about the increases because the Opposition argued they were not real. As soon as the budget was announced in each of the past three years my Opposition colleagues in the constituency were <Col N="984" /> out of the traps before me. I was thrilled they spoke to the people about what the Government had given them because it meant I did not have to do all the work. They outlined the percentage increase and it made my job easier. I welcomed that because it took the pressure off me. The news is so good they are anxious to be the first to tell it. That is happening in almost every constituency. I hope it will be the same during the next Administration.</P>
    <P>We all remember when the half crown was taken out of circulation, but the one change that will be remembered more than any is the 9.9% increase in old age contributory pensions by the rainbow coalition. I am glad the individuals involved are still here to take responsibility, although the party has merged. Left and right have now come together. I stand over the figure of 48.7%. There was an increase of 2.5% in 1995, 3% in 1996 and 4% in 1997. We are pleased with our achievement because if we cannot do it for our elderly, we will not do it for anyone. We will publish all the information in the next six or eight weeks and we will do the best we can.</P>
    <P>I will be pleased if we are back in Government after the next election. The general consensus is that we have done well. I compliment the Administration rather than one individual. If the worst criticism which can be levelled at a person is that he or she is willing to identify with his or her portfolio and the increases he or she is granting, it says a lot for the individual. I could not have imagined Deputy De Rossa putting his picture on a leaflet telling people they will get £1.20 a week. If the greatest gripe against the Minister is that his picture appears on leaflets, I hope he continues for a long time in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I thank the staff of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for the manner in which they deal with all the correspondence from my constituency. They provide an exceptional service. The same is true in the local offices. The last time I spoke on a social welfare Bill I complimented the inspectorate on the appeals system. I have visited that area on many occasions since the last Bill was enacted and I compliment it on its independence and the way it treats the people who must use that unfortunate part of the Department. It deals with each case effectively and in a civil manner and it gives the applicant every opportunity to make his or her case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Opportunities have arisen because of the economic upturn for the Minister and the Department to be given a large slice of the cake. I compliment the Minister on seizing the opportunity to improve the lives of those in a sector of our community which has been in need of financial benefits for many years. Deputy Dennehy spoke about previous problems, but the finance was not available in the past. The finances were not as good a number of years ago as they are now. I am sure that when Ministers were dealing with social wel<Col N="985" /> fare issues then, they had to fight at the Cabinet table to get as much as they could and they did that to the best of their ability.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the e-Cabinet initiative is to deploy information and communications technologies, ICTs, to enable Cabinet support services to be managed more efficiently and effectively. The initiative has progressed well. Consultants were engaged to identify opportunities to apply technologies to the Cabinet process. Provision was made for consultation with key stakeholders. Based on the research and consultation and working closely with the Cabinet secretariat in my Department, the consultants have set out a model for an electronic cabinet system and have identified the considerable benefits which will result. The report of the consultants, published recently, drew on the experiences of key stakeholders, including Ministers and Secretaries General, and was prepared in close collaboration with the Cabinet secretariat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report places particular emphasis on the scope for electronic management of Cabinet papers. For example, it proposes that memoranda for Government, the Cabinet agenda, Government decisions, etc. will in future be disseminated electronically. This will result in greater speed and efficiency in the process. Another important aspect of the initiative is that document structures will be examined to see how complex proposals might be presented more effectively at Cabinet. This will involve changes in the structure of memoranda for Government so that key data are presented up front, the use of embedded audio visual material where that would be helpful and other enhancements of a similar type. The Cabinet guidelines will be incorporated into the memorandum drafting processes throughout Departments so that anyone drafting a memorandum will be guided through those requirements. The project will also electronically support and help to speed up the consultation process which takes <Col N="986" /> place between Departments as memoranda are drafted.</P>
    <P>The new documents structures will be designed so that they will be more accessible on screen. This will impact on all users but especially on Ministers who will have the option of dispensing with some or all of the existing paper based memoranda in favour of screen based ones. The challenge is not just to make documents available electronically at Cabinet meetings, but to present them in a way which overcomes the difficulties normally associated with reading lengthy documents on screen. The report envisages the use of web enabled documents to address this. Additionally, the technology to be deployed at the Cabinet table will support functions other than accessing Cabinet documents. For example, Ministers will be able to send and receive e-mail during meetings and departmental briefing can also be provided on line for each Minister. The introduction of technologies to the Cabinet table will be carried out in a way which respects the culture within which those meetings take place, specifically that they will not dominate the human interactions which are at the heart of the process.</P>
    <P>These are some of the key features of the model. The project is now proceeding to implementation and the next step, on which my Department is now working, is to retain expertise to progress the detailed design of the system with a view to producing a prototype in early 2003 and progressing to full deployment thereafter. As implementation progresses, issues of training will be addressed and will involve all users. This is a flagship Government e-initiative. It will be co-ordinated with other key initiatives to ensure the necessary synergies are achieved, for example by sharing infrastructure and by using standard software authoring tools across Departments and processes.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that I undertook to provide for briefing on the project for the main parties. I am pleased that Deputy Quinn was able to avail of this opportunity and I will be happy to arrange a similar briefing for Deputy Noonan if he wishes. The text of the full report, as recently published, is available on my Department's website and copies have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply. With regard to his last sentence, I wondered if I had missed something when he said the report had been published but, obviously, it has not yet been circulated and I do not recall it coming across my desk. Not having seen the report but having heard the Taoiseach's summary, do I understand correctly that the next stage is for wider consultation to take place with the end users of this process, which we welcome and support? Will the Taoiseach outline what consultation will take place? The Government Chief Whip and Minister of State at the Taoiseach's Department consulted all parties in this House in relation to the reforms recently announced. It was the product of that inter-work<Col N="987" /> ing group, rather than the Government initiative, that brought about those reforms. Since the present incumbents around the Cabinet table will not be there after the next general election, the way in which this system is introduced has to apply to all potential Cabinet seat occupiers and not just the present group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I already made it clear that the process to date and the consultants' report drew on the experience of all the key stakeholders, including Ministers and Secretaries General. It was prepared in close collaboration with the Cabinet secretariat which has the responsibility of co-ordinating and providing the information. The report placed particular emphasis on the scope for electronic management of Cabinet papers, including memoranda for Government, the Cabinet agenda, Government decisions and dissemination of information before and after meetings. In reply to Deputy Quinn's point with regard to the benefits of the system and consultation about it, full consultation can take place if he wishes, including a full demonstration of the system by the consultants before they move on to the next stage of building a model, which will take about a year. It will probably take about another year to achieve full implementation. If the Deputy wishes, I will go through some of the benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it envisaged that the physical furniture of the Cabinet room &ndash; the Cabinet table in particular &ndash; will be specifically designed to have built-in screens if, as the Taoiseach indicated, the culture of the meetings &ndash; the phrase used in the report &ndash; is not to be obstructed or in any way inhibited by the introduction of e-Cabinet facilities? Will there be laptop computers on the table of the Cabinet room or will screens be built into the Cabinet table, with all that entails? Has that point been reached in the evolution of this project? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The detailed design stage has not yet been reached but the system will involve built-in screens. There are existing models of the system, as used by corporate boards and other organisations. The ECOFIN Council is moving rapidly towards the use of this system and there was a trial run at a meeting of the European Council &ndash; with not quite the same enthusiasm, I might add. The system uses built-in screens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the new system require more space in the Cabinet room? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be fitted in quite neatly, using recessed and slanted screens. Obviously, the new system will require a period of adjustment. The preparatory work to date indicates that a great deal of paper can be eliminated, though, perhaps, not all of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However it will take some time to change the culture. People who have been involved in this <Col N="988" /> work and work elsewhere believe it can happen fairly quickly. It will probably take another year on design stage and building the system and probably another year in implementation but that is not long. The work they have done over the past three years has been enormous. They are changing a system that is 60 or 70 years old. They have highlighted the benefits and spent a great deal of time looking at security and other aspects. They are happy, confident and comfortable that they can achieve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the initiative seems to be to ensure that citizens have access to State services but, unless broadband facilities are available throughout the State at the same rates, any such provision will be provided unequally among citizens and the national service will be incapable of that provision. Could the Taoiseach report once more on the roll out of affordable broadband services in all parts of the country, particularly outside the greater Dublin area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These questions are just on the e-Cabinet proposals. There are many other issues that are current but, if the Ceann Comhairle wishes, I will address this. The work begun by the interdepartmental group which started last September is now complete. There will be meetings this week about the next move and the means of moving forward. As I have already explained, the State will have to be directly involved in this. The group is looking at a three year plan as part of a longer term plan for rolling it out. It is clear the private sector might assist &ndash; they have had all the consultation meetings I spoke about the last time &ndash; but the State will have to do part of the funding.</P>
      <P>The report, which will be out shortly, explains how this system can be best dealt with and the kind of competition that will be required to run it. It will not be rolled out all over the country &ndash; it is not in any other country &ndash; but the intention is to try it out in a number of areas, using different technologies such as fibre optics, DSL and other systems and schemes. They will try out about 20 different areas and try and build on it from there. The report will be issued in March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the e-Cabinet project the Taoiseach, in his initial reply, suggested that it would be possible in the future &ndash; and possibly the practice &ndash; that Government memoranda would be constructed electronically and that Departments would consult with each other on an electronic basis. If we consider the records that will be kept for historical purposes for the archives, how can he ensure that there is a final hardback copy and that historians in the future can see the development of policy and the input by various Departments because, as memoranda are altered on the screen, the previous copy disappears and only the latest copy remains? Does an issue arise here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" />The Taoiseach refers to the electronic transfer of memoranda to screens for each Minister at the Cabinet table. In circumstances such as that, how will the Cabinet minutes be kept which are so essential to the work of Government? Will they be kept electronically or on hard copy?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First, a comprehensive electronic archive will result from this, facilitating the creation of new information resources. This is seen as one of the great plusses by those who have worked on this project where this archive can be used for new information sources and purposes and for research by historians in the future. It is already being used in many areas so that people can access records.</P>
      <P>In relation to the change in process, my note says we are still working out whether each stage of the draft will actually be changed or whether we keep a record as we go through. I wonder if that will matter so much because people will look back at the content of the memoranda to find what is finally decided. The basis of the work to date is that it must comply with the cabinet handbook procedure provisions in authorising the memoranda so anything the handbook says will have to form the basis of the system.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Noonan's last point about the documents on screen, the whole idea is to move, over time, to a paperless society so that the minutes, the agenda and everything else will be electronic. I can see much of the paper being eliminated early on but it will be a few years before we get to the end result using no paper. The wizards behind the process believe it can move to a paper free system. As people get into this system, see the benefits and are trained in it &ndash; which will be an important aspect &ndash; they will take to it quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are six members of staff seconded to the communications unit: one from my Department <Col N="990" /> and five from other Departments. A seventh member of staff transferred to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in early January and no replacement has yet been appointed. As the Deputy is well aware, the Civil Service works for the Government of the day and does not have any remit in terms of providing a service to Members of the Oireachtas. Therefore, I have no plans to extend the services of the communications unit to Members of the House.</P>
    <P>The staff of the communications unit are subject to the usual conventions which apply to civil servants in relation to political impartiality in their work, whether at election time or otherwise. I am satisfied that they will continue to observe these conventions throughout any election period and to this end they will be instructed to continue to deal with Departments on the same basis as before the election, in support of this ongoing work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will recall that we had discussions before on this political unit paid for by the taxpayer in the Department of the Taoiseach &ndash; a political unit as decided by the Office of the Information Commissioner. We know that the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is a candidate in the forthcoming general election because we have seen his advertisements &ndash; paid for by the taxpayer &ndash; in the Department's information. Can the Taoiseach confirm that all other members of the Government are candidates in the forthcoming general election? </P>
      <P>Can he confirm that this unit will supply Ministers, on a daily basis throughout the course of the general election campaign, with a news digest of what has been published that day relevant to their Departments? Can he confirm that that news digest would, for example, cover a press release from a Labour Party conference in the course of a campaign highlighting the failure of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government with responsibility for housing and that this unit would take a transcript or précis of that press conference early in the morning and remit it to the private secretary in the Minister's Department so that Minister could then issue some kind of attempted rebuttal or response?</P>
      <P>If the Taoiseach can confirm that the people in question will be candidates in the election, that the six civil servants &ndash; whose gross cost is &euro;300,000 &ndash; will be collating information pertinent to the affairs of the Department and communicating it to the candidate who happens to be the Minister enabling the Minister to respond in whatever way he or she might want to, would he agree that this is a unit which, during an election campaign, is manifestly political in its impact and operational effect? Does he not agree that he should stand down the communications unit during the course of the election campaign?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with most of what the Deputy said. It is not a political unit and not staffed with political people. It is not undertaking a political function, but noting the news reports of the day. It would not give detailed reports on Labout Party press conferences. Press offices in Departments have such a responsibility in their everyday work. In the previous Government none of the press offices was closed down, nor was anybody moved out when Deputy Quinn was involved.</P>
      <P>The projected annual cost of the unit is half what the Deputy said, &euro;156,000. Its job is non-political and is of no great help to anyone other than in noting news reports. It certainly would not be of any great benefit to a Minister who is a general election candidate. He or she would use his or her party political press offices for the kind of information about which the Deputy is talking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach, once again, that the function of this group of civil servants is to gather information, digest news reports published during the day, as reported in the national media, both print and live, and communicate it where it is of interest to the relevant Ministers. If there is a press conference in the course of an election campaign by any of the Opposition parties which criticises the lamentable performance of any of the Government Ministers &ndash; sadly one would have many from which to select &ndash; this will, in the course of events, be communicated to the relevant Minister, who is a candidate.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that anything pertaining to the activities of a Department will be monitored by the unit and conveyed directly or indirectly to the candidate concerned who happens to be a Minister? That is manifestly political during the course of an election campaign, whatever the Taoiseach's protestations about its function prior to the commencement of an election campaign. It behoves him in the light of the restrictions on expenditure to stand down the unit during the course of an election campaign, otherwise, from the legal advice we have received, it should be included in the spending guidelines for all affected candidates.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would do it now, but not during a general election. I said Civil Service convention would be followed. It stipulates that during an election campaign civil servants should not engage in such work, but the practice has been that those involved in Departments would be so engaged. Such civil servants do and have been engaged, which is a different matter. The people concerned do not have a political function in any way.</P>

In making a statement on the forthcoming referendum he said they had been contacted yesterday evening by a <Col N="993" /> Government representative looking for a copy of the statement in advance of the press conference today.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Taoiseach on this matter and neither of us can be proven right. The Taoiseach states this facility in respect of news gathering and monitoring, which is paid for by the taxpayer, is staffed by civil servants who are not politically partisan. To put the issue beyond any doubt, since the Taoiseach is asserting that it is non-political and non-partisan, I propose that all election candidates should be circulated with information from this service or else it should be stood down. It can be either one or the other, but the Taoiseach cannot have it both ways. It cannot be said the gathering of news relevant to the main stories of the day is not central to the very essence of a political campaign. If the Taoiseach insists it is not political, which I cannot accept, the only reasonable compromise would be to circulate the information to every candidate and let us all benefit, otherwise the essence of having a level playing pitch is not maintained.</P>

      <P>I know the Deputy is not being serious. Why did his office in the Department of Finance under the previous Administration, which was staffed by civil servants, not stand down and how could they continue to act as well as all the other Departments? Not one civil servant stood down during the last election campaign.</P>

There are 14 key decision makers <Col N="994" /> across the divisions in my Department who are mainly at assistant principal level.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are two assistant secretaries and four principal officers who are authorised to conduct internal reviews where requested under the Act.

      <P>On a number of occasions I have put it to the Taoiseach that there should be guidelines in place to ensure there is a standardised form of record keeping by civil servants to ensure the Freedom of Information Act operates to full effect. I have not received a straight answer on the Taoiseach's view on this matter. Are guidelines being drawn up as to what records are kept and in what manner civil servants should keep them in order that the Freedom of Information Act should operate to full effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue has come up a number of times in the past year or two since the Act came into force. Under the Act decision makers are independent in the exercise of their functions. The Act provides for internal review and subsequent appeal to the commissioner. I do not have a role in the processing of individual requests.</P>
      <P>An independent review by the commissioner does not support the contention that there is a difficulty with the keeping of records. The information commissioner's report, Compliance by Public Bodies with the Freedom of Information Act, which was published some months ago, described its investigation of 12 public bodies. It noted there was no evidence that less detailed information was being recorded and that the culture of secrecy has not been replaced by a culture of non-recording of information. In every Department and agency, each individual may have his or her own format of recording information, but the commissioner has not seen a need to recommend that changes be made to the old systems of filing and departmental practice. Across the Civil Service, different rules and regulations apply in different areas, but the keeping of records is more or less standard and has been since the 1956 Act.</P>

      <P>The working group completed its work with the publication of its report in March of last year. The final report was a culmination of extensive research into the broad implications of the introduction of a basic income. I emphasise that it was not the role of the group to make recommendations either for or against the introduction of a specific form of a basic income system. The group concluded that the research represented a significant move forward in our understanding of the complex issues involved.</P>
      <P>As already announced, my Department has been preparing a Green Paper that will build on the work of the group. An initial draft of the Green Paper has been completed by the Department and is being examined with a view to its early finalisation in consultation with other relevant Departments.

Asked more recently, he made a commitment to publish it at the end of January, which has just ended. Is there to be a fourth breach of promise on this matter, or can he give us a publication date which will not alter thereafter?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To correct the Deputy, the working group published its report last March, almost one year ago. That report addressed the very technical and complex issues that arise from the concept of a basic income. Those issues include the distribution effect, the impact on lab<Col N="996" /> our supply, the impact on economic growth and competitiveness. They must all be considered carefully. The task of taking these issues, evaluating the likely effects of introducing the system and of putting the arguments in a Green Paper fell to my Department. We said at the outset that we hoped it could be done in six months but, as I reported to the House previously, the same people were involved in much of the other PPF work and that delayed them.</P>
      <P>I said they would try to publish in January, but what they are doing has proved to be very difficult. It is very wide-ranging and complex and the sort of system under review does not exist elsewhere. There is no other model to go on and all they can do is to look at and set out the advantages and disadvantages. They are doing their utmost to accomplish that and they will publish as soon as possible. I certainly intend to publish it, but hard-pressed officials are working on something that has not been examined before and are trying to build on what they received less than a year ago, while still carrying on their other work. That has proven to be an enormous task, but they will finish it as soon as possible.</P>

Is it true to say there is a reluctance in the Cabinet, particularly on the part of the Attorney General, to publish this document? Given the reticence about guaranteed basic income among some members of the Government, is it something we are going to see before the general election? Will we have the chance to discuss it in the House before the election takes place?</P>

      <P>That is my intention. I have done a great deal of work on this in the past few years and Deputy Sargent has taken much interest in it. I have got it to this stage and I want to see it finished. The only difficulty is that the people involved are attempting something that has not been done anywhere before. They have to take the distributional impacts and describe the advantages and disadvantages in a fair way. There is no other agenda. It is an interesting project, but not an easy one. They are trying to be fair in terms of arguments for and against the proposal and are trying to make sense of the issues in a way that will be useful to the public.</P>

      <P>The modernisation programme in the Department supports the achievement of the Department's goals as set out in the recently published strategy statement for the period to end 2003. The strategy statement identifies objectives to be met in relation to each strategic priority, emphasising expected outcomes. The objectives for the Department are implemented through the business plans developed at division and section level and individuals' objectives are agreed as part of the performance management and development system.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the Department's modernisation programme, based on the key modernisation objectives outlined in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, are to position the Department to meet the ongoing changes in the external environment, to provide an excellent service to customers, to maintain a strategic focus on the Department's role and functions, to ensure the provision of leadership and co-ordination across key areas of Government policy and to work in partnership with departmental staff to effect the required changes. In accordance with the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, my Department has submitted performance indicators for its modernisation programme, developed through the internal partnership process, to the independent Civil Service quality assurance group. Specific actions and target dates, across all aspects of modernisation, are covered by the Department's performance indicators. My Department will submit a report to the quality assurance group after 1 April, which will outline progress in achieving its performance indicators. The group will then make an independent assessment of each Department's progress in meeting the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness objectives in relation to the modernisation agenda, including progress made by my Department.</P>
      <P>Progress has been made on each of the key indicators. As I indicated in my reply to this question on 27 November, a change management unit has been established to support the implementation of the modernisation programme.</P>
      <P>All staff have attended a presentation on the performance management system and comprehensive training courses are ongoing. As a further support for staff, career development training is currently under way, focusing on the development of the core competencies identified for the Department. A customer action plan for 2001 to 2004 has been published and made available on my Department's website, informed by the results of customer surveys. An extensive sample customer survey was undertaken in February 2001, which showed very positive results with 90% to 100% of customers regarding the levels of service as either good, very good or excellent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has been involved in providing central co-ordination and impetus to the Information Society and e-Public Service agenda. Internally, it has prepared its e-strategy and is engaged in a number of e-Government projects, <Col N="998" /> notably the e-Cabinet project and the upgrading of the website.</P>
    <P>Work is under way on a number of human resource management initiatives, including the re-orientation of the human resource function, the upgrading of training facilities and the development of an integrated human resource strategy and staff development plan. A survey was recently issued to all staff as part of the consultative process for the plan. In addition, a gender equality policy for the Department has been agreed as part of the partnership process and circulated to all staff.</P>
    <P>My Department is among the leading Departments in implementing the new management information framework. A new financial management computer system has been selected and is scheduled to be implemented in July 2002. The approach used by my Department has since been adopted as a model by a number of other Departments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that was in 1997. The statements, the programmes and the modernisation schemes are now well under way. However, there is an ongoing requirement in the Civil Service for training and retraining. Due to the level of technology and the fact that the Civil Service is now engaged with its customers and is working on strategy statements, people are having an input into what they do. They are not being told in the old ways. Their mission statements have been set down. It is an entirely different culture under the Public Service Management Act and the amount of engagement by staff, at all levels and in all grades, is enormous.</P>
      <P>As I set out in my reply, the modernisation programme is in place, not for the good of its health but to support the Department in its objectives. Equally, it is there to make the job more interesting for public servants in order that they feel part of and have an influence in the programme.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that it is 100% perfect in my Department or in other Departments, but the strategic management initiative and what has happened in the past decade since it started is certainly making it far more interesting and far more technologically driven than most people would probably have thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" />There is still quite a good deal of work to do. In my Department, since the start of the year people have been doing training on all of these issues, bringing them up to date with new strategies. That has a good motivational effect on the Department and on civil servants, not only on younger ones but on civil servants generally throughout the ranks. It helps them in their objectives to improve their careers and go for interviews and try to improve themselves, and it gives them an involvement. It is all part of both doing the job for the Government and for the people, but also helping the staff to play a role in what their job is about. There had been a criticism in the public service that nobody ever explains things but they do now.</P>

I propose to circulate in the Official Report, a table setting out the available figures on the number of farms of at least one hectare between 1985 and 1999. More recent figures will soon be available when the results of the Census of Agriculture, taken in June 2000, are published in April.</P>

      <Quest>when she intends to use the powers available to her under the Television Without Frontiers Directive and the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act, 1999, to designate certain sporting and cultural events as being of major importance to society to ensure there is no repeat of the recent situation where the Ireland v. England rugby international at Twickenham was unavailable to the majority of Irish television viewers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6840/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my response to Question No. 349 of 12 February 2002, the Television Without Frontiers Directive, as amended by EU Council Directive 97/36/EC, provides that member states may designate certain sporting and cultural events as being of major importance to society and take steps to ensure events so designated are available on free-to-air television services.</P>
      <P>The EU Council directive places an obligation on member states to provide in national legislation the statutory basis for the designation of events as being of major importance to society and which should be available on free-to-air television services. The directive does not place an obligation on member states to designate any event. Ireland's obligation under the directive was fulfilled through legislation promoted by me, that is, the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act, 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under that legislation, I have the power to designate a list of events which in the public interest should be available on free-to-air television. In drawing up such a list I am obliged by the Act to consult the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. In addition, I must consult the organisers of the events and broadcasters who are under the jurisdiction of the State. This, in turn, must be followed by a wider consultation process in respect of any event I intend to designate. It is only then that a draft order designating an event or events can be brought before the Oireachtas <Col N="1004" /> for approval. Any list drawn up must be compatible with EU law.</P>
    <P>My Department has engaged in consultation with the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation on the question of drawing up a list of events to be designated and a consultation process with the major sporting organisations in this country has taken place. It is clear from the consultation process that the drawing up of a list of events is a very complex matter. Some sporting organisations have argued against designation of the major events they organise on the basis that it could impact negatively on their finances and, consequently, on the development of the games, especially at club level. It must be recognised that the television rights to the events are owned by the individual organisations. The possible negative impact of designation on sporting organisations has to be considered and balanced against the public interest of certain events being available on free-to-air television.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>The issues involved are, therefore, complex but are being addressed in an appropriate, consultative and democratic manner. Consultation with the sporting organisations and with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation is ongoing. When these consultations are concluded, I will be in a position to make a decision regarding a list of events.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree she has not made any real progress in two years and that it is unacceptable that the legislation balances citizens' rights against the finances of sporting organisations? What guarantee can she give the House of substantial progress being made and the draft order for sporting events coming before the House within the lifetime of the Government? We facilitated the Minister in the enactment of the legislation to which she referred. We recently experienced the first traumatic event as a result of her inaction with the loss of the England-Ireland rugby match. Does the Minister agree the sporting organisations have said &ldquo;no&rdquo;, that she has backed off and, in so doing, has damaged citizens' rights to free-to-air access to important sporting events?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy's contention. It is slightly disingenuous to say work has not been done on this given that the Government ensured the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act was enacted in 1999. The Deputy will be aware that, under that Act, there must be proper consultation by me with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, the organisers of the events, broadcasters, the wider public and the Oireachtas to ensure any list is compatible with EU law. I inform the Deputy, if he does not already know, that the major sports organisations with which I have had consultations have been against a designated list. In such circumstances one must try to <Col N="1005" /> reach proper agreement by way of consultation, which will take time. The Deputy seems to be of the view that one could draw up a list without such consultation. However, consultation must take place under existing legislation. If agreement cannot be reached, a list could still be drawn up, but in such circumstances the process could face a legal challenge from an event organiser or organisers. Accordingly, it is possible no event would be designated.</P>
      <P>I also refer to the Ireland <i>v.</i> England game. As Deputies will be aware, the British Government has drawn up a designated A and B list of events. The game to which I referred was included on the B list, but that did not mean it would be available for live coverage on free-to-air television. Being on the B list ensured it would not be available for live coverage on free-to-air television in Britain either.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember that this is a very complex issue. Only four member states, Italy, Germany, Britain and Austria have published a list of designated events to date. In November 1998 the Danish Government made an order, which was amended in August 2001, designating certain events. However, in early 2002 it decided to revoke that order with effect from 1 January 2002. There is a small number of countries which have designated events because of the complexity of the matter.</P>

      <P>I received two principal reports in this context during 2001 relating to a proposed site at Grand Canal Harbour and a more general evaluation of options for redeveloping the theatre. I did not pass these reports to the board of the Abbey, but the authors met representatives of the theatre in the course of preparing both reports. My officials would also have briefed theatre representatives on their broad conclusions. I met the chairman and members of the Abbey board last week and explained to them the basis for the Government decision to support the redevelopment of the theatre on its existing site. At that meeting the chairman of the Abbey board welcomed the Government decision.</P>
      <P>This matter will be progressed in close consultation and co-operation with the board of the Abbey at all stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that this decision was arrived at by her and her Cabinet colleagues with minimum consultation, discussion and debate with the Abbey board and all of us? She referred to the two reports commissioned by her Department on the future of the Abbey and prepared by the Office of Public Works. Will she inform the House whether her decisions were based on the findings of these reports? Why have the reports not been made available to those involved, primarily the board of the Abbey and those of us in the House interested in the future of the Abbey, our national theatre? What is so secretive about them? The Minister is guarding their secrecy as if they were the third secret of Fatima. Will she lay them in the Oireachtas Library in order that we can all read them and make educated and informed suggestions on what should be done? Is she satisfied that the present site offers the best alternative? Will further property have to be purchased to give more room or has she once more been pressurised by the Taoiseach who is obviously anxious to have the national theatre, by hook or by crook, located between Drumcondra and the Liffey?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I am on record on a number of occasions both inside and outside the House as saying my preference has always been for the Abbey to remain on the existing site. I have said so on numerous occasions, both publicly and privately inside and outside the House. Therefore, there is no question of being pressurised in any way by the Taoiseach or anyone else. The Taoiseach does not do his business in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, the Deputy said no consultation has taken place. There has been a great deal of consultation on the issue because, even though my view from the beginning has been that the Abbey Theatre should be located on its existing site, other proposals were made to me by the Abbey board. Because they were brought forward by the board, I decided the best and fairest way to proceed was to have those particular options looked <Col N="1007" /> at, which is precisely what we have done. Some would like to call the fact that we have had such consultation prevarication. However, one cannot have it both ways. I always believe in consultation, which has taken place. I have had numerous meetings with the Abbey board, as have my officials. As I said, the representatives of the Abbey Theatre were made aware by my officials of the conclusions of the report to which the Deputy referred. The reason it has not been made available in full is that it is price sensitive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the decision taken by the Minister and her Cabinet colleagues &ndash; I do not know how firm it is, but, obviously, as it has been taken by Cabinet it must be firm &ndash; we have very little information as to what will be done or what the new Abbey will be like. Has she given any consideration to the fact that the Abbey Theatre and company must be relocated while the present building is being expanded and developed and, if so, where will they be located? Can she give us a timescale as to when the project will be completed, given that the Abbey will celebrate its centenary in 2004? Will it be completed prior to 2004 or will it be located somewhere else for the celebration of this great centenary to which we are all looking forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a firm decision made by Cabinet. The redevelopment will take place on the existing site and will be pursued through a PPP in regard to which, as the Deputy will be aware, there are different approaches and different models. The Abbey Theatre will sign off on the best approach to be taken in this regard. An initial meeting has already been held between officials of the Department and the Office of Public Works on progressing the Government decision, in particular, the development of the most appropriate structure for a public-private partnership. There is, therefore, no delay in the matter.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the position in regard to the theatre's work in terms of the rebuilding programme. It is obviously up to the Abbey to decide whether it will, for example, go on tour. However, if it decides it wishes to have facilities at home, we will do all we can to facilitate it by asking the Office of Public Works to look at further locations during that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier today, in my reply to Priority Question No. 12, I outlined the powers given to me under the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act, 1999, and I do not propose to repeat the information given in that reply.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has asked what my plans are with regard to the payment of compensation to sports organisations whose events may be designated and refers in particular to the GAA. I want to make it clear that I have no such plans. The acquisition by broadcasters of the rights to sporting events, is in the first place, a commercial relationship between the broadcaster and the holder of the rights in question. As I said in my earlier reply, some sporting organisations, including the GAA, have argued against designation of the major events they organise on the basis that designation could impact negatively on their finances and consequently on the development of their games, particularly at club level. In deciding what events should be designated, due consideration must be given to the positions advanced by the sporting organisations who own the television rights to the events. In addition, consideration must be given to the rights of the people of Ireland to continue to have access, through free-to-air television, to major events that have a special general resonance for them.</P>
      <P>I reject the Deputy's suggestion that the way to address the concerns of the sporting organisations is for the State to make payments to them in cases where events are designated.</P>
      <P>The matter raised by the Deputy highlights the complexity of drawing up a list of events. I intend to continue to progress the process in an appropriate, consultative and democratic manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that designation is almost the same as abrogating the rights to property of the sporting organisations here? It is almost the equivalent of a compulsory purchase order. We see what happens in respect of the National Roads Authority when land has to be purchased for motorways and so on. The real problem is compensation because if certain events are designated, it will impact severely on the sporting bodies. For instance, in the UK, does the Minister agree that every premiership match that is shown by Sky Television is at a cost of £7 million? Has the Minister anything at all to offer sporting organisations, particularly the GAA, FAI and IRFU, that will have to give up these rights eventually when the Minister gets around to it without compensation or remuneration of any kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There certainly seems to be a dichotomy in the views of Deputies O'Shea and McGinley on this matter. Deputy O'Shea seems to suggest that we should go ahead regardless of whether the organisations can come to an agreement with the Minister of the day. Deputy McGinley refers to the fact that this is so difficult that it is like a compulsory purchase order. The <Col N="1009" /> views seem to be contradictory but, again, it demonstrates the complexity of this matter.</P>
      <P>If an event on an Irish list would simply guarantee that the game would be made available to an Irish free-to-air broadcaster at a price to be negotiated between the broadcaster and the broadcaster who holds the exclusive rights to the game, it is quite possible that the price would still be prohibitive because it is a question of market value, as the Deputy will know from the legislation that has already been printed and is now the 1999 Act. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that the game could be shown live unless an agreement could be made between the broadcaster itself and the broadcaster who holds the exclusive rights to that game.</P>
      <P>It is a very complex issue. Contrary to what Deputy O'Shea has said, the only way forward is to continue to work to get the kind of agreement I would wish for. Once that is achieved, then we can draw up the list of events. However, as has already been shown in other countries, particularly Denmark, as I highlighted today, there have been very serious difficulties. Only four EU states have been able to produce a list, which demonstrates the complexity that exists in trying to find agreement. As I said in my reply to the initial question on this matter, there is no point in drawing up a list willy-nilly and having that legally challenged. I fear that is what would happen if consultation could not bring about a result in this regard.</P>

      <P>The enabling legislation is in place for the past three years. Can the Minister let us know if she has had any direct meetings with the interests involved in that time to try sort out this problem? I am not saying it is not difficult &ndash; it is. Perhaps the Minister should be involved and have discussions with the various interests to resolve the issue once and for all. We do not want to have an annual repetition of the deprivation of this country of the last international rugby match between England and Ireland.</P>

Obviously, I am extremely interested in the matter because it was I, with the support of the Government, who brought this legislation to fruition in the first place.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy McGinley's question, I have met different groups. I assure him that those meetings and the consultations will be ongoing.</P>

      <P>The arts and culture enhancement support scheme, ACCESS, which I announced in August 2001, provides funding of &euro;45.71 million from 2001 to 2004 to 44 projects, chosen to maximise access for people throughout the country to adequate venues for the creation, expression and appreciation of arts and culture, including our heritage. The scheme is designed to lead to an increased participation in the arts, with facilities and activities being provided on as broad a geographic basis as possible. The programme has three distinct strands, as follows: new facilities at regional, county and city level; the redevelopment of existing arts and cultural facilities and venues, including new buildings, additional buildings or major refurbishment; and smaller community based projects. A total of 180 applications were received seeking almost £224 million or &euro;284.42 million in grant aid.</P>
      <P>ACCESS will build on the success of the cultural development incentive scheme, CDIS, which was the responsibility of my Department and operated from 1994 to 2000. The CDIS was funded in part by the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99. A total of 37 projects were offered grants under the scheme.</P>
      <P>In the light of the fact that EU funding was no longer available for arts infrastructural projects of this nature, I was particularly pleased to be able to ensure Exchequer funding of &euro;45.7 million for the ACCESS scheme.</P>

      <P>A number of criteria had to be fulfilled by the successful proposals. Among them <Col N="1012" /> were financial viability, long-term viability, concrete local support, provision of a range of facilities, distinct arts and cultural aspect, capacity to deliver a quality project, creation of direct and indirect employment, legal capacity, standard of infrastructure and equitable geographic spread. The application form was comprehensive and, at times, quite difficult. The assessment by the independent body was based on these criteria.</P>
      <P>I believe projects in 23 of the 26 counties received funding under the scheme. The award of funding was based, not only on what could be done with the capital funding, but also on the understanding that local authorities supported the applications. Projects which had local authority support were strengthened by this.</P>
      <P>The scheme grants funding for capital expenditure. It does not fund running costs. Long-term viability is an important criterion for funding and successful projects had to be able to prove this. That is the reason is was important for them to have the backing of their local authorities because they are best placed to judge the viability of the projects. The venues having received capital funding, it is now up to the local authorities and local communities to see that the projects work.</P>

The whole purpose of having such a scheme is to ensure there is access and participation in the arts. The only way to do this is to ensure these venues are provided in local areas. Some venues are regional and some are small local projects. The independent process assessed all the projects and on foot of that information I did my best to fund as many as I could. I believe 23 of the 26 counties were able to avail of the ACCESS grant.</P>

I can confirm that no formal request regarding the return of religious manuscripts as referred to has been received by my Department. However, should any such request be received, I will be very happy to pursue the identification of whatever Ethiopian material is held in State possession in Ireland and consider the legal status of such material in the context of pursuing maximum cultural co-operation between Ireland and Ethiopia. In this connection the collections in the Chester Beatty Library are the property of the Chester Beatty Library Trust. In relation to any claim to ownership of any artefacts in State possession, a high standard of proof would clearly be required to substantiate the claim.</P>

      <P>As I explained to the Deputy in my reply of 12 December last, my Department is already committed to a programme of works under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and, other than providing advice, it is not in a position to become involved in this scheme to uncover, restore and present this well to the people of Dungravan. I stated at that time that should Dungarvan Urban District Council wish to carry out such a restoration scheme, I would arrange for officials of my Department to provide advice in relation to the best practice and also to provide technical advice. The urban district council has not yet been in contact with my Department with any proposals to carry out such restoration works.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 24 and 230 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has approved the capital redevelopment of the national theatre in order to provide enhanced premises and facilities for the theatre. The agreement of the board of the National Theatre Society will be sought for the redevelopment of the theatre on the existing site. The Government has decided that a public private partnership arrangement should be initiated in this context.</P>
      <P>I met the chairman and members of the board of the National Theatre Society last week to explain the terms of the Government decision, which the chairman welcomed. The matter will be progressed from here on in close consultation and co-operation with the board. Details of whether and for how long the Abbey may have to relocate will be worked out later. In this context, I will be happy to request the Office of Public Works to give any assistance possible to the Abbey in terms of locating an alternative premises at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>A number of city centre options, including the Carlton site, were examined. However, in arriving at a decision in the matter two important considerations were that the present site is already in the possession of the National Theatre Society, and it was considered that the Abbey's links with the existing historic site should be maintained if at all possible. Immediately following the Government decision last week officials of my Department met officials of the Office of Public Works to discuss how best to secure procurement of the project through a public private partnership. These discussions are continuing and, as I have already indicated, the theatre authorities will be fully involved in the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire as an freagra a thug sí. Was the Carlton site considered prior to the finalisation of the Office of Public Works report or was it mentioned subsequent to its publication? Will the Minister publish the report, as it would be of interest? The speculation surrounding the report is not helping matters and it would be good to base our discussion on it. Is there a possibility of the Abbey Theatre securing an alternative location during construction? How much consideration has gone into that? Is it possible at this stage to consider the large body of opinion, including architects, who feel the Carlton site would enhance not only theatre but the standing of O'Connell Street and the redevelopment of that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured the reports were examined and considered very care<Col N="1019" /> fully before any decision was taken. My view has always been that the Abbey Theatre should be housed on the existing site but I did not proceed with that until I had seen the other reports. I then reached my conclusion and put proposals to Government, which were accepted. The report on the Abbey site, as I pointed out when I replied to a similar question earlier, is price sensitive and, therefore, I do not intend to publish it.</P>
      <P>Contrary to what people read in <i>The Irish Times</i>, there has been a genuine welcome for the Government decision on the Abbey Theatre and that was evident in other newspaper reports over the weekend. I referred to the construction of the new building and what will happen to the theatre during that time in my reply earlier. It is a matter for the theatre to decide whether it wants to go on tour. I do not wish to promote any view on that. That should and will be a decision of the board and director of the theatre. However, if the company is looking for additional space during that period, I have undertaken to ask the Office of Public Works to be of assistance to us in locating other sites and that will be done, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from the Minister's reply that the Carlton site was not considered prior to the publication of the Office of Public Works report and is, therefore, not mentioned in it? I acknowledge she has considered it in her mind and she has read reports but can we take it the report does not include consideration of the Carlton site? Will she extract the price sensitive information from the report so that it can be published? Apart from sending the Abbey on a grand tour, are any sites being contemplated as a temporary measure?</P>

        <b>: </b>Given that this project has been planned for years, has the Minister not made a ham-fisted job of it if she is only now considering the relocation of the Abbey Players? They could migrate like swallows and stay away for longer than normal and return in a few years. Does she know how long it will take to erect the building? A decision has been made to rebuild the Abbey Theatre and nothing has been done in the meantime to replace it temporarily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Deputy. He would be the first, and rightly so, to accuse me of interfering in an artistic decision of the Abbey to go on tour, for example. There is no question of me sending the Abbey on tour. It is a matter for the theatre and I will not interfere in that <Col N="1020" /> decision. I reiterate for the third time that if the decision of the theatre is to stay at home during construction it will need extra property to carry out its work and I am happy to ask the Office of Public Works to facilitate the theatre in finding such a premises. That is the proper way forward.</P>
      <P>I refer to the consultation period and the time necessary for the project. This is a major project that has been welcomed by the Abbey. Significant facilities are required and a radical approach needs to be adopted, as a national theatre will be developed on the site.</P>
      <P>There are different options available under public private partnerships and since the announcement of the Government decision my Department has contacted the Office of Public Works to examine them. The Abbey will have the final say as to the kind of approach to be taken on the PPP and what best suits it. It will not be signed off without the agreement of the Abbey. It is disingenuous to say this will take time. We all know it will take time because it is a massive project. That is why the Government has taken a very clear stand in stating that we want to see a complete redevelopment of the Abbey and we are prepared to carry that through by way of a PPP with such arrangements signed off by the Abbey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said earlier, I compliment the staff of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs on the way they treat Deputies. Many of the problems in social welfare arise from anomalies that come about because of the different schemes. I compliment the Minister for one thing he has done. During his term of office many of the anomalies that existed were addressed. Many other speakers referred to other little items that need to be addressed. Given the complex nature of work within the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, these anomalies will continue to arise.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made some welcome changes in disability benefit. As stated in the Bill's supporting documentation, some people who feel they can return to work and do so, find within a short period that the illness or disability does not allow them to continue to work and unfortunately they must go back on disability benefit. The change made in the Bill allows them to return to the scheme without having to go through a process of qualification again. However, what will happen to the requirement to be on disability benefit for 12 months before qualifying for invalidity benefit and for the free schemes? Is there a link?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Deputy who has spoken has mentioned the carer's allowance and the means test. I lend my support to the call for the Government to continue to try to eliminate the means test. No carer should be deprived of the allowance because of the means test. Carers are the unsung heroes of society. I heard Deputy Noel Ahern being critical of the members of the Carers' Association. I do not share his views. They feel they have been left behind in relation to some of the social welfare advancements and have to fight their own battle to try to get political parties to realise the problems, concerns and worries they have and to recognise the work they put in to ensure their loved ones are given a proper and better life. Ultimately the people in receipt of <Col N="1022" /> care should be able to have a better way of life and a better opportunity to become involved in their family and community. That is what the carers try to do.</P>
    <P>Whereas changes have been made, it would be preferable to remove the means test completely. While one welcomes the respite care grant, one can also see the problems in relation to respite care itself. I have seen many cases where people could financially afford a holiday, but were unable do so because there was no respite place to which their child, brother or sister could go, due to the lack of respite care in the health service. This must be addressed in the short-term. If we can change the situation regarding respite and long-term care, this will release many of the beds that at present are taken up by these unfortunate patients in the general hospital service. Doing that will allow the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to further develop the respite grant scheme. Other Deputies have spoken about families caring for loved ones for 20 or 30 years without ever having a break. Any Member of the House could mention cases where that occurs. We must ensure the people who apply and receive the payment are in a position to benefit from it by ensuring the person being cared for can go to a hospital or nursing home for that respite period.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs uses the health boards as agencies for supplying deposit and rent allowance. Lone parents, senior citizens and others in receipt of social welfare have a major problem in getting proper rented accommodation. There is a waste of money in some cases where there is a row between the landlord and the applicant. Is the deposit supplied by the health board ever recouped back into the system to allow some other unfortunate person to get the deposit? In some cases the community welfare officer may suggest these unfortunate people could save up the deposit. It is absolutely impossible for people in this position to get £400 or £500 over a short period. If the overall picture is considered and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs with the Department of Health and Children and the health boards investigate this they will find there is a better way forward and a more even handed way of dealing with the matter so that the unfortunate people who seek these payments will be relieved of many of the worries and concerns they have. I welcome the local community grants which were also mentioned. Many local areas have benefited as a result of such grants. However, the good work which was done in recent years will be wiped out because of the increase in public liability insurance. What will happen to local groups which cater for senior citizens, lone parents, etc.? The people who run such services must now try to organise other functions to pay for the increase in public liability insurance on community halls where these groups work. It will be a major problem in the future if something is not done to alleviate it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1023" />I welcome the development of the education grant scheme, although it will probably not deal with the anomalies I mentioned earlier. One such anomaly is where a person in full-time employment becomes ill and is not able to work. When he or she seeks alternative ways to earn a salary, he or she realises he or she must go through the education system. I know of a case where a 29 year old carpenter, who was ill, wanted to get a third level education grant. However, because he was not on the unemployment register for six months he did not qualify for the grant. I ask the Minister to investigate that. If an illness is verified by the medical profession, the person should be allowed to qualify for the back to education allowance. I do not understand why facilities cannot be provided to enable people to better themselves through the education system. If a person gives up a job because of an illness which is verified by the medical profession, he or she should be allowed to seek alternative employment through the education system.</P>
    <P>As regards senior citizens and those, particularly married couples, who have paid social welfare contributions over the years, a dependent who is in receipt of a payment through his or her spouse may have stamps in his or her own right but not enough for an individual payment. I dealt with one case recently where the person was entitled to almost half the payment but because the payment for the dependent spouse was greater, she did not need to apply. One wonders if that person was entitled to the payment and if the payment to her spouse could have been diluted by that amount. In that way the person who made the contributions many years ago and whose money funded the social welfare system could feel they were getting some of their money back. The main income was provided by one person during all the years the couple were married. However, when that person retires, is it possible for the other person to get some of the income created over the years? Perhaps the Minister could comment on that in his reply to the House.</P>
    <P>Free travel is of major benefit to senior citizens and it was mentioned numerous times this morning. There is a scheme in Cavan and in other parts of the country where private operators accept the travel pass and recoup the payment from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. That is a great idea, but it should be done on a more widespread basis. The last time I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister on that issue, I was told that nine or ten groups were involved in such a scheme. That number could be increased dramatically to benefit people. In my constituency of Kildare South private transport is provided for people who must travel to Dublin in the mornings for hospital or business appointments because there is not a public bus or ambulance service. A number of buses travel through Athy every morning at 7 o'clock on their way to Dublin. If the scheme was available, the people with free travel passes could benefit from <Col N="1024" /> it. It is obvious the Department has facilitated this scheme in other areas. I ask it to publicise it more and to make it available to the travel agents throughout the country. In that way we would create a private transport web to complement the public transport system which is not able to facilitate the people about whom I am speaking.</P>
    <P>The Minister listened to the other Members of the House today who spoke about decentralisation. Athy has been designated under the RAPID programme for investment. If the Minister believes that some place in Leinster needs a section of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, Athy is the obvious place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Wall on his fair representation of the Bill. His contribution was balanced and it acknowledged what the Minister has done in the area of social welfare in recent years. It is important to do that because I have heard people making comparisons between what this Government did and what was achieved in the past by other Governments. I have heard members of the former rainbow Government saying that not enough has been done. It might be opportune to draw comparisons because the public needs to know the rates of increases given by the rainbow Government and by this Fianna Fáil-led Government.</P>
      <P>The rainbow Government increased old age contributory pensions by 9.9%, while this Government increased them by 48.7%. If inflation is taken into account, the Government increased them by 23.9% compared with 4%. The rainbow coalition increased widow's and widower's pension by 10%, while the Fianna Fáil-led Government has increased it by 36.6%. We have increased unemployment benefit and disability benefit by 38.6% whereas the rainbow coalition increased it by 10%. The rainbow coalition increased old age non-contributory pension by 10.7%. We, however, have increased it by 83.3%.</P>
      <P>All one need do is talk to elderly people about their lot in life and ask them whether they have really benefited in recent years. To a person they will state this has been one of the most comfortable periods in their lifetimes in terms of the social welfare increases they received. They remember the stark reality of what happened when the rainbow Government was in office. They recall that on one occasion they were given an increase which, at the time, amounted to the price of a box of matches. The reality is that there is a tangible sense of satisfaction abroad. Over two budgets they have been given recognition by a caring Government and increases of the order of 85%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rainbow coalition increased long-term unemployment assistance by 10.7%. We have increased it by 36%. Short-term unemployment assistance was increased by 14.6% by the rainbow coalition while we have increased it by 43.1%. The Minister has a remarkable record of achievement. I accept that a greater level of funds have <Col N="1025" /> been available to the Government as a result of the success of the Celtic tiger economy. However, it has also maintained the caring attitude that is part and parcel of the Fianna Fáil ethos. When we had the opportunity to spend money on the elderly and social welfare recipients we did so.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to social inclusion measures. In the final budget introduced by the rainbow coalition £273 million was allocated for such measures. It has been stated the current Government has not invested enough in this area. However, those who make such statements are in no position to do so because last year we invested £1.18 billion. In addition, this year a massive £1.2 billion will be invested in social inclusion measures. People can rest assured that measures in budget 2002 go further than any contained in previous social inclusion packages. The £1.2 billion we are allocating is four and a half times greater than the provision made for social inclusion by the previous Government. The scale of the amount of money we are providing is further underlined by the fact that over the three years of Partnership 2000 the rainbow coalition undertook to spend £525 million on social inclusion measures. If one examines the figure set out in budget 2002, one can see that almost two and a half times more is being made available for such measures. I say to the Minister, &ldquo;Well done&rdquo;. In the election campaign we will be able to highlight the figures and show what standards have been achieved. We will be able to hold our heads high and state we have allocated funding in a fair manner.</P>
    <P>The social welfare improvements contained in the budget will cost £850 million in a full year. This equals last year's record for such improvements and stands in stark comparison to the £215 million provided by the rainbow coalition in its last budget. Social welfare expenditure has increased by two thirds since this Fianna Fáil led Government entered office. Under budget 2002, all weekly social welfare increases have been paid with effect from 1 January. There were many calls for this in the past, but it was never done. However, the Government has now taken action and, as a result, increases in social welfare payments will be available five months earlier than was the case when the Government entered office.</P>
    <P>All the budgets introduced by the Government were characterised by measures designed to improve, in terms of their pensions, the position of older people in our society. We all value the major contribution our elders made to society and there have been unanimous calls during the years for a recognition of that contribution. I am glad the Government has delivered on the commitment, contained in the Fianna Fáil policy document produced before the last election, to increase old age pensions to at least £100 per week during its term of office. The most recent budget provides for at least a full £10 per week in the full personal rate. This equals the then unprecedented £10 per week increase contained in last year's budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1026" />I accept that people have selective political memories. However, Members on this side of the House are not likely to allow them to forget that over the three budgets introduced by the rainbow coalition, Deputy Quinn, as Minister for Finance, gave pensioners a total increase of £2.33. The effect of the increases under Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats is that old age contributory pension will now stand at £116 per week. When we entered office it was £62 per week. What we have done, therefore, is no mean achievement. The Government has increased the personal rate of old age pension by close to 50%, which compares to a total increase of 10% over the lifetime of the rainbow coalition. When the increase in the qualified adult payment is included, a contributory old age pensioner couple, both of whom are over the age of 66 years, will now receive £205 per week. This compares to the £133 they received in 1997 when the Government took office. Under the rainbow coalition, increases in old age pensions stood below the rate of inflation. The record increases we have implemented are well ahead of inflation and represent a real improvement in the living standards of older people.</P>
    <P>It has been stated the poor have fared worst out of the budget. It is interesting that in the commentaries made about the widening gap between the rich and poor, economists have indicated that the poor fared worst of all in the budgets introduced between 1994 and 1997. It has emerged that the very poorest did best between 1987 to 1994. It is also interesting that Brendan Keenan indicated in a newspaper article that the budget is the fairest on record. It is difficult to reconcile some of the statements made in the CORI document with factual representations of what has happened. People have faired better financially because the Government decided to focus on child benefit and provide significant increases. It has also ensured this benefit is paid directly to parents.</P>
    <P>I must admit that I was extremely concerned about the introduction of individualisation in taxation. I was extremely concerned until an increase occurred in the taxation level granted to parents at home. I recall mentioning to the Minister at the time that if we were going to operate individualisation in the taxation system, there would be no option but to extend it to the social welfare system. I am glad the Minister has now indicated quite clearly that individualisation will be part and parcel of social welfare payments. Our society and our family structure are changing. Many mothers, in particular, have not benefited to the extent that should be their right. By introducing individual payments, the Minister is restoring that right.</P>
    <P>With regard to the carer's allowance, the outstanding role of carers in society is well known. Many of them who have cared for people on a voluntary basis for years past are now benefiting from the changes which have been made. I welcome the provision in this year's budget to extend <Col N="1027" /> the payment to an additional 3,400 carers and that 2,300 carers will receive an increased payment. That is not before its time. Ideally, there should not be a means test. However, in every budget, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has ensured that the disregards have increased dramatically and long may that continue. We can never value too highly the important role of carers. The increase in the respite care grant is most welcome. The Minister increased it to £507 in the 2001 budget and has increased it further this year. Perhaps more than anybody else, carers need respite. They are under stress, sometimes for up to 18 hours per day, and they need a break. Great credit is due to the Minister for acknowledging this through the increase in the respite care grant. When Fianna Fáil is back in Government after the general election, whether the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is in his present office or not, I know we will continue that approach.</P>

      <P>At my age, I assure Deputy Deenihan that I am just happy to be in this House and to pay my respects to the Minister of the day for the invaluable work he has done on behalf of people on social welfare payments. The Minister also extended the back to education scheme to carers who have ceased their caring responsibilities. That is an excellent scheme for people who may have spent many years caring for their parents and given up a livelihood through love of their parents. The Minister has wisely recognised the gap which may exist in the lives of such people and has provided the opportunity and the facilities for them to go back into education.</P>
      <P>I hope my comments on this social welfare Bill have outlined in great detail for the electorate the benefits which this Government has delivered. I hope and believe they will acknowledge the great strides that have been made in terms of keeping payments well ahead of inflation. I congratulate the Minister and urge him to continue the good work. He has been an outstanding success in his Department and those on unemployment and disability payments have reason to be grateful for what has been a very generous hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Deenihan. It is unfortunate that, in debates like this, so much time is spent comparing the spend of the present Government to that of the previous Government. In many cases, that exercise is a total nonsense because one is not comparing like with like and it is simply petty politics.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to think that opposition politicians are big enough to recognise pro<Col N="1028" /> gress in Bills such as this one and that Government politicians would not constantly harp on about comparisons between the spend figures of a previous Government more than five years ago and those of the present day Government, when the amounts of money available are not at all comparable. In relation to the Bill I wish to make some general points, some of which relate directly to it and others relate more loosely. Children are a most vulnerable section of our society. On a positive note, I welcome the child benefit provisions in this Bill and I am glad the Government has adopted an approach that Fine Gael has been promoting for quite some time, that is, to pay lump sums to increase child benefit significantly over successive budgets, through direct child benefit payments. Some progress has been achieved in this area. This Bill ensures that a family with three children will receive &euro;382.50 per month after April and that is welcome on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>Bringing up children is an expensive business, particularly if both parents are encouraged &ndash; or forced &ndash; to work outside of the family home because of the high cost of their mortgage or because they are faced with a taxation regime that favours a double income family, so that people feel they have to go out to work rather than stay at home to look after children. With regard to child care, the £117 per month that is being provided for child benefit does not go anywhere near paying child care bills for a parent working full time or even part time. They may have to pay up to &euro;150 per week, never mind £117 per month, for child care. As policy makers, we need to look very seriously at how child care can be made more affordable for parents and how we can provide the capital investment to ensure, particularly in areas of disadvantage, that parents have an opportunity to put their children in quality child care facilities. In this regard, Fine Gael has been advocating the possible use of school grants as is done in other countries, such as in Scandinavia, for example, where a community or the local authority, funded by national government, provides child care facilities and the capital lump sums for that. That system would make child care far more affordable and would remove financial barriers which currently prevent many lone parents, in particular, and other parents from working outside the home.</P>
      <P>I welcome the recognition, however slight, of the increase in the cost of school clothes and footwear. However, the increase in that area does not match the increase in inflation. I have had approaches from a number of people, during the months of September and October, expressing real concern at the increase in cost of school uniforms and books. I would like to see more support in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child poverty is still a significant problem and it needs to be tackled. People talk loosely about one in three or one in four children being brought up in poverty and I often question where they get the facts to back up those statements but there <Col N="1029" /> seems to be great concern that there is far too high a percentage of children growing up and living in poverty. This in turn leads to all sorts of other problems when these children reach their teenage years.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, one of the great challenges we face is to try and deal with the problems of drug and alcohol addiction. Since I have a responsibility for the drugs area in my party, I will remind people of the stark facts. Alcohol consumption among all ages continues to be among the highest in Europe. The number of young people involved in under age drinking is higher than anywhere else in Europe. We have the highest use of ecstasy in Europe. Some 18% of Irish teenagers are smoking daily, which is the second highest rate in Europe. Ireland has the third highest use of cannabis in Europe, the fourth highest use of stimulants, the fourth highest use of cocaine and the eighth highest use of heroin in Europe &ndash; although that is largely confined to Dublin's inner city. I mention that because there is a link between the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the responsibilities of the national drug strategy. Moreover, there is a direct link between poverty and deprivation and drug addiction, particularly in the case of heroin. There is also a direct link between addiction and issues such as child prostitution, which are areas in which we are not doing enough work to reduce or eliminate the problems.</P>
    <P>Some of the problems could be reduced by an increase of emphasis on family and parenting support by providing the type of pro-family policies that Fine Gael is proposing which make strong arguments against the individualisation policies that have been adopted by this Government.</P>
    <P>Carers have been treated very poorly by successive Governments and they have been taken for granted in the work they are doing. It is generally accepted that carers have been doing the work of the State for many years while it has been considered a family duty, a duty to a friend or a voluntary practice. However, times are changing and, if we expect people to do the work they are doing as carers and put the number of hours in, we need to offer some financial recognition of that work. To date the pay or financial recognition has been appalling. During the by-election in which I won my seat three and a half years ago, the strongest lobby group of all was the carers. It was my initiation into lobbying but I found myself in agreement with almost everything they said about the amount of money they have been paid.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that family carers save the State about &euro;2 billion a year in unpaid work and about 19,000 carers receive carers allowance of some sort from the Department. From a rough estimate of about 100,000 carers in the country, 52,000 are officially recognised by the Department. In a move that the Government seems to view as a generous one, this Bill will increase the income disregard to include an extra 3,200 carers for some form of carer's allowance. This is far too <Col N="1030" /> little. Fine Gael proposes to increase the income disregard to twice the minimum wage which would extend the allowance to another 13,000 carers ensuring that almost two thirds of the recognised 52,000 carers would receive recognition of the valuable work they are doing. I welcome the increase in the respite care grant which will go some way to paying for respite care. However we must examine the capital lump sums that are needed to ensure that facilities are provided for.</P>
    <P>If we are to introduce tax individualisation from an income tax point of view, we must carry that philosophy into pensions too. It is unacceptable that we tax people within families as individuals yet, when it comes to paying a pension to members of those families, we treat them as a unit &ndash; so husbands and wives are not getting the equivalent of two individuals from a pensions point of view. In the areas of homelessness, asylum seekers and lone parents in particular we have much work to do yet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the fifth year in a row, this Government has failed to give priority to the deprivation being experienced by our poorest people. While the country has been experiencing its most prosperous period ever, the Government's budgetary choices have created a situation where our poorest people are expected to live on about &euro;118 per week. Its choices have also widened the rich-poor gap by more than &euro;200 per week. This is unjust, unfair and unacceptable. As a direct result of the choices contained in the 2001 budget, the number of people living in relative income poverty will continue to rise, the rich-poor gap will continue to widen, many people in low-paid jobs will gain nothing and families on very low income will not have a right to a medical card.</P>
      <P>After this budget, because the increases in the medical card bands did not keep pace with the increases in social welfare payments, a large number of people will be outside the bands and will lose their cards. A large number of people will continue to wait for appropriate accommodation and, despite the unprecedented prosperity of recent years, poverty and social inclusion have not been tackled on anything like the scale that was available through resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tackling poverty effectively is a multi-faceted task. It requires action on many fronts ranging from health care to education and accommodation to employment but the most important requirement is the provision of sufficient income to enable people to live life with dignity. This Government has failed dismally during its term of office to address this issue despite having the best opportunity to do so since the foundation of the State. After five budgets, this Government has produced a situation where Ireland's poorest people are expected to live on about &euro;119 per week. A large number of poor people do not have enough income to provide for basic necessities. The average disposable income of the poorest ten <Col N="1031" /> per cent of households is less than £106 per week while the disposable income of the top ten per cent of earners was about &euro;1,300 per week.</P>
    <P>A growing number of poor people are on housing waiting lists. Last week there was a debate in the House on the subject of the 50,000 families on the lists. This represents some 150,000 people. In County Kerry there are 2,000 people on the housing waiting lists, whereas a few years ago there were only 500.</P>
    <P>The two tier health system ensures poor people must wait at the back of the queue until those who are better off have been provided for first. This situation will continue, even if the recently published health care strategy is implemented. People are dying because they cannot afford to have operations. I have seen people die because they could not receive early treatment for cancer. If they had money, they would still be alive today.</P>
    <P>Many employed persons are living in poverty because their incomes are so low. I had hoped the Government would remove the basic income groups from the tax net. It moved in a positive direction, but should have removed them altogether. If we have a divided society, we will have a very restless one, which could make life very uncomfortable for those who currently have a monopoly on almost everything. It is important that we maintain a balance in society.</P>
    <P>The 1997 national anti-poverty strategy definition of poverty included those whose income and resources were so inadequate as to preclude them from having a standard of living regarded as acceptable by our society generally. As a result of inadequate income and resources, people may be excluded and marginalised from participating in activities considered the norm for others. I know several young people whose families cannot afford to meet their basic needs in regard to sport, in the sense of paying for coaching, transporting them to sports events and so on. Potentially good athletes are excluded from participation in sport because their parents cannot drive them from County Kerry to the national coaching centre in Limerick. At times I have given assistance out of my own pocket in order that such people can avail of basic coaching facilities. This is happening across the board and we should be mindful of it, irrespective of who is in power.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Batt O'Keeffe speak on the Government's record over the past five years which I admit has been good in many areas. We were in a very prosperous period in our history. The money was available and it was a great time to be in government. The only Department which did not have a good time during the lifetime of the Government was the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. In almost every area it was an easy time to be in government as there was plenty of money around. I have a chart showing who benefited most from 1997 to 2002. Those on long-term unemployment payments benefited by some &euro;30 per week. Couples with one earner in the family on long-term unem<Col N="1032" /> ployment benefit gained some &euro;55 per week, whereas those on £40,000 plus, which includes all Members, benefited by some &euro;250 per week.</P>
    <P>There has been no balance in how the money has been distributed. We are living in a very affluent society where it is common practice for some better-off individuals to have houses in Spain or Portugal. I do not begrudge them this in the least, but when I see the abject poverty in which others are living it makes me question the society we are now building. We are building a society with great potential for unrest. It could be explosive if we do not redress the imbalance. There is still time to do this, but there will have to be a change of policy. As Deputy Noonan stated, we need a new social contract.</P>

      <P>I am happy to contribute to the debate on the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2002, which mainly provides for various improvements in payments and some other measures. I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on his stewardship of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. He has made real improvements. I hope the Bill will have a speedy and unanimous approval for its passage through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1997 no other EU country has performed as well as Ireland. We are living in a time of excitement and great hope. Ireland's time has truly come. We are building a more prosperous and more progressive country than ever before in our history. While much has been achieved, much more remains to be done. I wish to see our twin-track republican policies continue: sustainable wealth creation and social inclusion. My vision, and that of my party, Fianna Fáil, is of an Ireland in which every person and community can prosper. The Bill reflects our basic philosophy in regard to social inclusion and social potential. We wish to see our country, its people and resources having the potential for further growth and <Col N="1033" /> development. That potential must be fully realised creating sustainable wealth and enabling real social inclusion.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has a radical commitment to fairness, equity and dignity. We are committed to the elimination of persistent poverty. I challenge anyone to an acid test on this party's record in government in this regard. The Bill gives practical effect to our economic and social philosophy. This Fianna Fáil led Administration has the best understanding of all the political parties of the issues that affect people, especially the less well-off in our society. We have the ability and a greater degree of understanding of all the economic groups in identification of the extent and nature of the relevant issues. Accordingly, our prospects of success in adequately dealing with such issues is greater. That is the reason this Fianna Fáil led Administration has been so successful. We are now well on our way to developing a social welfare structure of which we can all be proud.</P>
    <P>We have and wish to continue investing the dividends of our prosperity in the less well-off in our society. As a first step, we have put in place a permanent structure for long-term economic and social planning across all the regions. This Administration has worked hard and well. We will build on the foundations we have put in place. Arising from all the good work and our economic prosperity, social welfare recipients have benefited from the most progressive and generous benefits in the history of the State. In advancing the measures contained in the Bill, and previous Social Welfare Acts, under the leadership of the Minister we have brought social inclusion centre stage. Deputy Ahern has undertaken his duties in a positive and energetic manner as Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to a number of the contributors to this debate so far and welcome the opening remark of Deputy Coveney, someone for whom I have much admiration and respect, but the following speaker from his party, Deputy Deenihan, went down the track that he indicated it would be best not to travel.</P>

I will do two things to facilitate the fair judgment of this, as the call has been made. We will look not just at the £1.90 that the last Administration added to pension payments, we will also look at percentages and real values. If one goes down that avenue, is the level of economic prosperity relevant? One can say that things have changed and times are different, so let us look at both.</P>
      <P>A group of people who should be looked after and, I am happy to say, is strongly supported by the party of which I am a member is made up of old age contributory pensioners. They have helped to create the great country we enjoy and many have assisted in the development of the economy. During the term of office of the rainbow government, in which Deputy Deenihan proudly stated he was a Minister of State, the old age contributory pension was increased by 9.9%.</P>

I take this opportunity to cite my admir<Col N="1036" /> ation for the energetic manner in which the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has gone about his business. I congratulate the Fianna Fáil-led Administration and our PD partners for successes right across the board.</P>
      <P>With regard to section 2, we have seen tremendous increases in child benefit. Given the difficulties regarding how best to bring real financial benefits to parents, the manner in which the Ministers for Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs have introduced this measure is noteworthy.</P>
      <P>The respite care grant is excellent and it gives a much merited break to carers. There are, however, serious problems out there with regard to the availability of respite beds and that arises from the standards and conditions put in place to provide such beds. We depend on the statutory authority to ensure that such beds are available. They are very few at the moment and there is great pressure on them, therefore, while I welcome the grant and the enhancement of it, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs should work closely with the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that there are sufficient beds available. Those who assess the respite care grants should be able to assess the beds in the community. There are particular difficulties in the private sector.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the free travel scheme developed. I have described before the frustrations of those who use this fine scheme, which was introduced by Fianna Fáil. It is restrictive and some of those who use the scheme are often required to meet hospital appointments and the like at times outside the hours allowed. Rather than force people to apply for the unrestricted travel pass, which can be made available for certain periods of time, we should make the entire scheme completely unrestricted. When the travel scheme was originally introduced many did not have a motor vehicle available to them. That they were able to travel the country in a motor vehicle to meet family and friends and integrate in society was of tremendous benefit. The times have changed and travel on a bus or train is no longer a great excursion. For a person over 66, travel on an aeroplane is no longer a great excursion either. Many people's family and friends are in the US and in the UK and in other European member states and I would like to see the free travel scheme extended to include air travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following my contact with a number of the airline companies, and, in particular, one of the Irish companies, whose boss might not appreciate me referring to it as a &ldquo;cheap travel&rdquo; company but which certainly gives value for money in travel arrangements, I know they are quite keen to assist in a scheme which would allow people entitled to the free travel pass to avail of spare capacity on flights. I am not talking about placing a huge burden on the Exchequer or on the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. I am simply proposing that where there <Col N="1037" /> is spare capacity on flights leaving Ireland, people who possess a free travel pass would be able to avail of a percentage of that spare capacity. This all could be done in a pragmatic fashion by an approach being made by the Department and statistics being produced. Where there is spare capacity, a percentage of that spare capacity could be allocated for those possessing a free travel pass. A number of the airline companies are favourably disposed to this. I would ask the Minister to initiate real discussions in this regard. I have done some work on it and I have received very positive feedback. I have briefed the Minister on this.</P>
    <P>The other issue in relation to the elderly I want to raise is that unfortunately in some cases older people, who have assisted in putting in place the foundations of this nation and have assisted in producing the prosperity which we now enjoy, must leave their employment. Some of these could be active older persons who would like to continue to participate in the workplace. While I know there is an incentive with regard to reduced PRSI, we should explore putting in place a financial incentive for the older person to continue in the workplace in whatever capacity he or she may desire. At present there is no such financial incentive and at the same time we know there are many businesses which would greatly welcome the wealth of experience which the older person could bring to these places of business.</P>
    <P>Many Members of this House will be aware that there are many older persons participating in the workplace, particularly in the businesses of a son or daughter, and for practical reasons these people may or may not be on the books of the company concerned. I would like to see the matter rectified. Such people have a great deal to contribute. It is a simple issue which could be easily rectified. Putting in place a simple financial incentive could greatly correct some of these issues, which are out there in the workplace and which, for practical reasons, are not being accommodated.</P>
    <P>These are the two issues to which I want to draw attention &ndash; the extension of the free travel pass to air travel and the participation of the older person in the workplace. I can assure the House that I have done a great deal of homework in this regard and I would be happy to assist the Minister and his Department by providing them with the information in my possession. There is tremendous potential in these areas and I would ask that we explore them fully.</P>
    <P>I say to anybody listening to or reading this debate &ldquo;If you agree with the policies of this Fianna Fáil Administration, if you have enjoyed a share of the prosperity over the past five years, if you have enjoyed extra money in your pocket, if you have enjoyed the quality and standard of life over the past five years, in the next number of weeks you will have an opportunity to say so.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Moynihan-Cronin and Sullivan.</P>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill, the purpose of which is to provide for the increases forming part of the social welfare package announced in the budget, particularly the increases in child benefit. I am a constructive person and I heartily support the significant increase in child benefit. I also acknowledged and applauded the increases in this area in particular. The fact that it is a universal payment made directly to families, and particularly to the mother, is extremely important because the mother collects it, disperses it and spends it on matters which are extremely important for the overall benefit, welfare and well-being of the child or children. I welcome that provision and acknowledge its importance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Callely gave a eulogy about all the various good provisions in the Bill. I acknowledge those provisions but he omitted one glaring anomaly, that carers of Ireland mean nothing to this Government. That is the simple truth. Let there be no doubt about it, those people are waiting to give their response to this cold-hearted Government which still employs a niggardly means test to deprive people of the allowance.</P>
      <P>There is a fanfare because they say that 19,000 of the 220,000 carers are now in receipt of the payment. There is of course no national database. Why is that the case? Is that a purposeful exclusion to ensure that we will not know the true figure to make a comparison? Give or take a few, only 20% of carers qualify for the allowance and of course with the means test they all do not qualify for the full amount. How many of the 19,000 recipients get the full carers allowance following this great triumphal fanfare of the announcement? I want to address this matter which is not specifically dealt with in the Bill. It is regrettable that the financial support this allowance gives to carers is so inadequate as to be shocking.</P>
      <P>The carers issue has been ignored by this Government and it is a glaring omission. There has been some debate on this matter in the context of the budget but, as somebody who has championed the cause of carers for a long number of years and who has been deeply involved with them, I was deeply disappointed that there were no amendments to the social welfare code in respect of carers in this Bill. My party colleague, Deputy Broughan, has done a tremendous amount of work in this area and has laid the foundation of significant elements, which, if we were to be part of any future Government, we would see as fundamental prerequisites and requirements to ensure that the issue of the carers allowance would be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1039" />Most of us know that caring is a universal experience and for those caring for people within their own home, it can be a 24 hour job seven days a week. No doubt my colleagues on the Government side recognise that also. I would have personal experience of it through my own family who did not look for anything from the State because they thought it was their duty. However, there are many people who might require that £90 or whatever is the euro equivalent. We owe it to those people to ensure that the allowance is paid out and that the means test is withdrawn once and for all. It is mean and niggardly and I would say the same if my party were in Government. I am not being political. It is time to get rid of it. It is something in which I believe passionately. We cannot call ourselves a caring society if we allow it to continue. I am aware it will cost money but, on a cost-benefit analysis, the carers who care for people in their homes, where they are always happiest, rather than their having to enter an institutional environment create a significant saving for the State by their work. There is also the demographic trend. More of us are getting older and some of us in a few years might be delighted to have someone to care for us. We must also examine that aspect of the predicted demographic shift to an older population in the next few decades.</P>
    <P>It is time we had a database of carers and the Department should set about establishing one. It is very important because we need to be in a position to predict what future home carers are needed and what the cost will be. In the absence of that, it is very difficult to formulate policy. The establishment of a national database of carers should be a key requirement of our party if we return to Government. We need the detailed information it would provide on the numbers of carers and their requirements which will be important when it comes to policy formulation and giving support.</P>
    <P>It is sad that carers must still fight for what is their right. The restrictive nature of the conditions attaching to the carer's allowance and implicit in the carer's benefit and carer's leave means a significant number of people receive little or no assistance. That will require a fundamental policy change and one I advocate strongly. The means test must also be tackled.</P>
    <P>The free travel pass is the first benefit many people receive from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and, in many cases, it goes on the mantelpiece to gather dust. This is especially so in rural areas where there is no public transport of any description. Many Members, including the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, will be familiar with this. Deputy Callely referred to cheap flight operators and I know one of the chief executives lives in the heart of County Westmeath. However, let us begin with ordinary people in the country and get them mobile so that they can get to nursing homes, <Col N="1040" /> doctors, solicitors or whatever. For that they need transport.</P>
    <P>Our main focus should be combating social isolation and exclusion in rural areas and transport is necessary for this. Reduced mobility compounds social exclusion and denies members of the community opportunities for access to basic services, education, jobs and social interaction. The lack of adequate transport in rural areas especially impacts on older people who, even with travel passes, cannot access transport because it is not near their homes.</P>
    <P>The mobility transport needs of the rural population can no longer be filled by traditional transport. We must examine a public rural transport network which will operate to the benefit of those people and that may necessitate reform of the 1932 Transport Act to take account of the current needs of people. We must also examine the establishment of a rural transport authority to carry out a number of policies, such as establishing guidelines for community transport projects and social car schemes to operate without difficulty, creating a simple voucher system to allow local operators to obtain full reimbursement from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for free travel pass holders, and conducting a review of the free travel pass benefit in the context of the use of multiple modes of transport. That may be the way forward to ensure the free travel pass means what it should to rural people.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. Ministers and Government party members will probably say we are very critical. I am not so just for the sake of it. I welcome increases in social welfare benefits in any Bill passed by the House. I welcome the child benefit increases, but I wish to deal with a few other issues.</P>
      <P>Deputy Penrose dealt in detail with the carer's allowance and I will not reiterate what he said. However, I will make a few points about the respite grant for carers which will be issued in June. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs pontificated about how the greatest change that had been made in the previous Social Welfare Bill was that payments were made in January. This is one payment which could have been made in January. We know the value of carers' work and many Members who spoke referred to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met a gentlemen yesterday who was incensed because his wife, who cared for both his invalid parents, applied for the carer's allowance and was refused because his income was too great. He asked why she should suffer because he works every day. He does not have to deal with the difficulties she has 24 hours a day, yet she is penalised because he works. She does the work and the washing and cares for his invalid parents, and she should be recognised for that. I agree with that. If there is one thing the Labour Party could do, it would be to remove the means test from the <Col N="1041" /> carer's allowance and that would be the best thing that ever happened in this country.</P>
    <P>I raised a matter on the Adjournment two weeks ago about the enhanced subvention for people in nursing homes. I spoke on behalf of single people in nursing homes who have no families or relatives remaining and who are in nursing homes because there is no one to care for them. They cannot afford to be in nursing homes because the subvention they receive does not make up the difference between their pension and the cost of a nursing home bed. If it were not for the kindness and care of the owner, I do not know what would happen to these people. If the people being cared for in the home by their families were in nursing homes or in care, there would be chaos, and the Department does not realise that.</P>
    <P>The widowed parent grant was increased to &euro;2,500 which was very welcome. However, it will not deal with the severe pressure experienced by widows, especially young widows. I refer to those with young children who have been widowed suddenly. I know widows in my constituency who have children in third level education and who find it extremely difficult to keep them in college. The maintenance grant does not go far enough towards meeting the cost of digs or keeping, feeding and clothing the children. Such people are struggling to try to educate their children. It is the only thing they can give them. They cannot give them too much money because they do not have it.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the huge increases he gave pensioners in the budget. However, the plight of young widows has not been addressed and they experience the greatest difficulty in rearing their families. I have dealt with this issue on numerous Social Welfare Acts when I was spokesperson in this area. Young widows with families must be seen in a different light from anyone else. Many of them were accustomed to having a good income. Their late husbands may not have been entitled to a pension from their job and even though the Government promised a pensions Bill to deal with the issue it has not been delivered on. I ask that young widows should not be forgotten as happened in the past.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with the PRSI number and its use by Departments, which is dangerous. Some safeguards must be put in place in order that personal information cannot be used willy nilly without one's authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone who has spoken on the Bill has done so from personal experience of dealing with individuals and the difficult choices they must make as a result of being on very limited incomes. I detected a tone in Deputy Callely's contribution, in particular, that there are deserving poor and not so deserving poor, which I reject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to concentrate on categories who have not done well under the Government as a result of the budget. I am referring to those who still <Col N="1042" /> live on very basic incomes on which I do not think anyone in the House would manage to live. These are the people on basic social welfare payments that increased from £85.50 to £93.50, not much more than &euro;100 per week, and on which they are trying to balance household budgets. I am thinking, in particular, of those on disability allowances who already have enough to contend with without having to live on such very basic incomes. It was proposed a number of years ago that payments would be introduced towards the cost of addressing the problems of people with disabilities, including extra costs for clothing, food, special equipment and special transport needs. However, this has not happened. People such as those on disability allowance are left on these basic payments at a time when there is huge wealth in the economy. I have a problem with the complacency of some Deputies on the Fianna Fáil benches, particularly Deputy Callely, in addressing these very difficult problems.</P>
    <P>My two colleagues referred to carer's allowance. We are talking about those who must make a choice to give up the opportunity to have an income of their own in order to care full time for a loved family member. I do not think any Department can argue that carers should not be paid on the basis that they are giving full-time care and it should not be means tested. This aspect, which should have been changed a long time ago, needs to be changed now. My party has given a commitment that if we are in government following the next general election, it will abolish the means test for carer's allowance. Those who care for family members at home save the State a huge amount of money. They also provide a service which we often lament is missing nowadays in Irish life. Many tasks carried out by families in the past are not being done anymore because of the changes and social pressures on people. We need to facilitate the people concerned to provide care in their own homes if in order to do so, they are willing to give up work, social life and so on.</P>
    <P>Other families, including the parents of young children, must also make difficult choices. While the family allowance has been increased, which I welcome, the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance has only been increased for children over the age of 12 years, not for younger children, nor has it been increased substantially. My colleague, Deputy Shortall, did a cost analysis last September, before children returned to school, of the actual cost of clothing a child going back to school. She discovered this costs more than twice what they receive under the clothing and footwear allowance. Public representatives on all sides of the House will have constituents coming to them at that time of the year who must sometimes go to moneylenders to be able to afford to send their children back to school. They will not send their children to school without the appropriate clothing, books and so on because they care for them and do not want to embarrass them when they return to school.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" />These are the types of basic issues with which we should have been able to deal in a time of plenty. It is not a huge amount of money in terms of the budget and income the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is handling. He has spoken about huge sums of money in other areas. Given the decrease in the numbers unemployed, the demands on the social welfare budget are not as high as they might otherwise have been. These issues should have been addressed in that context.</P>
    <P>Parents must often make choices about whether to stay at home to look after their children or go out to work. This is about the only country in Europe which does not have paid parental leave. If the parties in government really believe in supporting families and caring roles in families, paid parental leave should have been introduced. I ask that the issue be considered. I am aware we are approaching the end of the life of the Government, but paid parental leave must be on the agenda of whatever Government is in place following the general election.</P>
    <P>I add my voice to those who expressed concern about the guidelines for qualifying for a medical card and the dichotomy between those on social welfare payments who would have qualified formerly but do not now qualify. I know directives were issued, but many in that situation have been omitted. This is something which should not have happened because it should have been dealt with in advance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Kelleher.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us brings about the changes announced by the Government in the very important areas of child benefit and carer's allowance, together with a number of other key changes. I would like to make some general comments concerning the Government's commitment since coming to office in July 1997 to helping the less well-off and disadvantaged in our society. I fully recognise the Opposition does not like it when we present the factual evidence of the successes of the Government. However, facts are facts and cannot be denied, notwithstanding the best efforts of the Opposition parties to do so. I suppose that is the reason Opposition parties exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Government came to office some 310,000 jobs have been created. Unemployment has decreased to its lowest level since modern statistics first commenced. There has been major reform of the taxation system which ensured more money was put in people's pockets. The Government has delivered real increases in take home pay and more than &euro;4 billion has been returned to workers in personal tax reductions alone. The key beneficiaries of these tax reductions have been lower and middle income earners. Health funding has been doubled by the Government which has brought forward the new health strategy which will cut treatment times and <Col N="1044" /> waiting lists, improve accident and emergency services and increase the number of community nursing beds and day places for the elderly.</P>
    <P>Government investment in education services has been increased by more than 70% since the Government came to office. No one pays tax on the first &euro;209 earned per week compared to just &euro;97 under the rainbow Government. This has ensured that 68,000 low income earners have been removed from the tax net altogether as a result of the changes announced in last year's budget. The Government has matched its commitment to tax reductions for lower and middle income earners with a commitment towards helping the less well-off and disadvantaged in our society, the core political philosophy of this Administration.</P>
    <P>If we are returned to office following the next general election, we will ensure the marginalised and disadvantaged receive more and continued support in terms of the implementation of the Government's social welfare initiatives. We do not wish to build a society of the haves and have nots. The Government has sought to improve the standard of living of the elderly, carers and children and will continue to do so if successful in the next general election. It is difficult to believe that in 1997 the old age pension was just &euro;99. This year it amounts to more than &euro;147. For the second year in a row, there has been a special increase of more than &euro;15 for widows and widowers aged 66 or over in order to progress these rates in line with the level of the old age contributory pension.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the specific provisions of the Bill. Section 2 brings the financial commitment of the State for child benefit to &euro;1.44 billion, which is almost three times the financial commitment of the rainbow Government. In 1997, only £397 million was spent on such important payments. As a result of the changes being announced today, the monthly child benefit rate for the first two children is being increased by &euro;31.80 per month, and the monthly rate for the third child and subsequent children is being increased by &euro;38.10 per month. These increases bring the monthly rates to &euro;117.60 and &euro;147.30, respectively. These are sizeable increases by any standard.</P>
    <P>In simple terms, what the increases mean for a family with three children is that, after April 2002, they will receive &euro;380.50, which is an increase of 36% on the existing received payments. These substantial payments fulfil the Government's financial commitments as set out in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which is committed to further increasing these payments in the future.</P>
    <P>The level of support this Government gives to child benefit is a clear indication of the importance that it attaches to improving the quality of life and standard of living of families and children. There has been much debate as to what is the best and fairest method to improve State payments for children. Increasing the level of child <Col N="1045" /> benefit is the fairest and most equitable option open to the Government, as opposed to dealing with it on a tax-credit basis.</P>
    <P>In 1997, the child benefit increase for a family with three children was only £7 per month. By means of the Government's commitment to children and families, a similar family will now receive an increase of &euro;100 on the basis of the payments of this year and last year alone. This Bill brings forward the effective date for the 2002 increase to April next. However, for administrative reasons, the month of May will be the earliest time at which it will be possible to make such child benefit payments to parents.</P>
    <P>The Government is also introducing changes for entitlement to child dependant increases payable with short-term social welfare payments, such as disability and unemployment benefits. At present, such increases cease to be payable once a child reaches his or her 18th birthday.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that, from April next, where the child is receiving a full-time education, those increases will continue to be paid until the following 13 June.</P>
    <P>Ever since the Government came to office, it has had a strong commitment to improving the support for carers. In fairness to the previous speakers who have spoken on this topic, I wholeheartedly agree with them &ndash; I say that sincerely. As a Fianna Fáil backbencher, I would love to see the day when the means test will be abolished. I mean that sincerely because I have come across very sad cases, as have Deputies from all sides of the House. I know there is a very big sum involved. Be that as it may, I would love to see the means test abolished and I hope that day will come.</P>
    <P>I do not want to touch on the debate categorising the different beneficiaries of State payments, but there is no group more worthy of support than carers. Carers play a pivotal role in our society in caring for families, loved ones, friends, neighbours and local community members. It is only right and proper that this Government should continue to make sizeable increases to the level of the carer's benefit and the annual respite care grant.</P>
    <P>Although much progress has been made in improving the support being given to carers, this must be viewed as an ongoing process of continued and improving State support. I firmly believe that much credit for the recent increases must go to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who has done so much in securing increased financial support for carers. As a result of changes introduced over the past five years, the number of carers receiving the carer's allowance and carer's benefit has more than doubled from 9,700 to more than 19,000. Expenditure on these programmes has increased by more than 180%. Disregards have been increased this year from April. From April, a couple can have a joint income disregard of &euro;382. This measure will increase the payment to more than 2,300 carers. It will also <Col N="1046" /> ensure that an estimated additional 3,400 carers will qualify for such payments.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the further enhancement in the amount of the respite care grant, which has been increased to &euro;635. There has been an increase of &euro;12 for carers in receipt of carer's allowance aged 66 years or over. The carer's benefit now stands at &euro;132.7 per week. In 2000, the Government initiated a study on long-term care funding, both in the private and public sectors, with a view to developing a strategy for future action.</P>
    <P>This Government's new health strategy proposes to reform existing arrangements to maximise support for home care. This strategy puts forward a number of other proposals concerning care planning, the greater availability of short-term respite care and the development of primary care services, such as domiciliary care and day-care services. We are committed to improving the role of carers and we will continue to do so if re-elected to Government after the next election. This Government is a caring Government. Its record across a whole range of policy programmes since it came to office speaks for itself. I support the provisions in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2002, and I hope all Members of the House will support the important and sizeable social welfare increases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Collins for allowing me time. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. It gives us an opportunity to nail the lie that has been proffered by the Opposition over many years that this Government is not interested in those who are in most need and that it caters only for those in the higher tax bracket. The facts speak for themselves. The last budget is a testament to our support and efforts to ensure that many people in the lower income bracket get a fair break.</P>
      <P>This Government is the one that increased the minimum wage. That was a very profound step in acknowledging the problems that existed in respect of people on low incomes. We now have a minimum wage system in place that guarantees a certain wage to anybody who works the average industrial week. Most of those people are now out of the tax bracket. If one examines recent history, it is fair to say this Government has made huge strides in ensuring that the most needy benefited substantially, be they on low pay or in receipt of social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable debate has taken place on the subject of child benefit. In the Seanad some years ago, when various reports were published on how to tackle poverty, particularly child poverty, it was felt that the most appropriate way to do so was by way of direct payments in terms of child benefit. I welcome the huge increases in recent years in child benefit. One of the problems in years gone by was that if people talked about employment, they lost entitlements straight away. That discouraged some people from entering the workplace because they would have lost out fin<Col N="1047" /> ancially. Now that we have direct child benefit &ndash; large child benefit payments &ndash; any barriers that may have existed in the past that discouraged people from taking up employment have been reduced.</P>
    <P>This year's budget provision for an increase of &euro;31.80 per month in the lower rate of the child benefit, payable in respect of the first two children, and an increase of &euro;38.10 in the higher rate, for the third child and subsequent children, is a recognition that larger families are at more risk of poverty. That is based on the ESRI report of the 1990s. The increases indicate how we addressed an obvious need. It seems that larger families are more susceptible to poverty. People with more children are more susceptible to poverty. Child benefit is the most obvious way of addressing that.</P>
    <P>As a Government backbencher, one could spend all day in this Chamber debating the positive aspects of this Government's budget of December and its statutory implementation in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2002.</P>
    <P>I, like my colleagues, have come across appalling cases with regard to carers. This sector of our society, which has made such a major contribution to the care of people with profound mental handicap and disability, deserves all the support we can give it. The Government has acknowledged this by addressing the issue of the carer's allowance. We would all love to see the removal of the means test for the carer's allowance. In a full year that would cost &euro;168 million. As we acknowledge the burdens placed on families I hope we will strive to ensure carers receive a fair reward for their efforts in caring for people who otherwise would have to be cared for by the State.</P>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance which was published in October 1998 noted that the allowance is an income support and not a payment for caring. The report examined the means test and considered that it should be maintained as a way of targeting resources towards those most in need. However, the introduction of income disregards was also recommended and these were first introduced in August 1999, with a disregard of &euro;95.33 per week applied to the income of a single carer and &euro;190.46 per week to the joint means of a married couple. Budget 2000 made provision for the increase in the disregard to &euro;158.72 for a single person and &euro;317.44 for a couple. The effect of this year's change is to increase income disregards to &euro;191 for a single person and to &euro;382 for a couple, an increase of &euro;32 and &euro;64, respectively. We still have a long way to go and I urge future Governments to address the question of carers as a priority and to ensure all carers are given the supports they deserve.</P>
    <P>Respite care is one of the most important services required by carers. Regular planned breaks and emergency cover can assist carers and reduce the stresses on them. A respite care grant of <Col N="1048" />&euro;253.94 was introduced in 1999. In recognition of the importance of respite care for carers this was increased to &euro;380 in budget 2000 and to &euro;507 in budget 2001. In addition, budget 2001 made provision for a double respite care grant for those caring for more than one person. I am sure every Deputy has come across cases of families who care for several people. These people make an enormous contribution and the State owes them not only gratitude but also financial payment.</P>
    <P>Difficulties arise in some areas where people who are entitled to free travel may not travel at certain times. These difficulties must be addressed. Many hospital clinics are held early in the morning but an elderly person must wait until a certain time to use his or her bus pass. All citizens, whether paying for a bus ticket or entitled to travel free, should have equal access to public transport.</P>
    <P>I found it extraordinary to see Opposition Deputies in my constituency falling over each other in their rush to announce the new social welfare provisions to the electorate. However, they forgot to point out that it was the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government which had implemented these major increases. Some cynics accuse the Government of trying to purchase an election victory, but the track record of the Government shows it to be pro-active in trying to combat poverty, create employment, take people out of the tax net, implement the minimum wage and ensure those who are most vulnerable receive increased payments.</P>
    <P>It is a privilege to speak on this Bill. I recall speaking in the Seanad some years ago when we debated an increase of £1.50 in the old age pension. This is an indication of the strides we have made. Deputies have said the number of people who have been taken out of unemployment, by Government policies, have freed up resources for increased payments to people on social welfare. This is happening. Funds are being transferred from people who are in employment to those in receipt of social welfare payments. We are also giving large sums of money back to people in employment, thanks to the Government's tax reductions and increased allowances.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I know when I canvass door to door in the weeks ahead these payments will be dear to my heart.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1049" />Some of the statistics cited would have baffled Garret FitzGerald in his prime. Speakers have made comparisons between today's payments and those of previous years. Deputy Kelleher recalled the time when an increase of £1.50 was given to old age pensioners, but it took a magnificent effort by the Government of the time to grant that increase. We all remember the gospel story of the widow's mite. We have just come through an economic boom when the Government enjoyed a surplus of &euro;2 billion and was able to pay off the national debt. All past Governments were obliged to add to the national debt. The PR people who write these scripts should compare like with like. There is no point saying the Government gave an increase of 180% to social welfare recipients while the previous Government gave only smaller amounts, because we are living in a different world from that of the past.</P>
    <P>I also ask the scriptwriters to stop writing about bringing payments back to January of this year. They should begin by saying the trouble started when Deputy Charles Haughey, as Taoiseach, postponed payments to the end of the year. If one follows the logic presented by speaker after speaker on the Government side one must argue that people will lose out next year if the payments are not brought forward even further, to October. A 12 month payment is a 12 month payment, whether it runs from January to January or from April to April. The original payment which was postponed is the one which caused the trouble. There is a gain in the year when the payment is brought forward to January but only in that year. Following the logic of these prepared scripts, the Minister would have to bring payments forward to November or December next year to give the same impression of gain. It means the Minister will have to bring it forward to November or December next year to give the same impression of gain. The amount of rubbish spoken about it is unbelievable, and all of it dreamed up by just one person.</P>
    <P>Many speakers have spoken about carers so I will not dwell on the issue. However, last week I received a letter from a person who was refused carer's allowance. She is caring for her mother who has Alzheimer's disease, a heart problem and weighs about five stone. She is so weak that when she fell she damaged her leg and now she is immobilised. The carer is appealing the decision and I have written a letter for her that will not please somebody in the decision making office. This is the type of thing that happens. Deputy Kelleher spoke of the value carers have given. If all the people who care for their elderly parents and relatives decided to stop their work, it would cost the State a fortune to put the cared for people in hospitals. Carers give marvellous value. The difficulty is that some of them who have genuine cases are refused the allowance on technicalities.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to discuss the provision for widows, an issue I constantly raise, including during yesterday's Question Time. There is now a <Col N="1050" /> two tier system for widows, one for those under 66 years of age and one for those over 66 years. I cannot understand why this is so and neither can the widows under 66 years of age whose husbands paid PRSI under the impression that their spouses would get a widow's pension. I have been paying PRSI for more than 40 years and I was not told that the amount of money my wife would receive would depend on when she became a widow. That is wrong.</P>
    <P>In 1935, with the introduction of the principal Act, widows received widow's pension until they reached old age pension age. In 1962 the age limit was removed. In 1998 this two tier system was introduced. It is a contributory pension and if people are elderly they should be declassified as widows and deemed to be old age pensioners. The widows are up in arms over this issue. The Minister told me yesterday that he increased the bereavement grant from £100 to £500, which is excellent, and allocated an additional £2,500 to the widowed parent's grant in the last budget. It was hard to put a question to the Minister because there is nobody better at repeating the mantra of the increases he has made, regardless of what one asks him. I tried but failed to ask him if it is retrospective to all widows under 66 years. It is not; it only applies to people who were widowed in the past year or two.</P>
    <P>Many widows are under 66 years of age. Some are in their 20s because, unfortunately, widowhood is not decided by age. People are widowed in their 20s, 30s and 40s and many of them have three or four children. These people are receiving the low rate of widow's pension while widows over 66 years are invariably in a position where their grown children can help them if necessary. In normal circumstances they certainly will not have the expense of looking after dependants. Young widows are doing all the work rearing their children and trying to get them educated but they are being treated as second class citizens. That is unacceptable and I will raise this issue again on Committee Stage. Unfortunately, I will not be able to raise it next year because I will not be here.</P>
    <P>I have a query about fostering. When I began teaching in 1957, I met a number of foster parents. They did marvellous work and I pay tribute to them. Some people might think there is money in it but 99% are foster parents out of kindness. They are marvellous people who give homes to orphans and other children. However, there has been a change in the system. I rang the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the fostering, orphanages and adoption sections. Nobody seems to know what is going on. Previously, orphaned children received an orphan's allowance. That had to be spent on them. In one case I was told it had to be saved and accounted for. The &euro;91 orphan's allowance appears to have gone into what seems to be a large increase in the foster care allowance. What is the position? Foster parents in the association are trying to sort it <Col N="1051" /> out but the Minister should offer an explanation of the exact situation regarding foster parents and the orphan's allowance.</P>
    <P>I could discuss many more elements of the Bill but I will give the rest of my time to Deputy McCormack, who will be here next year to speak on next year's budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in the hands of the electorate of west Galway. The real test of this Bill and of the budget is whether the gap between the rich and poor is narrowing or widening. Every test I have applied demonstrates that the gap is widening. It has widened over the five budgets this Government has introduced in its term of office.</P>
      <P>What did this budget do for people on social welfare? What did it achieve in narrowing the gap between rich and poor? What did it do for people with medical cards? Is entitlement to medical cards easier or more restrictive as a result of this Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill? Is the person with a medical card who wishes to work five or six hours a week, work that will not interfere with their social welfare entitlement, likely to be refused a medical card in future because he or she has the initiative to work for those hours? That is the reality facing people with medical cards.</P>
      <P>People on social welfare are on waiting lists for everything. There are 50,000 people on the housing waiting lists throughout the country, 2,000 of them in Galway city and county. What has this Bill done to improve their status? Nothing. The waiting time for housing in Galway city is now five years. The waiting lists for orthodontic treatment have not been reduced in the course of the five budgets introduced by this Government. People waiting for orthodontic treatment cannot afford to have the treatment carried out privately because generally they are on social welfare or on low incomes.</P>
      <P>When this Government came into office, the waiting time in the Western Health Board area was 18 months. It is now five years. Is that a record of which the Government should be proud? Has this Bill done anything to address that record? Sadly, no. The same applies to hospital waiting lists &ndash; they are as long now as when this Government took office five years ago. That is the real test. This has occurred at a time of unprecedented prosperity and budget surpluses. I do not know what the Government did with the surpluses but, as far as the people on social welfare and on the waiting lists are concerned &ndash; they tend to be the same people &ndash; they have been squandered.</P>
      <P>There is now a waiting list to get on a waiting list. In the Western Health Board area, for example, the consultants&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;which this Bill was supposed to cure.</P>
      <P>Let us get back to the people on social welfare. I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, is present for this debate because I am blue in the face raising an important issue with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern. I have raised the plight of carers at every opportunity over the past five years and will continue to do so. Most speakers have referred to carers, including Government backbenchers. I searched the entire Bill for references to carers and they are only mentioned in the context of a slight increase in the respite care grant, which I very much welcome.</P>
      <P>However, what will be done about the position of a carer who looks after a relative of her husband, who is doubly incontinent and bed ridden 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, in their home? Unfortunately, if her husband dies, she qualifies for the widow's pension. Immediately upon qualifying for the widow's pension, despite continuing to care full-time for her dead husband's relative, she loses the carer's allowance. I have asked the Minister to address this issue in every one of the five Social Welfare Bills he has introduced and the five budgets brought forward by the Government, yet my request has been ignored. I have tabled parliamentary questions on the issue and raised it on the Adjournment, at the Committee of Public Accounts and everywhere else I have met officials of the Department. I also made a submission on it to the review group established four or five years ago to address the carer's allowance scheme. However, this is a simple request. There could not be more than 50 or 60 carers who have been widowed and continue as carers. I cannot understand the reason the problem has not been addressed. It is an insult to a carer who is prepared offer his or her services.</P>
      <P>Community welfare officers are very insensitive when they interview people for the carer's allowance means test. They have been invited on occasion to go to the room of the person being cared for, but have not got the slightest interest in doing so because the person concerned might be a 90 year old man or woman who is confined to bed. However, they want to know how much money the person who works as a carer earns from cattle sales and so on. They should be much more sensitive to the trauma and difficulty of caring for someone, particularly someone who is bed ridden, because it is a 365 days a year job with the exception of the provision of two weeks' respite care, which is very much welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" />Many changes could be made and I want the issue to be addressed. The Department should be less restrictive. I do not say abolish the means test because that is an easy way out, but means tests should be more generous and greater allowances should be made because the person who is caring at home in the instance I have outlined does not benefit from a spouse's income. They care for elderly people in their own environment for as long as is physically possible which means they do not require institutional care, which in the long run would cost the State much more than a generous application of the means test for carer's allowance. It would cost the State much less if the means test were abolished entirely because fewer people would have to be placed in institutional care since carers would be recognised for looking after people in their own homes.</P>
    <P>I refer to rent allowance, which is not covered by the legislation. I have asked on a number of occasions that the same rules of social behaviour be applied to recipients of rent supplement as apply to those living in local authority housing.</P>
    <P>Some rural Members have referred to the free travel scheme. A free travel pass is no good to a pensioner in Letterfrack, Ballyconneely, Carraroe, Lettermullan or Lettermore in my constituency where there is no bus service. There is no possibility of them availing of the free travel scheme. I refer to another anomaly. If a pensioner who has a free travel pass dies and his widow is aged under 65 years, she will be given a free pass, but she could have a neighbour, who has been separated from her husband for years and left her to rear the family struggling on her own, who does not qualify for the free pass. I ask the Minister to address this anomaly in the next Social Welfare Bill, although he will not be in office.</P>

      <P>Many Opposition Members have outlined the various measures in the budget and offered the usual criticism of the increases introduced by the Minister. However, I have never seen the publication of as much literature by Opposition Members under the heading &ldquo;Know Your Rights&rdquo;. The literature provides a list of what has been done by the Government over the past five years, in particular, in the last budget. If the news was not good, none of these leaflets would be printed by the Opposition and if the budget was that bad and the disaster outlined by a number of earlier speakers, no Opposition Member would want to publish the bad news and deliver it to the homes of constituents. However, the opposite is the case. The Government has carried out a radical overhaul of many <Col N="1054" /> social welfare payments. Over the past five years there has been a significant change in approach in terms of the benefit provided and the delivery of services.</P>
      <P>No other Department has applied changes in information technology and efficiency of service as well as the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Information is easy to access and any Member who has a query regarding a parliamentary question is dealt with immediately and efficiently. The Opposition must acknowledge the people we serve and the officials with whom we must engage for one reason or another in the Department are satisfied that the service is delivered without delay. I commend the Minister and his staff, as I have done on many occasions, for the efficiency of service and the contribution they have made to bringing this Department from a state of inefficiency to where it is today. Many people benefit from that. This needs to be underlined and repeated because without the type of information flow that takes place and without the engagement the Minister has with public representatives and the people, there would not be the respect there is for that Department today.</P>
      <P>Unemployment here has fallen dramatically and the numbers of unemployed are minuscule when compared to the late 1980s and early 1990s. Many more people are now employed and considerably less people need to draw unemployment benefit. In spite of the reduction in numbers, the spend in the Department has increased from £4.5 billion in 1997 to £7.4 billion in 2002. The significance of that is that the money is being spent directly on benefit and is benefiting people and families. That must be acknowledged.</P>
      <P>The Minister has ensured a good broad spread of the money to take in as many people and families as possible who require support within the remit of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. That speaks volumes because it is an attempt to reach out to those who are less well off and marginalised for one reason or another and find themselves coming to the State for assistance. The measure of the maturity of any state or government is how it treats the less well off in society. While there is always room for improvement and room to increase benefit, all political parties in this House should acknowledge that we are moving in the right direction.</P>
      <P>Many people got percentage increases in budgets over the years and sometimes these were considered to be too low. I am pleased that in the past five years the amount of money was increased by the Minister and that it was not just a percentage increase. That has brought about real increases in terms of money in people's pockets over those years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have an issue with the appeals system within the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Where a client of the Department needs to appeal a benefit, there is too much bureaucracy involved. It is often said that doctors differ and patients die. General practitioners and consultants may give support to a client making <Col N="1055" /> an application to the Department, but the benefit is then turned down and goes into the appeals system which can drag on endlessly. Consultants or doctors on the Department side take issue with what is being said and, in the middle, a family or a person is suffering. While the support is there during the process of the appeal, it can be a stressful time for anyone who is ill.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to review that process and perhaps restructure or approach it in a way that is more customer and user friendly. We should use the reports already available, particularly when they are from general practitioners or consultants and support the applicant's case. I appreciate there has to be an argument because it is an appeals system, but we should be more humane in the way we treat applicants. I ask the Minister to look at the centres that are used throughout the country. We must deal with these appeals in a very professional way and all the documentation from both sides must be considered, but we could be more customer friendly.</P>
    <P>There are some problems with the rent allowance scheme and how the local authorities are engaged with it. This issue does not lie directly with the Minister but it comes from his Department. Millions of pounds are being spent by the Department on rent allowance. If the various Departments came together we might find housing schemes or other methods to address the issue rather than simply paying rent allowance. There must be a better way to deal with accommodation problems and the issue requires the involvement of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and perhaps the Department of Health and Children. All those Departments should be brought together to establish greater efficiency in the way money is spent through a more direct resolution to an accommodation problem. When that scheme was started it cost around £5 million, but it now costs several millions of pounds and if this is not addressed, it will spiral out of control. The accommodation problem has not been resolved and that needs to be tackled.</P>
    <P>I know the old age contributory pension of £116 or &euro;147.30 compares favourably in absolute terms to 1997 when it was £78. However, more needs to be done for the elderly. Even though the economy is sluggish and we are waiting for things to pick up and move on again, by comparison to the 1980s we still have a booming economy. In many areas we have more favourable numbers than our European neighbours. Our economy is successful. There may be an occasional hiccough, as happens even with a successful business, but we are dealing with those. The elderly laid the foundation for the boom in our economy and made a contribution in darker days. Many of them had a very poor quality of life and we should reflect on the lifestyle of our parents and grandparents if only to remind us that our economy and wealth came from those days and was not solely of our creation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" />While we have made great strides and there have been considerable increases under the ministry of Deputy Dermot Ahern, much more needs to be done. Elderly people do not feel secure in their homes today and live in a society that is perhaps indifferent to them. Tenants in local authority housing estates change all the time and the elderly people who remain can often feel vulnerable. I know there is a scheme for security systems and personal panic button alarms, but we must continue to invest in that area.</P>
    <P>There is a serious problem with the heating of elderly people's homes in local authority housing schemes. Between the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Social, Community and Family Affairs, something innovative needs to be done to make funds available to deliver a proper heating system in such homes. It could be prioritised by delivering it to homes where the elderly person is sick or very old. We need to return to elderly people what they gave to our generation during our economic development.</P>
    <P>Heating is essential and is being installed in newly constructed houses. However, particularly for elderly people who live in local authority houses, there is a need for the local authority to fund the heating system. The fuel allowance is another issue which needs to be examined and brought up to date.</P>
    <P>If there is an argument for interdepartmental co-operation, it is in the area of DPG schemes, the housing aid for the elderly scheme and the essential repairs grant scheme. It is mostly elderly people who look for assistance. One would imagine these people were getting a fortune given the amount of form filling and inspection which takes place. However, they get only a small amount of money to contribute to a project within their homes which will make them warmer, safer or habitable in some cases. An interdepartmental group should ensure that the amount of bureaucracy involved in the delivery of those schemes to the elderly is minimised. That would help the elderly. It is not a huge budgetary matter, but a matter of how we deliver the product from the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Environment and Local Government to elderly people who need to be looked after. The Departments of the Environment and Local Government, Health and Children and Social, Community and Family Affairs should be brought together to ensure we deliver a more efficient service. The same is true of the medical cards. I agree with extending the medical cards to people over 70 years of age. Perhaps we should reduce the age to 65 and start looking after people in that age bracket.</P>
    <P>As regards the carer's allowance, I have heard many backbenchers and people on the Opposition benches asking for the means test to be eliminated. One must go back to the beginning of any benefit scheme to see how we have progressed. We have made great strides since it was introduced in 1990. The carer's allowance has had <Col N="1057" /> a positive impact on many families. We cannot thank the carers enough for the job they have undertaken. They have dramatically reduced the costs to the State. Perhaps a point which has been missed is that they have also done a great deal for families. They introduced a value into family life by looking after parents, grandparents or whoever requires care. I know the Minister will remain in office after the next election and I hope he continues the job he has undertaken over the past five years and accelerates the pace of investment in this area. The increases were implemented by the Minister over the past five years. I understand the reason for maintaining a balance in the means test, but we must continue to reach out to people. We must be determined to review the increases in the allowance in future budgets.</P>
    <P>We also need to review the annual respite care grant. I welcome the increase from £100 to £400 and the fact that one person can receive a double respite grant of £800, which is built into this year's budget. However, we can improve that. Everyone needs a break from their job. There is nothing more stressful than being a carer. A carer is not only responsible for himself or herself but for the person for whom he or she is caring. Respite is essential for carers because of the amount of work they do. I welcome the efforts being made by the Department in that regard.</P>
    <P>As regards child benefit and family support, the work the Department is doing in family resource centres has had a major impact on communities. The grant given to such centres to enable them to organise women's and men's groups and child care has had a positive impact on communities. There are a number of them in County Kilkenny, such as those in Clogh and Newpark Close and the Fr. McGrath centre. Many people feel they are trapped in a cycle of poverty and cannot get out. The family resource centres have broken that cycle. They have made it possible for people to understand there is a way out. The money advice bureaux have been a big help for those who still feel trapped. People are taught in these centres about how to manage money. They are used as local community centres by people who once had nothing to do. The Minister must be commended for that initiative. I hope the Minister will continue to fund that initiative because it has been a wonderful resource for people and it has made a major contribution to their lives.</P>

      <P>The party which pledged in 1997 to put people before politics has not shown much of that philosophy in relation to the staff and customers of An Post. The Minister has repeatedly spoken about a commitment to a national postal network and about her opposition to the forced closure of post offices both in rural and urban areas. However, she is not doing anything about it and is undermining by stealth the national postal network of more than 1,800 officers in sub-post offices and An Post workers. The Minister categorically rejected the main recommendation of the Flynn report on the future of the postal network last year. The basis of this proposal is that Government funds would be required to keep the existing network in place. She has done absolutely nothing about her promise to establish Government service outlets in areas not serviced by postal agencies. Fianna Fáil's so-called progress report on its four wasted years in office, which appeared last summer, clearly stated that the Government agreed that in situations where <Col N="1061" /> it is impossible to continue a post office on an agency basis, a Government service outlet would be developed. However, speaking in the Dáil on 17 October last, the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, said that should no postal agency be established in an area the concept of a Government service outlet would be explored. It is clear that for the Government this concept is merely scattered about when local communities express concerns about their post offices.</P>
      <P>A post office is a vital element in the social fabric of any community. This is equally true for urban as well as rural areas, even if the emphasis is different. A post office is not just a place to avail of the services provided by An Post, it is also a place for people, particularly the elderly, to meet. There is much more involved in drawing up a policy on the sub-post office network than just considering its commercial viability.</P>
      <P>The Minister has frequently stated that post offices will not be forced to close. This means little in reality when post offices which are closed down, for whatever reason, do not reopen. It will be impossible to recruit post office staff unless a decent standard of living is assured. In my constituency, post offices are a constant source of concern to the people I represent. For example, the post office in Terenure village was closed for many months. It proved incredibly difficult to find a replacement premises and it was equally difficult to obtain a commitment from someone to manage the post office. Thankfully this situation has been resolved. However, in the months when there was no local service there was a huge level of concern among people and an enormous amount of inconvenience was caused.</P>
      <P>Not too far away in Crumlin and Walkinstown there is another crisis in the post office service. The accommodation and space provided for the running of the post offices in these localities is completely inadequate. It is not unusual to find people queuing in cold or wet weather on a very narrow footpath, or on occasion on the road and at risk of being knocked down by oncoming traffic, to gain entry to the post office. This is a regular occurrence. The people queuing are the most vulnerable, namely, the elderly, the unemployed, and young mothers with small children. These people are seeking a professional service and facility. What is being offered in these and a number of other sub-post offices in my constituency is far from satisfactory, much less state of the art. This is not to reflect on hard-pressed staff who work there; far from it. However, the facilities are appalling and it is impossible to provide a satisfactory level of service in the circumstances. In some of the areas to which I refer, the bank branches are also closing and the heart of the village community is being destroyed. It is those who most need these services who are being denied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The future of the sub-post office is not, as already stated, just about economic viability. It is about serving the community and ensuring that <Col N="1062" /> local structures are retained. Within those structures there is an opportunity to meet the long-established needs of the community where a social service of a sort is available for elderly people in particular. However, there is also an opportunity to marry that need with the commercial development of the post office service through the provision of services such as ATM facilities, e-commerce facilities, etc. I sincerely hope that this is the direction we will take and not proceed with the closure, forced or otherwise, of any of our sub-post offices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Upton for sharing time with me. I wish to make a number of comments on this important motion.</P>
      <P>The statement by the Minister some time ago, repeated by her colleagues in my constituency, that there would be no forced closure of post offices could be couched in terms of her stating &ldquo;I will allow them to wither on the vine&rdquo;. While there have been no forced closures, there has been an inordinate delay in providing capital investment, restructuring, retraining and technological innovation in post offices to enable them to be viable.</P>
      <P>I wish to draw attention to a point which should be debated widely, not just in rural areas but also in urban areas. I refer to the assumption that universal postal delivery and universal access to postal facilities can be changed in two phases by 2003 and 2006, respectively. It is one of the fundamental rights of citizenship to communicate. A person in a remote rural area who might be elderly is entitled to receive a letter or a package. It cannot be argued that the citizenship rights of such a person, who may live in a remote area, can be eroded by stating that the postal service has to be liberalised to a degree to which people will be able to enter into a contract to supply postal services and cream the market &ndash; pursue the most lucrative aspects of the market &ndash; and leave An Post, which is a State body, in deficit and the service it provides to wither.</P>
      <P>I wish to be positive in what I say and I believe a number of positive steps could be taken. The future of post offices should be considered within the terms of rural retention and renewal. We must also accept the fundamental principle of universal access of citizens and oppose the principle of reducing these rights to suit the needs of the marketplace and the implementation of a notion of liberalisation, which would have the net effect of reducing rights. For example, the banks, as everyone knows, are behaving disgracefully and are operating entirely on the basis of making profits. They are departing not just from rural areas but also from parts of cities where their profits are no longer viable. However, I do not have adequate time to speak about this disgraceful retreat by the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facilities provided by credit unions are sometimes limited by the unavailability of premises in remote and rural areas and in towns. Why could the Minister not come forward with posi<Col N="1063" /> tive proposals and suggest, for example, a scheme of subsidised rental or subsidised buy-out for such post offices as might be threatened with closure and their transfer to the League of Credit Unions? Why not allow the credit union movement expand in every location in which post offices are threatened? That would have the advantage of retaining services and providing a venue in which services could be expanded. It would also have positive benefits in terms of encouraging a form of social banking.</P>
    <P>There are other issues that arise in relation to post offices which are important. There is a suggestion that a post office can disappear and that its future can be regarded purely in terms of commercial criteria. In the rush to liberalisation, no cognisance has been taken of the social structure of the communities which post offices serve. Those who run post offices have long experience of dealing with elderly people, those with particular needs and those in receipt of different forms of State benefit. Their relationship with those who use their facilities is not merely commercial in nature; it is a profoundly human relationship. I am aware, from considering what has happened on the outskirts of Galway city, that when a post office closes a fundamental blow is struck against the social fabric of an area. Pensioners who made a certain kind of journey on a particular day are suddenly forced to move to a different venue.</P>
    <P>While the Irish Postmasters' Union has been willing to accept a pilot scheme in relation to agencies, we must consider where the indiscriminate liberalisation of that which was providing a social service is taking place. Should we sit back and allow the notion to take hold that supermarkets and other outlets will supply everything? I would prefer to buy a newspaper from a newsagent on the basis that newsagents are part of the social fabric. Every post office that is in danger of closing should be offered, in the first instance and as a going concern, to those providing an equivalent service. In my opinion the suggestion I made about offering them to the League of Credit Unions is worth pursuing. I hope the Minister will move from her position of allowing post offices to wither on the vine and take some positive action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Michael Kitt, O'Flynn, Cooper-Flynn and Conor Lenihan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I must state that my wife runs the post office in the village in which we live. I am, therefore, speaking from a position of knowledge <i>vis-à-vis </i>the operation of the post office network. Since I was elected to the Dáil, the Government commitment to the rural post office network has allowed the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, to ensure there will be no forced closure of post offices. In my constituency and in others throughout the country, several post offices were to close due to the retirement of a postmaster or postmistress. The Minister directed An Post management <Col N="1064" /> to ensure every effort was made to readvertise these posts with a view to retaining post offices in those rural communities. In County Laois several of the post offices were reopened in response to her direction to An Post management. Had she not intervened, those post offices would be long since closed, never to reopen. I welcome her commitment to the Flynn report and the recent forum established under his chairmanship.</P>
    <P>In relation to the rural post office network, the best development for many years was the agreement with the ESB to allow people to pay their ESB bills at their local post office where they can also pay their telephone bills now that many Eircom offices do not want the trouble of processing payments at their counters. This has brought additional business to An Post. These are initiatives that have been forced on the post office network by the Government.</P>
    <P>I am critical of An Post senior management which is not committed to the post office network in rural Ireland. As part of its preparation for the Flynn report, An Post produced various alternatives. One option was to close 400 branches, another to close a greater number, yet another to close practically every branch in rural Ireland. That is the view of An Post senior management. One of the key problems in relation to An Post is that senior management is not committed to its rural network and such commitment as it has is as a result of Government pressure.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that some recent business which An Post has secured has only gone to the automated offices, numbering about 1,000 or less than half the network. The other 1,000 offices, in the smaller villages, have not got the facility to handle many of the transactions in question, such as topping up mobile phones or operating the Government's new special instalment savings accounts. Smaller post offices can only hand out application forms to be used at a computerised office in the nearest town. The arrangement with the AIB is excellent, but, again, it does not apply to the 1,000 small post offices without computer systems. An Post management appears to have decided, some years ago, not to roll out the computer network to the smaller offices because it believes those offices should not be in place. Such a lack of commitment by An Post to its own local network is disappointing.</P>
    <P>Postmasters have recently been invited to apply for the voluntary redundancy scheme. In that context at a recent meeting in Tullamore some 30% of those present indicated an interest in a severance package. That is because they have not been properly remunerated, even though there has been some increase, and because An Post management is not providing proper facilities and business opportunities to make small post offices viable. It is not surprising that many of the older people want to get out if there is an attractive severance package on offer from An Post. I look forward to the completion of the three months trial period in order that people can <Col N="1065" /> assess the suitability of the package and discuss it with the postmasters union.</P>
    <P>It is important to retain the universal postal system whereby post is delivered to any location in the country for the same price. It is noteworthy that, where the waste management service has been privatised, those living in rural areas now only have a fortnightly collection &ndash; that will probably be reduced to once a month in another year or two &ndash; whereas those living in built-up areas have a weekly collection. An Post should not move in the direction of providing for different levels of service in rural and urban areas.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for her support for the An Post network. When An Post sets its mind to a particular task, it can perform very efficiently. One such example is the new SDS mail sorting and distribution centre in Portlaoise, one of the biggest sorting centres outside of the Dublin centre at Knockmitten Lane, Clondalkin. Millions of mail items are sorted each year and a very good service is provided. An Post should apply the same dedication to rural post offices, which should not be regarded as a burden but as part of its organisation for future development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. I share the view of other speakers on this side of the House that the Minister has been very positive in trying to promote the continuation of post offices in rural villages and towns. The post office is a focal point in a town or village. In my home village of Castleblakeney, when the postmaster retired last July, the local community was very anxious that the post office should continue to operate, but difficulties were put in our way by An Post management which is not as committed as it should be to rural Ireland. There are appalling delays in appointing a new person to take over the post office. I had to appeal to the family who ran the post office to continue for one month and, subsequently, for a further month. New appointments should not be made in this way. When a post office is without service for two months and people have to go to the next town to collect their social welfare payments, many may not return when a new local post office is put in place. Castleblakeney post office is now located in the local supermarket, which is an excellent arrangement, but some business has been lost due to the delay which occurred. That is wrong and I have been very critical of An Post in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement of new business for post offices, starting next Friday, in relation to the payment of ESB bills. The AIB banking transaction contract will also be available at post offices, including a range of services such as lodgements, withdrawals, AIB credit card bill payments and business lodgement services. That is very welcome. As Deputy Michael D. Higgins said, many banks are pulling out of smaller towns and, realistically, even the limited once weekly cash collection service currently being provided is not certain to continue indefinitely. Banks also <Col N="1066" /> cite the security implications of bringing large sums of money from smaller to bigger towns. There is a great opportunity for An Post to develop the role of local post offices in providing the banking services that are being withdrawn slowly but surely from the smaller towns.</P>
    <P>I commend the many post offices which, on their own initiative, even without Government support or any help from An Post, are getting involved in new business. I know of post offices which are providing photocopying and fax services which are badly needed in rural communities. One postmaster has told me he is handling mobile phone sales, another is providing a photographic processing service and yet another is supplying laminated signs for such purposes as planning permission notices. Perhaps there may even be further opportunities for the supply of signs in connection with the forthcoming general election.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging that new business is being made available to post offices and that post offices are seeking out new business on their own initiative. The new package referred to is a pilot scheme under which 26 offices will be operated. A full assessment of its success will be carried out before it is extended in any way. The package includes seven weeks' pay for every year of service which sounds good in theory, despite the disappointing fact that the payment is low in the first place. These operators can subsequently return on an agency basis and non-automated post offices can apply. Are we putting the cart before the horse here? Why do we not automate those post offices and install computers in them? There are computers in every school in the country and many homes have computers, yet there are thousands of post offices with no computer system. It is not right to tell people they should apply for this pilot scheme. They should get their computers in the first instance and operate on that basis and I hope that will be the case. Nonetheless, there is agreement between the Government, An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union to introduce the pilot scheme. The package is there and I am sure people will be interested in it considering the provision for seven weeks' pay for every year of service.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister for Public Enterprise has written to four Ministers asking them to consider channelling business to individual post offices from their Departments or agencies under their aegis. Moreover, I understand the Revenue Commissioners were also approached with this request. That is the way to go. If there is a positive response, post offices will remain the focal point of communities and will hopefully grow their businesses in the smaller towns and villages throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We must acknowledge that sub-post office staff work hard to provide a good service. Whether they are getting paid enough is another matter although they recently received a 12% increase. Given the services they provide and the staff they employ I do not know how they <Col N="1067" /> can operate on a commercial basis. We had a serious problem in Cork last August when our local post office in historic Shandon Street was due to close. The postmistress who had spent 14 years there said she had had enough and intended to retire. We found it difficult to find a suitable person with a suitable premises to take over the role of postmaster or postmistress. There was uproar in the community. People were devastated by the closure and were upset at having to move to a new post office. I have never seen such a number of people upset by the closure of a local post office. That puts into context how important is the role of the post office in the community.</P>
      <P>I was delighted that the chairperson of Shandon North Cathedral Community Association, Alice Morley, secretary, Joe Sheehan and I, together with my colleagues in the Dáil and Cork Corporation, were able to put our heads together and convince An Post that this post office had to remain open and that they had to try harder to recruit somebody to take it over. They did so and I acknowledge the role of the Minister for Public Enterprise in pressing An Post to ensure it found a replacement. The post office was not being forced to close, rather the postmistress was retiring. The Socialist Party put up posters stating it wanted the post office to remain open and it tried to take the credit. However, I can assure the House that it had no hand, act or part in keeping the post office open. This is a story with a happy ending because the post office reopened in November with a new, more modern premises and a new postmaster and is working out very well.</P>
      <P>I welcome the many initiatives introduced by the Minister for Public Enterprise through An Post to create a one-stop-shop and her commitment in her speech last night that there would be no forced closures of post offices. The Minister's actions have helped and will help to grow the post office network by increasing its services and I have no doubt that the 1,916 post offices and sub-post offices throughout the country will benefit from these initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The losses in 2001 and 2002 cannot be allowed to continue and An Post must get back to profitability or it will go under. An Post must increase its turnover or reduce its costs if it wants to survive and it is going the right way about it. I commend An Post on its SDS service which we use in our company in Cork. It is a fantastic door-to-door service which delivers on time. An Post is competing with commercial companies to provide this important service and is doing very well. I welcome the new commercial businesses on which An Post is embarking and the 26 pilot schemes for the post office agencies in shops, in particular the new AIB banking transactions contract which will allow people to make personal account lodgements, withdrawals, AIB credit card bill payments and business lodgement services. I welcome its successful tender for the ESB bill payment service &ndash; an important service which will commence in a few days &ndash; and the <Col N="1068" /> PostPoint system where people can top up their mobile phones in the different network offices throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I was fascinated by what my colleague Deputy Michael Kitt said about initiatives such as the pilot scheme which I welcome because it presents an opportunity for people to build their own businesses, providing services that are not provided in their own communities. I welcome the entrepreneurial flair being shown by the postmasters and postmistresses of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Coming from Mayo, which has a diameter of 140 miles, we have experienced many rural post offices in operation. We also have island communities which have had essential services provided through the rural post office network over many years. I compliment all the people who have been involved in the provision of this very important service for very little pay. We always heard complaints about the poor payment received for the provision of those services in rural sub-post offices. It is important to recognise the huge social importance of these post offices, not just in the provision of services to elderly people but in providing essential services to the community as a whole. This must be preserved and, in that context, I welcome the commitment of the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke in the White Paper on rural development in which she affirms that there will be no forced closures of post offices. This very important commitment from this Fianna Fáil-led Government must be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, if that commitment had existed under previous Administrations, the post office network might be in a better state. Following on from a point raised by a colleague, the commitment of senior management at An Post needs to be questioned because if the rural post office network is to survive and be seriously developed, it is vitally important that there is commitment at the highest possible level in An Post, not just because the Minister for Public Enterprise is beating on its door and forcing it upon people. It is important that senior management recognise the vital social service provided by post offices. One thing that stands out in my mind, having spoken to postmasters and postmistresses, is that they want to seize the business opportunity that is out there for them. They want to be automated and want to develop their businesses. They recognise that improvements must be made in the network if it is to return to profitability. In the environment in which we live and work, we all recognise that if serious losses occur, something must be done to address the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see great recognition of that among rural post offices that are anxious to proceed with automation. I welcome the fact that 1,000 sub-post offices will be automated, because this is the key to the service. Almost every ten year old child in the country is using a computer and operating on the Internet. It is almost unthinkable that a ser<Col N="1069" /> vice provided through a post office would not be fully automated, whether it is on Clare Island or in Dublin City &ndash; that service can be provided no matter where one is located. The beauty of the IT age is that no matter how remote one is, these essential services can be provided through automation.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister, particularly for commissioning the Flynn report. Rather than being ignored, as the Opposition asserts, this report has formed the basis for many of the improvements that are being carried out in the post office network. Following from that an interdepartmental group was established to set out the framework for the implementation of the Flynn report recommendations. I welcome these developments as a serious attempt by the Government to try and tackle the problems within the post office network.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the pilot scheme that has been set up for non-automated post offices, although I take on board Deputy Michael Kitt's point that automation is the key and it would be preferable to see all of these sub-post offices automated. Having said that, it is a pilot scheme and before it is expanded further it will be evaluated to see if it was successful. I recognise this as an attempt to move these sub-post offices towards profitability. I welcome the fact there is a severance package for older postmasters and postmistresses who have operated an essential service over the years and now wish to retire.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new business initiatives that have been made available through the post office network, particularly the AIB banking transaction contracts and the ESB bill payment at post offices. They are very important developments for the sustainability of post offices. The Minister has already been in contact with all Departments to see if more essential services can be provided through the post office network and a report on this is expected soon. That is an important step in the right direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to speak on post offices now. Deputy Stanton and I share a common concern for the social purpose of the post office and its important network both in rural and urban areas. I get a sense from many of the contributions, mostly from rural Deputies, that the viability of post offices is only a rural issue. It is not, and for that reason I joined Deputy Stanton on the committee on enterprise and small business in defeating the attempt by the Competition Authority to lift the ban on below cost selling. I believe small retailers, particularly post offices, serve an important commercial and social purpose in urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>In my own constituency we have a number of very important suburban retail shopping centres where the post office is vital to the viability of the shopping centre and the shopping centre itself is vital to the survival of any sense of community spirit in these locations. It is very important that we do not drive business from the small village or, indeed, the small suburban shopping centre to large retail outlets.</P>
      <P>One of the dangers here is that the political class &ndash; and I include all of us in this &ndash; often far too slavishly follow the diktats of the Competition Authority or the false god of competition. There is, and always has been, a tradition in Europe of supporting the small players &ndash; small retailers, post offices and other such commercial and state enterprises. This Government has fulfilled its mandate in that regard. The current Minister has moved to defend this network and build on its viability by providing a real future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we can see from the pilot programmes some will be run on a pilot basis with 26 in total run on an agency basis, which hopefully will be extended. The issues concerning automation are obvious and the role that the post office network can play in regard to electronic payments and the development of e-commerce and e-government is <Col N="1071" /> very important. The network is second to none and is an ideal vehicle through which State services can be delivered and made available through the Internet on a local basis. An Post management and the Minister need to look very closely at developing it.</P>
    <P>Moves by Allied Irish Bank in terms of transactions and the commencement by the ESB of its bill payment system in post offices are critically important. This is hugely important because it not only underpins the role of the post office but also allows the banks at a time they are closing branches to retain an involvement in communities. It is important that we develop that connection very strongly.</P>
    <P>We have a priority to defend not only post offices but also the integrity of our banking system. To have an Irish owned bank is an important control mechanism in one's economy and I fear for the day we might lose not only our post offices but Irish ownership of banks operating in the Irish market. That day may not be too far off, so it is important that we entwine the banks with the post offices in a relationship that makes it harder for foreign predators to come in and take over our banks. If they are linked to the social purpose of post offices it would be harder to take them over.</P>
    <P>I have never believed in fully open competition and do not agree with everything the Competition Authority says. It has made some rather misleading statements over the years, for instance, in regard to the ban on below cost selling in relation to small retailers. It also said some other foolish things in other areas but we probably do not have the time to go into those tonight. I praise the Minister, not just because she is my aunt, but because I believe she has made a commitment to the social purpose of the post office network.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before us is very timely. The Minister said the losses of the post office network <Col N="1072" /> could amount to &euro;100 million by 2004. It is timely, therefore, that, on the eve of a general election and what is possibly a long summer recess, we do all we can to keep the post office service operating. Many colleagues have expressed concern with regard to the closure of individual sub-post offices, but if action is not taken, not only will individual sub-post offices be at risk, the whole company will be endangered. It is obvious that An Post needs investment. Deputies on all sides of the House agree the company needs to be modernised and computerised. Many sub-post offices are not connected to the computer network and cannot get involved in many of the initiatives proposed by Deputies. It is imperative that all sub-post offices are connected.</P>
    <P>The Minister has commissioned three investigations into this area. There was the Flynn report, the interdepartmental working group and the partnership forum. I acknowledge this, but not much else has happened. Useful reports were brought forward, but there has been very little action by the Minister herself to support the post office network. At the same time, the network may lose up to &euro;100 million, a loss no company could sustain. Something has to give in the end. It is quite menacing that the Minister began last night by saying there would be no forced closures of post offices. She did not say she would ensure all post offices would remain open or that she would not stand idly by while post offices were closed. In saying there will be no forced closures the implication is that post offices will be allowed to close and that she will not assist them. That is what is happening.</P>
    <P>There is great uncertainty in the post office community. As many colleagues have said, in towns, villages and cities the post office is part of the infrastructure of the State and communities. It is essential that just as we maintain the road and rail networks, we also maintain this one. It should not be abandoned. Communication is vital. Communication by mail is not only vital, it is extremely complex. The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport recently considered a report dealing with extremely complicated international postal agreements. The amount of negotiation and expertise involved in putting it together was remarkable. We dealt with provisions to deal with the sending through the mail of dangerous and damaging substances, a matter which currently is extremely relevant. The post office has an expertise and an integrity that we cannot afford to lose.</P>
    <P>The withdrawal of banks from many rural and urban areas provides post offices with the opportunity to take up the slack. Post offices should, as we suggest in our motion, be allowed to carry on current account business. Those with cheques could then lodge and cash them at post offices. There is no reason driving licences and motor vehicle tax should not be renewable at post offices here, as is the case in other countries. The register of electors, which many Deputies have pointed out is often out of date, could be updated <Col N="1073" /> by local authorities with the help of postmen and women who know all those to whom they deliver letters. A low interest loan scheme over ten years is one way of providing the impetus for modernisation and an agreed redundancy scheme should also be put in place.</P>
    <P>There are many positive elements to the motion before the House and I ask the Government not to vote against it. An Post is an essential part of our infrastructure and we must do all we can to modernise and support it.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Jim Higgins for moving the motion and outlining its proposals in detail. Rural post offices have provided a great service. They have acted, not only as a public service, but as a social service to many single and lonely people. Their closure, if it is the will of the Minister, will have major implications. Postmasters and postmistresses have survived on a pittance, worked long hours and kept enormously detailed records, often for less money than the pensioners to whom they disbursed payments. Many do not recognise how minimal was the salary paid to them for the service they gave during the years. The Minister has stated clearly she hopes they will wither away. She will not prevent the closure of post offices. There needs to be an agreed redundancy package for those who may have to close, or who may want to get out of the business at this stage. Whether they are postmasters or postmistresses, if they do not wish to continue, they should get something to recompense them for the extraordinarily low level of pay they received during the years.</P>
      <P>It is not the cost of rural post offices that has got An Post into financial difficulty. An Post may need help to maintain rural post offices and if it does, that should be the Government's priority. Without the rural post offices, often linked to the local shop, there would not be a focal point in communities for many elderly and lonely people and the cost to the nation would be great. The person behind the counter knows that when someone does not turn up on a daily or twice-weekly basis they need to be checked up on. They are in constant contact, over the telephone and otherwise, with all the people concerned. The forced closure of 900 post offices by the Minister must be prevented, as must the destruction of rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>There are computers in every school; why are they not in post offices? That would allow them to increase the number of services they offer. Over the last five years the Minister has sat idly by, but we were given the great news tonight that she has written to four or five of her Cabinet colleagues to ask them to provide more services for post offices. I was delighted to hear the famous Cork representative, Deputy O'Flynn, who is so outspoken on all issues&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;admit that he had to involve the Minister herself in order to have a post office reopened in his constituency.</P>
      <P>An Post must be competitive, but that should not be at the expense of rural post offices. My mother was a nurse in Dublin in the 1930s and could post a letter home to the country at 7 p.m. to arrive at 9.30 a.m. the next morning. That is the sort of postal service we need. If that level of service is restored, the company will get the business it needs to be profitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>An Post will not save rural Ireland but, if it is given the opportunity, rural Ireland may well save An Post. There is an insidious movement involving professional organisations including An Taisce and some fishery boards, to deny people the right to live in rural Ireland. The post offices are the life blood of rural Ireland and other centres of commerce and activity.</P>
      <P>The Government should set out its stall by saying that it and the Members of the Oireachtas want to have post offices in as many places as possible. It is perfectly obvious that fairly significant numbers of people running post offices are elderly people who really do not want to continue, but they continue because of tradition and it is part of a way of life for them. It is scandalous that many of those postmasters and postmistresses have had to ask business people to buy quantities of stamps on umpteen occasions to boost their income because income was determined by the rate of sale of stamps.</P>
      <P>The former Minister of State, Deputy Donal Carey, who had responsibility for this area under the Department of the Taoiseach, drew up a comprehensive plan to save rural post offices and to provide them with alternative business on a range of fronts. When this Government took office, that ministry of state was transferred from under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach into the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and this plan was rejected by virtue of the fact that no money was provided to implement it. Where lies the CLÁR programme to resuscitate and rejuvenate rural Ireland, part and parcel of which is the rural post offices?</P>
      <P>There is a future for many of the post offices and for many people who work in them, but there is a need for a re-vamped statement of intent and, moreover, a guarantee by this Government of such a future. Then it might be possible for younger members of families of postmasters and postmistresses and others, who would see this as an ideal opportunity, to build a commercial foundation and to create a life in rural Ireland dealing with people who would be enabled to live there if we had a slightly more enlightened approach towards the kind of country we want in the times ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important motion. The post office is at the heart of the rural community. The post office, together with the schools, the garda station, the church and the doctor's sur<Col N="1075" /> gery, is the life blood of rural communities. If we take away those services from rural life, we will take away the real heart of rural Ireland and it will close up.</P>
      <P>We must acknowledge the quality, the integrity and the dedication of postmasters and post mistresses down through the years. They have done a tremendous job in every community up and down the country. Although many of them were on small incomes, they saw themselves as providing the post office to look after the way of life in rural Ireland. They did all the things that have been mentioned here already. They provided contact for people in rural areas. They looked after people in rural areas. They made sure that people were out and about and up and around. They provided a commercial service but it was also an important social service.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately this Government is doing very little to keep that service in operation in rural Ireland. In the same way as the Government is closing Garda stations and is not helping rural schools to remain open by not providing the necessary extensions, etc., it is helping with this proposal to bring about a decline in rural life in Ireland. Such is the state of rural life that recently I saw that there were no applicants for a doctor's post advertised in a rural community. It is a sad commentary on our modern society that we do not provide the services to keep rural life alive.</P>
      <P>What can we do? There are a range of services which can be offered by post offices in rural communities. If they were computerised and brought on-line to provide automated services, they could provide many of the services people need. As previous speakers said, they could process motor tax applications, driving licence applications and other such services. All the Government services could be provided by the local post offices on a fee per item basis. The local authorities could do a great deal more to bring the post offices into the picture and they could provide services through the local post office network. After all, there are postmasters and postmistresses doing their jobs in post offices in virtually every village and small community around the country. When one considers the service they provide five and a half days a week, and the out of hours services they often provide to facilitate local neighbours in those localities, they do a tremendous service and we should commend them for that. Instead of presiding over the winding down of those services, the Government should boost them and help them to survive and thrive in this new century.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>It shows how far from reality this Government has moved when the Minister can come in here and arrogantly stand over a decision taken at Cabinet to close rural post offices. It shows that the Mercs, the helicopters and the jets have taken them into the clouds and they no longer realise the needs of people in rural Ireland. Thankfully too much damage will not be <Col N="1076" /> done in the next ten weeks and a Fine Gael led Government will restore the post offices and improve the service to people in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>Not everybody in remote areas and small communities owns a car. There are one car families where the husband goes off in the morning at 7 o'clock to earn an income and the stay at home wife is left to look after the household. She must go into the local post office, which generally is attached to a small shop where she gets what she needs for the household. There are other services which could be provided there, as Deputy McGrath pointed out. Why can they not use the post office to pay motor tax, get a driving licence or pay the ESB bill directly? Why does the post office not dispense the range of application forms for the various services available? I am only thinking of a few items. Is there anybody in the Government to advise this Minister or does she ever get out of the tub this weather to see what is needed in rural Ireland? All she needs is simply advice on what can be done. Expand the services and the people will respond.</P>
      <P>I have always supported the rural post offices. On my local radio station I have encouraged people to do as much business as they can in them but they say there is very little they can do in the post office except collect their parents' pensions. However, there is more which should be done and can be done. Provide the service and the people will respond.</P>
      <P>The post office is the lifeblood and the focal point of a rural community. It is wrong of the Minister to close post offices and the Government will not get away with it. The people will react. Thankfully 9 May is coming and a new dawn is shining. People will realise that it is time to close down this Government and to open up a new opportunity.</P>
      <P>People will come to live in a remote rural community but they will do so only where there are services provided. That is the bottom line. Taking away the services discourages people from coming to live outside of the towns and villages. In outlying areas it is well nigh impossible to get services such as a water supply and in the towns the people are choked by traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The life blood of a rural community is its people and they will respond to positive initiatives. Any thought given to the kind of services a post office can provide would show that every activity in a post office is chartered as a unit and every unit brings in income to the postmaster or postmistress. The postmasters and postmistresses have done sterling work in the past. They are living on a pittance, providing a social service for which they have not been compensated. In the time of the Celtic tiger economy and the prosperity about which we have heard so much &ndash; much of which has been blown by the Government &ndash; why was the income of postmasters and postmistresses not increased in order that the post offices could be maintained and why did An Post not look at what is being provided and <Col N="1077" /> broaden the agenda in order that the people would respond?</P>
    <P>The people will not accept what the Minister is doing. It is arrogance on her part. She should be here listening to our concerns and she should address those concerns. It is not acceptable to me and it is not acceptable to the people I represent. I hope it will not happen in the short term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate and I congratulate Deputy Higgins on tabling the motion. The role of the post office is crucial to rural Ireland. It is crucial to urban areas but it is rural areas which are in danger of having their post offices removed. The Minister has announced 1,100 redundancies and many of these will occur at sub-post offices in rural areas. There is a prediction that up to 900 post offices will close in rural areas. This is a disgrace and will remove an important service to many communities. The post office is much more than just the postal service. It has been used by people for generations and there is much more to it than just selling stamps. The changes in the postal service and the role of the postman have been detrimental to rural areas. There was a time when the postman fulfilled a social need by calling on elderly people. That has changed and now he puts letters in a box at the end of the road.</P>
      <P>The level of payment to sub-post offices is starving people out of the business. In my constituency, in Knockaderry and other places, it was not worthwhile for people to take on the post office when the postmistress or postmaster retired. Last year, two post offices, Croagh and Loghill, were to be closed by the Minister, but, under pressure, she relented and kept them open.</P>
      <P>It is a disgrace that she is disregarding the recommendations of the Flynn report, that all necessary steps be taken by the Government to maximise the amount of business channelled through the post office network, in favour of the other report which will involve the closure of up to 900 sub-post offices. The network should be developed. I do not see any reason ATM facilities should not be available at sub-post offices. Banks are moving out of rural areas. In my constituency last year in Kilfinnane a vibrant and developing community saw the AIB remove its facility from the area, although it did leave us the sop of an ATM. All sub-post offices should have one. The retention of social welfare payments is vital and a mainstay of the network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The post office in Carrigkerry was closed some years ago when the Minister of State's party was in government which proved detrimental to the community. The effects are still being felt and spoken about in the community. The village has seen a decline in population in recent years, part of the reason for which is the removal of the sub-post office. Payment of bills to local authorities should be made through post offices, as should <Col N="1078" /> the renewal of driving licences and motor taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to support the motion and thank and congratulate Deputy Jim Higgins for bringing it before the House. The first contact most people have had with any banking institution has been with the post office when they opened a savings account with it. From this initial contact a loyalty has been built up to the network which has remained with many people throughout their lives.</P>
      <P>The seeds of uncertainty have been sown by the Minister through her inaction. She is causing the demise of the rural post office network by standing idly by. She has already caused the demise of the national airline and the rail service. In the case of the post office network, she has done nothing. It is odd that her opening statement was that she would not force post offices to close. She does not have to because, by her inaction, it is happening in rural areas and is a great loss to many.</P>
      <P>We have noticed in the past five to ten years that many of the commercial banks have withdrawn from small towns and villages in rural areas. That has given post offices an ideal opportunity, assuming they are properly financed, to develop a new banking network and facility throughout the country which we never had before. I would have thought the Government would have taken that opportunity to move in and direct support in whatever way possible to the post office network. Unfortunately, that has not happened and we are witnessing the demise of the rural post office.</P>
      <P>Sustainability is a word of great importance for Departments. Local authority development plans state houses cannot be built in rural areas unless it is sustainable to do so. For that to be so, there must be a post office, a school, a shop and a church. The Government is removing one of these by allowing the network to die. If the Minister can stand idly by and allow 1,100 people to lose their jobs, then ten more weeks is much too long to leave the Government in power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion. I come from a village which, unfortunately, lost its post office and I saw at first hand the effect it had. The postmaster could no longer run the post office and informed An Post which decided to close the office despite the fact a number of people were willing to take on the running of it. The company did not give them that opportunity and I have seen the detrimental effect that has had on local people. When they want to collect pensions, children's allowance and avail of other services they must travel at immense inconvenience to a town four or five miles away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A neighbouring village, Lixnaw, where I receive my post, has lost its creamery, school and railway. It had a larger Garda station at one time. <Col N="1079" /> When I was in office for two and a half years I had the opportunity of doing something to retain the Garda station and, as a result, the village still has a small barracks. Had I not done that, the garda concerned would not be living there today. The village is under a great deal of pressure to survive. It has a local post office, but the postmaster is concerned about his future and that of his daughter who runs it.</P>
    <P>Unless an effort is made by the Minister and a preferential Government strategy put in place for post offices, they will not survive. Post offices provide many services for local communities. More than anything else, they are a focal point for local people where they collect their pensions and avail of other services. From a social point of view, many post offices are now the only place where people can meet and talk to each other. That advantage will be lost throughout the country if there are widespread closures. The approach the Minister is taking means closures will be the inevitable result.</P>
    <P>The post office has always been an integral part of rural communities as much as the church, the school or the local shop. Without the post office and its services, villages will decline further. A number of speakers on the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill outlined what has been achieved in the area of social welfare. If one drives through rural areas from County Mayo to County Kerry, one will see they are declining because services are being removed. I agree with the proposals Deputy Jim Higgins has brought forward in the motion to make post offices viable and ensure proprietors have a decent living. I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will begin by affirming the commitment of the Government to the post office network and its decision that there will be no forced closures of post offices. I also remind Deputies of the personal commitment of the Minister for Public Enterprise to a viable and sustainable post office network, with a range of services meeting the needs of a wide variety of customers. The post office is in an unusual situation in that it fulfils both the commercial and social remit. It offers a range of services to personal and business customers, competes head to head with other financial institutions and, on the other hand, provides a range of services such as social welfare payments and financial products to groups such as pensioners and those living in rural areas without a banking presence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has fulfilled both roles admirably through its countrywide network of offices, the largest retail network in the State, the public services ethos displayed by postmasters and postmistresses &ndash; this ethos was particularly apparent during the foot and mouth crisis last year &ndash; and its investment in technology in recent years. Despite the resilient framework under which the post office operates, all relevant stakeholders, including An Post man<Col N="1080" /> agement, trades unions and the Government recognise that change is necessary and that while retaining the best of the old, the new model of service delivery is required. As an indication of its willingness to play a constructive role in identifying necessary improvements for the network, all relevant stakeholders participated in the post office forum established by the Minister and chaired by Mr. Phil Flynn. The work of the forum has cleared the way for the introduction of 26 agency pilots in the sub-post office network on a voluntary basis, as recommended by Mr. Flynn in his report on the post office network undertaken in the earlier part of last year. An Post recently invited sub-postmasters and postmistresses to apply to take part in the pilot arrangements. I understand the company received a very good response which should enable an early roll-out of the agency pilots. Another recommendation of the Flynn report of a payment of 12% to postmasters was made last November.</P>
    <P>An amount of work has taken place in recent years to devise a strategy which builds on post office strengths, while providing a more modern range of quality services to customers. The outcome of this work is that post offices are positioning themselves to be the premier service delivery channel for over-the-counter financial services. Already substantial progress has been made whereby it is now possible to pay most utility bill payments using the post office. From Friday onwards, payment of ESB bills will be added to the list of services.</P>
    <P>One of the most important aspects of the post office delivery strategy is the adoption of a partnership approach with other financial institutions. From July this year, post offices will act as agents for AIB. This will allow AIB customers to pay bills and make lodgements using their local post office. An Post is also co-operating with the banks on the development of an enhanced suite of financial services for people who currently do not hold bank accounts. With its background in handling social welfare payments, the post office is well positioned to offer attractive banking options in this area.</P>
    <P>The investment in computerisation made by An Post in the last few years has allowed post offices to offer better quality services to many of its customers, particularly social welfare clients. It is clear there is substantial scope for the transfer of additional Government business to An Post and the post office network, given the existing relationship between An Post, many Government clients and the extensive network of offices. To progress this, the Minister for Public Enterprise has written to a number of her colleagues requesting they give serious consideration to the channelling of business under the auspices of individual Department agencies to An Post.</P>
    <P>A number of working groups have been established and a report in respect of each individual Department or agency is expected within the next few weeks. In addition, as part of its commitment to the post office network, the Government last <Col N="1081" /> July approved &euro;12.7 million equity injection to An Post subject to State aid approval.</P>
    <P>Given what I and the Minister have said, many actions have been taken which speak for themselves and I commend the Government's amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Ó Caoláin and Higgins.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this motion. I do so having grown up in north Meath, in my constituency, and seeing the important role the post office played in the fabric of rural Ireland. If one considers the overall development which has taken place in Ireland in the last number of years, many of us are of the opinion that enough has not been done to fast-forward proposals to upgrade and improve the service being provided by local post offices. It was interesting to hear the Minister of State say that the payment of ESB bills will become part and parcel of the service provided by post offices. This should always have been the case. As we are all aware, the ESB closed offices in many towns throughout the country which left people on small incomes in a very difficult situation in regard to the easy-payment system whereby they could pay their bills on a weekly basis.</P>
      <P>I recently spoke to a man who works for An Post as a postal delivery man and he told me the amount of mail being delivered today is three times greater than it was four or five years ago. It is amazing that up to now nothing has been done to encourage business and five years into her term of office the Minister has just now come up with proposals to save post offices from extinction.</P>
      <P>No post office should be closed. What we want to see in rural areas is people living in small parishes. There are serious problems with planners who do not want to see people living in parishes, the football team continuing to grow or the soccer team continuing to develop. Many barracks in rural areas have closed. This has led to a fear among elderly people that all the services which used to be available locally are no longer available. An Taisce has said it will oppose the building of proposed single dwellings in rural areas, such as houses for people to live in and rear families, and it is amazing there has not been a word from Ministers condemning the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was informed recently that a postmaster is no longer available in the post office in Kells, a town of approximately 4,500 people and which serves a surrounding area of approximately 8,000 to 10,000 people. I have been told that on occasions there is no one to answer the phone at the head post office in the Kells district for which I have been elected as a local representative and a representative in this House. I wonder what is happening to the services. If we do not provide facilities and sufficient staff to provide a better service what is the point in the proposals referred to by the Minister of State and having a more cost effective service available? In order to ensure the <Col N="1082" /> future of post offices, many more services should be provided such as payment of local authority bills and so on. Some people may live 30 or 40 miles from the nearest county council offices where they can pay their car tax and so on.</P>
    <P>I fully support Deputy Higgins in this proposal. The Government has again left the issue on the long finger and not dealt with it very effectively in its five years in office. Unfortunately, there are many disillusioned people in the parishes of Ireland as a result of what has been proposed.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Farrelly and Jim Higgins for sharing their time with me. The contradictions in the Government's stance on rural development are starkly exposed by the response to the motion before the House concerning the essential role played by sub-post offices, particularly in the lives of rural communities. The motion, which I support, is about sub-post offices. Its text refers to sub-post offices, sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses no less than 11 times. The Government's amendment does not mention sub-post offices or those who staff them even once. Not once in the Minister's text is there mention of the focus of this debate.</P>
      <P>I have recently and, quite correctly, commended the Minster of State with responsibility for rural development, Deputy Ó Cúiv, on his introduction of the CLÁR programme, which seeks to fast-track development works and projects in areas where there is identifiable population decline. Naturally, I wish the qualifying areas could be extended and hope that might yet happen. However, the commitment of the Minister of State is not only not matched by any of his ministerial colleagues, it is not even reflected by those who hold potentially supportive portfolios &ndash; so it is that our rural post offices are now under serious threat. Imaginative measures to upgrade the level of services provided at rural sub-post offices are required. The &ldquo;can't do, won't do&rdquo; mentality must be replaced by those who take a must-do approach to the future of sub-post offices and rural Ireland.</P>

        <b>: </b>On Tuesday and Wednesday last week we debated in the House the circumstances in respect of 850 primary and post-primary schools and the fact that they were in such a state of neglect and dereliction. Seldom has any debate managed to generate such interest. There was such interest that there were Deputies sharing four minute and even three-minute slots. Again, over the past two nights, we have dealt with another cornerstone of urban and rural Ireland &ndash; the post office, particularly the rural sub-post office, as Deputy Ó Caoláin said. He rightly identified the stark omission in the Minister's amendment, namely, that there is not a single reference to a member of the staff &ndash; sub-postmaster and sub-postmistress &ndash; employed in the sub-post office structure.</P>

I thank particularly the Labour Party. In a fine contribution, Deputy O'Shea elaborated and elucidated on all ten elements of the Fine Gael plan. His colleagues, Deputies Micheal D. Higgins and Upton, spoke tonight. Also supporting the motion tonight on this side were Deputies Stanton, Crawford, Kenny, McGrath, Boylan, Neville, Ulick Burke, Deenihan and Farrelly. I have already mentioned Deputy Ó Caoláin. There was a queue of Deputies who would have loved to participate had time permitted.</P>
    <P>As has been said repeatedly tonight, the Minister gave a commitment last night that there would be no forced closures. There will be no forced closures, certainly this side of 9 May. However, closures take place through neglect, decay and the failure to develop services. The opportunity has not been grasped by the Government which has been five years in office and has watched and stood by abjectly as the post office system has fallen into steady decline. It has wilfully allowed post offices to decline and close. As Deputy Michael D. Higgins said, unless one enhances, invigorates and energises the system and provides the additional services, post offices will simply wither on the vine. One does not need a decision to close them. They will close automatically.</P>
    <P>There is a huge window of opportunity. There are 1,916 post offices, including mainstream and sub-post offices. There is a huge window of opportunity by virtue of the withdrawal of the banks from many areas in both urban and rural Ireland. The kind of agenda we sketched out in terms of having current accounts, ATM machines, bill paying services, etc. is realistic. If the credit unions could start from a zero base or greenfield sites just over 25 years ago and penetrate every single community, both urban and rural, why in the name of heaven has an institution in existence before the foundation of the State limped lamely along and failed to rise to the challenge and opportunity?</P>
    <P>If services are provided, people will support them. They will rally to the cause and change. Take the building society movement, for example. Not alone is there one in every town in Ireland, there are two or three all competing with each other for business. People will break the mould and change. They are prepared to invest and take out their savings and move them from one institution to another. Likewise, as we said before, if An Post can beat the banks hands down <Col N="1084" /> in terms of its savings plans, it can do exactly the same in terms of matching and beating them where current account facilities are concerned. As I said last night, I genuinely believe that millions of disillusioned, disappointed customers would abandon the banks and transfer billions of euro to the post office if there was a current account system available.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with the comments on the sad lack of management on the part of An Post at executive level. I do not accept the Government's assurance that there is no long-term agenda concerning the closure of post offices. I was somewhat amused at the allegation by Deputy Cooper-Flynn that those now in opposition had, when in government, some kind of hidden agenda, that they had not dealt with or developed the post offices, and that they had some kind of agenda regarding their closure. I recollect vividly sitting on these very benches eight years ago listening to a debate on the infamous An Post viability plan brought forward by none other than the Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Brennan, which would have wiped out overnight huge tracts of rural Ireland by closing down sub-post offices and some of the smaller mainline post offices. Thanks to a motion brought before the House by Deputy Currie, our spokesperson on that occasion, the Government suddenly got the message. It started as a small series of bush fires and built up to an inferno. Ultimately, the Government did what it had to do; because of the huge backlash from both urban and rural communities, it backed down and withdrew the plan.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that supermarkets can do the business post offices can do. We are talking about a one-to-one relationship, a kind of confessional relationship. We are talking about confidentiality, which supermarkets or service stations cannot provide. As of now, the Government's stated position is that, in theory, it supports the existing network of post offices. The reality is that, as far as An Post is concerned &ndash; the Minister is the main shareholder &ndash; the plan is to withdraw 1,123 jobs. Last night the Minister in her contribution and tonight the Minster of State in his made absolutely no attempt whatsoever to fudge or deny this. As of now, the plan brought forward by Mr. John Hynes, chief executive of An Post, is that 1,123 jobs are to go. If one takes out 1,123 jobs, one is dealing a mortal blow and it is inevitable that post offices will close. It is time to acknowledge the reality, which is that 1,123 jobs will go, and with their going there will be the inevitable closure of post offices. That is what the motion seeks to rescind or thwart.</P>

      <P>As I said before Private Members' business, the Government has no concern for the difficulties and problems faced by old age pensioners, widowers, widows and people who depend on carers. I want to read a letter I received from a constituent who has given me permission to mention her name and address. She is Bridget Boyle from Loretto Road, Cavan. This letter will spell out in detail what is happening here in spite of the so-called Celtic tiger. It reads as follows:</P>
      <P>To give a human side to this situation I am a person with a physical disability, a result of a RTA 25 years ago. When I was discharged from hospital after being there for over a year, there were no back up services put in place in order for me to return home and live with dignity and independence. I was issued with a wheelchair and a commode and left to cope alone. Only for a very supportive family, I would not have been able to manage. Recently, as part of my work with Irish Wheelchair Association, I carried out a home care assessment for a young man, who had recently been discharged from hospital with a similar spinal injury as myself. He has no home support, cannot access his bathroom and his house is completely inaccessible. Where is the progress here in our health service and our Celtic tiger economy?</P>
      <P>Twenty-five years later, things have not changed for people with a physical/sensory disability. Shortfalls in revenue will have to be filled by borrowing and fundraising. This makes it impossible to plan the future and anticipate future levels of service.</P>
      <P>It is not acceptable that such people have to fund raise, run raffles and hold church gate collections. Many backbenchers are aware of the difficulties, but the Ministers who have the ability to do something have reneged on these people. It is a sad reflection on a Government coming to the end of its term. Its members try to tell us what they will do for the next five years. On behalf of those people, thank God there will be no second term for this Administration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the debate tonight. A few minutes ago we saw new things happening in this House in relation to electronic voting. It was nice to see on screen what we were voting for. It reminded me of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. All over Christmas, when I was having <Col N="1088" /> my dinner or tea, when I looked at the daily paper or the local paper I could see nothing but lovely photographs of the Minister who, like me, does not have much on top of his head. All that publicity must have cost a considerable amount of money. I would prefer to see that money spent on the elderly, the unemployed and the people who need it most.</P>
      <P>In the last budget the Minister was generous in certain areas and yet the elderly never felt more vulnerable or more upset about what is going on. Elderly people like security in their homes and they like to be warm. I heard Deputy McGuinness speaking about the scheme the health boards and local authorities have in relation to special housing aid to give heating grants to the elderly. He made a very valid point and one that I have been making for a number of years. A couple of weeks ago I raised it here and asked the Department of Health and Children to investigate how the payment of heating grants can be speeded up. There is no need for two engineers from a council to come out. They are then followed by someone from the planning office and another executive from the health board. All those people get travel expenses from either the health board or the council. The elderly person then has to get two quotations from registered contractors. If it costs less than £10,000 to put in storage heaters or central heating for the elderly, they should just get one quotation and have the work done by anybody they like. The job should be done and approved by an inspector for grant aid rather than what they currently have to go through.</P>
      <P>The Department should pay the grant to put alarms into the houses of the elderly under the monitoring scheme. There is much concern about that scheme. I have received delegations and have tabled parliamentary questions to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and I know the Comptroller and Auditor General is also concerned about it. It was introduced by Deputy Prionsias De Rossa as Minister in the last Government and it was intended to deal with the safety problems of the elderly. Nobody should make big money out of that scheme and it should be investigated because there seems to be an anomaly whereby only certain people can apply for that scheme and not the ordinary private contractors. That should not be the case. It is a good and worthy scheme that I support but it should not be abused and more people should be able to apply for it. I will take this up further at another forum.</P>
      <P>The fuel allowance should be payable 52 weeks per year. The weather today is awful. How many days in the year do the elderly not have to put on a fire? We do not have a climate like Spain or Italy where they know they will get a few months of fine weather. We do not get fine weather here. We might get a few warm days but the evenings will be cold. These people have to put on a fire 52 weeks a year. That fuel scheme should be doubled and paid throughout the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1089" />Many other Deputies have already spoken about the carers. Some 130,000 people are looking after elderly people. I find it distressing to see women coming into my constituency office and clinics throughout the county, who look after elderly people. It is the hardest job and it is not right that they get no reward simply because their husbands are working and they exceed the means test threshold. I call on the Minister and the next Minister &ndash; I hope my party will be in Government &ndash; to deal with this problem so that people get rewarded for looking after the elderly.</P>
    <P>I recently tabled a parliamentary question and was told it cost almost £700 per week to keep an elderly person in a State nursing home. That is just to keep them in the home and does not include the costs of staff, food, etc. It would be cheaper to give recognition to people who look after elderly people in their homes. Even if they are over the means test threshold they should get some recognition of £30, £40 or £50. Carers are not respected, rewarded or thanked. When people come to me I can see the stress in their eyes and how upset they are. Some of them do not get out at weekends and cannot get away from an elderly person who is dependent on them. However they get no reward from the State.</P>
    <P>I must be honest in saying there has been a major attack on the unemployed by the Minister and his Department in recent years and it is a scandal. Some day the Minister and his Department will find themselves in court. When somebody loses his or her job after a long time in work, he or she goes into his or her local social welfare offices and is verbally attacked. I stand over that statement. They are required to bring in three letters showing they are seeking work. These are people that have worked hard and when they now want to draw their stamps they are treated like criminals when they go to some social welfare offices and that is not right. One day such a social welfare officer will be threatened with legal action because the unemployed person is merely drawing what he is entitled to and should not have to go through that experience.</P>
    <P>On many occasions I have challenged the Minister to identify what jobs exist in these areas because there are none there. A directive seems to have been issued by the Minister or his Department. I have been told that people are treated like criminals when they go into the offices. They must then appeal the decision. The Department has been consistent with the Government in terms of waiting lists, which is the one thing the Government is good at. There are waiting lists for waiting lists for appeals for carer's allowance, unemployment benefit or any other assistance payment. Why is the Minister examining people's circumstances when he cannot deal with their appeals immediately? Why must they wait for six, seven, eight or nine months to be called for an appeal? The greatest laugh is that they must go to the community welfare officer and that the health <Col N="1090" /> board pays them instead of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. That looks good for the Minister and his officials whom he rewards by paying them a few pounds extra for knocking off honest, decent, hard working people who are only looking for their just entitlement from the State.</P>
    <P>When a woman who worked for 14 years in the town in which I live left her job, she was asked for three letters. She did not know anything about letters because she had worked and paid her stamps all her life. She told me she felt like a criminal and was treated like one. She said she paid her PRSI and tax and that she was paying the wages of the Department staff. If the staff in the Department did not get their cheques next Friday, there would be an outcry and the offices would be closed because staff would walk out.</P>

As regards the recent increases in social welfare, the Minister and the Government did not show any courage when the famous euro came in on 1 January. I call it &ldquo;the robber&rdquo; because it robbed and crucified the poor as every product increased in price and the social welfare increases are not any good to them. The county councils also take the increases from them in house valuations. The Minister talked about the fact that the people would be better off. The people are waiting for the Minister and his colleagues in the long grass.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We know about the lack of a waste management policy from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in the north eastern part of the country. Yesterday a <Col N="1093" /> lady in her late 80s rang to tell me she was told at Christmas that the black plastic bag for refuse would cost approximately &euro;2.50. However, someone told her yesterday that it would cost &euro;5 per week. It will cost that lady &euro;250 per year to get her one plastic bag collected each week. What a legacy for the Government to leave. How will that affect the increases in the budget? She also informed me that she used to be able to buy a 50 kilograms bag of coal for &euro;8, but now she can only get a 40 kilograms bag for &euro;10. Deputy Ring was right when he said that people, particularly the elderly in our community, cannot buy as many goods, particularly fuel, with the euro as they could with the pound.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a number of points about how the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, have failed miserably in dealing with the 25% of the population who have lost their medical cards since the Government entered office. An accepted level of State-funded, free medical card cover for up to 40% of the population was agreed with general practitioners throughout the country in the past. At present, however, only 30% of the population have medical cards. One wonders how long waiting lists would be if the Government actually doubled the income limit for eligibility for medical cards as Fine Gael will do when elected to office after the general election. Thousands of children are not being brought to their GPs by their parents because they cannot afford to pay either for the service or the medicine prescribed. If the Minister does not know that, he is not in touch with reality. This fact has been communicated to me by GPs across the north east.</P>
      <P>At health board level, a proposal was drawn up to introduce &ldquo;Doc on call&rdquo;. Has anyone heard of this service? The Department has allocated a sum of £3 million towards putting it in place in the north east. It was approved, in principle and on a temporary basis, at health board level. Six months after the initial decision to proceed, many telephone calls are being made to the service seeking medical assistance, but many cases are not being dealt with as adequately as they should be. Elderly people are afraid to make contact because they believe they will not receive a response. Nine out of ten times they will not be able to contact anyone from their own GP's practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now wish to turn to unemployment offices and the letters required from unemployed persons supposedly seeking work. Departmental officials will not accept the fact that some people living in rural areas of north Meath cannot travel to work because there is no public transport available. There are villages which are not serviced by public buses and people are obliged to walk between two and four miles to the nearest bus stop. Officials of the Minister's Department will not accept this as a good enough excuse for someone not being able to get to a place of employment. If a job exists in the places to which the people concerned travel, the income they would earn would not prove sufficient to purchase and <Col N="1094" /> insure a car. Will the Minster indicate if it is the Department's policy to cut off the unemployment payments of those who cannot travel to a place of employment? When they are cut off, they go to their community welfare officer and their name is removed from the unemployment register. This is a form of camouflage to hide the real figures. How often is this type of scenario played out across the country?</P>
    <P>Many speakers referred to carers. The costs involved in keeping a person in a bed in some of the State owned retirement and nursing homes are phenomenal. It can cost between £500 and £700 per week to do so. We do not have a proper system in place. There is an eligibility clause which prevents people who are saving the State substantial money from claiming carer's allowance. When I was growing up, many did not have the opportunity to work. There was always someone in the family who could look after an elderly parent or parents. That is not the case today because people must provide for their children's education, pay high mortgage costs, etc. The Minister is not providing those who want to care for their elderly relatives with a fair opportunity to do so. They are being discriminated against through the medium of the means test, despite the fact that they are saving the State a substantial amount of money.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increases in social welfare payments, but, unfortunately, they have been totally outweighed by the increases to which I referred which were caused by the euro changeover and the profiteering that has resulted from it. I provided two examples of this, one involving an 88 year old woman. The increases the Minister mentioned will be spent on covering her fuel costs and waste disposal charges. That should not be the case.</P>
    <P>These issues must be addressed. The 15 members of the Cabinet stand condemned and indicted by virtue of the fact that they have not increased substantially the eligibility limit for medical cards in order that people and their children can access proper GP and pharmacy services. They cannot avail of either of these services because they cannot afford to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill. I cannot but praise highly the social welfare officers who operate at national level. They are people who are extremely courteous, helpful and fair. Where they have an opportunity to display that fairness, they always avail of it. However, at local level there is a major variation in the consistency with which the rules and regulations are applied. Approximately two and a half years ago I raised a matter involving personnel from the main social welfare office in Galway who were obliged to travel out to east Galway. I refer, in particular, to an incident that occurred in Gort where there are two social welfare offices. On the occasion in question, neither of these was used to interview people called for review of their assessment. <Col N="1095" /> Instead a newly built hotel in the town was used. The people in question were obliged to wait in the public lobby before being called for interview.</P>
      <P>I accept that this was a once-off, tragic mistake. At the same time, however, the Minister's Department should issue a direction to ensure something of this nature never happens again. It was unfortunate that many were embarrassed and intimidated. I sympathise with Deputy Ring in respect of the comments he made about a similar incident. Such incidents have occurred and it is regrettable that social welfare personnel, at that level, would behave in that way when there is no need for it, especially in the situation I instanced where there are two social welfare offices, ideally located and properly serviced at local level. I hope the Minister will look into that as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I will comment on the farm assist scheme which appears to be a failure. It was introduced with a great fanfare of publicity but I believe the Minister must admit that it has proved to be a total disaster because of failure to apply it&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister maintains it is a success, I would like to hear his reasons for that view. It has failed to supplement the incomes of the farming community, as it was intended to do, outside of what was traditionally termed the farmers' dole. Any supplement of income that was generated and means tested from that, as a result of the current scheme, has failed miserably to enhance the incomes of farmers who need an income supplement. The farm assist scheme, because of the application and the means test which is part of it and despite all the write-offs that are supposed to apply, has benefited very few people. If the Minister can provide information as to the increasing numbers who have availed of this scheme and the number of farmers who have benefited, I will accept that. However, I know from experience in my constituency where the majority of farmers are small farmers, that the number of applicants is miserably low and the number who have succeeded in qualifying under the scheme is so few that it is clearly proven to be a failure. It is regrettable that there has not been a substantial revamping of the scheme to make it worthwhile for people to avail of it.</P>
      <P>As far as I can see, the question of <i>pro rata</i> pensions for the self employed has not been dealt with in the Social Welfare Bill. Although it is <i>pro rata</i> in name, it is certainly not applied in that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The self employed who had made contributions for up to five years were to <Col N="1096" /> get no pension and that is fair enough &ndash; very few people would imagine that one could get any portion of a pension with less than five years contributions. However, there is no recognition for those with five to nine years contributions; those in that category only get a half pension and, with ten years contributions, one gets a full pension. Will the Minister explain why increases in pensions are halved, proportionately, in this instance, whereas an old age non-contributory pensioner on a reduced pension gets the full increase? That inconsistency needs to be tackled and a readjustment made. If one is entitled to an increase, one should get the full increase. People in the small group who fall into the category which I have described are being victimised in that regard. Many people have made past contributions in respect of part time work, which was part and parcel of the normal working year for many farmers. Many of them participated in forestry schemes and with the Land Commission on a seasonal basis but it is now practically impossible for them to trace their past contributions for such employment. Others were employed by local authorities on various road building schemes and they also have suffered because of the lack of recognised contributions or the availability of access to the records of such past contributions. That is a serious drawback and many people have lost out as a result of a small shortfall in the qualifying period of contributions.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that it is time to abolish the multiplicity of assessments which apply in this country. There is no consistency between one assessment and another. It is extraordinary that accounts which are perfectly adequate and acceptable to the Revenue Commissioners are not acceptable to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Why is there such an inconsistency and why is it necessary to have duplication of assessments as between medical cards, social welfare payments, farm accounts and for so many other purposes? I cannot understand why there is no common assessment system.</P>
      <P>With regard to the overall budget package of social welfare increases, the Combat Poverty Agency has said the budget maintains living standards but falls short of the £14 increase recommended by the agency to provide an adequate income. That was a missed opportunity in the budget, as many other speakers have already said. On the day the Government's health strategy was launched, it was flagged that the income guidelines for medical cards would be reviewed as part of the Government's budgetary strategy and there would be significant improvements in income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low incomes who are eligible for medical cards and to give priority to families with children, particularly children with disability. Two days later, in relation to primary care strategy, it was announced that there would be no changes until 2003. That is a sad indictment of this Government's contribution to people in absolute need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and his officials on what has been done over the past five years for the less well off sector of our society. Unemployment has been reduced to one of the lowest levels in the EU. Almost 100,000 people have left the live register in a few years and I compliment the Government for what it has done to create employment across the country.</P>
      <P>In the budget, the Minister for Finance provides for the most vulnerable in our community and those whose need is greatest, with the increases in child benefit, pensions and social welfare payments from January 2002. Increases in social welfare will now be payable more than five months earlier than when this Government took office.</P>
      <P>The £850 million additional social welfare spending announced in this budget equals last year's increases and means across the board increases for all social welfare recipients. These increases mean that, despite a more difficult economic situation, the less well off will fare best. The total social welfare budget this year will be more than £7.4 billion and the increases announced in this budget, particularly for older people, carers and the unemployed represent further steps toward reducing poverty and disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Families will benefit greatly from this budget. For the second successive year, child benefit has gone up by £25 per month for first and second children and by £30 for third and subsequent children. These increases bring a monthly payment for the first and second child to £92.62 and for third and subsequent children to £116. A family with three children will now receive £301.24 compared with £221 at present. This is an increase of £80 per month or 36%. Child benefit has trebled since this Government took office. The back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance is also to be improved. From this year, 70,000 children aged 12 years and over will benefit from an increase in the payment rates which have been raised to £94 per child. By easing the means test, another 8,000 children will be eligible for inclusion in this scheme. An increase in the income threshold for family income supplement will bring the average payment to £59 per week per family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The elderly in our society will also gain significantly. The full personal rate of old age pension, retirement and invalidity pensions is to rise by a minimum of £10 per week. This brings the old age contributory pension to £116 per week and the old age non-contributory pension to £105 per week. These increases mark an increase of almost 50% in the pensions over the past five budgets and these amounts also exceed Government commitments on entering office to raise old age pensions beyond the £100 mark. The increases are well ahead of inflation and will mean a real improvement in the living standards of our elderly. The fuel allowance is being increased by £2.09 per week which is the first increase in the allowance since 1985. The number of months covered by the scheme was increased last year <Col N="1098" /> and it now operates from October to mid-April. The free electricity allowance gives an extra 300 free units to bring the allowance up to 1,800 units and qualification criteria for the free telephone allowance are to be relaxed. There will be further improvements in tax relief for the elderly. Income tax exemption limits have been substantially increased in the past four budgets. It is only right that the Government has rewarded the older generation for their sacrifices, work and contribution to making the economy what it is today.</P>

      <P>I thank nearly all the Deputies for their remarks in the course of this debate but I cannot allow the occasion to pass without saying that I unreservedly condemn Deputy Ring for the attack he made on officials in my Department. While Members on both sides of the House may put up with comments and attacks on each other, we cannot stand over the type of attack he perpetrated on officials in a Department. In my parliamentary party, any time Members refer to how Departments are doing in relation to their services to people, my Department is held up as a paragon.

      <P>When my officials are doing their job &ndash; and that is all they are doing &ndash; they are merely following the guidelines that were set down while Deputy Ring's own party was in office. I signed the regulations ultimately, but the preparation of those regulations happened when Deputy De Rossa was Minister and was supported by Fine Gael and the Labour Party. The officials in my Department are working according to guidelines laid down by a Fine Gael-led Government. Before Deputy Ring blathers in this House, condemning people who are not here to defend themselves, he should check the record.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies raised questions about my record in this office. I am proud of that record. Since I became Minister, for five years in a row, I have been able to bring forward, in each successive year, the largest budget package increase with record increases across the board.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important matter and the Minister of State for attending.</P>
      <P>A constituent of mine has approached me in the past 24 hours with regard to renewal notices he received relating to his insurance for a small boutique shop and office. In 2001 the cost of public liability insurance, employer's liability insurance and insurance of premises and contents was &euro;667, a reasonable cost for the type of holding involved. Unfortunately, the renewal notice he received yesterday demanded a premium of &euro;13,355, an increase of 2,000%. That means that where this constituent comes from two small businesses are going to close because no one could absorb that sort of cost. The two occupants of the premises cannot do so, nor can the owner. That state of affairs is reflected right across the commercial and business sector.</P>
      <P>Insurance companies are recouping their losses arising from the events of 11 September which they are using as the excuse to facilitate financial gain. The amazing thing is that they have reduced the liability they may incur by removing from the grounds for claiming, among others, an act of terrorism. By reducing their risk they have increased their profit margin, as a result of which businesses are going to go to the wall.</P>
      <P>Small rural community centres which run social events such as Christmas parties, especially for senior citizens, will not be able to function effectively or facilitate old and young in the community because they have to feed avaricious demands for expensive public liability insurance. In the case of my local hall, which serves 300, the cost of insurance has increased by 33%.</P>
      <P>What is happening in the insurance industry is unbelievable and the House is failing to address the issue. I ask the Minister of State if we are going to allow insurance companies to close down the small businesses that are the heart and soul of our villages, while damaging their infrastructure by closing community halls. This is a very serious matter and I ask the Minister of State to tell me what the Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas can do about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very aware of the difficulties being experienced by businesses arising from the cost and availability of insurance. There are a number of reasons, both international and domestic, for the increases to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>Insurance, globally and domestically, is a cyclical business. It has been generally agreed that after a number of years of technical losses the insurance industry, in Ireland and elsewhere, was entering a phase of its cycle in which prices would increase, even before the unfortunate events of 17 June and 11 September last. It is estimated that current losses resulting from the 11 September attacks in the USA are in excess of $115 billion. That has had a serious impact on the global insurance industry. Most of the losses will be borne by the same reinsurers with which Irish insurance companies hope to reinsure their future large losses. These companies are reducing their exposure to future losses, hence the reduction in availability of insurance, especially for relatively large risks, and the increased cost.</P>
      <P>Domestic factors include the cost of settling claims, which are increasing because of increasing prosperity. Recent court decisions may necessitate further increases to claims reserves. The Government's policy is based on three principles. We want to encourage as much competition in the market as possible, if necessary by removing or minimising those barriers to entry that are within our control. The only remaining barrier to entry was the cap on commissions, which I removed in 1999. Any EU insurer is now free to write insurance on the Irish market and any Irish citizen is free to seek insurance cover from any insurer authorised by a member state. We wish to recognise that the price of insurance is driven by the high cost of claims settlements and to address claims settlement costs, on the one hand, by reducing the incidence and severity of accidents and, on the other, by seeking to reduce the cost of the delivery of personal injury compensation, now running at as much as 40% of the cost of claims. Last year that cost exceeded £800 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strengthening of the Health and Safety Authority, together with measures taken by partnership practices in the workplace, has led to a reduction in workplace accidents. An IBEC survey, published in March 2001, shows that the number of accidents in the workplace fell by as much as 21% between 1999 and 2001, at the same time the numbers at work increased considerably. In 1987 there were 770,000 at work. Today there are 1.8 million. Research into the difference between the high price of insurance in Ireland and the much lower price of insurance in other EU member states linked the high cost of insurance to the high cost of settling personal injury claims here. The cost of delivery of compensation, almost entirely made up of legal costs, now runs at approximately 40% of the value of claims. In cases relating to amounts up to &euro;15,000, <Col N="1104" /> the cost of delivery may equal the amount of compensation. That is serious.</P>
    <P>In March 2001 the Government approved the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. It is intended that the PIAB will reduce delivery costs in personal injury cases by reducing the number that enter the legal system to achieve settlement. Since the insurance industry estimates that it pays out &euro;800 million per year in legal fees alone, the savings that may be achieved by the PIAB could be considerable. The interdepartmental implementation group has made good progress in its examination of operational issues and the possible legal implications surrounding the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. I expect to receive the group's report in the next month or so.</P>
    <P>The figures Deputy Wall has given are startling. The huge increases are phenomenal and I will take a personal interest in finding out if there is any way to alleviate the problem. If the Deputy wishes to pass on the details of the cases mentioned, I would be only too delighted to take the matter up with the Irish Insurance Federation.</P>

    <P>Gortahork national school is situated in the heart of the Donegal Gaeltacht. It is a five teacher school and was built in 1929, with some renovations carried out in 1959. One could say it is located between the devil and deep blue sea. At the front is the busy N56, a continuous hazard to pupils entering and leaving the school. However, the more serious hazard is at the back of the school, Gortahork Estuary. During spring tides the school yard and play area are flooded and there is a high level of e.coli contamination in the water. The presence of e.coli in tidal waters <Col N="1105" /> has been independently verified by Aqualab, an independent monitoring company, and is disturbingly in excess of EU safety levels. After every flood tide the yard and playground must be disinfected. Anyone must recognise that this poses a definite health hazard. Some of the classrooms are rat infested and could possibly be carriers of E.coli.</P>
    <P>The school is on the INTO's list of substandard buildings. The only long-term solution to the problem is a new school. The existing facilities are completely inadequate to meet the needs and requirements of teaching effectively the modern curriculum. A site is available, but everyone is frustrated at the delaying tactics of the Department. What we, in Gortahork, need is an immediate decision to provide a new school on the available site in order that the best education possible is provided for the pupils attending the school and the best possible facilities for the five dedicated and committed teachers.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me no great pleasure to raise this issue tonight in Dáil Éireann, but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, must make a public statement on the serious problem of street violence in urban areas, in this particular case, the most recent serious assaults in Cork city, and on the <Col N="1106" /> view among the public that the Garda presence at night in Cork city is insufficient to deal with the problem. In response to a parliamentary question yesterday the Minister refused to disclose the number of gardaí on duty in Cork city centre on the weekend of 15-18 February, a weekend which saw a most serious assault resulting in a young man being almost beaten to death in Cork city centre and a situation where the Garda admits that the ambulance arrived before gardaí at the scene of this serious crime.</P>
      <P>I know that there is a large number of factors contributing to the problem of street violence in Cork city, that the presence of gardaí alone will not resolve the problem and that there is a responsibility on night club owners, pub owners as well as parents to work towards reducing this vicious and dangerous situation. I am concerned that, as a result of a number of serious incidents, persons have been arrested, interviewed and had their files sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, but the suspects are allowed to go free and, in some cases, reoffend while the DPP is assessing the files. I have failed to get from the Minister information on the number of files with the DPP and also the average waiting period between a file being sent to the DPP and a decision being reached on it. I am told that it is a matter for the DPP and the courts. I express my deep concern that this procedure is simply not working and that there must be a speedier and more effective way of dealing with those suspected of having committed serious assaults.</P>
      <P>The effects and fall-out from vicious assaults are catastrophic for so many families. For example, an incident occurred on 26 March 2001 where two parents were woken from their sleep by two gardaí and told that they would have to travel to the South Infirmary Hospital, Cork because their son, Adrian Moynihan, had been involved in an accident. Unfortunately, before they left their home to go to the hospital they received further information that their son had died. The following day two detectives arrived at the family home and told them that the Garda had two tapes of video evidence from the club involved with the names of 200 people who were in the club at the time. They said they would return as soon as they had more information. On Saturday, 31 March, the family read in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> that three men had been arrested in connection with the incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Weeks went by and the family inquired as to how the case was progressing. They were told by a senior garda that the Garda was still taking statements, that the best thing for them to do was to leave it to the Garda and not to talk about the case or refer to the three people who had been arrested as it might jeopardise the case. They agreed to do so. Months went by and the family were telephoned to say the investigation was complete and that a file had been sent to the DPP with 70 statements and two tapes of video evidence. They then had to wait until January 2002, when a garda arrived at the family home to tell <Col N="1107" /> the mother of the deceased that the decision of the DPP was that there would be no prosecution on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>This case is an example of what is happening and raises major questions. First, why did it take so long to question individuals? Second, why was there no prosecution if, according to the Garda, the evidence was very strong? Third, why did it go from being a murder investigation to one where there was no prosecution? Fourth, why are the family being refused access to the files and the videotapes? There is documentary evidence to show that both the Garda and the DPP have refused the family access to the files of evidence and the video evidence. Fifth, why is the Garda refusing to give to the family the names of the three men arrested? Sixth, why have the family received no explanation in writing from the DPP or the Garda as to the reason there is not going to be a prosecution?</P>
    <P>I have brought forward this case history as an example of what is happening in our cities. A man is killed, the offence remains unsolved and those involved are not prosecuted. Why is a serious case such as this being shrouded in mystery and why are the family being kept in the dark?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and inform the House that I am standing in for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is unable to attend as he is out of the country on official business.</P>
      <P>The issue of street violence and the measures being taken to combat the problem were raised on the Adjournment last night and I refer the Deputy to the Minister's response on these matters. The Minister fully accepts that there is considerable public concern on the issue. This is especially true in the wake of a number of recent high profile incidents. Given this concern, the Minister has held consultations with the Garda Commissioner, following from which, a new public order initiative, entitled Operation Encounter, came into effect on 23 February 2002. This operation is focused on all issues of public order occurring in the community. Particular attention will be paid to night clubs, fast food outlets and other venues at which large numbers congregate and where there is potential for disorder. The target hours of the operation will be determined locally, based on the specific circumstances prevailing at each location. The Garda is liaising with the owners and managers of such premises to ensure they are fully aware of their responsibilities and of the duty of care they owe to their patrons and other members of the public. Additional resources are being made available, and each regional commander has been asked to draw up his or her own plans to prioritise the deployment of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" />Regarding the specific issues raised concerning Cork city, I refer the Deputy to the Minister's reply to Questions Nos. 354 and 355 of 26 February 2002 which addressed these matters. Regarding the specific incidents referred to by the Deputy, the Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that investigations into the three assaults referred to in the question are ongoing. A number of arrests have been made in respect of two of the incidents and the directions of the Director of Public Prosecutions are being sought in these cases. The Minister is further informed that good progress has been made to date in the third investigation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the issue of the Garda presence in Cork city centre, as the Minister pointed out in his reply, the detailed allocation of Garda resources is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner. As the Minister informed the Deputy yesterday, the Garda authorities have received no recent requests from local Garda management for an increase in Garda manpower in Cork city and have informed the Minister that the level of public disorder and assaults in Cork city is on a par with other sizeable cities and towns. He is further informed by the Garda authorities that gardaí in Cork city have been very proactive in addressing the level of public disorder experienced on the streets.</P>
    <P>Again, as the Minister advised the Deputy yesterday, the Garda Síochána has a positive relationship with the city centre traders and licensees in Cork city. The Garda maintains regular contact with the pub and night club owners in the city centre in an attempt to curb the level of public disorder and any abuse of alcohol. In addition, the regular Garda units are augmented with additional personnel at weekends. A pilot pub watch initiative has been launched in a number of areas in the city centre and progress to date has been positive. Special exemptions have been generally opposed by the Garda as part of its enforcement strategy, with exemptions not generally granted after 2 a.m. In addition, a closed circuit television system is being completed in Cork city division which has been part funded by Cork City Council in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Twenty four cameras are operating. The Minister is informed that these were found to be useful while investigating recent incidents.</P>
    <P>As the Minister recently informed the House, he has also recently sought and received Government approval for the drafting on a priority basis of a new Criminal Justice (Public Order Enforcement) Bill. The purpose of the legislation is to provide the Garda Síochána with additional powers to tackle anti-social behaviour. It will target, in particular, drunk and unruly elements who congregate late at night outside or in the vicinity of licensed and other premises, such as fast food outlets, and who by their aggressive and intimidating behaviour threaten the peace and well-being of law abiding citizens. The Bill will be published in this session.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1109" />The Minister assures the House that the Government will continue to provide all the necessary resources to tackle effectively the problem of assault and violence on our streets, and is confident that existing measures, together with the enhancements he has announced, will pay dividends in terms of crime prevention and detection.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been hiding from this issue which I have raised on four occasions in the past six months and on none of which has he referred in his response to community gardaí. He waffled on about everything else, but refused to deal with the question of the appointment of community gardaí in south Tipperary. I received a reply from him during the week to a parliamentary question. It also referred to everything except the question I asked, which concerned the need for the appointment of community gardaí in Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir and Tipperary town. Is there a sanction which can be placed on Ministers who refuse to answer parliamentary questions?</P>
      <P>The Minister has also failed to meet members of Clonmel Borough Council who, six months ago, asked him to meet a deputation of members on this issue. In response to my question during the week the Minister said there are 41 gardaí of all ranks in Clonmel, 16 in Carrick-on-Suir and 30 in Tipperary town. The garda complement in Tralee, a town in the Minister's county, is 70, 29 more than that in Clonmel, which is larger than Tralee.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister is not present and that he has failed to respond to this question I have asked for the past six months. Unfortunately, his failure to respond means that it is now the position that one in every four crimes is not reported to the Garda. This damages the reputation of the force and diminishes its status in the community. People do not believe that crimes they report to the Garda will be dealt with effectively. Huge numbers are not being reported. There is a further complication in that, this year, the Minister has refused to publish the preliminary figures for 2001 which would show that crime levels throughout the country have deteriorated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our request for community gardaí is simple and necessary and the Minister has accepted it in other areas. Two sergeants and nine gardaí in <Col N="1110" /> Waterford city are dedicated to community Garda policing and community efforts. I am aware that local Garda management has requested community gardaí for south Tipperary. It is my understanding, in the case of Clonmel, that a Garda sergeant and four gardaí have been requested by local management for community policing. I visited Waterford with community groups some time ago where community gardaí have made a huge and lasting impression on anti-social behaviour in the city. The same applies in Letterkenny and the same could be the case in the towns in south Tipperary to which I referred.</P>
    <P>The sad fact is that there is serious anti-social behaviour in all towns throughout the country, not just in south Tipperary, which has resulted in tenants being forced to move out of local authority houses. Will the Minister examine and approve the application for community gardaí for south Tipperary and give a date to members of Clonmel Borough Council for meeting a deputation from the council, something we requested more than six months ago?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that as the Minister is out of the country on official business he could not be here tonight.</P>
      <P>I note that the Minister recently dealt with a parliamentary question tabled by the Deputy on this matter and I welcome this opportunity, on behalf of the Minister, to go into more detail on the issues raised by him.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Minister is responsible for the overall provision of resources to the Garda Síochána, while the Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas. With that in mind, I would like to set out for the information of the House the information recently conveyed by the Minister to the Deputy with regard to the manpower strength of the three stations referred to by him. The strength of the three stations, all ranks, is as follows: Clonmel, 41; Carrick-on-Suir, 16 and Tipperary Town, 30. The Minister has been further informed that the strength, all ranks, of Tipperary Division is 316 as of 19 February 2002. This compares with a strength of 293 in February 1997 and, as such, represents an increase of 23, or 7.8%, in the manpower allocated to the division since that date.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources to individual areas and, in this regard, the allocation of gardaí to particular duties within a division, such as community Garda duties, is the responsibility of the divisional officer. The Minister has been assured that the manpower situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir and Tipperary Town will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated earlier that the Minister is responsible for the overall provision of resources to the <Col N="1111" /> Garda Síochána and, in this regard, I would like to detail some of the resources he is providing. Last November the Minister announced he had approved the holding of a further Garda recruitment competition early in 2002 to recruit an additional 300 Garda trainees.</P>

      <P>The current Garda strength of 11,770 is the highest in the history of the State. The strength of the force was 10,800 when the Minister took up office. Recruitment already under way will bring Garda strength up to an all time record high of 12,000 by the end of 2002.</P>

      <P>The recruitment of an additional 300 Garda trainees will ensure Garda strength is maintained at that level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy refers to anti-social behaviour. One of the ways we are tackling this problem is by extending the CCTV network. As of now, there are three Garda CCTV systems in operation with a fourth currently being completed. As part of the first tranche of this expansion, CCTV systems are to be installed in ten more areas and it is anticipated that these ten CCTV systems will be installed by the end of 2002. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003. The Minister is also conscious that some applications for CCTV systems that have been received relate to relatively small schemes. He has given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided to these areas. To this end, it is planned to introduce a grant scheme soon to cater for those communi<Col N="1112" /> ties who would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. I am sure this will be of interest to communities in the Deputy's constituency.</P>
    <P>I should also add that the Minister sought and received Government approval for the drafting on a priority basis of a new Criminal Justice (Public Order Enforcement) Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to provide the Garda Síochána with additional powers to tackle anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to detail some of the Garda initiatives taken to deal with street crime. The Garda Síochána's national public order initiative, Operation Oíche, has been in operation since October 2000. The Garda authorities consider Operation Oíche to have been highly successful to date. Since its introduction, there has been a more visible Garda presence on the streets, particularly at the closing times of licensed premises and night clubs.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the considerable successes enjoyed since the inception of Operation Oíche, it was felt that a fresh approach was needed. Therefore, following consultations which the Minister held with the Garda Commissioner, a new public order initiative entitled Operation Encounter came into force on 23 February 2002. This operation concentrates on targeted areas and it also involves closer liaison with the owners of night clubs, pubs and fast food outlets.</P>
    <P>The Minister wishes to assure the House that the Government will continue to provide all the resources necessary to effectively tackle the problem of assault and violence on our streets. He is confident that existing measures, together with the enhancements he has announced, will pay dividends in terms of crime prevention and detection.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity once again to restate my confidence in the Irish Museum of Modern Art. As I indicated in a speech at the launch of the publication, <i>Celebrating a Decade</i>, at the Irish Museum of Modern Art in December 2001 we can be very proud of the many achievements of IMMA. Since its establishment the museum has become an important feature of our cultural and artistic map, incorporating the authentic voices of some of the key representatives of critics, artists, board members and staff. The museum has been challenging, arousing and intellectually, visually and emotionally stimulating and has interwoven to a remarkably high standard its core activities of collecting, exhibiting and education with local community involvement. In this context, I would like to acknowledge the involvement of the local community with IMMA over the past ten years.</P>

      <P>The original returns of the Irish census of 1901 are more extensive than the returns of the 1901 UK census which were made available online at the beginning of this year. A project to make available for online publication the data used in the preparation of the 1901 census would be an enormous one. It would represent the largest project of its type ever undertaken by an archival institution in Ireland. While it is the hope of the National Archives that this information will eventually be made available online, it is considered by the National Archives to be beyond their current resources, both financial and otherwise.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the National Archives that the returns of the Irish census for 1901, as well as those for the following census in 1911, have been available for public inspection in the National Archives and its predecessor body the Public Record Office of Ireland since 1961 and microfilm copies of returns for entire counties have been supplied to many county libraries and other research centres. In addition, copies of individual returns have been supplied to many thousands of individuals over many years. There has, therefore, already been a widespread dissemination of the information contained in the 1901 census returns.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the shooting of ducks and other protected wildlife from high-powered boats is already banned and an offence under section 36 of the Wildlife Act, 1976. This section prohibits the use of mechanically propelled vehicles, aircraft and vessels, including powered boats, whether propelled or stationary, in hunting. I am pleased that this provision has been strengthened further by section 44 of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000, which I introduced and brought through to enactment. The section extended the protection to all wild animals and all wild birds and not just protected wild animals and protected wild birds. In exceptional circumstances, a licence may be granted by me under the Wildlife Acts, 1976 and 2000, for educational, scientific or other purposes as are specified in the licence. I encourage anyone who has evidence of illegal hunting from a high-powered boat to inform local conservation staff of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department.</P>

      <P>Implementation of the revised arrangements agreed by Government for <Col N="1117" /> the introduction of digital terrestrial television or DTT in Ireland, as provided for in the Broadcasting Act, 2001, is ongoing. These revised arrangements provide that the DTT platform will be established by two separate but inter-linked transactions: the separation and sale by RTE of the existing RTE transmission network as a going concern and subject to RTE being able to retain a shareholding of up to 28% in the new entity; and the selection of the DTT multiplex licensee, or the DTT retail business, to be licensed by the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.</P>
      <P>In my reply to Question No. 7 of 8 November last, I outlined my position regarding the process to select the DTT multiplex licence. On the recommendation of the consultants engaged by me to evaluate the proposals, a deadline of 31 January was agreed to fulfil certain conditions relating to financing requirements. On 5 February 2002, the consultants reported the emergence of a credible potential lead investor in the DTT multiplex business and recommended that a further extension be granted to allow that party to complete its due diligence in accordance with a timeframe agreed with the consultants. I have decided to grant the extension of time as recommended by the consultants and the project management group.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of the process that will lead to the sale of a majority stake in the RTE transmission network, I understand from RTE that it has received a number of bids from interested parties in late October 2001. I also understand that in the near future RTE intends to invite second round bids from a number of bidders based on the substantial completion to date of due diligence, management presentation and transaction documentation provided by RTE to bidders. Following the receipt of the revised bids a further short-list will then be determined. My Department is engaged in ongoing regular contact with RTE in relation to the implementation of the Government's objectives for the establishment of the DTT platform.</P>

      <P>The remit of Dúchas, the heritage service of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, is to protect, conserve and maintain the State's natural and built &ndash; including archaeological &ndash; heritage. My Department is also a statutory consultee in relation to planning applications under consideration by a planning authority. These responsibilities arise from both national and European law. As a statutory consultee in relation to planning <Col N="1118" /> matters, Dúchas is obliged to comment on and, where appropriate, make recommendations to the relevant planning authority &ndash; which may accept or reject them &ndash; where it is believed that proposed developments may have a negative impact on our heritage.</P>
      <P>Planning applications are assessed to determine any potential implications for the heritage present. Such assessments are completed by a variety of departmental officers including wildlife rangers, district conservation officers, district, regional and divisional managers, architects, archaeologists and engineers who have a variety of qualifications and various levels of expertise in archaeology, architecture and ecology. Many members of staff assess planning applications as part of their normal duties and only a small number of staff are engaged full time in assessing such applications. In addition, all comments, observations and recommendations made by staff members assessing planning applications are reviewed and co-ordinated by the development applications section of my Department in conjunction with senior management to ensure that my Department deals with all planning applications referred to it in a consistent and fair manner.</P>
      <P>In the vast majority of cases my Department either does not find it necessary to comment on planning applications or is able to acquiesce in developments proposed subject to appropriate mitigation measures. It is only in exceptional circumstances that the Department finds it necessary to recommend, for specific stated reasons, that a planning authority not grant planning permission. It should be noted that Dúchas does not and indeed cannot refuse planning permission. The responsibility for so doing clearly rests with the relevant planning authority. In the event of a planning authority refusing to grant planning permission, the applicant has the right to appeal such a decision to An Bord Pleanála, an independent body which will decide on the issue after considering all aspects of the case. As mentioned above, all planning applications which require the input of Dúchas into the planning process are co-ordinated by the development applications section of my Department, and this section reports directly to the director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Dr. Alan Craig.</P>

      <P>I am aware that strong representations were made following the unsuccessful application for ACCESS funding by the Cill Rialaig project. However, this application went through the same vetting and assessment process as did every other application under the scheme. Applications judged technically eligible were evaluated by an independent committee which had the unenviable task of selecting the relatively small number of projects to receive grant aid from the much larger number of very worthy projects from which applications were received. Against that background, the committee did not recommend the Cill Rialaig project for assistance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Grady's Yard abuts the inside of the medieval city wall which enclosed St. John's Abbey and the approach to the crossing on St. John's river. The <Col N="1120" /> site includes a water-gate bastion. This bastion is an early and rare gunnery work and a site of significant archaeological importance. In 2001 my Department registered the site as an historic monument thus affording it protection under National Monuments Acts. I am aware of the proposal to construct a high-rise development on this site and my officials have held detailed discussions with the developer in order to ensure the satisfactory preservation and presentation of the site. These discussions are continuing and my officials are currently awaiting a response in respect of further specified requirements regarding revised proposals for the development. I understand that there has been no planning application to date for such a development. The Deputies will of course appreciate that the granting of planning permission in any particular case is a matter for the relevant planning authority and not for my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>While my Department has not carried out any study of the cost of living, running a business or farming on the islands compared to that on the mainland, I understand that the development officer of Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann or the Irish Islands Federation, whose post is funded by my Department, is currently in the process of undertaking a study of the extra passenger and cargo transport costs associated with living on the islands, the results of which will be forwarded to my Department for consideration. However, over the past number of years the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has generally recognised that certain costs incurred by island dwellers are higher than those incurred by mainland residents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a recognition of the extra construction costs incurred by islanders my Department's new house grant, available to eligible Gaeltacht island <Col N="1122" /> applicants, has been increased from &euro;7,618 to &euro;15,300 while the house improvement grant on Gaeltacht islands has been increased from &euro;4,380 to &euro;15,300. In addition, the Department of the Environment and Local Government's new house grant for the islands has been raised from &euro;6,094 to &euro;12,190. These increases have helped considerably in offsetting the additional costs involved in constructing or improving houses on the islands.</P>
    <P>In 2001, my Department paid a total of &euro;1.84 million in subsidies towards the provision of ferry and air services to the islands. I should point out to the Deputy, however, that the intended purpose of these subsidies is not to reduce the charges made by the relevant ferry companies for the transport of passengers and, in some cases, cargo but to guarantee a scheduled service on occasions when it may not otherwise be profitable to provide one. It could be argued, however, that the subsidies provided by my Department have the indirect effect of reducing the cost of transporting passengers and cargo, farm animals and commercial goods included, to and from the islands.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of my Department's work is the co-ordination of Government policy in relation to the islands. This is mainly achieved through the work of the inter-departmental committee on the islands and resulting bilateral contacts with other Government Departments. Amongst the objectives achieved through this forum which have had the effect of reducing the cost of living on the islands are an extra &euro;12.70 per week for pensioners living on the islands which was announced in budget 2000, a special rate of &euro;66 in respect of road tax for island cars which was introduced with effect from 1 April 2001 and the introduction by the Department of Education and Science since September 2001 of a significant increase, from &euro;2,539 to &euro;3,809, in the level of remote area boarding grant payable in respect of island children attending secondary school on the mainland. While considerable progress has been made in reducing the cost of living and of conducting business on the islands, it is my intention to continue to examine ways of making further progress in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>No formal rebuke was issued by the European Commission in relation to protection of wild bird populations. I presume the Deputy is referring to a reasoned opinion <Col N="1123" /> issued by the Commission which states that in the view of the Commission, Ireland has not fully implemented the provisions of the birds directive. This relates primarily to the progress made by Ireland in designating special protection areas or SPAs under the EU birds directive.</P>
      <P>There is a considerable amount of common ground between the Commission and my Department in regard to many of the issues raised in the reasoned opinion. Major sections of that document were concerned with designation of additional SPAs and the extension, on scientific grounds, of existing SPAs. It is agreed that we have some work to do in this area and I can confirm that considerable progress will be made over the next few months. I am making available to the Deputy a list of 34 SPAs that will be the subject of public advertisements within the next week or so. The Deputy will see that 25 of these sites are wholly new SPAs and that nine of them are extensions to existing SPAs. This is the first step in the process of formal designation of these areas. I fully expect that these and other measures to be taken by my Department will more than satisfy the EU Commission in this regard.</P>
      <P>There are other issues of a technical nature, such as the designation of sites for dispersed species, that require further examination from my officials and their EU counterparts. There is continuing communication with the Commission on these matters. I expect that this dialogue will soon enable the Commission to conclude that further legal action in the European Court of Justice is not necessary to secure the full and effective implementation of the birds directive in Ireland. There are no implications for the draft National Heritage Plan in the reasoned opinion. The reasoned opinion relates only to the implementation of EU directives. The national heritage plan was mentioned briefly in the reasoned opinion but only because it had been referred to by my Department in previous correspondence in outlining various initiatives relevant to conservation of wild birds and research on their status.</P>
      <P>The national heritage plan will be the first integrated plan in the history of the State to set out comprehensive proposals to conserve and protect all aspects of our national heritage. The plan will set out priorities, strategies and actions for the future management and protection of our heritage. It stems from the programme for Government and does not arise from the obligations contained in any EU directive. I intend to seek Government approval for the plan in the very near future. When this has been obtained it will be published at the earliest possible opportunity. At a recent meeting with Commissioner Wallstro1m I outlined my proposals in regard to the national heritage plan and the related national biodiversity strategy which were warmly welcomed by the commissioner.</P>

These cSACs have been formally transmitted to the European Commission in Brussels. Under the provisions of the Habitats Directive, these sites are required to be formally adopted by the Commission before member states proceed with formal designation. I understand that the Commission has not formally adopted any site throughout the European Union to date.

      <Col N="1125" />Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, has made payments to 104 individuals who own areas of raised bog within cSACs under the cessation of turf-cutting scheme. These payments give my Department an option to purchase the land for a nominal amount. These options are in the process of being exercised and my Department is in continuing liaison with the office of the Chief State Solicitor with a view to the relevant contracts of sale.</P>

      <P>Ever since the decision of the Supreme Court that the Blascaod Mór National Historic Park Act, 1989, was unconstitutional, I have been considering how the conservation of this important part of Ireland's historic and cultural heritage could best be ensured. It seemed that progress would best be made through an inclusive consultative process. Accordingly, in May 2001 I invited Mr. Martin Nolan, the Kerry county manager, to facilitate the bringing together of all interested parties into a consultative process to afford them the opportunity of stating their views on options for the future of the Great Blasket Island. This has resulted in the setting up of the Blasket Island forum.</P>
      <P>The objective of the forum was to clarify options and to achieve the widest possible consensus on the development of the island, as a precursor to the formulation of an outline conservation management plan. This has been a long and complex process involving detailed discussion with all interested parties over many months. The deliberations of the forum have now been completed and I expect to have the final report of the county manager in the very near future. I will address the issue of pursuing world heritage site status for the Great Blasket as soon as I have had the opportunity of considering the forum's report.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>In evaluating sites for proposal as special areas of conservation, SACs, for salmon under the EU Habitats Directive, my Department engages in wide-ranging consultations, especially with the central and regional fisheries boards. It draws on the best information available under the following headings: sites of importance because of the size of the salmon population; sites important for spring salmon, which are genetically distinct and more threatened; good geographic range, that is, rivers from around Ireland; reasonable prospects regarding water quality and physical condition; and, where appropriate, significant presence in sites of other habitats or species listed under the habitats directive.</P>
      <P>To date, my Department has listed salmon as a qualifying interest for 14 of the currently notified SACs &ndash; those in which the salmon interest is wholly or largely contained within the present site boundary. To encompass the salmon interest more fully, extensions to these sites will be made where necessary. In addition there are five other existing river SACs where extensions are envisaged to encompass the salmon interest more fully, particularly to include tributaries. Finally, it is intended to designate five additional rivers as SACs or extensions to existing sites. Each site will include the main channel and tributaries important for salmon. Substantial progress has been made in regard to surveying and digitised mapping of these sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Member states' proposals for SACs are generally evaluated at EU regional seminars, which in our case are for the Atlantic region. It is only at the next such seminar that it will become clear whether Ireland will be asked to consider proposing more sites for a few particular habitats or species in addition to salmon in order to contribute to the Natura 2000 network. I concluded some time ago that any further SAC proposals from Ireland should as far as possible be published as one final tranche when the boundaries of sites for salmon have been determined and in the light of the conclusions of the Atlantic region seminar. The seminar has been postponed several times by the EU Commission and is now sched<Col N="1133" /> uled for early June in the Netherlands. I am satisfied that the proposed salmon sites will be ready for publication and notification to landowners with any other proposals arising from the seminar, soon after its conclusions are known.</P>

      <P>The board of visitors to the National Museum of Science and Art and the National Botanic Gardens was constituted in pursuance of an agreement entered into in 1881 between the Department of Art and Science in London, the Commissioners of Public Works and the Royal Dublin Society in connection with the establishment of the National Museum and the National Library. The agreement obtained statutory force under the provisions of section 16 of the Dublin Science and Art Museum Act, 1877.</P>
      <P>The duties of the board are to make annual reports to the Department on the conditions, management and requirements of the museum and to advise on points affecting the administration. A copy of such reports is to be laid before Parliament by the Department. It is regrettable the 1998-99 report was only produced recently. The delay has occurred for a number of reasons, including difficulties in printing and editing the report. The 2000-01 report will be published this year.</P>

    <P>Six different scenarios were used in the projections corresponding to three fertility assumptions taken in conjunction with two migration assumptions. The M1F2 scenario used above is thought to be the most likely of these in the short term. The assumptions used in the compilation of the population projections are as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Fertility:</i>F1: Total fertility rate, TFR, to increase from its 1998 level to 2.0 by 2001 and remain constant thereafter; F2: TFR to remain constant at its 1998 level to 2001, decrease to 1.75 by 2011 and remain constant thereafter; F3: TFR to remain constant at its 1998 level to 2001, decrease to 1.5 by 2011 and remain constant thereafter.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Mortality:</i>Decrease in mortality rates consistent with gains in life expectancy at birth from: 73.0 years in 1995-97 to 77.8 years in 2030-32 for males; 78.7 years in 1995-97 to 84.0 years in 2030-32 for females.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Migration:</i>M1: Immigration continuing but diminishing +20,000 per annum in 1996-2001; +15,000 per annum in 2001-2006; +10,000 per annum in 2006-2011; + 5,000 per annum in 2011-2031; M2: Immigration followed by emigration +15,000 per annum in 1996-2001; + 5,000 per annum in 2001-2006; zero net migration in 2006-2011; 5,000 per annum in 2011-2031.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 to 51, inclusive, and 54 together.</P>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance are currently established on a non-statutory basis but will be placed on a statutory basis once the National Economic and Social Development Office Bill is enacted. The Central Statistics Office comes under the aegis of my Department. The national statistics board was established under the Statistics Act, 1993. The new Information Society Commission was appointed in November 2001 as an advisory body to Government. It was established pursuant to a Government decision. It is not a statutory body and there are no proposals to give it a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, my Department is involved in a range of cross-departmental activities and initiatives, including many groups or bodies which are under the auspices of other Departments. The most significant of the committees, boards, companies or other bodies currently under the auspices of my Department are the National Millennium Committee, the legislation committee, to progress the Government's legislation programme; the SMI implementation group of secretaries general; the steering group for the evaluation of SMI; the high level group on regulation; the quality customer service working group; the national implementation body under the adjustments to the terms of the PPF; and the National Forum on Europe. There are no plans to establish any of these groups on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>Although independent of the Department, the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and the McCracken and Moriarty tribunals are funded from my Department's Vote. I also have ministerial responsibility in respect of certain administrative matters relating to the Offices of the Attorney General, Chief State Solicitor and Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>

    <P>IDA Ireland fully recognises and is committed to ensuring that the process of balanced regional dispersal is achieved in the west and in this respect the agency's priorities for the region which includes east County Galway are the pursuit of a more balanced regional spread of new overseas investments to secure significant industrial developments in this Objective One area and to confirm the process of upgrading the existing base of overseas companies in order to enhance their sustainability and improve their quality and value.</P>
    <P>Specifically in east County Galway since 1997, IDA Ireland has acquired 35 acres of land at Creagh on the east side of Ballinasloe for development as a new business park. Development work has now been completed on the park. IDA has worked with a local group of developers who have recently completed construction of a new 27,800 sq. ft. advance unit on the new park; been successful in attracting Valois, a French engineering company, to establish a manufacturing operation in Ballinasloe. The company is initially commencing operations in a temporary facility while it is working with its property advisers to design and develop a new customised facility in the IDA's new business park at Creagh. The company will employ 60 people at full production and recruitment is actively underway at present; been actively involved in the inter-agency group which I set up following the announcement by AT Cross <Col N="1138" /> of its intention to close its operation at Ballinasloe to help retain the maximum number of jobs in Ballinasloe and to promote the area for new projects. A high-quality promotional brochure has now been completed and will highlight the strengths and attractiveness of Ballinasloe and environs as a location for investment. The final report for the above task-force was forwarded to me in November 2001; and has acquired a 32-acre business park on the Dunmore Road in Tuam. Site development works are in progress at present; is actively marketing its 25,000 sq. ft. advance factory in Gort.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government remains committed to the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities throughout the country and will continue to impress this on the industrial development agencies.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to say when the report of the High Court inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited will be completed or published. I understand that the inspectors have completed most of their work and are currently going through the required process of providing an opportunity for persons about whom conclusions have been drawn to comment on these conclusions before the report is submitted to the High Court. Following the enactment of the Company Law Enforcement Act, 2001, which amended section 11 of the Companies Act, 1990, this report will now be provided to the director of corporate enforcement rather than to me as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The question of whether and to what extent the report is published is solely a matter for the High Court.</P>

      <P>I am pleased that the Labour Relations Commission, in its recently published strategy framework, is seeking to work with the various agencies concerned with different aspects of industrial relations in Ireland. During the consultation process which preceded the publication of the strategy, there were some <Col N="1139" /> suggestions that there should be a high level national forum where the commission and other interested parties could discuss current and emerging issues. The commission, having examined the matter, is now proposing to host an annual informal meeting of the various agencies to discuss matters of mutual concern.</P>

      <P>The Laois inter-agency task force, under the chairmanship of Michael Malone, county manager of Laois County Council, comprises membership from IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, FÁS, the county enterprise board, SIPTU, IBEC, Laois County Council and local industry. The task force has been very active since the closure of the company and is continuing to work to achieve a successful outcome. For the former employees of the Portarlington facility, FÁS has provided a comprehensive guidance, training and placement service to both permanent and seasonal staff and I understand that at this stage over 260 have secured alternative employment. FÁS has also provided a profile of skills available in County Laois and these details are available for potential employers.</P>
      <P>The factory has been purchased by a property developer who plans to develop the facility and surrounding lands for industrial purposes and is liaising closely with IDA Ireland. A brochure on County Laois, promoting the facility, has been produced and circulated to all IDA overseas offices and project divisions in headquarters for active marketing. During 2001, 11 overseas companies visited Portlaoise and five visited Portarlington.</P>
      <P>In November 2000, ebm Industries Ltd. announced its intention to locate in the 25,000 sq. ft. advance factory on IDA Ireland's business and technology park in Portlaoise. The company currently employs 11 people in the manufacture of cooling systems for the electronics and communications industries. The project will employ 145 people at full development. Planning permission has been granted for a 17,000 sq. ft. office facility in the IDA business park in Portlaoise and construction is underway at present. The office facility is to be completed in August 2002. Planning permission has also been granted for the construction of two advance factories of 25,000 sq. ft. each. Construction of both factories will commence in late 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is also actively involved with the work of the task force and is continuing to <Col N="1140" /> encourage new business for County Laois. I can assure the Deputy that a co-ordinated response between the development agencies in the area is continuing to ensure that everything possible is done to further maximise job opportunities in the region.</P>

      <P>The management of the industrial property portfolio is a day-to-day matter for IDA Ireland and not one in which I have a direct function. Between 1997 and 2000, IDA Ireland acquired around 48 hectares of land, commonly known as the Belcamp site, in north County Dublin. The site was acquired for medium to long-term development as a major business park for the region, in line with the IDA's standard policies on forward planning. Dublin City Council was granted way leave to access part of this site in order to lay sewer pipes as part of the North Fringe sewer infrastructure. In the course of these works last year the contractors for Dublin City Council unearthed a waste landfill site which, on analysis, has been dated to the 1980s &ndash; long before the lands were acquired by IDA. Clearly, this land had been used for illegal dumping and contained a wide range of waste materials, including some hazardous clinical and blood waste materials.</P>
      <P>While surprised by the discovery, IDA Ireland undertook to manage the situation according to best international practice and accordingly appointed an environmental consultant to advise on the extent of the buried dump, the implications in terms of its management and the possible origins of the waste materials. For immediate management of the site advice and technical consultation also included the involvement of the local authorities, the EPA and the Health and Safety Authority. Secured and well-marked fencing has been erected around the relevant section of the site. The best advice received by IDA is that there is no immediate risk to the nearby population. Full environmental clearance has been given at this point to the remainder of this extensive site including the nearby GAA Craobh Chiaráin sports grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the IDA has received two preliminary reports from the expert consultants at this stage, one in December 2001 and a progress report in January 2002, the agency does not plan to publish these preliminary findings as issuing preliminary reports could be prejudicial to legal action and may not reflect the final researched position or <Col N="1141" /> conclusion of the various activities presently underway. Appropriate decisions will be taken regarding the publication of the final report once it is received and considered by the agency. However, IDA Ireland has been assured by experts and statutory authorities that the present action of securing the relevant area of the site is the best course of action at this time.</P>

      <P>Ireland was among the first Council of Europe member states to sign and ratify the European Social Charter, which was opened for signature by the Council of Europe in 1961. A revised European Social Charter was adopted to adapt the charter to developments in the field of social rights since 1961 and was opened for signature at Strasbourg on 3 May 1996. The revised charter came into force on 1 July 1999.</P>
      <P>The main innovations in the revised charter include: strengthening equality between men and women; the right of disabled persons to individual social integration, personal independence and participation in the life of the community; strengthening the right of children and young persons to social, legal and economic protection; the right to protection in cases of dismissal; the right to dignity at work; the right of workers with family responsibilities to equal opportunities and equal treatment; the right to protection against poverty and social exclusion; the right to adequate housing and a widening of the ban on discrimination. These rights can be accepted selectively subject to a minimum number of acceptances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland signed and ratified this revised charter on 4 November 2000, subject to deferral of the <Col N="1142" /> acceptance of the following provisions until such time as our national legislation is in conformity with these provisions: Article 8, Paragraph 3 &ndash; regarding certain rights of employed women to protection of maternity &ndash; specifically, where such mothers are nursing their infants; Article 21, Paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) &ndash; regarding the right of workers to information and consultation; and Article 27, Paragraph 1 (<i>c</i>) &ndash; regarding the right of workers with family responsibilities to equal opportunities and equal treatment  &ndash; specifically, in regard to daycare services and other child care arrangements. These provisions will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>In relation to Article 31 &ndash; regarding the right to housing, the position of the Department of the Environment and Local Government is that Ireland cannot accept the provisions of Article 31 at this time. However, I understand that the Department of the Environment and Local Government intends to follow future interpretations to be given to the provisions of Article 31 by the Council of Europe itself with a view to their possible acceptance by Ireland at a later date. A statement to that effect was made by Ireland to the Council of Europe upon signature and ratification of the revised charter in November 2000.</P>

    <P>
      <i>Existing &ndash; Non-statutory</i>1. Review Group on Auditing. I established the review group on auditing following the first report by the Committee of Public Accounts of the parliamentary inquiry into DIRT, which proposed that a number of areas of possible reform in the auditing profession should be examined. It is not proposed to establish this body on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>2. CROlink. CROlink the Companies Registration Office Users' Council, was established in January 1996. There are no proposals to give CROlink a statutory basis.</P>

    <P>4. The Asia Pacific Strategy Group was established under the auspices of the Foreign Earnings Committee following the adoption by the Government of the strategy for long-term development of foreign earnings in Asia in 1999. It oversees the implementation of the strategy.</P>
    <P>5. The Trade Advisory Forum is a consultative body chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for Labour, Trade and Consumer Affairs. Its purpose is to provide a forum for consultation between the export sector and the relevant Departments and State agencies and to act in an advisory capacity to the Minister in determining policy. </P>
    <P>As bodies numbered three to five serve consultative or co-ordination functions, they do not have a statutory basis and it is not intended to give them one.</P>
    <P>6. An inter-Departmental and Agency Group was established on a non-statutory basis to oversee Ireland's participation in EXPO 2000. The group's mandate came to an end following the conclusion of EXPO 2000 in October 2000. The question of establishing the group on a statutory basis, does not, therefore arise.</P>
    <P>7. The Competition and Mergers Review Group, the report of which I published on 4 May 2000 was established by my predecessor in September 1996. This group finalised its work in 2000.</P>
    <P>8. The European Consumer Centre offers advice to consumers on their rights in respect of both domestic and EU legislation as well as being a resource location for information on cross-Border consumer protection matters. The centre was first launched in December 1996 and since January 1999 it operates as an independent company. There are no proposals to have it given a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>9. Patents Office Users Council. In 1997, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment established the Patents Office Users Council to consider and report to the Minister on the administration of industrial property protection by the Patents Office and to advise on appropriate changes and innovations in the operation of the office. There are no proposals to give a statutory basis to the Patents Office Users Council at this time.</P>
    <P>10. Code of Practice on Unsolicited Commercial Communications Committee. The Committee was established to examine the feasibility of a code of practice that would complement the legislation giving effect to the provisions on unsolicited commercial communications in the Electronic Commerce Directive. The draft legislation to give effect to the directive is with the Attorney General for approval. The code of practice committee hopes to complete its work this year. This is a non-statutory group and will remain so.</P>
    <P>11. On 22 February 2000 a Timber Industry Development Group was launched. There are no proposals to give the group a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>12. The e-Work Action Forum was established to provide a focal point for the ongoing development of an environment which will stimulate telework/e-work employment opportunities and ensure that this method of working achieves its full potential in contributing to economic growth and an improved quality of life. The forum was established on a non-statutory basis and it is not intended to establish it on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" />13. The National Competitiveness Council was established on a non-statutory basis. There is no intention of giving it statutory backing.</P>

    <P>19. The Task Force on the Prevention of Workplace Bullying and the Review Group on Public Safety were both established otherwise than pursuant to statute or statutory instrument. There are no proposals to place either body on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>20. An Interdepartmental Committee on Science and Technology has been established. There are no plans to give it a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>21. A Technology Foresight Advisory Group on Implementation was established on a non-statutory basis in March 2000. This report was noted by the Government in October, 2000. The work of the group has been completed.</P>
    <P>22. An Inter-Departmental Group on Modern Biotechnology has been established. There are no plans to give it a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>23. A PPF Standing Committee on Labour Market Issues has been established. There are no plans for establishing it on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>24. Taskforce on Lifelong Learning. As provided for under Framework IV of the PPF, my Department established in early 2000, a lifelong learning taskforce, in collaboration with the Department of Education and Science which involves representation from relevant stakeholders and includes representatives of the social partners. This taskforce will report to Government shortly. There are no plans to establish the taskforce on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>25. Users' Council for the Office of the Registrar of Friendly Societies. A users' council for the office of the registrar of friendly societies was established in August, 2001 on a non-statutory basis. There are no proposals to give the users' council a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>26. An Inter-Departmental Committee has been established with a co-ordination role in regard to expenditure by Departments on research technology and innovation, RTI. There are no plans to give it a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>27. Employment and Human Resources Development Operational Programme and EQUAL Community Initiative. As provided for under the national development plan, my Department is the designated managing authority for the employment and human resources operational programme and the EQUAL community initiative. The operational programme and the initiative are overseen by two separate and distinct monitoring committees, established and chaired by my Department. The committees have decision-making powers in the case of European Social Fund part-funded activity. They are non-statutory committees and have agreed their own rules of procedure, in accordance with the provisions of both the national development plan and the community support framework agreed with the European Commission. There are no plans to give them a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>28. As provided for in the national development plan, my Department established and chairs a horizontal employment and human resources development co-ordinating committee to monitor European Social Fund part-funded activity and related employment-labour market interests. The role of the committee is to consider, from time to time, key policy issues and actions in such fields. The committee does not have a decision-making role and <Col N="1145" /> is non-statutory. There are no plans to give it a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>29. National Anti Poverty Strategy-Employment Working Group, NAPS. The NAPS employment working group was established by this Department in 2001 as part of the process of reviewing and updating the national anti-poverty strategy. Work of this group has already been concluded following the submission of a number of recommendations, as part of the review process, on employment policy contribution to reducing poverty and eliminating social exclusion. The question of giving the group a statutory basis does not arise.</P>
    <P>30. Employment Services Advisory Committee. Since mid 2000 the management of the LES has been assigned to FÁS. A new employment services advisory committee, ESAC, to the FÁS executive has been established to carry forward this process. There are no plans to establish the committee on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>31. Immigration Policy Advisory Committee. Following consultation with the social partners, the Government announced a new proactive, skills-based immigration policy in 2000. An immigration advisory committee was established as part of the PPF and is chaired by this Department and includes the social partners. There are no proposals to put the committee on a statutory footing.</P>
    <P>32. The National Training Advisory Committee. The national training advisory committee was established recently to advise the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on issues relating to training people in and for employment and on the priorities for support from the national training fund. There are no plans to establish the committee under statute.</P>
    <P>33. The Social Economy National Monitoring Committee. The social economy programme arose from a Government decision on foot of a P2000 working group report on the social economy. The social economy national monitoring committee chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and comprising trade union-local employers-farming-voluntary pillar representatives as well as relevant Government Departments and statutory bodies was established to oversee the development and implementation of the programme. There are no proposals to give a statutory basis to this committee.</P>
    <P>34. Competition Authority Advisory Panel. In October 2001, following a recommendation in its organisational review, the competition authority established the competition authority advisory panel to advise it on legal, policy, management and strategic issues. The panel has no executive role and does not discuss individual enforcement cases. The panel will sit for two years. It does not have a statutory basis and it is not intended to give it one.</P>
    <P>35. Euro-Taxis Euro Changeover Group. A group consisting of representatives from the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the euro changeover board, the legal metrology office, Dublin Corporation, the Garda carriage office and Forfás was set up in June 2001 to ensure a smooth changeover of taximeters for the euro. The question of establishment on a statutory basis does not arise.</P>
    <P>36. An implementation group, set up in March 2001, has been progressing the establishment of the personal injuries assessment board. There is no intention to establish this group on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>37. The consumer advisory council was set up in June 2001. There are no proposals to have the council given a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>38. A round table for SMEs was established on a non-statutory basis. There is no proposal to give it a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Existing &ndash; Statutory</i>39. The Motor Insurance Advisory Board was established under Statutory Instrument S.I. No. 299 of 1984. This order may be cited as the Motor Insurance Advisory Board (Establishment) Order, 1984. There are no plans to have this body given a basis in statute as opposed to statutory instrument.</P>
    <P>40. Office of Director of Corporate Enforcement. The Company Law Enforcement Act, 2001 provided for the <Col N="1146" /> establishment of the post of Director of Corporate Enforcement with the functions of enforcing and ensuring compliance with the Companies Acts. The ODCE came into being on 28 November 2001.</P>
    <P>41. Company Law Review Group. The Company Law Review Group was established as a statutory advisory body to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment by section 7 of the Company Law Enforcement Act, 2001. The review group is charged with advising the Minister on the reform and strategic development of the companies code in Ireland.</P>
    <P>42. The Register of Patent Agents Rules, S.I. No. 180 of 1982, provide for a board to consider applications from persons wishing to be entered in the register of patent agents. The Trade Mark Rules, S.I. No. 199 of 1996, also provide for a board to consider applications from persons wishing to be entered in the register of trade mark agents. There are no proposals to give these boards a basis in statute as opposed to statutory instrument.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Proposed &ndash; Non-statutory</i>43. A high level steering committee has been proposed to assist the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment in relation to the activities of Science Foundation Ireland so as to ensure an appropriate consultation process between the foundation's activities and other research funding agencies. There are no plans to give it a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>44. My Department is in the process of establishing a consultative forum, on an informal basis, for the purpose of dealing with issues relating to the proposed administrative transfer of the National Metrology Laboratory from Enterprise Ireland to the national standards authority of Ireland. The forum will be representative of the management, staff and their unions of the two organisations concerned and the Department. It will not have a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Proposed &ndash; Statutory</i>45. Science Foundation Ireland. Legislation is being drafted to set up Science Foundation Ireland as a separate legal entity.</P>
    <P>46. As recommended in the report of the review group on auditing I established the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, on an interim basis. The interim board is advising me during the drafting of legislation to give effect to the review group's recommendations. This legislation will provide for the establishment of IAASA on a statutory basis.</P>

      <P>The current position in relation to the transposition of EU directives for which my Department is responsible indicates a total of 34 directives to be implemented, including six for which the deadline for implementation, in full or in part, has passed. Details of the directives, including, in so far as it has been decided, the proposed transposition instruments, are available on my Departments website at www.entemp.ie/ecd/eudirectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A letter of formal notice, under Article 226 of <Col N="1147" /> the treaty, has been issued by the European Commission in the case of three of the outstanding directives for which the deadline for implementation has passed.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that my Department is giving all due priority to the task of implementing the provisions of EU directives, in light of the available resources.</P>

      <Quest> the Acts or sections or other provisions of Acts under the auspices of her Department or for the commencement of which her Department is responsible which have not commenced by reason of the fact that a commencement order has not been made; if it is intended to make such an order; if so, when; the reason for the failure to make such an order to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <P>The position in relation to the question put by the Deputy is as follows:</P>
      <P>Section 2(2) of the Competition Act, 1991, provides for the repeal of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, and every order made under that Act. Section 2(2) of the 1991 Act also provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that different days could be fixed for the repeal for different purposes of any provision of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972. The Competition Act, 1991 (Commencement) Order, 1991 (S.I. No. 249 of 1991) provides for the repeal of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972 and every order made under that Act with the exception of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987 (S.I. No. 142 of 1987).</P>
      <P>Having considered the final report of the competition and mergers review group, which reported to me in May 2000 on a wide range of competition issues, including the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, I decided to retain it. I came to the view that it was not in the consumer's interest to remove the Groceries Order which includes a ban on below cost selling. I was particularly concerned that below cost selling could be used to eliminate competition in local markets. The groceries sector is changing rapidly and I will keep the position under review in the light of developments.</P>
      <P>The Competition Bill, 2001, which was passed in the Seanad on 20 February 2002, provides for the repeal of the Competition Act, 1991. Section 46 of the Bill provides that the Minister may, by order, amend or revoke the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Industrial Designs Act, 2001 (No. 39 of 2001), which was enacted in November 2001, awaits commencement. The commencement of this legislation is contingent on the making of detailed regulations to give full effect in practice <Col N="1148" /> to the provisions of the Act. These regulations, to be known as the Industrial Designs Rules, 2002, are expected to be completed and the Act to be commenced by the end of April.</P>
    <P>Sections 98 and 247 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000, provide for exceptions allowing sound recordings of copyright works and performances to be played in public by certain non-profit clubs and societies without payment of royalties. It is hoped that the effect of these exceptions can be maintained informally by agreement with the rights management interests concerned. Consequently, no date for the making of a commencement order in respect of these sections has been set.</P>
    <P>Sections 198 and 199 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 provide for the deposit of books and certain other materials in specified libraries. It is expected that these sections will be commenced later this year, following further consultations with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands designed to secure a smooth transition from the pre-existing legislation to the new provisions. In the meantime, the existing provisions of section 56 of the Copyright Act 1963, and sections 65 and 66 of the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, will remain in force unamended.</P>
    <P>Commencement Orders for sections 5 and 6 of the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Act, 2001, have not yet been made. Section 5 provides that the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977 and 1988, will cease to apply to NET. However, it is only intended to commence this section in the event of the sale or disposal of NET's 51% shareholding in Irish Fertilizer Industries Limited. The workers directors on the board of NET are actually employees of IFI. Therefore, if the State were to dispose of its shareholding in IFI there would no longer be any rationale for IFI employees to be elected to the board of NET.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Act, 2001, provides for the repeal of the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Acts, 1963 to 1993, to be brought into operation by order. Again, it is the intention to exercise this power only in the event of the State disposing of its shareholding in IFI and the subsequent winding up of NET.</P>
    <P>One Part of section 8 of the Insurance Act, 2000, has not been commenced. That part deals with the repeal of section 47 of Part IV of the Insurance Act, 1989 &ndash; the requirement for insurance intermediaries to hold a bond. When bonds are finalized section 8 will be fully commenced.</P>
    <P>Commencement Orders in respect of sections 18, 19, 20, 36, 37 and 38 of the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act, 1998, have not been made. The staff of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are currently employees of Forfás on terms and conditions which provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for superannuation benefits. The above provisions would allow for the separate employment by these agencies of their own staff and for necessary provision of superannuation benefits to <Col N="1149" /> those staff. I have no immediate plans to bring these provisions into effect.</P>
    <P>The Company law Enforcement Act was enacted in July 2001. The sections of the Act that have not been commenced by reason of the fact that a commencement order has not been made are as follows: (a) 43, 44, 45, 46, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57 and 58; (b) 93 (b)(fa)(ii); (c) 109 and (d) 110. The sections of the Act referred to at (a) relate to the winding up of companies and, in particular, those that have become insolvent. It is proposed to commence these sections by way of commencement order on 1 May 2002. Section 93(<i>b</i>)(<i>f</i>a)(ii) will be commenced following further consideration. Section 109 will be commenced following further discussions with the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Section 110 relates to the provision of information to juries. Commencement of this section will be done in consultation with the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Sections 248 and 249 of the Companies Act, 1990 provide for matters relating to the delivery of documents to the registrar of companies in legible and non-legible form. The commencement of these sections is currently being considered.</P>
    <P>Sections 68(1)(<i>c</i>), 120(5) and 122(1)(<i>f</i>) of the Credit Union Act, 1997, have yet to be commenced. Consideration will be given to their commencement following discussions with the registrar of friendly societies and the credit union movement.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972 (No. 10 of 1972) dealing with provisions in relation to the safety of explosives has not been commenced. This part, <i>inter alia</i>, would make the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, rather than the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, responsible for explosives safety and the making of regulations in connection with same. The issue of State security has delayed the commencement order on this part of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, automatically repealed specific provisions of existing enactments on safety and health, that is, Factories Act, 1955, Safety in Industry Act, 1980, Office Premises Act, 1958, Mines and Quarries Act, 1965, Dangerous Substances Acts, 1972 and 1979, and the Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) Act, 1987 &ndash; from 1 November 1989, both in relation to sections as a whole, or certain provisions relating to penalties. The section, in conjunction with section 1(2), also provides for the repeal of all remaining provisions of these enactments, together with the Boiler Explosions Acts, 1882 and 1890, subject to the making of commencement orders under section 1(2) of the Act in respect of any of those enactments or any of their provisions.</P>
    <P>Three such repeals orders have been made to date including the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Repeals and Revocations) Order 1995 (S.I. No. 357 of 1995). This order, <i>inter alia</i>, repealed the Office Premises Act, 1958, in full and <Col N="1150" /> repealed 46 sections in full, and seven sections partially, of the Factories Act, 1955. The order also revoked 55 sets of regulations in full and partially revoked 12 sets of regulations made under a range of statutes. The purpose of the exercise was to avoid overlapping or duplication between different statutory provisions and to remove enactments that had become obsolete. The legislation is currently under review to identify further provisions that may be considered for repeal at this stage.</P>

      <P>Statutory instruments are being prepared, or will be prepared, to transpose the EU directives due for implementation by secondary legislation which are referred to in my reply today to the Deputy in Question No. 68. Details of the Directives are available on my Department's website at http://www.entemp.ie/ecd/eudirectives.htm.</P>
      <P>Details of other statutory instruments being prepared are as set out as follows.</P>
      <P>A statutory instrument is being prepared in the Department to give effect to amendments made to Council Regulation (EC) No. 1334/2000 of 22 June setting up a community regime for the control of exports of dual-use items and technology. A statutory instrument is being prepared in the Department to introduce penalties for breaches of the trade sanctions introduced against Zimbabwe under Council Regulation (EC) No. 310/2002 of 18 February 2002. A further statutory instrument is being prepared in the Department to introduce penalties for breaches of the embargo on the importation of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone which was renewed under Council Regulation (EC) No. 303/2002 of 18 February, 2002.</P>
      <P>Draft Industrial Designs Rules, 2002, are being drafted to give effect to the Industrial Designs Act, 2001 (No. 39 of 2001), which was enacted in November 2001. These rules will commence the Act, set out the procedures to be followed in relation to the various proceedings under the Act and set out in more detail the methods by which the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks and the Patents Office will carry out their functions under the Act. It will also set down the fees to be charged by the Patents Office for the services to be provided under the Act</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Draft Copyright and Related Rights (Register of Copyright Licensing Bodies) Regulations will prescribe detailed rules for the keeping of a register of copyright licensing bodies under the provisions of section 175 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000. Similar draft regu<Col N="1151" /> lations will be prepared in relation to the statutory registers of licensing bodies in the areas of performers' property rights and the database right in due course.</P>
    <P>Draft Copyright and Related Rights (Proceedings before the Controller) Rules will provide for the procedures to be adopted by the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks in adjudicating disputes referred to him for resolution under the provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000.</P>
    <P>A draft Copyright and Related Rights (Certification of Licensing Scheme for the Purposes of Reprographic Copying by Educational Establishments) (Irish Copyright Licensing Agency) Order will certify a licensing scheme proposed by the Irish copyright licensing agency for the management of copyright rights relating to photocopying in educational establishments, as provided for in section 173 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000.</P>
    <P>A draft Copyright and Related Rights (Notice of Seizure) Order will prescribe the form of the notice to be given by copyright and related rights owners for the seizure of infringing copies of copyright works, illicit recordings of performances and other items the seizure of which is provided for in the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000.</P>
    <P>A draft Copyright and Related Rights (Notify and Take Down) Order will specify the form of notice to be given by copyright and related rights owners in notifying Internet service providers of the presence of infringing copies of protected materials in their equipment, and requiring their removal, as provided for in sections 40 and 205 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000.</P>
    <P>A draft Copyright (Foreign Countries) Order will formalise the extension of protection under Irish copyright law afforded by the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000 to copyright works qualifying for protection under the copyright laws of states and territories to which reciprocal obligations in this regard are owed under a number of international treaties and conventions.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal to amend the European Communities (Requirements to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations. These regulations provide that selling and unit price which is defined in the regulations as price per kg, per litre or per metre, square metre, or cubic metre unless provided for in the schedule attached to the regulations must be given. A need has been identified for some additional exemptions from standard units. Consultations have commenced.</P>
    <P>Three sets of draft regulations under the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, are being prepared. The purpose of these regulations is to designate entities as credit institutions for the purposes of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>A Statutory Instrument is being prepared to amend the Safety in Industry Acts, 1955 and 1980 (Hoists and Hoistways) (Exemption) Order, 1985 (S.I. No. 100 of 1985), the purpose of which is to <Col N="1152" /> avoid any potential conflict between the provisions of that order and the provisions of paragraph 39 of the Fifth Schedule to the Safety, Health and Welfare at work (General Application) Regulations, 1993 (S.I. No. 44 of 1993) as inserted by Regulation 2 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations, 2001 (S.I. No. 188 of 2001).</P>
    <P>The sixth commencement order under the Company Law Enforcement Act, 2001, is currently being considered. It is envisaged that sections 43, 44, 45, 46, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57 and 58 will be commenced from 1 May 2002.</P>
    <P>Section 56 of the Company Law Enforcement Act provides for a liquidator of an insolvent company to report to the Director of Corporate Enforcement on the conduct of director(s) of that company. The report submitted to the director must be in a prescribed form. Draft regulations are being prepared to prescribe the form of the report.</P>
    <P>Section 58 of the Company Law Enforcement Act, 2001, provides for a disciplinary committee or tribunal of a prescribed professional body to report any misconduct by liquidators or receivers to the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Draft regulations are being prepared prescribing the professional bodies.</P>
    <P>Section 120 of the Companies Act, 1990, requires the Irish Stock Exchange to submit to the Minister an annual insider dealing report. Draft regulations are being prepared to require the provision of additional information in the report.</P>
    <P>Draft regulations amending the European Communities (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) Regulations, 1989-1999. Draft regulations are in preparation for the purpose of updating the Central Bank's powers to supervise and regulate UCITS, disapplying various company law provisions to UCITS consistent with changes made for Part XIII investment companies in the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1999, and making various miscellaneous changes to the present regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Friendly Societies (Amendment) Act, 1977, provides that the Minister may by regulation alter the restrictions that apply to the making of loans and acceptance of deposits by societies governed by section 46 of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896. Draft regulations are being prepared for the purposes of increasing the financial limits on deposits with, and loans by, specially authorised loan societies within the meaning of section 8(5) of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, and which are governed by section 46 of that Act.</P>

            <entry>Designed to co-ordinate endeavours among the Member States of the Council of Europe to tackle the problem of insider trading. Part V of the Companies Act, 1990 introduced statutory provisions to tackle these problems in Ireland and in so doing implemented the EU Directive of 13 November, 1989 co-ordinating regulations on insider dealing. On the 14 December, 2001 the EU Ecofin Council reached an orientation agreement on the EU Commission proposal for a Directive on Insider Dealing (Market Manipulation), which will replace the 1989 Directive.<br />No decision to sign or ratify the convention has been taken.</entry>

While the introduction of a unified code for the treatment to be accorded to companies proposed in the Convention might have certain advantages, a substantial revision of Irish Company Law would clearly be involved. The EU programme of harmonising Company Law governing the formation and operation of limited liability companies addresses many of the areas covered by the Convention. Ireland has concentrated its resources on negotiating and implementing the relevant EU Directives and Regulations. At this point in time, it is not proposed to pursue the question of signing and ratifying this Convention.</entry>

      <QRef>[7040/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>The felling of conifer seed stands is the normal practice to facilitate seed collection. Following the felling of such seed stands, new or replacement stands are added to the seed stand register. The period over which the 1,474 hectares of seed stands referred to by the Deputy have been felled extends back, in fact, to 1973 when EU Directives 66/404 and 71/161 on forest reproductive materials first applied in Ireland. However, a significantly greater area has over the years been added to the register and the existing area of registered seed stands totals almost 4,800 hectares.</P>
      <P>In the years up to and including 1997 the felling of seed stands was authorised under the general felling licence procedure. In 1998 and 1999 the felling of seed stands required a limited felling licence in recognition of the sensitivity of such stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those two years, although Coillte submitted listings of the seed stands scheduled for felling with their applications for general felling licences, they did not submit applications for limited fel<Col N="1159" /> ling licences for those areas as required. In consequence, the felling of seed stands by Coillte in 1998 and 1999 was unauthorised. The areas involved were 64.5 hectares in 1998 and 62.3 hectares in 1999. Changes in procedures in relation to felling of seeds stands were introduced in 2000 and Coillte Teoranta have been in full compliance with these procedures since that year.</P>
    <P>My Department considered the question of taking legal action against Coillte Teoranta in relation to felling in 1998 and 1999. However, advice from the Office of the Attorney General was to the effect that a prosecution under the Forestry Act, 1946, would, in this instance, be unlikely to succeed.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that my Department has not received a request from the EU for information in relation to the maintenance of the seed stand register in Ireland. The role of Coillte Teoranta in maintaining Ireland's seed stand register is in accordance with EU Directives 66/404 and 71/161 on forest reproductive materials. Arrangements for the maintenance of the register of seed stands are being reviewed in light of the introduction of Directive 105/99/EC on Forest Reproductive Material which will apply in Ireland from 1 January 2003.</P>

      <P>Section 13 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, dealing with the period for determination of applications for aquaculture licences, has not been commenced pending definitive clearance of the backlog of licence applications. The question of commencing this provision will be considered in due course.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act, 2000, relating to marine casualty investigations have not been commenced. I intend to bring the relevant elements of the Act into operation in the near future to facilitate the early establishment of the marine casualty investigation board. I intend also that the new maritime safety directorate which I have established within my Department will advance as a priority the necessary arrangements to allow the commencement of the Adventure Activities Standards Authority Act, 2001, and the setting up of the Adventure Activities Standards Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The work of my Department involves an ongoing programme of secondary legislation. The principal statutory instruments which are in preparation at present include the following: an order to require community fishing vessels, over 24 metres in overall length or over 20 metres between perpendiculars, to carry satellite based position monitoring terminals which are capable of automatically transmitting position reports to the fisheries monitoring centre, when operating in Irish waters; regulations to amend the Merchant Shipping (Tonnage) Regulations, 1984, as amended, in relation to the measurement of the tonnage of certain fishing vessels; regulations to amend the Merchant Shipping (Registry, Lettering and Numbering of Fishing Boats) Regulations, 1997, as amended, to take account of changes in the rules relating to the measurement of the tonnage of fishing vessels; regulations to effect various amendments of regulations introduced in connection with the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, MARPOL Convention; regulations to give effect to Annex IV and Annex <Col N="1163" /> VI of the MARPOL Convention; regulations to transpose into Irish law Directive 98/30 EC concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas; Directive 99/105/EC on the marketing of forest reproductive material; Directive 2000/59/EC on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues and Directive 96/43/EC on the imposition of veterinary inspection fees for the inspection of food producing premises, inspection of food imports and border inspection.</P>
      <P>The effective annual management of Ireland's quota restricted fisheries requires the making of statutory instruments on a regular basis. These are made following consideration of technical and administrative advice on the optimum management of fish stocks and quotas and in consultation with the fishing industry. Sixty-six such instruments were made during 2001 and a similar number is likely to arise in the course of 2002. In addition there is a continuing need for statutory instruments to enhance the level of safety at sea and on inland waters by ensuring that vessels meet accepted international and domestic safety standards. Statutory instruments envisaged include: passenger boat regulations; merchant shipping &ndash; fishing vessels &ndash; regulations; merchant shipping &ndash; small fishing vessel &ndash; regulations; fishing vessel &ndash; radio installations &ndash; regulations; fishing vessels &ndash; fees &ndash; order; load line exemption rules; safety of life at sea &ndash; SOLAS &ndash; convention regulations; Merchant Shipping (Safe Manning, Hours of Work and Watchkeeping) (Amendment) Regulations; and radio installation-survey rules.</P>

      <P>The situation in the Middle East is a matter of grave concern to Ireland and our European Union partners. As I said to the press on 19 February, &ldquo;Both sides know what needs to be done. They should take the necessary steps immediately and pursue security and political steps in parallel. No other solution is possible.&rdquo;  This is even more the case today in the light of the further killings which have occurred over the past week.</P>
      <P>Ireland has constantly urged the parties to resume negotiations towards a final settlement. The Mitchell Committee report and the Tenet ceasefire plan offer the best available means to get such negotiations underway. This is also the view of our European Union partners. Yesterday a debate took place in the Security Council of the UN on the situation in the Middle East. A draft resolution was tabled for the consideration of the Council. It contains a number of new elements including recognising that a Palestinian state must live beside Israel and that normal relations should be established between Israel and all its neighbours. Ireland's representatives in New York will work to achieve the widest possible support for this draft resolution in the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1166" />Foreign Ministers of the European Union held an in depth discussion on the Middle East at our informal meeting at Caceres on 9 February. A range of ideas were presented by the Presidency and member states. These were further refined and considered again by the General Affairs Council on 18 February. At the Council it was decided that Mr. Javier Solana should visit the region to meet the parties and consider options for bringing forward the peace process and ending the current paralysis of trust.</P>
    <P>Mr. Solana has been in the region for the past three days and has had a number of high level meetings. Today he will visit Saudi Arabia to meet Crown Prince Abdullah and discuss the Prince's proposal for a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East problem based on Israeli withdrawal from the territories occupied in 1967 and the establishment of normal relations between Israel and other states in the region. He will report to the member states in the next few days and we shall then consider what further role the European Union can play in assisting the parties towards implementation of the Tenet plan and the Mitchell Report.</P>

      <P>Protocol 12 to the European Convention on Human Rights was signed by my colleague Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, on 4 November 2000 at the Euro<Col N="1167" /> pean Ministerial Conference on Human Rights in Rome.</P>
      <P>This protocol prohibits discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth, or status. In addition, it provides that no one should be discriminated against by any public authority on any ground such as those described above.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a comprehensive anti-discrimination legal code in place since the enactment of the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts which prohibit discrimination on nine separate grounds. It has also put in place an equality infrastructure which offers redress for individuals to pursue complaints in regard to discrimination experienced on any of these grounds. Ireland has, therefore, already provided in national law for many of the provisions of Protocol 12.</P>
      <P>There are ten ratifications needed for this protocol to come into force. Georgia is the only state to have ratified the protocol to date. The primary responsibility for the ratification of Protocol 12 is within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I understand that the protocol is under examination in that Department.</P>

      <P>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was signed by Ireland on 1 October 1973 and ratified on 8 December 1989. Upon ratification, Ireland made reservations to Articles 6(5), 10(2), 14, 19(2), 20(1) and 23(4). The reservation entered to Article 6(5), regarding the death penalty, was withdrawn. On 24 August 1998, Ireland transmitted notification of the withdrawal of the reservation to Article 14(6) and the reservation to Article 23(4) of the Covenant to the Secretary General of the United Nations. The enactment of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1993, which makes legislative provision for compensation of miscarriages of justice, rendered Ireland's reservation to Article 14(6) of the covenant, which provides that such compensation may be made by administrative rather than by legal means, unnecessary. The reservation to Article 23(4), which arose out of the former prohibition on divorce, was withdrawn further to the amendment of Article 41 of the Constitution and the subsequent enactment of the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland maintains the following reservations to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. These reservations are kept under review. <Col N="1168" /> The reservation to Article 10, paragraph 2 of the article deals with the segregation of accused persons from convicted persons and the segregation and treatment of juvenile offenders. Ireland accepts the principles referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 10 and implements them so far as practically possible. It reserves the right to regard full implementation of these principles as objectives to be achieved progressively.</P>
    <P>The reservation to Article 14 states &ldquo;Ireland reserves the right to have minor offences against military law dealt with summarily in accordance with current procedures which may not, in all respects, conform to the requirements of article 14 of the Covenant&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reservation to Article 19 paragraph 2, states &ldquo;Ireland reserves the right to confer a monopoly on or to require the licensing of broadcasting enterprises&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reservation to Article 20, paragraph 1 deals with the prohibition of propaganda for war and states &ldquo;Ireland accepts the principle in paragraph 1 of article 20 and implements it as far as it is practicable. Having regard to the difficulties in formulating a specific offence capable of adjudication at national level in such a form as to reflect the general principles of law recognised by the community of nations as well as the right to freedom of expression, Ireland reserves the right to postpone consideration of the possibility of introducing some legislative addition to, or variation of, existing law until such time as it may consider that such is necessary for the attainment of the objective of paragraph 1 of article 20&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>The following Council of Europe instruments in the European Treaty series have been ratified or signed without reservation as to ratification by Ireland since 26 June 1997: European Convention <Col N="1169" /> on Cinematographic Coproduction; Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities; European Agreement Relating to Persons Participating in the Proceedings of the European Court of Human Rights; Sixth Protocol to the General Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Council of Europe; 1996 European Social Charter (Revised) and its Additional Protocol Providing for a System of Collective Complaints; Protocol 7 to the European Convention on Human Rights. In addition, the European Landscape Convention will be signed and ratified within the next week.</P>
    <P>Ireland has signed or ratified the following international multilateral human rights instruments since 26 June 1997: the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; the Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on Involvement of Children in Armed Conflicts and on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography; the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>Given the large number and range of international human rights instruments in existence or under negotiation, signature or accession may not necessarily be under active consideration in respect of all such agreements at any given time. The situation is kept under review in the context of the ongoing assessment and prioritisation of Ireland's international commitments.</P>

      <P>Ireland is a party to five of the 12 universal conventions relating to terrorism. The Government attaches high priority to the bringing forward of legislation which would permit Ireland to become party to the outstanding seven conventions. On 18 December 2001, the Government approved the drafting of a Criminal Justice (United Nations Conventions) Bill, which if enacted would enable Ireland to become party to the following three UN Conventions; the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, 1973; the UN Convention against the Taking of Hostages, 1979; and the UN Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, 1997. On 16 January 2002, the Government approved the drafting of a Criminal Justice (Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism) Bill, which if enacted would enable Ireland to ratify the UN Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.</P>

The United Nations Convention on the Law of Treaties between States and International Organisations was done at Vienna on 21 March 1986 but has not yet entered into force. While consideration has been given to Ireland ratifying both of these conventions, further examination of their terms and of the requirements for implementing their provisions into Irish domestic law would be necessary before this could be done, due to the complexity of both instruments. The decision on when to conduct such a detailed examination will be made in the context of the ongoing assessment and prioritisation of Ireland's international commitments.</P>

      <P>Ireland became a party to the Statute of the International Court of Justice upon joining the United Nations in 1955, an act fully consistent with Ireland's commitment, under Article 29.2 of the Constitution, to the peaceful settlement of international disputes. However, in view of the possible implications of doing so at that time, we did not then make a declaration under article 36 (2) of the statute accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government is now favourably disposed to accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. However, the precise implications of making such a declar<Col N="1172" /> ation, and the question of what, if any, conditions or reservations should attach to it, are complex legal matters which require careful study and consideration. This process continues to be advanced within my Department.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, it should be borne in mind that, pending the making of such a declaration, the court may nevertheless exercise jurisdiction in disputes where there is a specific agreement between the parties that the court should do so or where specific treaties so provide. It should also be borne in mind that other forms of dispute settlement may be more suitable in certain cases.</P>

      <P>The Attorney General presented Ireland's second national report, which is submitted under article 40 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to the UN Committee on Human Rights in Geneva on 13 and 14 July 2000. The conclusions of the committee, which were received on 26 July, have been circulated widely and are available in the Library of the House and on the Department of Foreign Affairs' website. I am arranging for a copy to be sent directly to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General also gave the committee a brief description of the commitments entered into under the Good Friday Agreement, with particular emphasis on its human rights provisions. He drew attention to the Government's undertaking to &ldquo;bring forward measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights&rdquo; and that &ldquo;these proposals will draw on the European Convention on Human Rights and other international legal instruments&rdquo;. Progress on implementation of these and other measures was also reported to the committee.</P>
      <P>The committee, in its concluding observations, also recorded its appreciation of &ldquo;the high quality of the report of Ireland&rdquo;. It said it appreciated the additional oral and written information provided by the Government delegation during the examination of the report; this information was highly instructive and enhanced the dialogue between the committee and the delegation. Furthermore, the committee said it welcomed the publication and wide dissemination of the report by the Government and its willingness to involve non-governmental organisations in the process.</P>

      <P>The European Convention on the non-applicability of statutory limitation to crimes against humanity and war crimes was opened for signature on 25 January 1974. It requires three ratifications to enter into force. The Netherlands and Romania are to date the only two states to have ratified; Belgium and France have signed. The convention has not entered into force since it has not been ratified by the required number of countries. The United Nations convention on the non-applicability of statutory limitation to crimes against humanity and war crimes was opened for signature on 16 December 1968. It entered into force on 11 November 1970 and has been ratified by 45 countries.</P>
      <P>The object of these conventions is to encourage the adoption of measures by contracting states to ensure that statutory limitations shall not apply to crimes against humanity and war crimes. The position in this jurisdiction is that statutory limitations do not apply to these criminal offences and, accordingly, the question of signature and ratification by Ireland of these conventions is not seen as a priority. The Government has, therefore, no immediate plans to arrange for the ratification by Ireland of either convention.</P>

      <P>The position concerning the transposition of EC directives in the various member states is set out by the European Commission in its Annual Report on Monitoring the Application of Community Law. The most recent annual report is the eighteenth report published on 16 July 2001, which outlines the position as of 31 December 2000. Details of this report are available on the Commission's website at: www.europa.eu.int/eur-lex/en/com/rpt/2001/com2001&euro;0309en01.html.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As of 31 December 2000, 1,488 EC directives were applicable to Ireland and implementing measures in relation to 1,427 of these had been <Col N="1174" /> notified to the European Commission. This represents 95.90% of the total number of directives. The EU average for the transposal of directives as of 31 December 2000, was 96.59%. This is the highest rate achieved since 1992 and reflects an improvement in the situation in every member state.</P>
    <P>Ireland ranks 11th of the 15 member states for the notification of measures implementing directives. The difference between the rate of transposition in Ireland and the next five member states immediately above Ireland was less than 1%. The rate of transposal of directives in Ireland, as of 31 December 2000 &ndash; which stood at 95.90% &ndash; represented an improvement of 1.77% on the rate as it stood on 31 December 1999, when the figure was 94.13%.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 to 110, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As indicated in previous replies to similar questions on this subject, there is a very large number and variety of international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral, already in existence going back over a number of years. New proposals for draft international agreements are constantly being put forward for discussion and negotiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" />Consideration is given on an ongoing basis to the desirability of Ireland signing, or becoming a party to, those agreements which it has not already signed. In addition, it is often the case that the subject matter of an international agreement relates to the area of work of other Departments whose views must be taken into consideration in deciding whether or not Ireland should sign or become party to a particular international agreement. In many cases it will be necessary for other Departments to introduce new domestic legislation or put in place new administrative arrangements in order to allow Ireland to fulfil its obligations under an international agreement. In some cases, an amendment to the Constitution may be required.</P>
    <P>Given the large number and range of international agreements in existence or under negotiation, signature or accession may not necessarily be under active consideration in respect of all such agreements at any given time. The situation is kept under review in the context of the ongoing assessment and prioritisation of Ireland's international commitments. If the Deputy has a query concerning Ireland's position with regard to a particular international or proposed international agreement, I will be happy to provide him with more detailed information.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Question Nos. 111 to 116, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The answer to Question No. 111 was contained in a written answer on 30 January 2002 &ndash; Dáil Question No. 208 &ndash; as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Aviation Authority was established with effect from 1 January 1994 pursuant to the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993 to exercise powers and functions in relation to safety of air navigation services and regulation of safety at airports in the State. When consulted about proposed developments in the so-called red zones, the IAA advises the planning authorities of any conflict with international aviation safety requirements, and also draws their attention to increased public safety risks in those areas. The Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act, 1998, requires Aer Rianta to take all proper measures for safety, security, management, control, regulation, operation, marketing and development of its airports. In discharge of that statutory duty, it is a matter for Aer Rianta to decide what representations, if any, it should make to the relevant planning authorities in respect of proposed developments within or in proximity to the State airports. The planning authorities have the normal statutory responsibility to regulate development in their area. In doing this, they take account of a wide variety of concerns, including public safety. The red zones at airports were developed in the 1960s to indicate to the local authorities the areas in which development may need to be restricted, in the interests of aviation safety specifically, and public safety generally. The red zones have traditionally had two functions, namely, the aviation safety function of avoiding developments which potentially, because of their height, may interfere with safe take-off and landing of aircraft, but also avoiding developments which, because of their location, would add to public safety risks to people on the ground. This Department, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment and Local Government, has commissioned consultants to make recommendations for public safety zones in the vicinity of Dublin Airport. The recommendations of the consultants, ERM, will specifically deal with the risk to people on the ground. The work, when completed, will clarify that the primary agency in relation to aviation safety assessments will continue to be the Irish Aviation Authority, whereas the primary agency in assessing public safety risks will be the relevant planning authority itself. In any event, the planning authorities in accordance with their own statutory obligations, and ultimately, An Bord Pleanála, will continue to decide whether specific developments in the vicinity of airports <Col N="1179" /> receive planning permission. When the study is completed, the Department of the Environment and Local Government will issue planning guidelines in accordance with the Planning Acts to the local authorities to assist them in their consideration of the public safety aspects of planning applications in the vicinity of airports.</P>
    <P>While it had been hoped to have all work in relation to the study finalised by now, unfortunately the tragic events of 11 September meant that resources had to be diverted to deal with <Col N="1180" /> other very urgent matters. However, my Department is now reactivating the study with a view to concluding the work as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The IAA is not responsible for producing or publishing safeguarding maps for licensed aerodromes including the State airports. This is a responsibility for the owners or operators of such licensed aerodromes. The red safety areas for existing runways at Dublin Airport are similar in shape to those of the International Civil Aviation Organisation Annex 14 approach surface projected on to the ground. The respective sizes of the red safety areas for these runways are as follows:</P>

    <P>S.I. No. 14 of 2002 was made by the IAA in exercise of the powers conferred on that body under the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993. In accordance with the Act, the IAA does not require ministerial approval prior to making these orders. I am informed by the IAA that this order defines obstacles to aircraft in flight for the purpose of airspace protection in the State at, adjacent to and in the vicinity of aerodromes and elsewhere and specifies reporting and information requirements. These are new definitions and do not revoke or amend previous ones.</P>
    <P>In relation to Annex 4 and 14 of the Chicago Convention, the IAA will inform any interested parties where they may be purchased. In addition, the authority will be publishing relevant material on the IAA website at www.iaa.ie</P>

      <P>Iarnród Éireann is currently undertaking a major investment programme to upgrade the south-west rail corridor, including Portlaoise, into Heuston to provide additional capacity. This is being designed to meet the predicted demand levels for rail services on the corridor in question and is one of the projects benefiting under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The project is also included in the DTO strategy &ldquo;A Platform for Change&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Works at Heuston Station will cost an estimated &euro;117 million and over &euro;65 million in EU and Exchequer funds is being provided this year. I am informed by Iarnród Éireann that this work, over the next 18 months, will lead to improvements in commuter and intercity services. This work will increase the number of platforms in Heuston Station from five to nine, with platforms lengthened for increased number of services; remodel the trackwork at Heuston and the approaches to the station to separate long distance trains from commuter trains; allow faster journey times for all trains into and out of Heuston Station; re-signal the Heuston and Inchicore cabin areas to modern computerised signalling; and provide a secondary concourse to improve customer comfort and facilities at Heuston.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann will also start taking delivery this year of 80 new diesel railcars at a cost of approximately &euro;2 million each, which will lead to increased capacity on outer suburban routes, including Portlaoise to Dublin. Funding for these railcars is being provided by the Exchequer and EU as well as from CIE's resources. I expect to receive plans shortly from Iarnród Éireann to further increase the track and signalling capacity along the Kildare line to cater for growth over the coming years.</P>
      <P>As part of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 proposals, Iarnród Éireann is examining tenders for the supply of up to 67 new mainline locomotive-hauled carriages. These trains on entry into service will provide a significant improvement in the quality of mainline services on all inter-city routes.</P>

      <P>The following proposals for the <Col N="1181" /> establishment of bodies under my aegis are under consideration. On public transport, the general scheme of a Bill to establish a land use and transport authority for the greater Dublin area is currently being prepared by a cross-departmental team led by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The authority, which will act as the public transport regulator for the greater Dublin area, will be under the auspices of that department.</P>
      <P>Institutional arrangements for the regulation of public transport for the rest of the country are currently the subject of a consultation study. The Railway Safety Bill, 2001 will, when enacted, establish a statutory railway safety regulator to be known as the Railway Safety Commission. The commission will have wide-ranging powers of inspection, investigation and enforcement. The Railway Safety Bill, 2001 will also, when enacted, establish a statutory body to be known as the Railway Safety Advisory Council. The purpose of the council will be to consider matters relating to railway safety and make recommendations to the Minister or the Railway Safety Commission as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Under the Communications Regulation Bill it is intended to establish a commission for communications regulation, dissolve the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and transfer its functions to the commission. The Bill was approved for publication at the Government meeting of 19 February 2002 and it is my intention to have it published this week.</P>
      <P>Legislation has been recently passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas called the Sustainable Energy Bill, 2001 which will establish the Irish Energy Centre as an independent statutory body.

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to the areas under my remit is as follows. On rail and road transport, the task force on railway safety was established by the Government on 3 November 1998 to prepare prioritised recommendations to address the issues identified in the 1998 report by independent consultants led by IRMS entitled &ldquo;A Review of Railway Safety in Ireland&rdquo;. The task force, which comprised representatives of the Department of Public Enterprise, the Department of Finance and CIE, recommended a five year railway safety investment programme entitled the railway safety programme 1999-2003. The Government <Col N="1182" /> accepted the recommendation and committed &euro;546.7 million &ndash; in 1999 prices &ndash; to the programme. It is proposed to reconvene the task force in 2002 to consider railway safety investment requirements post 2003. It is not intended that the task force will be established on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental committee on the carriage of dangerous goods by rail, established in 1977, is charged with preparing emergency response procedures in the event of an accident involving a train carrying dangerous goods. The committee comprises representatives of the Departments of Public Enterprise, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Defence, Environment and Local Government and Health and Children and also Iarnród Éireann, the fire and ambulance services and heath boards-hospitals. It is not intended that the committee will be established on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>An interim Railway Procurement Agency was established by me in July 2001. The agency was subsequently established on a statutory basis on 28 December 2001 following the enactment of the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act, No. 55 of 2001. The level crossing working group was established in recognition of the safety risks at road-rail interfaces. The function of the group is to monitor safety performance, identify vulnerable-high risk locations or scenarios and the means for achieving appropriate risk reduction. The group comprises representatives of the Departments of Public Enterprise and Environment and Local Government, Iarnród Éireann, Dublin Corporation, the National Roads Authority and the Garda Síochána. It is not intended that the group will be established on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>The following committees-Groups have also been set up public transport accessibility committee; public transport partnership forum; informal working group on the possible use of alternative fuels by Dublin Bus; interdepartmental committee on rural public transport; NDP monitoring committee; NDP communications committee; and quality customer service committee. A top level group of three persons has also been established to assist Iarnród Éireann in facing the challenges of expansion of the rail network and in delivering improved service. There are no proposals to give these committees or groups a statutory basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I established the road haulage review group in December 1997 to oversee a review of the sector. This group, chaired by my Department, consisted of representatives of both service providers and service users. The review resulted in the publication of a report entitled &ldquo;A Strategy for the Successful Development of the Road Haulage Industry&rdquo;. The road haulage review implementation group, consisting of representatives of IBEC, IRHA and my Department, was established in June 1999 to implement the recommendations of the strategy for the successful development of the road haulage industry. The <Col N="1183" /> programme of action for the road haulage industry steering group was formed to implement the commitments contained in the programme of action for the road haulage industry and had its first meeting in May 2001. The steering group has subsumed the work of the road haulage review implementation group. There are no proposals to give a statutory basis to any of the above groups.</P>
    <P>The Irish Energy Centre was established by a memorandum of understanding entered into between the Department of Public Enterprise, formerly the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, and Enterprise Ireland, formerly Forbairt, which came into effect in January 1995. The Government, at its meeting of 5 May 1998, decided to set up the IEC as an independent body, under the auspices of my Department.</P>
    <P>Legislation has been recently passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas called the Sustainable Energy Bill, 2001 which will establish the Irish Energy Centre as an independent statutory body. The centre will be renamed the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. The Bill is expected to be signed by the President in the coming days. An interim board, with 11 members, was appointed by the Minister of State in my Department in December 2000, to oversee the transition of the centre to an independent body. A board for the new authority will be appointed as set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In November 1999, the Minister of State at my Department established the renewable energy strategy group. The terms of reference for the group were set out in the 1999 Green Paper on sustainable energy. The group submitted its report in July 2000. There are no proposals to give the strategy group a statutory basis. During 2001, the Minister of State appointed a steering group to oversee and advise him on the implementation of the NDP-ESIOP-funded grid upgrade development programme. There are no proposals to give a statutory basis to the steering group.</P>
    <P>From a nuclear safety perspective the following committees were set up: ministerial committee on nuclear safety which was established in February 1998; consultative committee on nuclear emergency planning which was established in October 1999; and the committee of ministers (nuclear emergency planning) which was established in November 1998. There are no proposals to put these committees on a statutory footing.</P>
    <P>The gas 2025 steering group was formed on 19 October 1997. The purpose of the steering group was to monitor a joint study on the Irish natural gas usage to 2025 carried out by representatives from my Department and Bord Gáis Éireann and determine the optimal long-term transmission infrastructure necessary to meet these projections. There are no proposals to give a statutory basis to the above group.</P>
    <P>On communications, an interdepartmental committee has been established to review <Col N="1184" /> arrangements regarding internet related network security matters. There are currently no proposals to give this committee a statutory basis. Digital Media Development Limited is the body established to oversee the development of the digital hub in the Thomas Street area of Dublin. The board was appointed by the Taoiseach, under whose aegis the project was initiated, in April 2000. Responsibility for the project transferred to my Department in May 2001.</P>
    <P>It is intended to establish DMDL on a statutory footing as the digital hub development agency, DHDA. The DHDA Bill, which defines the functions of the agency with regard to the development of the digital hub, and provides the necessary corporate and regulatory structures for a State body, was published on 14 January last. It is hoped to bring this Bill before the Dáil in the next session.</P>
    <P>The post office working group, IDG, was formed in 2001 for the purpose of establishing a basis for the sustainable operation of the post office network. There are no proposals to give a statutory basis to the above group.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following table:</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>(A)&nbsp;<i>Aviation Regulation and International Relations.</i>There are two Directives in relation to Aviation Regulations that have not yet been transposed into law.</P>
      <P>Both of these Directives will be transposed via Statutory Instrument entitled: European Communities (Restrictions of subsonic Jet Aeroplanes Operations) (Amendment) Regulation, 2002.</P>

Expected date of implementation March 2002.</P>
      <P>The European Commission has addressed a Reasoned Opinion to Ireland, pursuant to Article 226 of the EC Treaty, relating to the failure to implement Directives 98/20/EC and 98/28/EC.</P>
      <P>(B)<i>&nbsp;Renewable Energy</i>There is one Directive in relation to Renewable Energy.</P>
      <P>Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27th September 2001 concerns the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market.</P>
      <P>The Directive requires Member States to increase, by 2010, the contribution of renewables based electricity consumption in line with the thresholds outlined in the Annex to the document. The target for Ireland is 13.2%. This is required to be implemented before October 2003</P>
      <P>On the 27 September, 2001 the European Council and Parliament adopted Directive 2001/77/EC on the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market. The deadline for full implementation of the Directive is 23 October 2003 and the means of transposition have not yet been decided.</P>
      <P>(C)&nbsp;<i>Public Transport Regulatory Affairs</i>There are six Directives in relation to Public Transport.</P>
      <P>1.&nbsp;Council Directive 96/48/EC on the interoperability of the trans-European high speed rail system. Transposition will be effected by Statutory Instrument. Transposition is overdue, but will be completed in the near future. Judgement has been issued by the European Court of Justice in this case.</P>
      <P>2.&nbsp;Commission Directive 2001/6 adopting for the third time Council Directive 96/49/EC on the transport of dangerous goods by rail.

    </Speaker>
    <P>3.&nbsp;Council Directive 2001/12 amending Directive 91/440/EC on the development of the Community's <Col N="1186" /> railways. Transposition will be effected by Statutory Instrument. Transposition is not overdue.</P>

    <P>5.&nbsp;Council Directive 2001/14 on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and safety certification. Transposition will be effected by Statutory Instrument. Transposition is not overdue.</P>
    <P>6.&nbsp;Council Directive 2001/16 on the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system. Transposition will be effected by Statutory Instrument. Transposition is not overdue.</P>
    <P>(D)&nbsp;<i>Communications Regulation</i>Directive 97/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 1997 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector has not yet been transposed into Irish law. Transposition was due under Article 15 of the Directive not later than 24 October 1998. The European Commission has instituted proceedings under Article 226 of the Treaty seeking a declaration that Ireland has failed to fulfil its obligations under the Directive. It is intended that the relevant Statutory Instrument will be signed into force in the near future.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out as follows:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Road Haulage</i>The relevant Act and sections are sections 4 to 8, 11, 16 and 23 of the Road Transport Act, 1999. The delay in introducing the commencement order is to allow my Department time to introduce a new vehicle plating system. Amending regulations will also have to be introduced to make provision for certain sections of the Road Transport Acts 1933-1986, which are being repealed. It is intended that the commencement order and the amending regulations will be introduced later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Communications Regulation: Commencement orders for the following provisions of the Postal and Telecommunications Services (Amendment) Act, 1999 have not been made (i) Sections 19(3), 22 and 24 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983. These provisions had not been commenced while the State retained any shareholding in Eircom. Consideration is now being given to the appropriateness of making commencement orders for the above provisions; (ii) Sections 28 and 30 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983. The above provisions cannot be repealed until Eircom's State-guaranteed loans, which extend up to 2003 have been cleared; and (iii) Sections 46(9) and (11) of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983. These provisions must remain until <Col N="1187" /> the obligations of the Minister for Finance to Eircom's superannuation fund have been cleared.</P>

      <P>There is one statutory instrument being prepared in the Civil Defence branch entitled Air-Raid Precautions Services (Compensation for Personal Injuries) (Fifth Amendment) Scheme, 2002. The effect of this proposed statutory instrument is to update the compensation payable under S.I. No. 183 of 1976, Air-Raid Precautions Services (Compensation for Personal Injuries) (Fourth Amendment) Scheme, 1976. The amendments proposed are currently with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government for final preparation. S.I. No. 104 of 1973 Air-Raid Precautions Services (Compensation for Personal Injuries) Scheme, 1973 allows compensation in certain circumstances to Civil Defence volunteers or their dependants, if the volunteers are injured, disabled or die while on Civil Defence duty. At present, my Department is engaged in an ongoing programme of reviewing all Defence Force regulations with a view to their simplification and modernisation. Defence Force regulations are statutory instruments made by the Minister for <Col N="1196" /> Defence pursuant to various provisions of the Defence Acts, 1954 to 1998. Many of the provisions in the regulations are out-dated and overly detailed. While certain matters relating to the management of the Defence Forces will continue to be prescribed in regulations in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Defence Act, all of the administrative detail relating thereto will be the subject of administrative instructions which will be issued by the relevant senior military authority.</P>

Earlier this week Minister of State, Deputy Davern, announced the first tranche of awards under the scheme totalling &euro;6.2 million. Further awards of grant aid under the scheme will be approved in the near future and this application will be considered in that context.</P>

Most of these have actually been approved by this stage, or are awaiting additional information from the applicant, but there are a small number of cases, 11 in all, where approval to commence work has not issued within the time limit set out in the protocol on direct payments to farmers, that is, within three months of receipt of a valid application. This is an unavoidable consequence of the continuing requirement to deploy some technical staff to foot and mouth duties.

      <P>Regulation 42 of the Animal Remedies Regulations, 1996, imposes a legal obligation on farmers, or other persons in charge of animals, to maintain an animal remedies record in a format specified under the regulations. This record of all administrations to food-producing animals of veterinary medicines which are either subject to a veterinary prescription or have a withdrawal period, constitutes an important element of the overall controls on the use of veterinary medicines and is particularly necessary in facilitating controls designed to ensure that specified withdrawal periods are observed.</P>
      <P>It is primarily a matter for farmers, or others in charge of animals, to maintain the animal remedies record in the manner specified. In order purely to facilitate farmers in the bovine sector in meeting their legal obligations, it was decided to avail of the opportunity afforded by the issue of herd registers to include a section for recording veterinary treatments in the specified manner. This was not done in any other sector and was never intended to set a precedent in the bovine sector itself. It is not, therefore, intended to issue replacements.   </P>

      <P>The facts surrounding the current beef market do not suggest there is a collapse in price. The predominant fact is that the market is firm with strong prices both here and in the EU generally particularly for male cattle. Steer prices in Ireland have increased by 17% from 224 cent/kilo, 80p/lb, last November to 262 <Col N="1203" /> cent/kilo, 94p/lb, for week ending 17 February &ndash; the last week for which we have official figures. Cow prices, on average, have improved by 7% in the same period. However, prices for the very poor grade cows have disimproved in recent weeks. Overall, prices are satisfactory especially when account is also taken of increased direct payments for 2002 under Agenda 2000.</P>
      <P>The factors underpinning the beef market is the strong demand in the UK because of the foot and mouth cull which has increased significantly that country's import requirements for 2002 and the increase in consumption in the EU which is reflected in increased demand.</P>
      <P>I will continue to monitor the market to ensure that there is a satisfactory return to those producers operating in the beef sector. I am meeting with Commissioner Fischler this week and one of the items we will be discussing is the beef market and the appropriate supports to maintain prices.</P>

      <P>There are currently just over 6,500 farmers who have land annuity commitments amounting to &euro;2.1 million annually. Some 4,600 of these annuitants have current arrears totalling approximately &euro;5.3 million. To date no arrears cases have been brought to court. In order to reduce the amount of arrears, 216 accounts with long-standing arrears were referred to a debt collection agency. Approximately 3,000 annuitants have annual repayments of less than &euro;100. The need for measures such as those provided in 1992 and 1993 is reviewed by my Department from time to time.</P>
      <P>In carrying out such reviews particular attention is paid to the impact such schemes would have on the Exchequer and on farmers with current land purchase annuities. In relation to the cases referred to a debt collection agency, the arrears involved have been outstanding for some time and little effort has been made by those involved in contacting my Department with a view to discharging the arrears outstanding. I am not aware of undue pressure being placed on small family farms.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 154 to 156, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My Department is in the process of establishing the agriculture appeals office on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>The following committees-bodies were established by my Department on a non-statutory basis: the agri-food 2010 committee; the beef task force; the sheepmeat forum; the monitoring committee on implementation of the recommendations of the sheep forum; the technical committee on meat inspection fees; the food agency co-operation council; the food quality assurance schemes review group; the food institutional research measure committee; the food NDP monitoring sub-committee; the task force on agricultural education and training; the strategy group for the pig industry; the agenda 2000 consultative group; the interdepartmental committee on dangerous and exotic animals; the inter-agency group on the silvermines investigation; the BSE scientific advisory committee; the equine liaison committee; the monitoring committee under the protocol on direct payments to farmers; the organic development committee; the monitoring committee for leader; the mid-term review consultative committee on milk quotas; the quota review group; the advisory committee on the role of women in agriculture; the monitoring committee on the CAP rural development plan, 2000-2006; consumer liaison panel; and the advisory forum on farm animal welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also intended to establish the beef consultative group on EU policy on a non-statutory basis to assist this Department in assessing options for Ireland in relation to the forthcoming <Col N="1205" /> mid-term review of Agenda 2000. I do not consider it necessary to establish any of the above on a statutory basis. The Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001, established Horse Racing Ireland, a new State body, which replaced the Irish Horseracing Authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001, sets out the functions of Horse Racing Ireland, including the registry office and related functions which are to transfer from the Racing Regulatory Body to HRI. Section 8(2) provides for a separate commencement of this section from the rest of the Act. Discussions are currently under way between the Racing Regulatory Body and HRI to achieve an orderly transfer of these functions, including arrangements for the transfer of staff and associated matters such as the terms and conditions of their employment. I hope that arrangements will be finalised by both parties in <Col N="1206" /> the near future, which will enable me to make the commencement order to give effect to section 8 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001.</P>
    <P>The following statutory instruments are being prepared by my Department:</P>
    <P>1.&nbsp;European Committees (Beef Carcass Classification) Regulation, 1994, (S.I. No. 8 of 1994) is being drafted to allow the Minister appoint as a classification officer any employee of the slaughterer he considers to be a fit person to carry out the functions of a classification officer.</P>
    <P>2.&nbsp;Statutory instruments on fodder plant seed, seed of oil and fibre plants and the common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species are being prepared. The proposed effect of each is consolidate existing regulations and to introduce detailed rules in respect of genetically modified plant varieties and plant genetic resources.</P>
    <P>3.&nbsp;A statutory instrument is being prepared to give effect to the EU regulations governing the production of organic food.</P>
    <P>4.&nbsp;The European Communities (Milk Quota) (Amendment Regulations, 2002, are currently nearing completion. These regulations will amend the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations, 2000, S. I. No. 84 of 2000) to provide detail rules for the introduction and operation of milk production partnerships in Ireland.</P>
    <P>5.&nbsp;European Communities (Wine) Regulations: The purpose of this statutory instrument is to confer powers of entry on authorised officers and to provide for penalties for breaches of the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1493/99 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine. Council Regulation 1493/99 automatically has the force of law here, but national legislation &ndash; secondary &ndash; is required to enable it to be policed.</P>
    <P>6.&nbsp;European Communities (Marketing of Cocoa and Chocolate products intended for human consumption) Regulations: The purpose of this statutory instrument is to transpose Directive 2000/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to cocoa and chocolate products into Irish law. The deadline for the implementation of this directive is 3 August 2003.</P>
    <P>7.&nbsp;European Communities (Marketing of Fruit Jams, Jellies, Marmalades and sweetened Chestnut puree intended for human consumption) Regulations: The purpose of this statutory instrument is to transpose Council Directive 2001/113/EC relating to fruit jams, jellies and marmalades and similar products into Irish law. The deadline for the implementation of this directive is 12 July 2003.</P>
    <P>8.&nbsp;A statutory instrument, the European Communities (Welfare of Laying Hens) Regulations, 2002, is currently being prepared giving effect to Council Directive No. 1999/74/EC of 19 July 1999 laying down minimum standards for the protection of laying hens.</P>
    <P>9.&nbsp;A statutory instrument, Abattoirs Act, 1988 (Veterinary Examination) (Amendment) Regulations, 2002, is in the course of preparation in order to establish a pig salmonella control programme.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;10.&nbsp;A statutory instrument, European Communities (Marketing Standards for Poultrymeat) Regulations, 2002, is currently being prepared in order to update national legislation that transposes EU marketing standards regulations.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;11.&nbsp;European Communities (Marketing of fruit juices and certain similar products intended for human consumption) Regulations. The purpose of this statutory <Col N="1207" /> instrument is to transpose Council Directive 2001/112/EC relating to fruit juices and similar products into Irish law. The deadline for the implementation of this directive is 12 July 2003.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 to 162, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland signed the International Coffee Agreement at the UN Headquarters in New York in September 2001 and, in accordance with Article 45(2) thereof, is applying the agreement provisionally pending ratification. Ratification will be finalised before 30 June 2002. An order under section 40 of the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act, 1967, is required and is in course of preparation at present. The International Cocoa Agreement 2001 was opened for signature at UN Headquarters from 1 May 2001 until 31 December 2002. Agreement was negotiated through the International Cocoa Organisation under the auspices of the UN. It is proposed to sign the agreement at the same time as the other member states of the EU. This will not require new legislation. It should be noted that the International Cocoa Agreement 1993, which has been ratified by Ireland, remains in force pending entry <Col N="1208" /> into force of the International Cocoa Agreement 2001.</P>
    <P>The following international multilateral agreements have not been signed by the State: The Protocol of Amendment to the European Convention for the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes. This protocol was agreed by the Council of Europe and opened for signature on 6 February 1992. Clarification has now been received from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that additional legislation is not required. Therefore, the State may now proceed to ratify and sign the protocol. I intend to proceed with this matter at an early date. The European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals &ndash; this convention was agreed by the Council of Europe and opened for signature on 13 November 1987. The ratification and signing of this convention is under consideration.</P>
    <P>There are no international multilateral agreements under the auspices of my Department which have been signed but not ratified or acceded to by the State. On behalf of member states, the EU Commission is conducting negotiations in the Council of Europe to revise the European Convention for the Protection of Animals during transport. These negotiations may be completed in June 2002.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the HIPC initiative strengthened with the development of poverty reduction strategies is the best mechanism currently available to bring the debts of the highly indebted poor countries to a sustainable level. That said, I recognise, and have stated on several occasions, that the HIPC initiative in its current form may not provide <Col N="1209" /> many of the eligible countries with a permanent exit from unsustainable debt. I have, therefore, given my support to calls for further enhancement of the HIPC initiative, including additional funding on the part of donors, if the initiative fails to meet its stated aim. I have also publicly stated that the current concept of debt sustainability may need to be revised to take account of basic social needs.</P>
      <P>Conditions imposed by international lenders are not intended to create harsh or impossible burdens. However, it must be pointed out that economic mismanagement, excessive spending on arms or other inappropriate strategies have led several countries into positions where external credit becomes impossible to obtain. The IMF and the World Bank seek to foster involvement by the debtor country in developing appropriate solutions. This, in itself, goes a long way towards alleviating the conditionalities which have often provoked resentment in the past.</P>
      <P>Over two years have passed since the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, PRSP, approach was launched in September 1999. The early experience has been encouraging; the PRSP approach is beginning to take hold in many countries. Some 36 countries have prepared interim strategies. Five countries have completed their first full PRSP and are shifting their focus toward implementation. The bank, fund and a growing number of other development partners have intensified their efforts to support countries in formulating strategies and to use the PRSP as a basis for their own assistance.</P>
      <P>Bank and fund staff are currently undertaking a comprehensive review of experience to date with the PRSP approach. The review will consider both the process and content of poverty reduction strategies, drawing on inputs from PRSP countries, civil society, and external partners. The review will include contributions from governments and individuals and civil society organisations in developing countries, aid donors, and international civil society organisations and other interested parties. The PRSP review, and a companion review of the IMF's poverty reduction and growth facility being conducted in parallel by the fund, will be presented to the executive boards of the bank and fund within the next few months.</P>
      <P>One will see from this that both the bank and the fund are taking important steps toward giving developing countries charge of their own development programmes. While the bank and the fund support the preparation of the PRSPs, they are country-driven and country-owned.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 166, 167 and 169 together as they all relate to the same individual and that individual's eligibility for tax relief under the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fundamental requirement of this scheme <Col N="1211" /> that the disabled person meets the medical criteria specified in the relevant regulations and is in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the local health board. Where the issue of a primary medical certificate is refused, it is open to the applicant to appeal this refusal to the disabled drivers' medical board of appeal, an independent body whose decision is final. It will be noted that neither the Revenue Commissioners nor my Department has any role in the medical assessment of persons for the purposes of admission to the scheme. The Revenue Commissioners are unable to consider an application for admission to the scheme without the issue of a primary medical certificate. For the Deputy's information, there are other State funded schemes aimed at mobility, namely a mobility allowance and a motorised transport grant, both of which are payable by the health boards.</P>

      <P>The details required by the Deputy are as follows. Structural Funds-monitoring committees: Under European Council Regulation 1260-1999 laying down the general provision and arrangements for the Structural Funds, monitoring committees must be established for each operational programme. Under the European Commission's INTERREG III community initiatives programmes, monitoring committees are due to be established for the Ireland-Wales and Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG IIIA programmes; North West Europe and Atlantic Area INTERREG IIIB programmes; and the INTERREG IIIC programme. It is not proposed to give these committees a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>Management agency for Civil Service crèches: Under the Civil Service child care initiative I announced in budget 2001, funding of &euro;12.5 million was provided over two years to establish up to 15 crèches for the children of civil servants. I have approved the establishment of a management agency for Civil Service crèches. The agency will have the following functions: to promote the provision of crèches under the Civil Service child care initiative, in accordance with Government policy; to advise generally on that provision; to contract with suitable individuals or companies to run Civil Service crèches on foot of tenders considered and decided by the board of the agency in line with normal public procurement procedures. It is proposed to establish the agency on a statutory basis and I have agreed to the preparation of a draft memorandum for the Government. In the meantime, on legal advice, the agency has been established on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and I have appointed an interim board.</P>
      <P>Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority: the Government decision of 20 February 2001 to establish the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, within the new structure of the Central Bank of Ireland and Financial Services Authority, includes the establishment of a board of ten members to be the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also includes the replacement of the board of the Central Bank by a new board of the Central Bank of Ireland and Financial Services Authority to have 12 members, six from the regulatory side and six from the monetary side. Legislation to implement these proposals is now at an advanced stage of preparation. Closely related proposals for the establishment of consultative consumer and industry panels are being developed and will be provided for in a companion Bill which is also being prepared. NTMA claims advisory committee: a policy committee is <Col N="1213" /> to be established to advise the National Treasury Management Agency in dealing with claims as provided for in section 12 of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act, 2000.</P>

      <P>The disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions regulations, 1994, were drawn up by the Minister for Finance and come under the remit of the Revenue Commissioners. The Department of Health and Children has no statutory responsibility for the regulations or their operation.</P>
      <P>To qualify, a person must meet one or more of the following medical criteria which are specified in the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions regulations, 1994, which are not set by the Department of Health and Children: the applicant is wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; the applicant is wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; the applicant is without both hands or without both arms; the applicant is without one or both legs; the applicant is wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; the applicant has the medical condition of dwarfism and has serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 188 and 189 together.</P>
      <P>In 2002 I provided a non-capital determination of approximately &euro;650 million to the Western Health Board. As part of this allocation I provided in excess of &euro;9 million for the continued development of acute hospital services in the region.</P>

    <P>There has been a major capital development, phase 2, at Mayo General Hospital in recent years which provides for enhanced services at the hospital. A sum of &euro;3.9 million was provided to <Col N="1221" /> the Western Health Board this year for the continued commissioning of the new facilities provided under the phase 2 capital development.</P>
    <P>The detailed use of this funding and the phasing of developments at the hospital are matters for the Western Health Board.

      <P>Pursuant to a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Government established a tribunal of inquiry on the fire at the Stardust, Artane, Dublin in February 1981. The tribunal's remit was to investigate the causes and circumstances of the fire and subsequent loss of life, and to make recommendations in relation to the fire service, fire prevention and related matters. The tribunal sat for 122 days and its 1982 report sets out its detailed <Col N="1224" /> examination, conclusions and recommendations on these issues.</P>
      <P>All of these recommendations have received full and careful consideration and have either been implemented or taken into account in the ongoing formulation of policy on fire safety and the development of the local authority fire services in the intervening period. Improvements have been carried out on a comprehensive basis, covering such areas as the financing and equipping of the local fire service, its organisation and staffing, training, the legislative framework and emergency planning. A further public inquiry into the cause of this tragic fire is not proposed at this stage.</P>
      <P>A separate Stardust compensation tribunal was appointed by the Minister for Justice in October 1985, following a Government decision and a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas. Under the chairmanship of the Honourable Mr. Justice Donal Barrington, its remit was to make <i>ex gratia</i> awards to those who suffered as a result of the Stardust fire. I understand that there have been no calls for a review of the work of this tribunal.</P>

      <P>The NSS public consultation paper, &ldquo;Indications for the Way Ahead&rdquo;, published last September included, among other issues for debate, the viewing of Ireland in terms of 12 functional areas as providing a useful explanation for the basis on which Ireland functions spatially. The paper expressly stated that these tentative areas were not intended to require the adjustment of any regional or other administrative boundaries. While the map appended to the consultation paper shows a south midlands functional area, it did not, accordingly, in any way purport to suggest the establishment of a new south midlands administrative region. A number of the submissions received by my Department in response to the consultation paper have addressed themselves to the role of the above described concept of functional areas. Regard will be had to these and all other submissions in finalising the national spatial ethics strategy.</P>

      <P>The position regarding untreated sewage discharges set out in the most recent Environmental Protection Agency report on urban waste water discharges in Ireland, which related to the 1998-99 period, is <Col N="1226" /> being rapidly overtaken by developments under my Department's water services investment programme. Some &euro;4.4 billion has been provided in the national development plan for capital expenditure on water services in the years 2000 to 2006. A major focus of this investment is on the expansion and upgrading of waste water infrastructure to meet the requirements of the EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive. A number of significant waste water schemes have already been substantially completed in locations such as Drogheda, Dundalk, Leixlip, Osberstown and Loughrea. The provision of the necessary facilities is well advanced in other locations such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway. The NDP provides for an investment of &euro;1.7 billion to complete the remaining waste water schemes required under the directive.</P>
      <P>Of the 37 agglomerations covered by the directive that were identified in the EPA report as being without waste water treatment, my Department's water services investment programme for 2000-2002, announced in July 2000, includes schemes to provide secondary treatment, or better, in 31 of those locations, representing almost 99% of the total effluent load. Schemes already completed, in progress or scheduled to start up to the end of 2002 will meet the treatment requirements for over 97% of the total load. The investment programme for 2000-2002 is the first phase of a rolling three year strategy that will be progressively advanced up to the end of the NDP in 2006. Further waste water schemes will be approved in future phases of the programme.</P>

      <P>Passenger cars are required to undergo a roadworthiness test when they are four years old and every two years thereafter. Each test due date is set by reference to the date of first registration of the vehicle. Accordingly, where a NCT inspection occurs after the test due date, the NCT certificate is valid from the date of the test to the next test due date. This arrangement follows from the test schedule laid down in Directive 96/96/EC, which requires mandatory vehicle testing in all member states.</P>

      <P>Where a person who was formerly self-employed makes a claim for unemployment assistance, and a deciding officer of my Department is satisfied that the self-employment has ceased, any income which accrued to that person in the past from that self-employment is not assessed as means. Where a person either makes a claim to or is in receipt of unemployment assistance and that person continues to be engaged in self-employment, the deciding officer, in the absence of any other means of ascertaining it, will assess the net income received in the past year.</P>
      <P>Income from self-employment can vary from week to week and the current arrangements avoid the necessity to continuously recalculate means because means are assessed by reference to income over a full year. I am satisfied that these arrangements are a fair and reasonable method of estimating income from self-employment for the purposes of unemployment assistance. However, if there is a change in the person's position which is likely to have an ongoing effect on the amount earned from self-employment, this matter should be brought to the attention of the deciding officer or, alternatively, if the person is already in receipt of unemployment assistance, a review of means should be sought. I would also like to point out that a person may appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office if he or she is dissatisfied with any decision of a deciding officer.</P>

      <Quest>the latest regulations regarding eligibility for citizens with pre-1953 stamps; and if further credits can be obtained to enable these citizens to obtain a larger portion of the contributory pension.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 2000 I introduced a special old age contributory pension for people who commenced insurable employment before 1953 and who had paid insurance comprising either national health insurance or a combination of social insurance and national health insurance but who, under previous arrangements, would not have been entitled to pension. This initiative has been an unprecedented success. Since its introduction some 23,500 claims have been received to date. More than 10,000 people have qualified for pension under this scheme for the first time. In addition, another 8,500 people who had been in receipt of <i>pro rata</i> old age contributory or retire<Col N="1242" /> ment pensions have qualified for higher pensions under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Applications continue to be received and processed and the numbers benefiting will, therefore, continue to grow for some time. To qualify for this special pension, a person must have paid contributions before 1953 and have a minimum of 260 full rate contributions paid in total. This can be made up solely of pre-1953 contributions or a mixture of contributions paid before and after 1953, provided at least one contribution was paid prior to 1953. In taking contributions paid by or in respect of an employed contributor under the National Health Insurance Acts, 1911 to 1952, into account for the purposes of qualifying for pre-1953 pension every two such contributions are reckoned as three contributions paid with any odd contribution being reckoned as two contributions paid. The rate of pension payable is 50% of the standard maximum personal rate of old age contributory pension, which is currently &euro;147.40, £116.</P>
      <P>Persons who have in excess of the minimum 260 contributions needed for the pre-1953 pension, could possibly qualify for a higher standard rate of old age contributory pension under the previous rules, based on their yearly average of contributions paid or credited since 1953. In this regard, as part of the decision process in all cases, applicants for the pre-1953 pension would have their entitlement to a higher standard rate of pension examined before determining the position relating to the pre-1953 pension. Where entitlement to the higher rate exists, this would be put into payment in favour of the pre-1953 pension. There are no other arrangements whereby claimants can qualify for a higher pension under the pre-1953 arrangements.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims are made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>Ratification or signature by Ireland of an international agreement is a matter for decision by the Government. The United Nations Convention of 1962, referred to in this question, has not been the subject of a Government decision to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, my Department and the Department of Health and Children are undertaking a programme for the modernisation of the civil <Col N="1243" /> registration service. As part of this process, I have responsibility for the review and modernisation of the legislation relating to the registration of births, deaths and marriages. As a consequence of the review, I propose to publish a new civil registration Bill later this year which will modernise and consolidate the existing legislation and facilitate the introduction of new technology and organisational change. In advance of this legislation I recently published, in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2002, a number of technical amendments to the existing legislation to facilitate the implementation of an electronic issue of birth, marriage and death certificates by registrars.</P>
    <P>There are certain substantial issues in relation to marriage that are outside the scope of this review of legislation which need to be addressed. To address these issues the Government approved the setting up of an interdepartmental committee to establish an approach to the review of legislation relating to the registration of marriages and related issues. This committee will be set up shortly. The issue of seeking Government approval for the State to accede to the UN convention of 1962 on consent to marriage, minimum age for marriage and registration of marriage will be examined in the context of the committee's review of these issues.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 221 to 223, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to establish the dormant <Col N="1244" /> accounts fund disbursements board and the board of the new Family Support Agency shortly. The Dormant Accounts Act, 2001, provides for the appointment by the Minister of the dormant accounts fund disbursements board, the remit of which will be to oversee a scheme for disbursement of surplus dormant funds. The board will consist of a chairperson and eight ordinary members representative of the Minister, the financial services industry and people with knowledge of, or experience in relation to, the purposes for which disbursements will be made or any other matters relevant to the board's functions. I am consulting with relevant interests with regard to appointments to the board.</P>
    <P>Family support agency legislation to establish the family support agency was enacted on 22 December 2001. The Family Support Agency Act provides for the establishment of a statutory body which will bring together the main programmes and pro-family services introduced by this Government in recent years. Its main aim is to support families, promote continuity axed stability in family life and prevent marital breakdown, and to foster a supportive community environment for families at local level.</P>
    <P>The new agency will be a resource for voluntary and community groups and others involved in promoting family well-being. In addition to raising awareness about family and parenting issues, it will also undertake research. It will be overseen by a board comprising members with experience and expertise in fields such as family mediation, the family community resource programme, counselling, research, family law and parenting.</P>
    <P>The national advisory committee to the money advice and budgeting service, which advises the Minister on matters relating to the service, currently operates on a non-statutory basis. I propose, as part of the money advice and budgeting service Bill, due to be published shortly, to establish the committee on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>In November 2000 I established, as part of Ireland's contribution to the International Year of Volunteers 2001, a national committee on volunteering. The objective of the committee is to devise strategies and actions for supporting and developing volunteering. The membership of the committee comprises representatives from relevant Departments, universities with related research or training roles, business and industry, foundations, leading NGOs and community and voluntary groups, together with some individuals. I have no plans to establish the committee on a statutory basis. There are no bodies operating under the aegis of my Department which have set up under statutory instrument.</P>

      <P>There are two directives issued under the treaties establishing the European Communities, parts of which come under the auspices of my Department, which are awaiting transposition into Irish law. These are Council Directive 98/49/EC, which was adopted on 29 June 1998, and Council Directive 2000/43/EC, which was adopted on 29 June 2000.</P>
      <P>Directive 98/49/EC deals with the preservation of benefits, disclosure of information and payment of occupational pensions across borders for workers who move from one member state to another. It also provides for workers who are posted abroad to be allowed to stay in their occupational schemes and to be exempt from joining such a scheme in the country to which they are posted.</P>
      <P>This directive was adopted on 29 June 1998. Member states were required to comply with the directive by 25 January 2002, and member states are to communicate to the Commission the text of the provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by the same date. The Pensions Act is already largely in compliance with the terms of the directive. However, some minor changes are required to that Act to ensure full compliance. These have been incorporated in the forthcoming Pensions (Amendment) Bill, which is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas. My Department has already informed the European Commission of this situation, and explained that the delay in implementing the directive is due to the complexity of the Pensions Bill. The aim is to have the Pensions Bill fully enacted by the end of March this year, and I will then be in a position to inform the European Commission that we are in full compliance with the directive. In view of this, the Government did not consider it necessary to seek a derogation in relation to the date of implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Directive 2000/43/EC relates to implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin. The purpose of the directive is to allow the participation of all persons, natural and legal, in society regardless of racial or ethnic origin. This directive was <Col N="1246" /> adopted by the Council of the European Union on 29 June 2000. While primary responsibility for its implementation rests with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the scope of the directive includes social security. Consideration is being given to any changes in the social welfare code which may be necessary for compliance with the directive, for implementation not later than the deadline of 19 July 2003.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 227 to 229, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two international organisations with multilateral agreements related to social security <Col N="1248" /> matters to which Ireland is affiliated &ndash; the Council of Europe and the International Labour Organisation. In addition to the conventions which Ireland has both signed and ratified, there are also the following: the Council of Europe's European Convention on Social Security was opened for signature on 14 December 1972, and was signed by Ireland on 23 February 1979. To date only eight of the member states of the Council of Europe have ratified the convention, all but one of which are members of the EU. Accordingly, with one exception, the social security entitlements of persons moving between Ireland and those countries are already protected by the EU regulations on social security. Ratification would require legislation to apply the provisions of the convention to migrant workers from non-EU countries. There are no current proposals to ratify this convention, but my Department is continually monitoring the situation.</P>
    <P>A revised European code of social security was opened for signature in Rome on 6 November 1990. Although a number of countries have signed this revised code, it has not yet been ratified by any and therefore has not yet entered into force. Ireland has not signed or ratified this revised code to date. Ratification would commit Ireland to much higher standards of social protection than those currently in force. Ireland has ratified five parts of the 1964 European Code of Social Security relating to sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, old age benefit, family benefit and survivors benefit respectively. My Department is currently examining the position with regard to whether additional parts can now be accepted. There are two relevant international labour conventions which have not been ratified by Ireland &ndash; ILO 128 Invalidity, Old Age and Survivors Benefits which was opened for signature on 29 June 1967, and ILO 130 Medical Care <Col N="1249" /> and Sickness Benefits which was opened for signature on 25 June 1969. Both would require changes to the Irish legislation and there are no current proposals to ratify either convention. I believe there are no proposed international agreements related to social security matters being negotiated or prepared at present.</P>

      <P>While it is known that some seals of the estimated 100,000 grey seals which may live on the offshore Islands of Scotland migrate to Irish waters, there is no scientific data to show how many seals migrate annually to the Inishkea islands. Grey seals spend most of the year dispersed at sea where they are, in effect, uncountable and, historically, little research has been carried out on the population levels of grey seals around the Irish coast. Seal pups tagged at breeding sites in Scotland and other countries are frequently sighted in Irish waters. I understand a report published by an Bord Iascaigh Mhara in July 2001 on grey seal interactions in Irish coastal waters reported that a seal pup tagged on the Inishkea islands as part of the study was spotted in the Outer Hebrides in Scotland some 60 days after tagging and some 360 kilometres from the Inishkea Islands. This indicates that the seal migration dynamics are complex and any population management proposals must reflect this.</P>
      <P>Seals are protected under the Wildlife Act, 1976 as amended. Section 42 of the Act enables me to permit, where serious damage is being done by seals to a fishery, the control of seals in individual cases. I note that of ten permissions issued in 2001 by my Department to control damage by seals, three related to Mayo and the one permission issued to date in 2002 to control seals also related to the Mayo area. While calls are made from time to time by fishing interests to control seal populations, I have no current plans to manage the seal population on the Inishkea islands. Any proposals to actively manage seal populations would have to be addressed in a regional context and with due regard to my statutory responsibilities for the conservation and protection of seals under the Wildlife Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to Priority Questions Nos. 12 and 14 of today. Under the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act, 1999, I have the power to designate a list of events which should, in the public interest, be available on free-to-air television. In drawing up such a list, I am obliged by the Act to consult with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. In addition, I must consult with the organisers of the events and with broadcasters who are under the jurisdiction of the State. This, in turn, must be followed by a wider public consultation process in respect of any event that I intend to designate. It is only then that a draft order designating an event or events can be brought before the Oireachtas for approval. Any list drawn up must be compatible with EU law.</P>
      <P>My Department has engaged in consultation with the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation on the question of drawing up a list of events to be designated and a consultation process with the major sporting organisations in this country has taken place. It is very clear from the consultation process that drawing up a list of events is a very complex matter. Some sporting organisations have argued against designation of the major events they organise on the basis that designation could impact negatively on their finances and, consequently, on the development of the games, particularly at club level. It must be recognised that the television rights to the events are owned by the individual organisations. The possible negative impact of designation on sporting organisations has to be considered and balanced against the public interest of certain events being available on free-to-air television.</P>
      <P>The issues involved, therefore, are complex but are being addressed in an appropriate, consultative and democratic manner. Consultation with the sporting organisations and with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation is ongoing. When these consultations are concluded, I will be in a position to make a decision regarding a list of events. Given the extensive process involved I will not be in a position to make an order under Section 2 of the Act by 1 April 2002. RTE, which includes TG4 as part of its broadcasting family, and TV3 were invited to submit comments or observations as to which events should be designated. I received a reply from RTE recommending an extensive list of events.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999, each planning authority shall for the purpose of protecting structures or parts of structures which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, include in its development plan a record of protected structures within its functional area. The number of structures that are so protected in County Kildare is a matter for the planning authorities there.</P>
      <P>This legislation places a duty of care on the owners of protected structures and also gives planning authorities enhanced powers, not only to deal with development proposals affecting them, but also to safeguard their future. This is the proper framework for the protection of our architectural heritage.</P>
      <P>The protection afforded under the Planning Acts covers both the interior and exterior of the protected structures and in the absence of a declaration from the planning authority, outlining any works which are exempted development, any future building works will require planning permission. Planning applications received by local authorities relating to any protected structure must be forwarded to my Department for observations. I believe that the strength of these provisions is sufficient to safeguard the architectural integrity of the protected structures in County Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The heritage sites in County Kildare in the care of my Department are Castletown House, Celbridge and Maynooth Castle, Maynooth. There <Col N="1253" /> are eight properties in County Kildare which are open to the public under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. The 2001 listing which was compiled jointly by Bord Fáilte and the Revenue Commissioners is as follows: Carnalway Glebe, Kilcullen; Coolcarrigan House, Naas; Furness, Naas; Harristown House, Brannockstown; Leixlip Castle, Leixlip; Lodge Park, Straffan and Lyons' Demesne, Hazelhatch.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 238 to 240, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The principal source of information in relation to the number of archaeological sites registered in County Kildare is the record of monuments and places for County Kildare which lists the number of recorded sites at 1,628. Officials from Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department are currently undertaking an archaeological survey of the county. The fieldwork for this survey is nearing completion. This survey will, when completed, provide more up-to-date data on the quantity and type of sites in the county.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to quantify the numbers of sites where archaeological excavations have taken place since the foundation of the State. The Deputy will be aware that my Department licences archaeological investigations and excavations, primarily in response to development and so far this year my Department has issued 257 excavation licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of the sites under excavation are on land not in the care of the State and therefore, public access to view these sites is not feasible. However, I remind the Deputy that my Department provides visitor services at over 70 heritage sites, many of which deal with archaeological and historical themes and in this context, I will <Col N="1254" /> arrange to have a copy of Heritage Sites 2002 sent to the Deputy for his information.</P>

In 1990 the Heritage Council undertook a survey involving an examination of 1,400 monuments to gauge their present condition. The results were published in 2000 and are available from the Heritage Council.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 242 and 243 together.</P>
      <P>Heritage centres and libraries are not generally considered to have appropriate facilities for the display of original artefacts. However, the National Museum of Ireland has a well established policy of lending artefacts to county and regional museums. To date, ten such museums have been designated with my consent under the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>Applications for loan of material held by the National Museum of Ireland, including material held in storage, are considered having regard to a number of factors. These include the following: the proposed use of the material must be in accordance with the terms of the loan policy of the National Museum of Ireland; the security standards of the borrowing institution must meet the requirements of the National Museum and this will normally involve an inspection of the proposed loan venue by relevant museum staff; appropriate facilities for the control of environmental conditions; specified standards of accessibility; and employment of a curator.</P>
      <P>Artefacts in storage in the National Museum are used extensively for research purposes and particularly in the area of local and regional studies.</P>

      <P>The National Museum of Ireland is a collecting agency and accordingly will always possess significantly more artefacts than are exhibited. However, I am pleased to say that the situation whereby important artefacts at the National Museum of Ireland have been held in storage, rather than displayed, has been greatly alleviated by the opening of the new museum facilities at Turlough Park House, County Mayo and at Collins Barracks, Dublin. It should be noted that the museum also loans artefacts to appropriate museums around the country and abroad.</P>
      <P>The situation will be further improved when the additional facility at Collins Barracks is completed. I have taken a particular interest in the plans for the additional facility and I am pleased that an application for planning permission in respect of this facility was recently submitted to Dublin City Council.   </P>

      <P>The information regarding proposed statutory instruments requested by the Deputy is set out below. A consultation process under the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act, 1999, which will lead to the preparation of a statutory order, is ongoing. This is designed to ensure that events of major importance to society can be seen on free-to-air television. When the outstanding section 36, dealing with the regulation of commercial shoot operators, under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000, has been commenced, the associated statutory instrument will be formulated and implemented. The format of the statutory instrument to be effected under this section is the subject of consultation with the relevant interested parties in accordance with commitments given to this House. A reappraisal of the statutory instruments in the wildlife area is under way following commencement of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000. It is premature at this stage to say what new statutory instruments-regulations will be required as a consequence of that appraisal. Preparation of a statutory instrument to extend the <Col N="1260" /> existing network of special protection areas required under the EU Birds Directive, 79/409/EEC, is under consideration. A statutory instrument to implement Council Directive 2001/38/EC will be prepared shortly. This directive will enhance the provisions of the original directive which deals with the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a member state.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda that local gardaí are aware of the petition in question, to which a number of local residents responded. I am further informed that, in relation to Dargle Road during the period 1 October 2001, to 1 February 2002, two incidents of criminal damage and two incidents of unauthorised taking of motor vehicles were reported. Both motor vehicles were subsequently recovered. I <Col N="1262" /> am advised by the Garda that foot and mobile patrols have always been maintained throughout the area by uniform personnel, detective units and the divisional crime task force. I am assured that local Garda management is satisfied that there is no erosion of the residents' confidence in gardaí and has undertaken to reassure the resident who carried out the survey of the Garda commitment to provide a quality service.</P>
      <P>The Garda will encourage him to support the local neighbourhood watch scheme. This particular neighbourhood watch scheme is recognised at national level as being among the more resourceful and dedicated of its type and has been promoted as an example to be followed by other similar schemes. I am assured that Dargle Road and its environs are to receive particular attention as part of the new Garda public order initiative, known as &ldquo;Operation Encounter&rdquo;. An inspector, who has overall responsibility for community policing in the area, has also been asked to re-examine the policing for the specific areas mentioned.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda that an application for a Garda CCTV system in Portlaoise town has been received by the advisory committee established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate applications for Garda CCTV systems. The application from Portlaoise is currently under consideration, together with applications from other cities and towns throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Garda CCTV systems are currently in operation in the following areas:</P>
      <P>Dublin (North Central) &ndash; O'Connell Street and its surrounding areas;</P>
      <P>Dublin (South Central) &ndash; Grafton Street and its surrounding areas;</P>
      <P>Tralee, County Kerry.</P>
      <P>A Garda CCTV system is currently being installed in Cork City and I understand that most of its cameras are now fully operational.</P>
      <P>I announced late in 2000 that the number of Garda CCTV systems was to be increased. As part of the first tranche of this expansion, CCTV systems are to be installed in Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. It is anticipated that these ten CCTV systems will be installed by the end of 2002. At least six more areas will see installation commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious that some applications for CCTV systems received by the advisory committee relate to relatively small schemes which, while <Col N="1263" /> of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided to areas which are not rated as a high-level Garda priority. To this end, I plan to introduce a grant scheme soon to cater for those communities who would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. While it will be up to the local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes, grant assistance will be provided. To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards will have to be met and the Garda will have to be allowed access to the system as and when required. Local authorities will have an important role to play. The details of this new scheme are currently being finalised and full details of the scheme including relevant conditions and grant levels will be announced soon.</P>

      <P>The Government has included in its legislative programme a proposal to bring forward legislation in the area of civil evidence. Ratification of the Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence and other relevant international instruments will be considered in the context of that legislation. The development of that legislation is subject to the disposal of other priorities.</P>
      <P>Council Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001, on co-operation among the courts of member states in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters, was adopted by the Council of the European Union on 28 May 2001. The instrument aims to improve, simplify and accelerate co-operation among courts in the taking of evidence and is seen as complementing Council Regulation (EC) No. 1348/2000 of 29 May 2000 on the service of judicial and extra-judicial documents in civil and commercial matters. That regulation entered into force on 31 May 2001. The latest regulation applies from 1 January 2004. It applies to Ireland since it is one in relation to which, following the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas, Ireland exercised its right under Article 3 of the Protocol on the Position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the treaty establishing the European Community to opt in to the adoption and application of this instrument.</P>

      <P>The question of ratification by the State of this convention is under consideration. I previously indicated to the House, in the course of debate on the Bill which led to the Children Act, 1997, that the Bill contained certain provisions which would facilitate ratification of the convention. The Act is now operational apart from two important sections. These are sections 26, regarding social reports in the District Court, and 28, providing for the appointment of guardian <i>ad litem</i> for a child and provision for separate representation of a child.</P>
      <P>Those two sections, which have a bearing on accession to the convention, have financial and staffing implications for certain bodies. This issue has been included in the Government's national children's strategy as part of its action plan.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 261 and 262 together.</P>
      <P>As and from 1 March 2002, the Brussels convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters will be superseded by Council Regulation (EC) No. 44/2001, of 22 December 2000, for all member states with the exception of Denmark. The regulation has the same scope as the convention. In so far as family law is concerned, Council Regulation (EC) No. 1347/2000 of 29 May 2000 came into force on 1 March 2001. It deals with jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility for children of both spouses. Discussions are ongoing in relation to a proposal for a Council regulation on the mutual enforcement of judgments on rights of access to children and on a proposal for a Council regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matters of parental responsibility.</P>
      <P>There are no immediate plans to ratify the 1970 Hague Convention.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the equal opportunities child care programme, 2000 to 2006, makes grant assistance available under a range of measures to develop child care services throughout Ireland. Funding for the programme comes from both the European Union and the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>On 20 November 2001, a capital grant application, under the programme, was received in my Department from the individual in question. The application was immediately passed to ADM Limited, which administers the programme on my behalf, to carry out a technical appraisal of the project proposal. I understand that this technical assessment is now taking place and, once complete, this assessment will be referred to programme appraisal committee for a recommendation before I make a decision on the application. Until then, it would be premature of me to comment further on this application.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out as follows: An inspectorate of prisons and places of detention is being established on an administrative basis, pending statutory provision in due course. The necessary implementing legislation to provide for the establishment of an independent Garda inspectorate on a statutory basis is currently being prepared. This legislation has been included in the Government's legislative programme. The Department has responsibility for the establishment of the co-ordinating committee for the European year of people with disabilities. This body will not have a statutory basis. A centre for excellence in universal design will be established under the auspices of the Department. A statutory basis for the establishment is provided for in the Disability Bill, 2001.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that signature by Ireland of an international agreement is a matter for decision by Government. There are other international agreements which have not been signed by Ireland and in respect of which signature has not been proposed or remains under consideration. Many of these agreements are of long-standing and vary in their potential application to and interest for the State. Should the Deputy be concerned to seek the position in relation to any particular international agreement, I shall be glad to furnish him with any available information.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 273 and 276 together.</P>
      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project following an initial submission and approval of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are: preliminary report stage; contract document stage; tender stage and construction stage.</P>
      <P>My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works &ndash; OPW &ndash; evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been received for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>
      <P>In the case of the proposed replacement pool for Tuam, the position is that the final documentation relating to the preliminary report was provided to the Department in December 2001. Assessment of this documentation, in consultation with my Department's technical advisers, is now nearing completion and the local authority will shortly be advised of the outcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that estimating the number of drugs users and, in particular, opiate users is a <Col N="1291" /> difficult exercise. This is due to a number of factors, not least the illegal nature of the activity and the significant numbers of users who are unwilling to come forward for treatment. A number of attempts have, however, been made to estimate the number of opiate users in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In 1996, the first ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs, extrapolating from treatment figures, arrived at an estimate of approximately 8,000 heroin misusers in the greater Dublin area. Dr. Catherine Comiskey's 1996 capture-recapture study, which was based on three data sets &ndash; the methadone treatment list, acute hospital discharges and Garda data &ndash; suggested a rough estimate of the number of opiate users in Dublin in 1996 was 13,460.</P>
      <P>The National Advisory Committee on Drugs recently commissioned a study to estimate the prevalence of opiate drug use in Ireland. The study, which will be based on the three sets of data for 2000, should be completed by August 2002. As part of the study, the researcher will compare the resulting estimate with the findings of the previous capture-recapture study carried out for 1996.  </P>
      <P>In relation to the treatment figures, the number of heroin misusers receiving methadone treatment at the end of December 2001 was 5,865 while the number awaiting treatment is 428. The number receiving treatment in the South-Western Area Health Board, which covers the Tallaght area, was 2,233 at the end of December 2001, while there are 197 people awaiting treatment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 277 and 278 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 27 November 2001, the Government approved the drafting of a National Tourism Development Authority Bill. This Bill, which is with the parliamentary draftsman's office, is to provide a statutory basis for a new authority to <Col N="1292" /> promote the development of sustainable tourist facilities and services, including promotion of training, human resource and marketing skills development in the tourism industry and other functions carried out by Bord Fáilte Éireann and CERT Limited respectively.</P>
    <P>Following a Government decision on 25 January 2000, Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited was established under the Companies Acts to drive the design and development of the campus and stadium project. Responsibility for the project, including responsibility for preparing the legislation, transferred from the Department of the Taoiseach to the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation with effect from January 2001.</P>
    <P>On 27 July 2001, the Government approved the drafting of legislation to establish the development entity for the project on a statutory footing. The legislation is being drafted by the office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel.</P>
    <P>The National Advisory Committee on Drugs was established in July 2000. Its role is to advise the Government on the prevalence, prevention, treatment and consequences of problem drug use in Ireland. It is a non-statutory body under the aegis of the Department and is pursuing a three year work programme of research. Its status will be reviewed at the end of this three year programme.</P>
    <P>The national monitoring committee for the RAPID programme, which is non-statutory, was established pursuant to a Government decision in 2001 to oversee the implementation of the RAPID programme. Meanwhile, independent product management boards are being established to act as the final decision-making authority for grant approvals under the tourism measures of the regional operational programmes for the Border, Midlands and Western and the Southern and Eastern regions as provided for in their respective programme complements. These boards will be non-statutory. There are no proposals to move either the product management boards or the national monitoring committee for RAPID to a statutory basis.</P>

      <P>The anti-doping convention of the <Col N="1294" /> Council of Europe was opened for signature on 16 November 1989 and was signed by Ireland on 25 June 1992. Prior to the ratification of the convention, it is a requirement that a national anti-doping programme be in place. The Irish Sports Council Act, 1999, also included provision for the introduction of Ireland's first national anti-doping programme which has since been launched by the Irish Sports Council based on the principles set out in the convention. Consequently, arrangements are being put in place in co-operation with the Department of Foreign Affairs with a view to early ratification of the convention, a process which does not necessitate legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for <Col N="1295" /> physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists. The report was launched in July 2001 and it concluded that a major expansion in the numbers of therapy professionals was essential over the next 15 years. In relation to training places, the report recommends an annual increase of 75 training places for both speech and language therapy and occupational therapy and an additional 25 training places in physiotherapy. These additional places would result in an annual intake of some 145 students to physiotherapy, 110 to occupational therapy and 100 to speech and language therapy.</P>
      <P>An inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Higher Education Authority. The Higher Education Authority invited institutions to submit proposals for the expansion of existing courses and-or the introduction of new courses, including graduate entry programmes. The proposals received are currently being considered.</P>
      <P>In relation to clinical psychology, I understand a joint review group on psychology services has identified a shortage of professionally qualified clinical psychologists. This review group comprised representatives of the Health Services Employers Agency, health service employers, the Department of Health and Children and IMPACT. I further understand that the Department of Health and Children has made arrangements with the Psychological Society of Ireland to provide 30 additional postgraduate training places in 2001-02. The Higher Education Authority has recently received a request for capital funding from NUI Galway for the development of a postgraduate course in clinical psychology. The authority is currently considering this request in consultation with the Department of Health and Children.  </P>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of these therapy services, including clinical psychology services rests with the various health authorities and my Department does not have details of the numbers projected to require these services in schools over the next five years.</P>
      <P>The National Educational Psychological Service is undertaking a joint survey with the principal psychologists in Northern Ireland of supply and demand for educational psychologists in the island of Ireland. I am awaiting completion of that survey along with its report and recommendations. In the interim my Department and the Higher Education Authority have agreed to a proposal to increase the annual output from the MA in Educational Psychology at University College Dublin, NUI Dublin, from six to ten. The Psychological Society of Ireland also awards a postgraduate Diploma in Educational Psychology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I launched the new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, in January 2001 to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. <Col N="1301" /> The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at-risk pupils are being supported, where necessary, over the three-year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes &ndash; infants through second class &ndash; and a pupil-teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes &ndash; third through sixth classes.</P>
      <P>Schools participating in the programme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. Schools already in receipt of additional resources under the disadvantaged areas scheme, including the school in question, will retain their entitlements under that scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the disadvantaged areas scheme, the school in question is benefiting from the services of a shared disadvantaged concessionary teacher and a shared home-school-community liaison teacher. The school also qualifies for special supplementary capitation funding at the rate of &euro;38.09 per pupil and a refund of the television licence fee.</P>
      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is also included in the urban dimension of the new programme. The school is eligible to receive &euro;3,230 in respect of the current school year towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned. This funding is in addition to the &euro;7,047 that the school received under the disadvantaged areas scheme for the current school year.</P>
      <P>In line with normal staffing arrangements for national schools, teacher post allocations for the purpose of the new programme in respect of the current school year were determined by reference to enrolments in junior and senior classes on 30 September 2000. In order to enable the school in question to adhere to the maximum class size guidelines for all junior and senior classes in selected schools under the urban dimension of the new programme, the school's current compliment of one new programme teaching post, which was allocated for the 2000-01 school year, has been retained for the current school year. For the selected schools to adhere to the maximum class size guidelines under the new programme, it may necessitate the formation of classes from mixed standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school referred to by the Deputy has been reminded that my Department allocates adequate staffing to schools to ensure that the maximum class size guidelines are implemented in both the junior and senior classes. If the school in question <Col N="1302" /> is unable to operate within the maximum class size guidelines, it may make a submission on the matter to my Department.</P>

      <P>There are two EU directives currently awaiting transposition into Irish law through my Department.</P>
      <P>Directive 2000/5/EC amends Annexes C and D to Council Directive 92/51/EEC on a second general system for the recognition of professional education and training to supplement Council Directive 89/48/EEC. This directive, which came into effect in January 2000, will be transposed into Irish law by means of a statutory instrument. The provisions of the directive provide that member states must have adopted the necessary provisions to comply with the directive by 27 February 2001. In this context the procedures for the transposition of the directive into Irish law are under way and it is envisaged that these will be completed in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Directive 1999/42/EC provides for the establishment of a mechanism for the recognition of <Col N="1306" /> qualifications in respect of the professional activities covered by the directives on liberalisation and transitional measures and supplements the general systems for the recognition of qualifications. This directive, which came into effect in January 1999, will also be transposed into Irish law by means of a statutory instrument. The procedures for the transposition of the directive into Irish law are under way and it is envisaged that these will also be completed in the near future.</P>
    <P>In the case of both of these directives, the Commission has issued a letter of formal notice, which is the first action taken when the deadline for implementation has passed.</P>

      <Quest>the Acts or sections or other provisions of Acts under the auspices of his Department or for the commencement of which his Department is responsible which have not commenced by reason of the fact that a commencement order has not been made; if it is intended to make such an order; if so, when; the reason for the failure to make such an order to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The following statutory provisions have yet to be commenced formally: the Teaching Council Act, 2001; the Youth Work Act, 2001; the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, and; the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act, 2001, other than sections 4, 8, 11, 12, 15 and 20.</P>
      <P>The primary reason why these statutory provisions have not been commenced to date is that they provide for very significant structural, staffing and other changes which require detailed planning and consultation with the education partners and others. That planning is now well advanced in the case of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, the Youth Work Act, 2001 and the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act, 2001. I intend to make appropriate commencement orders for these Acts in the near future. Consultation and planning is also proceeding in respect of the setting up of the Teaching Council and I will commence that Act as soon as practicable.</P>

      <P>My Department is engaged in the preparation of a number of statutory instruments arising from recently enacted education legislation. Commencement orders are being drafted for provisions of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, the <Col N="1307" /> Youth Work Act, 2001 and the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act, 2001. Orders are also being prepared for the purpose of establishing the National Special Education Council and the National Adult Literacy Council under section 54 of the Education Act, 1998. In addition an order is being prepared for the transposition of Directive 2000/5/EC into national law under the European Communities Act, 1972, amending Council Directive 92/51/EEC on a second general system for the recognition of education and training to supplement Council 89/48/EEC.</P>
