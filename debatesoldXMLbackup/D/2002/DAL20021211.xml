      <P>The programme for Government includes a section dealing with commitments in respect of the Common Fisheries Policy and the proposal from the Government to ensure greater access to fishing waters, good governance and sustainable development. At the moment catching of four species of fish, monkfish, prawns, megrim and white pollock, is banned in the Irish box to Irish fishermen, on the basis of conservation of stocks. This is made a mockery of by the fact that Spanish trawlers are now entitled to fish in Irish waters because they have a greater quota. Irish fishermen must keep their boats tied up or throw the fish overboard while Spanish fishermen can sell fish caught in Irish waters to the Irish consumer.</P>
      <P>This is not listed on the agenda for the Copenhagen meeting on Friday. I want an assurance from the Taoiseach that he will raise this with the heads of government in Copenhagen, because this is a matter not just of national pride but of the livelihoods of 25,000 families around the coast, many of whom live in areas in which no regional development of any consequence has taken place or ever will because of infrastructural deficits and so on. Will the Taoiseach assure me that he will raise the issue of reform of the CFP with heads of government on Friday so that this matter, which will not come up again for many years, can be dealt with comprehensively on behalf of Irish fishermen, who have 5% of the quota while our country has 11% of the waters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>For the past 32 years Irish fishermen have been seeking implementation of a 32-mile box around the country to restrict foreign access to this zone, on which, as Deputy Kenny says, 80% of our whitefish fleet is dependent. When Spain and Portugal joined the EC 16 years ago, Spain was given access to that zone for 93 vessels at any time from a list of 300 vessels. In 1995 a comprehensive new arrangement was worked out to facilitate full integration of Spain and Portugal into the CFP. It was agreed that this would be debated as part of CFP policy and this <Col N="362" />discussion is ongoing. I assure Deputy Kenny that the discussions of the framework for the debate on the CFP taking place next year are still going on.</P>
      <P>Recently, however, Spain has been seeking equal access to all EU waters and is pressing hard for the removal of the western waters regime, which gave protection to our fishermen. It has support from the Legal Services Commission, which stated that the rule was to end at the end of December. This should not happen, but discussions should take place this year. The issue is a contentious one and potentially very divisive &ndash; it could lead to difficulties in our waters. We have taken it up with Commissioner Fischler. This week's meeting is about enlargement but I will certainly mention it <i>en marge</i> to the relevant people. We dispute the view of the legal services on this: it is seriously flawed and incomplete. A detailed contrary opinion from the office of the Attorney General has been sent to both the Presidency and the Commission. We will continue to fight this serious battle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach comment on the legal advice given to the Government by the Attorney General, which I understand states clearly that access to the Irish box can be restricted for Spanish trawlers? There are 25,000 fishing families around the country, including more than 5,000 in Cork, 3,200 in Kerry, almost 2,000 in Mayo and 4,300 in Donegal. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will need to fight this on a much tougher basis, because the issue will not be revisited for a number of years. The conservation element of the CFP is made a mockery of by the fact that Spanish fishermen with larger quotas can fish in Irish waters. That defeats the purpose of sustainable development and the conservation element of the fisheries policy.</P>
      <P>I am glad to hear that the Taoiseach will raise this on the margins of Friday's summit. He should take a direct interest in this because regional development will never take place to a satisfactory level in these coastal communities. This has been their livelihood for generations. The Taoiseach and his Minister should fight this case much more forcefully than they have done so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1995, when the compromise agreement was worked out and we agreed to facilitate the full integration of Spain and Portugal to the Common Fisheries Policy, the arrangement covered the Irish Box and was known as the western waters regime. It was introduced in 1996 following the end of the transitional arrangements agreed under the act of accession for Spain. This was to be phased and would form part of the Common Fisheries Policy review. We could not argue with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission legal service, however, in response to questions put by Spain, gave the surprising opinion that the western waters regime fell automatically at the end of 2002 so it would <Col N="363" />not form part of the discussions on the Common Fisheries Policy. The legal advice we have states that opinion is seriously flawed. The Attorney General's office prepared a detailed contrary opinion and we have given that to the Danish Presidency and the Commissioner.</P>
    <P>Portugal has submitted legal opinion similar to ours. The Spanish have supported the legal service's opinion because it suits them fine. The Commission does not accept the opinion of the legal service that the regulations fall in their entirety but states that the discriminatory elements, in effect the Irish Box, cease to have legal effect, causing enormous problems for us. It has presented no legal opinion to back this up but we are demanding to see it because it runs out at the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Every week we hear explanations for the cuts in education and new punitive charges being levied by the Minister for Education and Science. We hear excuses from his PR people that they are in the interests of tackling inequity and disadvantage and addressing equality of opportunity. Is the Taoiseach aware of the scandalous situation that obtains at the newly formed National Education Welfare Board that is supposed to deal with absenteeism, not least in areas of disadvantage?</P>
      <P>The Education Welfare Act was passed in 2000 yet not only are the new welfare officers not in place, the 40 who were in place under the 1926 Act have been idle in their offices since 2 June, when the 1926 Act expired. The budget of &euro;13 million needed to put the service in place has been cut to &euro;3.2 million. Almost 3,400 young people drop out of education before junior certificate and the estimated truancy level is 20% or higher in deprived areas. How can the Taoiseach justify his Minister for Education and Science prattling on about equity and equality of opportunity when kids in disadvantaged areas, for whom a school attendance service was supposed to be put in place following the 2000 Act, are still without education welfare officers and the people charged with that responsibility will now be unable to carry out their duties under the 2000 Act with the provision of a mere &euro;3.2 million in the Estimates for next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information that public servants are sitting in their offices doing nothing since the legislation was passed. The legislation was updated because the old legislation was not powerful enough for them to carry out their jobs in disadvantaged areas. I accept what the Deputy says, that these people are important in such areas. When the Act was passed, not only were the old staff retained, but additional staff were recruited. If Deputy Rabbitte says they are sitting in their offices I will have to investigate but the Minister for Education and Science has given priority to the legislation <Col N="364" />and has made it clear that he supports policies for areas of disadvantage and has made resources available to deal with them. I will have to see if these people are doing nothing but I doubt it. I have not heard from schools in my area that people are doing that.</P>
      <P>We have put in place many schemes to help people from disadvantaged communities stay in education. We have extended the home-school community liaison programme, which is designed to deal with those who fall away from school. Large numbers do fall away, they do not even reach junior certificate, but the liaison programme deals with primary and post-primary schools in the designated disadvantaged areas and the scheme is working. The establishment of the National Education Welfare Board is going ahead and the stay in school initiative in primary and post-primary schools receives money from the Estimates. The only point I cannot answer is that about civil servants sitting doing nothing and I will investigate that.</P>

      <P>This is the first time this term that I have seen the Taoiseach caught out without a page from his early morning beavers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is evident that the Taoiseach is winging it. The least important part of my question concerns the 35 welfare officers who, according to a letter I have from a solicitor working in the Children's Court in Smithfield, have been unable to do their jobs since 2 June. The most important part of it concerns the cut in the budget from &euro;13 million to &euro;3.2 million, preventing the establishment of a school attendance service in the parts of the Taoiseach's constituency and parts of my constituency that so badly need it, especially in mine because in County Dublin there is no school attendance service. The issue is the money needed to supply the education welfare officers to invigilate school attendance throughout the country, especially in disadvantaged areas. How can the Minister reconcile that with his supposed concern for equality? Is it not the case that if the penalty point system applied to the bogus promises of this Government, the entire Cabinet, if it chose to attend, would be off the road for longer than Dunphy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The significant point for me was that we had changed the legislation and taken on more staff and the Deputy alleges they are doing nothing. My note tells me that the National Education Welfare Board has been established, is promoting school attendance and is involved in early school leaving initiatives. Either my note is wrong or the Deputy is wrong.</P>

Not only is the board established and in operation, but it brought in a new stay in school initiative. The Youthreach programme has been extended, child care services have been introduced to enable parents to access adult education, the National Learning Council for Parents has been extended and there is a litany of other initiatives in the Estimates for 2003.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that some of the most neglected people in Irish society for decades have been the mentally handicapped and intellectually disabled, and their families? I acknowledge that progress has been made in recent years but the Taoiseach will agree that much has yet to be done. How can the Government justify the budget decision to cut the allocation to health boards for the provision of services for the mentally handicapped from &euro;38 million to &euro;13.3 million for the coming year? Is the Taoiseach aware that the Federation of Voluntary Bodies and the National Association of Mentally Handicapped in Ireland have described this decision as absolutely disastrous? This morning NAMHI advised me that this budget will not allow it to maintain services in the coming year. Progress made in recent years will be reversed.</P>
      <P>The essential developments necessary for the young and the ageing mentally handicapped population will not be seen. There is great concern among parents of ageing, mentally handicapped people about what will happen to their children after the parents die. It is a major problem and this decision will mean longer waiting lists for day care, respite care and long-term residential care. I appeal to the Taoiseach to reverse this cut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="366" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot talk about the figures for each health board but the overall figure with regard to intellectual disabilities has increased from &euro;35 million a few years ago to &euro;160 million. There have been substantial increases in recent years, brought in by the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen. This provided an additional 1,500 day care places and 100 residential places for each year.</P>
      <P>I admit that the figure is not as high now and organisations such as St. Michael's House and others have not been able to expand for 2002 and 2003 from what was a historic high. The organisations have made the point that they need to stay at the high figure if waiting lists are not to get longer. They were allocated an additional &euro;5 million last year through the health boards to deal with that.</P>
      <P>They have also made the point to me, as they have to Deputy Ó Caoláin, that this decision will not allow them to continue. However, from 2001 to 2003, over &euro;100 million in capital revenue was provided to enhance these services and that was in addition to a very high annual budget. The base figure will remain but the additional resources for which these organisations have put forward a case will not be provided.</P>
      <P>This is a priority within the health area. The Deputy is aware of the efforts of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to put capital resources into a number of the mental health institutions. It is an area to which the Minister is sympathetic. The difficulty is that the high figures for 2000 and 2001 cannot be increased at the same level, although that is regrettable. Enormous resources were put in to deal with this and the Government's best efforts will go towards keeping the existing output level and, as soon as possible, returning to the very high allocations given in 2000 and 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that welcome progress has been made in recent years but I also stated that much had yet to be done. We are not looking at an increase here but at a devastating cut from &euro;38 million to &euro;13.3 million. The money going to the health boards is dealing with this issue on the ground on a regional basis.</P>
      <P>I am speaking on this issue from a personal interest, as well as from the wider concern of those who have exactly the concerns I have for my brother who has Down's syndrome, for my mother who cares for him and for the many others deeply distressed by this decision. There are many people with mental handicaps and intellectual disability still trapped within mental institutions in this country. There are elderly parents in the same position, alone and having to look after a mentally handicapped son or daughter. They are on waiting lists for day care and respite care but the critical area is long-term residential care within the community. The Taoiseach's response does not address that concern and I appeal to him to revisit the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="367" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the Deputy's interest and knowledge in this area, and appreciate his acknowledgement of what has happened over recent years. It is an area the Government recognises as a priority and one where, when high resources were available, it was possible to spend additional money to deal with accumulated waiting lists. It was not an area to be proud of some years ago and will not be until there are sufficient residential places.</P>
      <P>St. Michael's House was one organisation which pointed out to me the situation in the greater Dublin and Wicklow area &ndash; it is no different in other areas &ndash; where it had greatly extended services for those with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities. Without additional high levels of funding, waiting lists will build up again and because of the age of the parents involved, a number of people will need residential care. It is the Government's hope to maintain the high level of service and, when possible, to move additional resources into this area. That will not be possible in 2003. However, the figures built up in recent years will be maintained except for the additional resources the Government was able to commit in 2000 and 2001.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>On 21 November, I met Mr. Erdogan, leader of the Turkish AK &ndash; justice and development &ndash; party. Mr. Erdogan was touring European capitals with a view to seeking support for the commencement of accession negotiations by Turkey to join the European Union. He was accompanied by the Turkish Foreign Minister, Mr.Yasar Yakis. I congratulated Mr. Erdogan on the results achieved by his AK party in the Turkish parliamentary elections on 3 November and I wished the new Government every success in office.</P>
      <P>With regard to EU enlargement, I said that Ireland accepted the conclusions of the 1999 Helsinki European Council. That council stated that Turkey is a candidate country destined to join the EU on the basis of the same criteria which applied to all other candidate countries. I assured Mr. Erdogan that Ireland will be as helpful as possible in terms of Turkey's EU candidature. On Cyprus, I welcomed the recent UN proposals and hoped they will be carefully considered by both Cypriot communities and by Greece and Turkey. Ireland has a particular interest in Cyprus as we have contributed from the outset to the UN peacekeeping operations on the island.</P>
      <P>I commented on our bilateral economic relations and noted that trade between Ireland and Turkey has grown significantly over the past decade, increasing almost eightfold in the past 12 years. I also noted that several Turkish companies are successfully operating in Ireland, particularly in the construction sector.</P>

In the course of our discussions, the Prime Minister and I noted that Romania and Ireland enjoy good bilateral relations and both sides agreed to continue to develop these relations as Romania prepares for EU membership. I said that Romania could count on Ireland's support for achieving its objective of EU membership in 2007. Ireland supports this objective in the full knowledge that the Irish people expressed their backing for EU enlargement in the referendum on the Nice treaty.</P>
    <P>Prime Minister Nastase briefed me on Romania's ongoing efforts to meet the criteria for EU membership. He also briefed me on the recent positive developments with regard to human rights issues and particular measures being taken to improve the circumstances of children.</P>
    <P>Later the same day, I met with the President of the European Council, Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark, who was in Dublin as part of his tour of capitals in advance of the European Council meeting in Copenhagen on Thursday and Friday of this week. We discussed the Council's agenda, which will focus on enlargement, and the functioning of the Presidency in that context. It is expected that the necessary decisions will be made to conclude negotiations with the ten accession states with a view to signing the accession treaty in April 2003. From our discussions, it is clear that the Council faces a difficult task. We will, as always, seek to be constructive in our approach. The agreement reached at Brussels on agricultural expenditure is very important to Ireland. Decisions are also expected to be made on advancing the accession process with Bulgaria and Romania while the next stage of Turkey's candidature will also be considered.</P>
    <P>The European Council will also discuss an initial report by the Presidency on reform of the Presidency. The Prime Minister and I discussed this and the broader agenda of the Convention on the Future of Europe. I indicated that reform of the Presidency should build, to the greatest extent possible, on the strengths of the current system. In addition, the President of the Convention on the Future of Europe, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, will update the Council on its work and a meeting will be held with the President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox.</P>

      <P>What is the Government's policy with regard to giving a firm accession date to Turkey? Has there been any approach by the United States of America to encourage support by the Government of Turkish entry to the EU? If so, has there been a response from the Government expressing concern about human rights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met yesterday with the Cypriot ambassador who was very appreciative of Ireland's involvement over many years in peacekeeping in Cyprus, <Col N="370" />particularly by gardaí currently working there with the United Nations. He is very grateful for the diplomatic skills of the Irish personnel involved. Will the Taoiseach raise the ongoing work of the Convention on the Future of Europe at the Copenhagen summit? Given the high profile representation from EU countries whose Foreign Ministers are members of the Convention, will the Taoiseach be embarrassed by the low key involvement of the Government? The Irish position with regard to the convention is still unknown to our representatives. Will the Taoiseach address that matter before travelling to Copenhagen to allow members of the Convention from this Parliament to be aware of Ireland's position? Deputy Gormley visits Brussels regularly on this business and he and his colleagues would like to be able to work together to promote the national interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When he visited, I told Mr. Erodogan that we support the Copenhagen criteria of 1993. That is the same basis everybody else supports. Human rights issues have to be properly addressed and be proven beyond doubt to have been addressed. As the Deputy will appreciate, Mr. Erodogan also fell foul of some of those issues himself. He explained that while he leads the party which won an overall majority in the recent election, he was not allowed to run himself. He is appointed to Government, but he is not a member of Parliament because in the run up to the election he recited during a speech some poetry for which he was jailed. He pointed out that he has more interest than many in resolving human rights problems. I made it clear to him that he must do so and that the criteria described above have to be fulfilled. He emphasised that while his party is Islamic, it wishes to pursue secular politics. He is an impressive person who wants to make progress and deeply wants to join the EU.</P>
      <P>He realises that it will not be possible to do so in 2004 and he wants to make as much progress as possible. He has issued a similar message to other European leaders, all of whom have met him despite the fact that he is not a parliamentarian. He is an unusual position. Even if a date is set, which I expect will happen given the discussions yesterday in the General Affairs Council, it has been made very clear that accession will be on the basis of fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria of 1993. As most people realise, that will not be very easy to accomplish, but there is a new administration in place and it has an opportunity to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will know from his meeting yesterday with the ambassador, a second important issue is how the Turkish Government proceeds in its conversation with Mr. Denktash who is ill at present. That will influence greatly the views of Greek Prime Minister, Costas Simitis, which have much influence in the European Council because of the ongoing Greek and Turkish Cypriot differences. That issue will not be resolved, but major <Col N="371" />progress will have to be indicated in tackling something that has gone on for years. During my time on the European Council the debate has remained the same with no evidence of progress. That apart, we will continue to support the membership of Cyprus and hopefully the matters discussed will be negotiated and resolved in the accession treaty by 16 April.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy and other Members that we are actively involved in the Convention on the Future of Europe at both official and prime ministerial level. I have met a number of Deputies who have been involved and last week discussed these issues with Deputy John Bruton who is on the presidium, the inner council of the Convention. He is extremely helpful to the Government having been elected to that privileged position. It gives us access to someone who is in the inner sanctum. Some of the best officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs are actively involved in the Convention on a day-to-day basis and the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, is fully engaged in several meetings per week. To have the same person at full Convention meetings and at sub-meetings is the best way to proceed.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, to attend all the meetings. Today he is chairing meetings on Northern Ireland and last week he was presiding over the Security Council of the United Nations. It is not practical for him to be at the Convention at the same time. We meet weekly to discuss the Convention and the Irish Presidency of 2004. The Cabinet committee meets fortnightly and there is an in-house meeting on Mondays at the Department of Foreign Affairs where the relevant people discuss these matters in the presence of the Minister. He is very well briefed. As the Deputy has said, the French and German delegations have recently been switched and Foreign Ministers now attend. They were not there previously and I expect they are preparing for a major initiative in January on the 40th anniversary of the Franco-German axis of the European Union. Tactically, they will want both Ministers in attendance on that occasion. I may be wrong, but I expect to see a major statement on that event. It is in our interest to keep our people briefed and we will continue to do that.</P>

      <P>What precisely did the Taoiseach say to the unofficial Turkish leader, Mr. Erdogan about what he, the Taoiseach, would be saying in Copenhagen about Turkey's application for membership of the European Union and in regard to specifics? I denounce the disgusting <Col N="372" />comments by some, such as Mr. Stoiber, the German CDU Leader, who said Turkey should not be admitted because it was, &ldquo;too different to join a Christian club&rdquo;. Did the Taoiseach raise specifics with Mr. Erdogan? Does he believe Turkey should be admitted while, this year still, citizens are being imprisoned for expressing peaceful verbal dissent, when forms of torture are widespread as employed by Turkish police and while elected Kurdish parliamentarians are still serving a 17 year sentence which the European Court of Human Rights said stemmed from a patently unfair trial? What will the Taoiseach say in Copenhagen on this matter? As the Taoiseach did not answer Deputy Sargent's question, I would like to ask it again. What representations have been made by the US Administration to the Irish Government in whatever way to hurry along the acceptance of Turkey into the EU, irrespective of where the issue of human rights stood at present in Turkey?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To make it absolutely clear for Deputy Higgins, I have stated that a date can be referred to following the European Council but that date can only be a date on the basis of the Copenhagen criteria. Ten years ago the Copenhagen criteria spelt out all the rules that any applicant country has to follow. including strict rules on human rights. All the procedures about arrests, laws, signing up to UN matters are all in the Copenhagen criteria. That is the position of practically every country. A few countries might take a more sympathetic view but I do not think any country takes the view that it can join until the Copenhagen criteria are fulfilled.</P>

      <P>I have had no representations from the United States but its position is very clear. The US sees Turkey as an important strategic location and has long made its position clear. I imagine that if the US has not written to the Department of Foreign Affairs I would be surprised if we do not get a fax or e-mail prior to, or at, the European Council reiterating its position. It does this every time. The US would like to see certainty on the Turkish position and that has been its position for the past number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying it is not the case that the Irish Government has shown, what <i>The Irish Times</i> described as contempt for the workings of the convention? Is he saying that the article on 9 December by the European affairs correspondent of <i>The Irish Times,</i> saying that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, was blithely dismissive of the entire affair and arguing it was no more than a loquacious prologue to the real business being done at the Intergovernmental Conference, is not the case? In particular, is he saying it is not true that the Government has never required Deputy Bruton to raise any matter at the presidium and that it <Col N="373" />has never sought a briefing from Deputy Bruton? I gather from the Taoiseach's answer that the last point is not true. However, it is asserted in <i>The Irish Times</i> article that the Government never sought Deputy Bruton's influence in a central presidium of 12 people in a very influential position to put forward the Government's position, that essentially the Government has no position on the convention and is happy to leave it to the traditional method of Heads of Government dealing with these major questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Rabbitte for asking the question because I think all of it is untrue. I lobbied in so far as I was able to do, but I was able to assist Deputy Bruton in getting on to the presidium. He had his own major group behind him which was where he was nominated. We also assisted because it was in our interest. Ray MacSharry was on the convention but not on the presidium. We have worked with Proinsias De Rossa and Deputy Gormley and our members on it, Deputy Carey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and have briefed them. A senior civil servant &ndash; it would be unfair to use the person's name &ndash; keeps in regular touch. We have a tight arrangement on it.</P>
      <P>I accept that from time to time all the papers we would issue from the Department of Foreign Affairs or other sections may not always be agreed. MEPs, officials, outside experts, former politicians, current politicians are represented on it. It is not a question of Deputy Bruton or any other Deputy taking an Irish position, that is not their role, and particularly Deputy Bruton because he is on the presidium. He is most helpful and keeps in contact with me personally. I have had briefing sessions with him and with other Deputies. The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, spends an enormous amount of time on it. Whatever one may say about the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, in the cross-fire of this House on the issue of Europe he is well qualified and has been lecturing on the matter for 25 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept the point. I will explain to the Deputy from where that came. The <Col N="374" />position was put that the convention was to be rushed through, that the Intergovernmental Conference would be irrelevant and that the convention would complete its work and then the Intergovernmental Conference would rubber stamp it and that none of us should raise questions out of the convention to the Intergovernmental Conference. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, in his normal physical self got entirely agitated at that and let fly at the idea. He did it on the basis that clause 8 states that the convention would finish its work and the Intergovernmental Conference would finish in 2004. Another representative stated that it would all be wrapped up during the Italian Presidency and there was no need to worry about the rest of the details. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, gave his views in no uncertain manner. One would expect him to do that in the circumstances but it does not deserve to be said that nobody was doing anything.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that his endorsement of Turkish entry to the European Union was premature given the Commission's recent ruling that Turkey does not meet the human rights' requirements for EU entry under the Copenhagen criteria? I presume the Taoiseach is aware of Turkey's appalling human rights record, of the ongoing torture of prisoners and that 101 people have died on hunger strike during the past year alone. Does the Taoiseach not believe that this record and the Commission's decision underscore the point that the Taoiseach has acted prematurely and hastily in endorsing Turkish entry to the European Union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misrepresenting my position. Turkey has been given a green light for a future date when it will be entitled to join the European Union. It has been told that even if a date is indicated it will not be permitted to join unless it fulfils the Copenhagen criteria. Those criteria include all the human rights complied with by all other members. While 2007 has been indicated Turkey must comply before then. In fairness, Turkey has made substantial moves. Last August the outgoing administration made a number of moves by changing laws and releasing prisoners etc. However, it will be some years before Turkey can join the EU and that will only be when it has complied with the criteria regarding democracy, civil rights and liberties and other initiatives. It faces a mammoth task to do that in the time. The new administration has an overwhelming majority and most of its members have come from a background of being involved in opposition. It is in its interest to show it believes <Col N="375" />in human rights. The new leader himself suffered under a difficult regime in the past. People are prepared to give Turkey the benefit of the doubt but will not let it join the European Union until there is compliance with the Copenhagen criteria.</P>

      <P>Would it not have been better to say to the Turkish Government that in principle we accept its right to join but it should comply with the conditions before an entry date is given? Having given a date we may find that the conditions for entry will not be complied with or that shortcuts will be taken.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach have a personal view, given increasing tensions, on an Islamic country joining a Christian world? Will the accession of Turkey lead on to the greater expansion of the European Union and clear the way for Russia, the majority of whose people live within Europe, to join also?</P>
      <P>The article referred to by Deputy Rabbitte mentions that there is a growing tendency for small member states to band together to protect their interests. Ireland does not appear to have joined with them. The Dutch representative indicated that Ireland was not invited to a recent group meeting to discuss this. Is this true? Why has Ireland not participated?</P>

      <P>Ireland has had great experience as a leading negotiator on a range of European issues yet we have now adopted a head-in-the-sand approach. Why is the Government not proactive in putting forward proposals within the convention that would lead to the new Europe to which people aspire? The convention has a strong moral authority given that all members are represented at it.</P>
      <P>Prime Minister Berlusconi appears to be adamant that the next treaty should be the second treaty of Rome. This would mean that the intergovernmental conference would be expedited and that issues relevant to a treaty bigger than the Treaty of Nice would descend upon us without our being acquainted with their consequences. What is the Taoiseach's view on that?</P>
      <P>In his acceptance speech for his peace prize former American President Jimmy Carter said that an invasion of Iraq could have catastrophic consequences for the world. Will the Taoiseach raise this matter in Copenhagen on Friday? It is a matter of grave concern that, irrespective of the UN assessment of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, it appears an invasion will take place. Will the Taoiseach undertake to raise the matter with the Heads of Government? In the event of the Security Council having to vote again will he see to it that all the relevant documentation is made available to the Government and to our representative on the Security Council? Will he also ensure that the matter is discussed in the Dáil before a further vote is taken?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has long been agreed that Turkey will be allowed to join the European Union when it has fulfilled the criteria. The indication of a date is important for Turkey for domestic issues and to keep the dream alive. Turkey wants to see a blueprint for its future. About 85% of the people have indicated they want to join the European Union. The party which won the recent election and which was only founded about 18 months ago is in favour of joining the Union. It is important that we give an indication that Europe will welcome Turkey. The quickest way to get proper human and civil rights in Turkey is under a European model.</P>
      <P>My view is that the inclusion of an Islamic country is something good. The ruling party is Islamic but it is also secular and wants to move forward. Looking at the issue from a world perspective it is a fact that many people from the Islamic faith and tradition feel alienated. Interaction with an Islamic country with a democratically elected government, although it has major difficulties to sort out, will help matters more than all the suspicions and fears of the past. It is better that people are actively involved in democratic politics than left on the outside feeling strained.</P>
      <P>A lot of the difficulties concerned with Saudi Arabia are because people feel alienated. It does not have a system of democratic government, as we know it, and that creates hate, bitterness and bigotry in some of its citizens. That then feeds to the rest of the world. I have met ambassador Haass on several occasions. When I met him this year I told him that America should use its efforts to build up contacts with the Islamic faith around the world rather than think the problem will go away. That is my personal feeling. We should also do the same.</P>
      <P>With regard to the meetings, it is true we were not invited to one dinner. There are endless breakfasts and dinners going on for which we gain no publicity for our attendance. One could be forgiven for taking the view that the best way to gain publicity on some issues is to be omitted from the invitation list to a dinner. The lack of publicity in relation to many functions one has to attend is sometimes rather irritating. On the serious part of Deputy Kenny's question, we avail of every opportunity to engage with the smaller countries to maintain our position. For the record, we did protest about the dinner to which we were not invited, even if it was a quiet occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have set out our stance in position papers relating to the JLC. The statement last week by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, outlined our position very comprehensively in the Justice and Home Affairs Council. As Deputies will be aware, contacts are not confined to Government level. Deputy John Bruton has also submitted position papers and we make whatever input we can in that regard. The Deputy is correct in his reference to Prime Minister Berlusconi who, for understandable reasons, would like it to be the Treaty of Rome. In relation to my earlier com<Col N="377" />ments to Deputy Rabbitte, that was the origin of the remarks by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, with regard to any move to rush this matter through. The Minister quite rightly reminded people that there is a small matter of rules, regulations, laws and Intergovernmental Conferences which cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is correct in his analysis that such an approach could very quickly result in very major treaty changes being imposed on us. It could also lead to institutional changes in terms of the working of the Presidency, the General Affairs Council and other major Councils, the interaction with the Parliament and the proposal that the charter of fundamental rights should be built into the treaty. Those are truly major issues. Whatever may emerge in the final analysis, it is our view that one cannot simply rush into a convention, rubber-stamp it and then have to explain it to one's people and live with the consequences. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs pointed out, such an approach might be all very fine if one did not have to consult the people of one's country. As we know, it is the view of many member states that they do not have to consult their people on this occasion, as on the last occasion. That obviously gives rise to differences of emphasis as between countries. However, we continue to put forward our view and I fully expect that I will have to do so again next weekend as I have done on many previous occasions. I acknowledge and appreciate that the Deputy has done likewise in his group. That is essential to ensure that our position is understood.</P>
    <P>Valéry Giscard d'Estaing has said recently he wishes to make this treaty so simple that every second level student in Europe will readily understand it. At the end of five and a half hours of reading last Sunday, I appreciated that sentiment and will probably appreciate it even more after a further nine months. However, it should be practised as well as preached. Perhaps I will make that point to Valéry Giscard d'Estaing when he visits this country in the near future. </P>

      <P>As I said earlier, this issue is unlikely to come up in the formal sessions, which are purely concerned with enlargement and there is no &ldquo;any other business&rdquo; session. However, I will certainly raise the matter with my Spanish counterpart and with the Commission. Meetings are scheduled over four days next week in that regard. I have received briefing notes from the fishing sector organisations and I have been in <Col N="378" />consultation with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and his Department officials in formulating our approach. Our legal submission has already been made, with the involvement of the Attorney General. Our legal advice is totally contrary to the EU Legal Services Review. I find it difficult to understand how interpretations of the same document can be so diametrically opposed.</P>
      <P>Our legal opinion has been given to the Danish Presidency this week and I have raised it with Prime Minister Rasmussen. It has also been raised with Commissioner Fischler. Over the weekend I will avail of all opportunities, on the margins of the meeting, to talk to as many as possible. It is a very serious situation and we need to be very clear on what we are seeking. As I said earlier to Deputy Kenny, we know the present position has to end, but we do not accept it has to end on 31 December this year and is not taken into account as part of the Common Fisheries Policy discussions of next year. What the Legal Services have done, in effect, is to remove our big bargaining chip from the equation, on legal grounds, before it goes into the central discussions. That seems entirely unfair and totally inconsistent with anything that has happened previously. At this stage, we have to fight it legally, on the Legal Services document, as well as fighting it politically and I will certainly play my part in that regard.</P>

      <P>I have one further question on the Turkish issue. The Cypriot Ambassador has visited the House on numerous occasions, making the case in relation to the occupation of northern Cyprus by Turkish forces. Would it be helpful if the Taoiseach were to make the point that if Turkey were to withdraw its forces, or to arrive at a conclusion about a withdrawal of forces from northern Cyprus, that would aid and encourage early acceptance and full committal to the conditions of entry to the European Union in respect of Turkey? Is that a proposition which the Taoiseach would support? Does he intend to raise the matter and, perhaps, follow it through?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not resolve the matter because the Copenhagen criteria would still have to be fulfilled. However, it would certainly create a sea change in the minds of the European Council towards a new leader, if not prime minister, in terms of serious intent on the part of his administration. He got the message very clearly from every country that his credibility as a person wishing to make progress would be greatly enhanced by a move in that regard. The intention was that progress would be made prior to this weekend. However, allowance has to be made for the fact that Mr. Ecevit is ill in the United States and negotiations cannot take place. A major move in that area would be seen in a very positive light. It would not change the situation with regard to the Copenhagen criteria but it would certainly help the case.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said he expected the US Administration might send an e-mail or a fax indicating support for Turkish entry to the European Union. Is he aware of the very heavy pressure by Turkey on the US to twist arms in the European Union to secure Turkish accession on the basis that otherwise the Turkish people will not be willing to co-operate in a war on Iraq? What will be the Taoiseach's response to the US in that regard, given that Shannon Airport is, apparently, now part of that war? Will the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his officials meet those going to Brussels on Ireland's behalf in relation to the work on the Convention on the Future of Europe, so that, together, they might hear from the Government as to what its position is and how they might best work co-operatively together in Ireland's interest? In that regard, what is the Government's policy&mdash;</P>

Will he also advise the House of his views on the UN plan to re-unite the Greek and Turkish administered areas of Cyprus under a rotating presidency?

      <P>I am concerned about the representations the Taoiseach proposes to make for Irish fishermen in Copenhagen. He seems to suggest the only issue he will raise is the legal and political situation regarding the Irish Box, yet that is only one of a number of key issues regarding the Irish fishing industry. Will the Taoiseach also emphasise and prioritise the issue of overall quota allocation in the EU as we have less than 5% of the quotas despite having 11% of European waters? That is the key issue the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, needs help on.</P>

      <P>The US authorities' position on Turkey is clear. They may have already been in contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs as they normally send a message before these meetings outlining their efforts regarding Turkey, and I am sure they will do so again. The European Council wants to give a date to Turkey but it wants the human rights issues dealt with in accordance with the Copenhagen criteria which are clearly set down.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ó Caoláin asked about the hunger strike and human rights. I gave a full account of a briefing note I received from the Department of Foreign Affairs on human rights issues &ndash; it is a long list. As a new leader, he is well aware of the list and, as he said, is himself a victim of some of the issues on the list.</P>
      <P>The Government totally supports Kofi Annan's UN plan. It is a good plan which should win great support &ndash; the EU supports it generally. The UN Secretary General and his officials have put a great deal of work into dealing with the division of Cyprus and the Turkish and Greek Cypriot positions. There is growing support around the plan and I will continue to press for it and support it in my discussions this weekend.</P>
      <P>I have received only an informal briefing on the fisheries issue as the fisheries Council meeting is next week. I accept there are other points but I emphasised this one because I want to raise it with the Spanish authorities as they raised legal issues with the European Council's legal secretariat, causing the difficulty. The difficulty is created by taking the 50 mile zone out of the Common Fisheries Policy. I accept there is a range of issues including the 80% reduction in quotas and what it would do to Ireland, but I highlighted this issue specifically because of the impending closing date of 31 December 2002 &ndash; just a few weeks away. I will take the opportunity on the fringes of the meeting to talk to whomever I can about those issues.</P>

I looked back to find a large number of Bills which have been dragged out. A great deal of time is being spent on them with many speakers so we are not getting the legis<Col N="383" />lation through. Next week's schedule is packed with legislation but, if time can be found, we can do what he suggests. However, I do not think we can. Bills are now before the House for many hours and to make progress on them, we must move them on through the Stages. The more time I concede for debates on this, that or the other, the less time we have to process legislation. That is creating a problem.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Rabbitte has highlighted, No. 5 on today's Order of Business, is not only concerned with the contraction of Second and Subsequent Stages into one day. We are also looking at a proposition in relation to the Appropriation Bill that will have the Bill taken with one question being put to the House, and without debate. If it was the case that Second and Subsequent Stages were being debated, with or without a time limit, there would be some credibility in the proposal. What we are looking at, however, is a proposition that will not allow any debate, and so the matter will be decided by a solitary question. That is infinitely more objectionable than the point highlighted earlier. It is an unacceptable situation and I have to oppose it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night the Minister said the Government was most anxious to protect the weak and vulnerable in society. CORI's overall conclusion on reviewing the Government's six budgets was that the Government had failed to address poverty and social exclusion. There is no doubt about how CORI feels about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the subject of young widows and widowers, <Col N="391" />I welcome the &euro;11 increase for widows and widowers over the age of 66. However, the increase for a widow I know with four children, three of whom attend secondary school and one of whom attends primary school, is only &euro;6. They live in rural Ireland. She will have to find the increased college registration fees for next year for at least one of the children. She will have to find the increased cost of running a car in terms of tax and insurance. Her late husband drove a diesel car, which also now adds to the cost. An increase of &euro;6 for a young widow or widower is unrealistic. I realise that any proposal of mine or of my colleague, Deputy Ring, to increase the cost to the nation, will not be welcome, but I urge the Minister to see whether, over the next 24 hours, she could rejig the figures to find money for this sector. The person I know is in no position to go back to work. I highlight her situation as an example. Another constituent, a young man whose wife died at 32 years of age leaving young children, is equally seriously hit. If he wants to be involved in the workplace, he must pay to ensure that his children are properly looked after.</P>
    <P>The idea that somebody is entitled to &euro;11 if he or she is over 66 years of age and to &euro;6 if he or she is under 66 needs to be examined. It is argued that single parents, for many reasons, because the family is divided or they were never married and so on, have similar problems. However, where the husband or wife in a reasonably well-off family dies, this is the sort of payment on which the family must rely. Payments for dependant children are not increased either. That is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>As I listened with interest to a number of Government Deputies highlighting the fact that someone fortunate enough to get into a nursing home will now be able to have his or her own telephone I thought of the people who are on waiting lists for nursing home subventions or who have been denied the subvention on some technicality. I would welcome the provision of extra comforts for residents of nursing homes if the major issue of the availability of subventions had been dealt with first. The provision of nursing home subventions is the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children but the Minister for Social and Family Affairs shares Cabinet responsibility and I hope she will examine this very serious matter. Aged and disabled people cannot get access to subventions.</P>
    <P>I had a sad telephone call to my office this morning. A man who had been desperately hoping a subvention could be provided for his wife, who had suffered a stroke and has been in hospital for the past five weeks, rang to say there was no further need for me to seek the subvention because his wife died this morning. This sad story will provide some relief for the health board. This man had been told it would be impossible or very difficult for him to get help to look after his loved one.</P>
    <P>The issue of carers must be examined although there have been improvements in recent years. <Col N="392" />Of the 100,000 or more carers only 23,000 are getting any help. I know of cases, as I am sure the Minister does, of people who have been looking after an aged in-law and who lose the carer's allowance when their spouse dies because they cannot receive carer's allowance as well as the widow's or widower's pension. Some leeway should be given so that a person in receipt of another social welfare payment could receive at least half of the carer's allowance. If such a person got a job he or she would be entitled to retain the widow's or widower's pension but because he or she must stay at home to care for an elderly person that is not possible. I hope the Minister remains in office in order to examine this question.</P>
    <P>I return to the issue raised by my colleague last night. How can media publicity and consultants' reports be justified when people are expected to be satisfied with an extra &euro;6 per week? I understand almost &euro;20 million was paid out last year for consultants and reports. We must add to that the publicity, which gives the Department a good profile but at a cost to the nation. Full page advertisements in national newspapers look well and get the Department necessary media goodwill but there must be cheaper way of getting a message across.</P>
    <P>The back to work and rent allowances have been capped. When will these spending cuts end? No increase has been granted in the fuel allowance and 190,000 people on short-term social welfare will not get a Christmas bonus. In the last six budgets a single person on social welfare has benefited to the tune of &euro;39 per week while a person earning &euro;50,000 is better off to the tune of &euro;261 per week. Is this an indication of a fair and just society?</P>
    <P>I welcome the &euro;10 increase for old age pensioners and any benefit which improves their lives but I condemn the overall thrust of this Bill and of the budget. Those who are worst off will be overcome by inflation and by numerous hidden cuts. Within weeks they will realise that they will be much worse off before the end of this year.</P>

I have no doubt but that she will continue this programme of investment and reform in the next four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Crawford referred to publications and to the Department's advertising of various schemes. All public representatives receive glossy literature from agencies funded by taxpayers. The Minister has increased the funding for the money advice and budgetary service and for some other agencies which come within the remit of her Department. Of all the agencies established in recent years I compliment MABS on its work with people who have a problem with handling <Col N="393" />money and who are often unable to make local authority and other payments. I have doubts about the usefulness of much State money which is allocated to the many organisations which have sprung up in recent years. The newspapers on Fridays and Sundays are full of advertisements for jobs with agencies which are of questionable benefit to the country. Each Department should review the value given to taxpayers by the money given to a plethora of organisations whose duties and briefs overlap and who often do not give value for money. However, from speaking to officials at local level I know MABS does an excellent job. I am glad the Minister has provided additional funding and that the service's programme of work for the next three to five years is secure.</P>
    <P>I also compliment the Minister on the extra funding being provided for the community development programme. From working with groups in my own constituency I know that small State assistance is being put to excellent use by people working on a voluntary basis in the least advantaged areas.</P>
    <P>We can all join Deputy Crawford in sympathising with the widow with four children, one of whom hopes to go to third level next year. We appreciate the struggle that woman has to survive and the difficulties widows with children face in trying to make ends meet. If that young person succeeds in getting a third level place next year he or she will not face college registration fees. If the household income is as low as Deputy Crawford says the student will be entitled to a maintenance grant and the registration fee will not be applicable.</P>
    <P>When we talk about making education more accessible to people from less advantaged homes we should not forget the extension of maintenance grants to the post-leaving certificate sector in the past number of years. A greater number of students going to colleges of further education are from less well off homes than is the case in traditional third level institutions. The extension of maintenance grants to this sector has enabled many students from less well off homes to avail of further education and to complete certificate, diploma and degree courses at third level.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the substantial increase she has obtained for her Department in the coming year. The budget improvement means an additional &euro;530 million for her Department. This continues the work of her Cabinet colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern, as Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. I am particularly glad that the emphasis on improving pensioners' incomes is being continued. The Minister has made a clear commitment that the old age pension will rise to &euro;200 per week within the lifetime of this Government and all of us want to see such an achievement. This House should fully recognise that the pensioners of today built this country during very difficult times and suffered a great deal of hardship and drudgery in their lives. Our generation has not had to make the sacrifices that <Col N="394" />the previous generation made as they attempted to provide a decent standard of living for their families. I am pleased by the increase of &euro;10 in the old age pension in this Bill and I am satisfied that the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, is committed to the achievement of the &euro;200 target I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crawford referred to a statement by the Conference of Religious of Ireland, but I do not think the pensioners of Ireland need to read any such documentation to help them to analyse the improvements in the social welfare system in recent years. They are probably more appreciative than any other sector of the developments since 1997. The improvements, that have not come about before time, are welcome and are enjoyed by pensioners. The contributory pension was just over £70 in 1997, but it had increased to £116 by the start of this year.</P>
    <P>Very important improvements have also been made to the free schemes, which in many instances were not available to pensioners because of the composition of their households. The previous Minister in this Department, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and his officials brought about worthwhile and important improvements which have meant an additional income in households. I welcome such initiatives.</P>
    <P>There has been enormous and welcome progress in relation to the child benefit scheme. Increased payments have been appreciated by the parents of Ireland as they have helped to ease financial burdens in many cases. Many children living in less well-off families have a better standard of living as a result of the improvements in this regard.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I would like to congratulate Deputy Coughlan on her appointment as Minister for Social and Family Affairs. I know she has been in the job for some months, but this is the first opportunity I have had to congratulate her in the House while she is dealing with a Bill. Her appointment was welcomed by all parties and I wish her a long and successful term in office.</P>
      <P>People often tend to discuss social welfare matters in monetary terms alone, but I do not believe they can be addressed purely in such terms. When we raise the topics of poverty and social exclusion, we should be talking about the starving thousands in Ethiopia, as I did when the Taoiseach was in the House earlier. People in countries like Ethiopia have to live in hope as they do not know from where their next meal will come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is to be any justice in the world, we have to reconsider how we treat those living in such distress and hunger, so close to the rest of the civilised world. This is especially true when one considers the amount of money that is spent on arms internationally. I hope we will see <Col N="395" />a united international effort to deal with these problems.</P>
      <P>I do not deny that there is poverty in Ireland, as I deal with it and meet those who suffer from it on a daily basis. When the Government was elected in 1997, it acknowledged the existence of poverty and social exclusion in Ireland and put in place a number of measures to deal with such problems. Countries can be judged by how they treat the less fortunate in society. Bad luck can be the cause of the problems of many people on social welfare. Some people are permanently dependent on welfare payments and others receive such assistance on a temporary basis. It is important that payments given to social welfare recipients not only allow them to survive, but help them to live with dignity. I do not like to generalise or to paint everybody with the same brush, but it is true that social welfare recipients often feel excluded or marginalised. It may seem to them that the community does not value them in the same way that it values those in full-time employment. The same phenomenon sometimes applies to women who work in the home. These issues need to be addressed.</P>
      <P>For many years, the attraction of remaining unemployed was greater than the attraction of work, as there was no incentive to work. It is important that there is a balance between the moneys taken home by those who are employed and those who are not. If the country is to remain vibrant, it is essential that work is rewarded well. Some of the measures taken by the Government in recent years have helped to ensure that the incentive to work remains.</P>
      <P>I read an article recently that criticised Ireland for having low taxes. The writer asked how our economic and social infrastructure can be expected to catch up with the rest of Europe if we continue to sustain a low tax economy. I regard such thoughts as left-wing nonsense. If we examine some of the effective measures taken by the Government that may have seemed to benefit the well-heeled in society, we will see that they benefited us all. The Minister for Finance received a great deal of criticism when he reduced capital gains tax from 40% to 20%, but his critics were dealing with the perception rather than the facts. Capital gains tax yielded &euro;59 million to the Exchequer in 1994 and &euro;57 million in 1995. In 2001, however, the yield was &euro;876 million, which was more than in 1997, 1998 and 1999 combined.</P>

      <P>If the Deputies opposite speak to parents, they will hear that the significant increases in child benefit have been welcomed.</P>
      <P>We should ignore the idea that profit is a dirty word. Profit should be encouraged, as if businesses are not making money, the Exchequer will not receive enough taxes. I support those who run their businesses well and make profits. If we did not have entrepreneurs who are prepared to take risks by putting their money on the line in establishing businesses, we would not have profit or employment. It is important that we create an environment in which people are prepared to take risks, as we will all benefit as a result.</P>
      <P>The Government's low tax policy has succeeded in eliminating many black economy activities. It was always very difficult to estimate what the black economy was worth. Many people are happier in a country where there is low tax and a perception that it is paid by everyone. People understand and appreciate that tax must be paid and the vast majority accept the regime which exists and welcome low tax rates. It is important, as an island nation, to remain competitive. If there is not a low tax rate thousand of jobs will be lost. Anyone who looks at the US will see that the famous company Levi Strauss, which is very much associated with the USA, is closing factories and moving to China. The workers in Levi Strauss were on an average of $14 per hour whereas the labour costs in China are closer to 25 cents per hour.</P>
      <P>I welcome what the Government has done. The low tax has yielded more and allowed huge resources to be poured into the infrastructure, roads, schools and, in particular, social welfare with huge increases in old age pensions and child benefit. We all realise the serious shortage of child care facilities and the increase in child benefit gave parents a little more freedom of choice and flexibility.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Government's decision to make sure all weekly increases take effect from January 2003. For far too long, under all Governments, people having a pint or a few smokes paid increased taxes the day after the budget but, in most cases, had to wait a number of months to enjoy the increases in their social welfare payments. I hope the Government's decision that the increase will take effect from January will be followed by all Governments in all future budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="397" />There is no justification in paying all parents child benefit. I know this matter has already been discussed. We talk about cherishing all of our children equally but the job of Government is to spread the resources equally throughout the country in order to ensure the less well off are well looked after. It is madness that one family with a person on an income of &euro;100,000 and two children and another family struggling on an income of &euro;20,000, also with two children, receive the same amount of money. Previous Ministers have said that it would be difficult to implement and, in reality, people are afraid of the reaction of the electorate to such a move. However, it is a move which must be taken. When resources are scarce it is important that they are used properly and the money is directed where it is most needed, and I encourage the Minister to do that.</P>
    <P>I have another question about child benefit, which I raised last year and did not receive a satisfactory answer. This year the increase in child benefit is &euro;8 for each of the first two children and &euro;10 for the third and subsequent child. I cannot understand why the third and fourth children &ndash; I am lucky to have four children &ndash; should be more valuable than the first two. For most parents the most expensive child is the first one, who needs buggies, prams and clothes. In my family the clothes and shoes were passed on to the younger children as the older ones grew. Would the Minister explain the thinking behind this? </P>
    <P>Pensioners were singled out over the last five years. The Government made a commitment to pay them £100 per week. I am glad because Governments are often criticised, as are politicians, for not honouring their promises. That was one promise we honoured.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Crawford about widows and widowers. Most pensioners very much appreciated their increases. I was talking to a couple of pensioners at the weekend who told me they were living very comfortably and had a lovely income which was more that adequate to meet their needs. Most pensioners find they are in a situation where their children are reared, the mortgage is paid and their expenses are less than those of younger people. There is greater pressure on younger widows and widowers than on other people. I encourage the Minister to look at this and see how greater assistance could be given.</P>

      <P>I am sharing time with Deputy O'Dowd. It is difficult for Government backbenchers, and there were two very competent backbenchers in the previous slot, to justify the budget. That is their duty and they had the opportunity of doing it. It must be hard on <Col N="398" />them because it is difficult to justify the budget from the point of view of social welfare, which is the only aspect we are discussing. Deputy Michael Smith rightly praised the work of the money advice and budgeting service. Deputy Smith knows their services will be greatly used in the coming year as a result of the effects of the budget. Not alone will recipients of social welfare have to use MABS but they will also have to, as many of them do, look for support from their mams and dads to survive as a result of the provisions in the budget.</P>
      <P>I regret that Deputy Sean Power, for whom I have respect, has left the Chamber. I was very surprised that he said people on social welfare should be quite pleased and happy when they compare themselves to people in Ethiopia. That was an uncalled for statement. He need not worry about whether or not I have clinics. I do not go to pubs but I give a service to my constituency. I do not go around the pubs, meeting the same three people every month. That is a ridiculous way for a public representative to represent his constituents. I am available to meet them in my office by appointment and by telephone. That is why I will mention many of the things which my constituents have mentioned. I did not survive 15 or 16 years here without giving a service in my constituency, and nobody will. There are different ways of giving a service.</P>
      <P>To deal with the budget, it marks the moment of truth for the Government. It has drastically failed to address the substantial poverty and social exclusion which still exists. It has widened the gap between the rich and poor, something which can be proved. We now have the worst gap between rich and poor of any EU state. The budget has failed to attack in any meaningful way the defects in infrastructure and social provisions which see Ireland far below EU levels. It has failed significantly to increase the total tax take to a level closer to the EU level than previously. For example, as a result of the budget, an unemployed couple with one child will be 25 cent per week better off in real terms than they were in 2002. The poverty gap has widened considerably. The gap between a single, unemployed person and a person on &euro;50,000 per year has widened by &euro;25 per week. The number of people living in relative income poverty will continue to rise as a result of this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much loss of essential services in local communities as a result of the cutback in community employment schemes. Those schemes helped people on the margins and did wonderful work in the communities. Community services will be greatly affected as a result of this loss. The budget expects poor people to bear the burden of the Government's mismanagement. It is all the Government can come up with after five years of unprecedented economic boom. The reason Deputy Dermot Ahern asked to be relieved of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is obvious &ndash; he knew what was coming down the tracks. I welcome the appointment <Col N="399" />of Deputy Coughlan and wish her every success, but she has been left holding the baby.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind that six out of every ten people living in relative income poverty live in a household headed by a person who is not on the labour force, the Government's increases in social welfare are unjust. In case Deputy Power has any doubt about this, I will illustrate with an example. A person came into my office on Monday, which is when I do most of my constituency work, and asked me what this budget would do for her. I did some research and was astonished at how little the budget would do for her. She is a lone parent with one child, who cannot work because she cannot afford child care. She had been receiving &euro;118.80 plus &euro;19.30 child allowance and &euro;27.03 child benefit, a total of &euro;165.13. Because of the budget measures she will be getting &euro;124.80, &euro;19.30 and &euro;28.89, which adds up to &euro;172.82. It appears that she and her child will be &euro;7.84 better off per week, but that rise is completely negated by inflation. The cost of fuel allowance must also be added. This woman is in a local authority house: as a result of this meagre increase, her rent will now go up. Any increase is wiped out before it is even noticed. I had to tell her, and others who came into my office, that they would be no better off as a result of this budget.</P>
      <P>The capping of the back to work allowance was only announced yesterday. Before this, a person who had been on social welfare for 15 months could qualify for a back to work scheme, which would enable them to retain 75% of their allowance the first year, 50% the second year and 25% the third year, plus their benefits. This was a great incentive for people on social welfare to get back into the workforce. When a person is unemployed or on social welfare for five years it is far more difficult to get back into the workforce than it is after 15 months. In the case of people on disability allowance, the period is three years. I may be wrong because I only read the press release. Even so, it is often the case that people on disability benefit are helped in their rehabilitation by getting back into the workforce. Now they are being denied that opportunity because of the provision announced yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of my colleagues referred to the fact that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs spent &euro;19.5 million over the last two years on consultants and PR, which is a scandal. I raised the anomaly of the carer's allowance with the former Minister at every budget and now I raise it with the Minister for the first time. I hope she will take heed. A person in my constituency was receiving a carer's allowance for looking after a doubly incontinent, bed-ridden relative of her husband in her own home. Suddenly, her husband was killed by a tractor crossing the road. She then <Col N="400" />qualified for the widow's pension, but despite the fact that she continues to be a full-time carer she lost the carer's allowance. I will not ask the Minister to do anything else for me during the term of this Government if she eliminates the anomaly whereby a person loses his or her carer's allowance if he or she becomes a widow while continuing to be a carer. The only reason this person receives the widow's pension is to compensate her for the unfortunate loss of her husband. That woman must now employ help to run her small farm because of her full-time caring duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">

      <P>The country has come a long way since the days of the Famine, the poor law guardian system and so on. One of the Deputies made a comparison earlier with Ethiopia, which is a very poor place with a poor local economy and in every sense a Third World country, and which needs as much international support as can possibly be given.</P>
      <P>Children do go to school in this country who are not fully fed and clothed, who have no family support systems and whose families are in despair. These people look to the social welfare system to give them support. This system, at a time of increasing economic difficulty, is not giving the support they need. This Government's policy is a failure. The meagre rises, welcome as they are, will be eaten up by inflation by the time of the next budget. The poor are the victims of this Government's lack of concern for the underprivileged in our society. On a personal level I welcome the Minister and wish her well, but the attitude of this Government is unacceptable in every respect.</P>
      <P>The Deputy from Kildare spoke of child benefit being taxed. This is one of the benefits which apply directly and immediately to every mother in our society regardless of family income and this should be protected at all costs. There is never a case for the taxation of income which goes directly to the mother of a family. It is a sad reflection of our society that in many cases the breadwinner is male and that historically, women have been treated very badly. In cases of alcoholism and drug addiction, if the child benefit was taxed, the mother, who provides above and beyond what she is able to and lives on the edges of society, would suffer. The taxing of benefit, which would affect mothers who live on the edges of society, must be condemned outright. It is unacceptable that any Fianna Fáil Deputy would support or propose the taxation of child benefit. We must look after the badly-off. I have never seen an analysis that states that a family or society would be better off if child benefit were taxed. All politicians know that mothers really care and give most to their children, particularly when times are tough at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs is first class in its interaction with public representatives. I acknowledge the expert training and skill of those who staff the hotlines we ring. If the same training was available in local auth<Col N="401" />orities and health boards, there would be significant improvement in community services. I cannot praise the response they offer highly enough. I am unaware, however, if there are 1890 numbers for the Department. I have not seen any in the telephone directories I have used. If there are such numbers, they should be widely circulated because people would call a low tariff number. We should make it known that there is a number to ring to ask questions of trained, professional staff. Those staff go beyond the call of duty to see if there is any way they can help the caller or if he or she is entitled to any other benefit.</P>
    <P>There have been cutbacks in allowances for travel for social welfare officers. In County Louth people have applied for benefits only to be told no officer can come from the nearest administrative town to visit them in their homes and they must travel to the office. To assess someone properly the assessment should take place in his or her home. Cutbacks in travel allowances for social welfare officers should be reversed. To ask someone applying for invalidity benefit to travel from a rural area where transport is irregular is unacceptable. The Minister must ensure this practice is discontinued. The Department has a good name and this is part of the service it must give to the community. It should not be cut back.</P>
    <P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service, the St. Vincent de Paul and other community groups work extremely well together in Drogheda and I welcome the significant work they do. There should be statutory recognition of the MABS and its interaction with those who get into rent arrears. I have dealt with people who have rent arrears of &euro;500 or so and, in many cases, they are too deeply in debt to feel they can cope with the issue. Someone with rent arrears to a local authority should be automatically referred to MABS. It is absolutely unacceptable that the local authority sends out eviction notices to people who cannot deal with their finances when MABS is capable of assisting. When this assistance is brought to the attention of the local authority, the results are very positive. People who fall into rent arrears often have other debts and it is an indication that a family might have serious income difficulties and may need someone to intervene on their behalf.</P>
    <P>Interaction between the St. Vincent de Paul, the Department and social welfare officers is excellent. In Drogheda there is welcome recognition of the statutory and voluntary agencies. They work well together. With inflation and unemployment increasing and significant social problems emerging, we need more dynamic interaction between the Department and the community. That requires money and this budget fails in that respect.</P>

      <P>The reality is that successive Fianna Fáil led Governments have introduced innovative and radical changes in the welfare system.</P>
      <P>The improvements in social welfare in this year's budget will cost &euro;530 million. In stark comparison, the rainbow Government provided &euro;272 million in its last budget in 1997. Social welfare expenditure next year will be double the level set by Fine Gael and the Labour Party when last in Government. As a result of the changes in last week's budget, social welfare increases will be paid on 1 January, five months ahead of the payment date when Fine Gael, the Labour Party and DL left office.</P>
      <P>Does the figure £1.78 ring a bell? That is how much the DL Minister for Social Welfare in the rainbow Government, Proinsias De Rossa, or Frank Ross as he is also known, gave to pensioners, just as the Irish economy was ready to boom. The Opposition claims it is responsible for economic success but it could only give a miserly £1.78 to old age pensioners. It was a shameful pittance. All of our budgets have been characterised by measures designed to improve the position of older people's pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1997 we promised to increase old age pensions to at least &euro;127 per week during the term <Col N="403" />of the last Government and we delivered on this commitment. At the last election we promised to increase the State pension to &euro;200 per week while in Government and we will deliver on that commitment. This budget puts us in a position to deliver, providing a &euro;10 increase in the full rate of old age and related pensions. Frank Ross gave old age pensioners an average increase over three years of &euro;2.95.</P>

      <P>In contrast, the average increase to pensioners under Fianna Fáil stands at &euro;9.71. The effect of the increases under Fianna Fáil is that the rate of the old age contributory pension is now &euro;157.30 per week. That is an enormous increase on the &euro;99 per week which was payable on the day Fine Gael and Labour left office. The old age contributory pension this year has been increased by 6.8%, well ahead of inflation unlike the rainbow Government increases which were below the rate of inflation.</P>
      <P>I have met several hundred old age pensioners over the past two weeks due to the round of Christmas parties. I am sure all public representatives are receiving invitations to senior citizen parties. Not one pensioner I met had anything bad to say about this Government with regard to the social welfare increases he or she received over the past five years.</P>

      <P>In the 2001 budget, the Government announced its intention to invest an extraordinary &euro;1.27 billion in increased child benefit over a number of budgets. Two-thirds of that increase was achieved in the last two years. This year, an additional &euro;105 million was announced in a full year to increase child benefit further. Child benefit rates will increase by &euro;8 per month for first and second children and by &euro;10 per month for third and subsequent children. When Fianna Fáil returned to Government in June 1997, child benefit was payable at &euro;38.09 per month for first and second children and &euro;49.52 per month for third and subsequent children. It will now be payable at a staggering &euro;105.60 for first and second children and &euro;157.30 for third and subsequent children. That is an achievement this Government targeted five years ago and is continuing to deliver on.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the widow's pension has increased by &euro;11 because, as Members will agree, widows have been neglected for many decades. Many widows have had to raise families on smaller weekly incomes than pensioners had. I realise that there could be a legal problem with regard to widows' pensions and the position of a widower compared to a single person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted &ndash; I am sure Deputy Ryan will agree &ndash; that this pension has increased significantly because it is an area that has been neglected for a long time. I urge the Minister to continue to support widows and widowers in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Before the budget, I received a phone call from an active carer who was concerned that carers would not get a significant increase in the budget. I received another phone call from the same person shortly after the budget to say that something had been done, that the carer's allowance had been increased by &euro;10 per week plus the grant, and that the carer appreciated the Government's recognition of the work of carers. Many people have chosen to care for their wives, husbands and partners because of illness, a need for full-time care and a desire not to put loved ones into full-time hospital care or a nursing home.</P>
      <P>The work of carers must continue to be recognised. Some have given up their life's work to care for their partners because they would not allow somebody in an institution to do that. We must continue to expand, develop and increase the resources available to carers. In the long run, this will mean that the Exchequer will not need to put billions of euro into the health care system to care for people who need 24 hour care. A great debt of gratitude is due to the many thousands who care for people in the family home. That is recognised this year but I would like to see the measures go further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that under the Social Welfare Bill, 2002, new powers will be given to the <Col N="405" />Department in its fight against social welfare fraud. Under the Bill, social welfare inspectors accompanied by gardaí will be able to stop vehicles suspected of being used for work while persons are claiming social welfare. I raised this matter some years ago when Deputy Dermot Ahern was the relevant Minister and I disagreed with him on the mechanism he was using. I am on record in this House as being against it but, because of a number of instances that have been brought to my attention since that period, I now see the validity and benefit of this method of trying to stamp out social welfare fraud. Those committing fraud deprive others of the benefit of the services they so richly deserve.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains items which have far-reaching consequences for public access to civil records of births, deaths and marriages. I am delighted that parts of the Bill include measures to bring about the modernisation and computerisation of the civil registration system, which has remained largely unchanged since the mid-19th century. My constituents in Cork must now go to Grattan Street &ndash; it is a nice new building and I thank the former Minister for putting it in place. I hope the new Minister will do great things also. People attending Grattan Street must take a ticket and queue for several hours to get a birth, marriage or any other certificate. It is good that they will now be able to access this service over the Internet.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Dowd with regard to the work of the Department of Social and Family Affairs and all involved in this area. In the five years I have been in this House, I have yet to find an official who was discourteous or unhelpful, or one who gave a short answer when a proper explanation was required. It must be very trying for officials to deal with the volume of work they have on a daily basis. I commend the former Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for putting in place a system where public representatives were able to get quick access to officials by having the contact details of Deputies. This practice will be continued by the Minister, Deputy Coughlan. I ask her to further improve the services delivered by her Department and the speed of their delivery for the people we are all charged to serve.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister well in the task ahead. In the context of this Bill, I will hold my judgment until next year with regard to her performance and how prepared she is to take on the Minister for Finance and the real Government. I agree with the Minister that her greatest achievement this year was that, through her efforts and by banging her hands on the Cabinet table, she was able to prevent means testing or the taxation of child benefit. That is the extent of the real impact on this budget, but we will wait until next year before going further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget is a disaster as far as social welfare recipients are concerned. In many ways it has rolled back much of the progress made in recent years in dealing with the major problem of pov<Col N="406" />erty. Taxation and the social welfare policies in our budgets are the mechanisms the Government has available to it to deal with that poverty. If we accept the logic that the budget should be judged according to its impact in addressing this problem, this Bill which gives effect to its provisions should be assessed by the same criteria. After five of the most prosperous years in the history of the State, more than 6% of the population, or 200,000 people, still live in poverty. They live on incomes which are below 60% of the average and experience constant deprivation. Deprivation in this case means lacking a full warm meal every day and not having a coat to wear to protect against the elements. When I see the people who come to the Dáil getting out of their cars, leaving the train or getting off their bicycles, I often tell myself that we are not living in the real world. Yesterday people were saying how cold it was though they were wearing top coats. Yet, 200,000 of our people do not have a meal or a coat to wear.</P>
    <P>The recent ESRI study shows that the number of people subsisting below relative income thresholds has increased compared with 1997, the year to which the Minister for Finance has consistently referred indicating that he is to be judged on the basis of his performance since then. These startling facts show, notwithstanding some improvements, that for a substantial minority things have not got better. The increasing income gap is some achievement, resulting from five years of mismanagement and implementation of ideological policies by the Government. As I listened to the Minister's Budget Statement I asked myself if this would be a good budget for people in need. The Minister stated that his main objective was to protect the weaker sections of our society. That is a joke.</P>
    <P>What would we do without the voluntary and statutory groups and bodies who deal with the disadvantaged sectors of our society? The CORI justice commission has utterly slated the budget describing it as unfair, unjust and unacceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It says that, once again, this Government has insulted our poorest people. The commission further states that the budget has dramatically failed to address the substantial poverty and social exclusion that still exists. It has increased the gap between rich and poor, a gap that is the worst in the EU despite the fact that this is one of its richest countries. We must question the direction and policies of this Government over the past five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its response to the budget, Threshold stated that people experiencing housing disadvantage will be hit hard by the implications of this Social Welfare Bill and the budget. People in receipt of SWA rent supplement will have to increase their contributions from &euro;7.60 to &euro;12.40 per week. The miserly increase for the majority of this category of &euro;6 per week does not take into account cost of <Col N="407" />living increases. People involved in local authorities know that those who are lucky enough to have local authority housing will not be able to meet the rent increases that are on the way with that extra money.</P>
    <P>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul works daily with people who live in poverty. Its members are aware of the reality for the hundreds of thousands who would not be able to exist without their support. The society described choices to the Government, but they have been ignored. The social welfare package contained in this Bill is an utter disgrace. It is easy for a Minister or a backbencher to say there is to be an increase of &euro;6, &euro;7 or &euro;11, but when those increases are examined in the context of the cost of living another story is told. An unemployed couple with one child is to receive an increase of &euro;11.84 per week, as described by Government backbenchers, but inflation erodes the sum by &euro;11.59. That family will see an actual increase of 25 cent per week. The lowest level of unemployment assistance is to increase by &euro;6 per week which will be eroded by inflation and also become a real increase of 25 cent. Are we living in the real world?</P>
    <P>Choices are made and it is no surprise that more than 1 million people are paying into SSIAs. They are getting returns of 25%, which one would be mad not to avail of if one could afford to. The return from financial institutions is 0.7%. It was ludicrous to introduce such a scheme when there were choices to be made that could have dealt with poverty. When there was an opportunity to deal with the poverty problem the Government was not prepared to look at the choices and improve the quality of life. The Government has failed and will be shown to have failed, and miserably so in the case of taxation and welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleague. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul entitled its pre-budget submission, &ldquo;Right Choices&rdquo;. The three Ministers who sat smugly in this House on budget day &ndash; the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy &ndash; made the choices. They decided that the poorest in society would bear a significant part of their spending spree before the general election and would bear the brunt of what the budget set out to do. Like my colleague I have respect for the new Minister. She has been in office for nearly six months, yet in the pre-budget submissions she clearly lost the battle across a whole range of issues. Anyone who has followed the Department of Social and Family Affairs will be aware there is a much progressive thinking in the Department but it appears many of the issues which our colleagues in that Department were <Col N="408" />trying to bring forward were buried by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance. One of the most regrettable features of the budget is that a series of cutbacks affecting social welfare were not revealed on budget day. Yesterday we tried to come to terms with them.</P>
      <P>For many years the voluntary and community bodies, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, CORI and the Combat Poverty Agency, demanded that we set up a minimum acceptable income standard for all in society. In the recent report on this matter there is a target of &euro;150 per week equivalent by 2007. It was obvious that to attain that basic target it would have been necessary for the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, to have introduced a minimum increase in unemployment assistance and the other basic benefits of at least &euro;14 per week. We had hoped to get &euro;14 per week but at worst &euro;11 per week, instead of which we got an insulting, miserly and disgraceful &euro;8. It is clear the Government has abandoned all pretence of creating a minimum income standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years the Labour Party has called for a proper poverty proofing exercise in the budget. However, in the Budget Statement there is a ridiculous Annex B, a couple of pages entitled &ldquo;Examination of budget 2003 &ndash; Income tax measures using the National Anti-Poverty Strategy guidelines&rdquo;, which is pure fantasy. It is in a question and answer format, drawn up by some civil servant in the Department of Finance. To the question &ldquo;Does the budget help to prevent people falling into poverty?&rdquo; the report answers &ldquo;No&rdquo;. In  fact the budget exacerbated people falling into poverty. Neither did the budget reduce the level and depth of poverty, or ameliorate poverty. To every question posed, a nice handy answer is given. In reply to the question, &ldquo;Does it increase poverty?&rdquo; we are given the answer &ldquo;The income tax changes do not increase poverty.&rdquo; It is a ridiculous exercise, with ridiculous questions to which are given ridiculous answers. It is a farce to try to pretend the budget was poverty proofed. Had it been poverty proofed the Minister would not have dared to bring this disgraceful and miserable Social Welfare Bill into the House. The core reason this is a ludicrous exercise is that the tables which examine the impact of the budget are all done in percentages. The miserable &euro;6 is placed against &euro;118 and we are told that the huge tranche of welfare recipients who have to live on a miserable &euro;124 per week got a massive increase of &euro;6 and that a person on &euro;50,000, &euro;80,000 or &euro;100,000 received a great deal less in percentage terms through the miserable tax changes. The reality is that the income gap between those on &euro;60,000 or &euro;80,000 per annum and those on &euro;124 per week will increase after Christmas. That is a hallmark of this Government which has created the most divided society since we got our independence in 1922. This was rightly stated by Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, a distinguished former Minister and backbencher. This is the most right-<Col N="409" />wing Government in the history of the State, as characterised by the budget and this miserable Social Welfare Bill.</P>

In preparation last year for the euro being launched <i>The Irish Times</i> checked on prices for a month before Christmas. All the multiples and the grocery and service areas did not increase prices for a month. Following the launch of the euro in January, <i>The Irish Times</i> announced there had been no price increases. As soon as <i>The Irish Times</i> went back to D'Olier Street on the south<Col N="410" />side prices lashed up again and, once again, social welfare recipients received practically no increase for 2002. We are now facing ESB and gas price increases as well as an increase in the RTE licence fee. This budget is useless as is this miserable Bill. Why do we bother to discuss it? It is a miserable, disgraceful insult to 1.5 million of our fellow citizens and the Government should be thoroughly ashamed of itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Four animals born in 1997 have been confirmed as BSE positive. An animal born in 1999 has also been confirmed with the disease. This animal was discovered when the herd cohorts of a 1993 born infected animal were depopulated and tested.</P>
      <P>The confirmation of BSE in the 1999 born animal prior to the onset of clinical signs is a positive indication that our comprehensive active surveillance programme is effective in identifying such animals. This programme, together with ante and post mortem tests and the removal of SRM provides assurance to consumers that all potential sources of infectivity will be identified and removed prior to entry to the human food chain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general trend of the disease is encouraging in that the age profile of animals confirmed with the disease is increasing. In 2002 less than 2%, <Col N="411" />five cases, of cases have been identified in animals less than six years old at the time of diagnosis, compared to 16% in 2001 and 40% in 2000. In addition, in the period August to November 2002, inclusive, the number of BSE cases identified, at 102, is down by more than one third on the corresponding period of 2001 when it was 157. Therefore, while isolated cases in animals born after 1996 are disappointing, the important factor is the overall trend.</P>
    <P>This trend illustrates the effect the controls introduced in 1996 and 1997 are having on the rate of infectivity. The increasing age profile of animals in which the disease is confirmed is a positive indication that these additional controls are having the desired effect and that the incidence of BSE will decline further as older animals leave the system.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that when we get information about a BSE infected animal the consumer response can be an over reaction to the difficulty. The industry and the Department have made great efforts over recent years to solve the problem. However, does the Minister agree that the four animals found to have BSE, which I assume include the bull born in 1999, are a matter for concern? We may say this is an indication that the measures we have in place are fine but it is worrying that some can get through the net.</P>
      <P>The Department's documentation states that we have almost foolproof mechanisms in place. Have we established how these four animals, particularly the 1999 animal, became infected? What additional measures, if any, have we put in place to plug the loophole whereby these animals became infected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Scientific bodies world-wide suggest that the source of infectivity is the recycling of meat and bonemeal. That practice was stopped for ruminants early in the 1990s and in 2000 for all farmed animals. There was considerable improvement in the processing of meat and bonemeal in 1996 and 1997. The time and temperature combination used was improved and the system was upgraded. A lot of effort went into removing cross contamination where there might have been a potential source of infectivity, for example, where poultry or pigs were fed on a farm or, in the case of provender mills, where feed was processed for ruminants and non-ruminants. Additionally, on farms where meat and bonemeal may have been fed legitimately to non-ruminants up to the year 2000, there could have been some material caked on to the sides of bins and silos.</P>

    <P>It is difficult to get precise reasons for the disease. There is a major learning curve world-wide on the source of infectivity and how it is trans<Col N="412" />mitted. In Ireland we implement and introduce every new scientific and technological development. For example, the new testing system has only been available in the last two years. We introduced it immediately it was validated in Europe.</P>
    <P>I assure consumers that a comprehensive range of measures remain in place for the control and eradication of BSE. If adjustments are deemed necessary in light of developments they will be made. The current controls include, not alone the testing and control systems and the elimination of meat and bonemeal but the removal of the specified risk material. That ensures that only muscle meat gets into the human food chain. There is compulsory notification of the disease, ante and post mortem inspections at all meat plants and whole herd depopulation.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to me that only the infected animals should be taken out when one or two in a herd go down but we implement whole herd depopulation. There is tracing and culling of birth cohorts and progeny of BSE infected animals. There is also a comprehensive active surveillance programme among all animals over 30 months of age, all casualty animals over 24 months of age and all fallen animals over 24 months of age. With that catalogue of controls there can be total assurance for consumers.</P>

      <Quest>if the departmental investigation into the discovery of BSE in a young bull on a County Limerick farm recently has been completed; if the cause of the infection has been established; if he has satisfied himself with the controls in place to prevent BSE from entering the human food chain; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25961/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is continuing its investigations following confirmation of BSE in an animal born in 1999. This animal was discovered when the herd cohorts of a 1993-born infected animal were slaughtered and tested for the disease. In this, as in all other BSE cases, my Department is conducting an in-depth analysis of all possible sources of infectivity. It has not, to date, drawn any final conclusions on the source of the infection of this animal. In so far as the controls are concerned, they are the most stringent being applied anywhere. They consist of the removal of SRM from the human food and animal feed chains; ante and post mortem inspections at all meat plants; whole herd depopulation; tracing and culling of birth cohorts and progeny of BSE-infected animals; a ban on feeding meat and bonemeal to all farmed animals intended for human consumption and compulsory notification of the disease.</P>
      <P>Up to a few years ago, as those familiar with farming practices will be aware, casualty or fallen animals were sometimes buried on farms or even, in some situations, left unburied but in most cases they were disposed of to local knackeries or other outlets such as foxhound packs. All of that practice has now ceased and there is a comprehensive collection system in operation. Even though such fallen animals are clearly not destined for the human food chain, they are all tested as part of a comprehensive, active surveillance programme among all cattle over 30 months of age, all casualty cattle over 24 months of age in meat plants and all fallen cattle over 24 months of age in knackeries. Since 1 January, 2001, more than 1.3 million cattle have been tested, of which more than 600,000 were aged between 30 and 48 months. With all of those tests, only one animal, a 45 months old bull in County Limerick, was found to be positive.</P>
      <P>Against that background, the fact that the age profile of animals in which the disease is confirmed is increasing is a reflection of the success of the additional controls introduced as technology evolves. As a result, the incidence of BSE will decline further as older animals leave the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister confident about the controls which are in place? Clearly, in this case, something went wrong and there was some slippage through the net. It may well be attributable to a residue of meat and bonemeal on the farm concerned. If that is the case, it is important that <Col N="414" />it is traced and identified. If that is not the case, it raises many other questions on the possible options as to how this situation may have occurred. The Minister will be aware of various research programmes in relation to BSE and that there are some outcomes, admittedly at a preliminary stage, that might give rise to further concerns. Accordingly, we need an absolute outcome urgently, in terms of establishing the precise cause in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree that people need assurance that the controls in relation to BSE are comprehensive, that the measures in place prevent contaminated food from getting into the human food chain and that there is no food safety risk with regard to beef for human consumption. Epidemiological testing is continuing in the County Limerick case. It requires in-depth examination and a special surveillance unit of my Department has spent the past few weeks in the Limerick area, examining all relevant documentation, farm management practices and the feeding regime etc. I expect an outcome to those investigations very shortly. That is essential, having regard to the importance of our food industry for consumers in Ireland and worldwide.</P>
      <P>No food product other than beef has such a comprehensive set of controls ensuring its safety, including the testing which picked up the animal involved in this case, the removal of specified risk material and the other measures to which I have referred. The beef which consumers buy at their local butcher or supermarket outlet is, typically, from animals in the age range of 24 to 30 months, as distinct from animals of 45-months-old and upwards as in the Limerick case. I guarantee that the beef which people consume is safe to eat. I doubt if any other food is monitored to the same extent as beef or is subject to such a wide range of controls to guard against even the most minute risk of contaminated material getting through the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the reply to the previous question, which referred to four other animals born after 1996 which were also found to have BSE. Was there a thorough investigation of those cases also and was the cause of infection established? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. There is no possibility of meat from animals born in 1997 going into the consumer market, which is typically supplied by animals in the range of 24 to 30 months at slaughter. Up to the year 2000, it was permitted to feed meat and bonemeal to non-ruminants and there was at least a risk, both in feed mills and on farms, that cross-contamination could occur. In those cases, the most likely source of infectivity was such cross-contamination. That the animals referred to were picked up by the testing system is a positive sign. On that basis, we can assure the public that, out of 1.3 million tests, only one animal was found to be positive.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the situation regarding the special beef premium.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25965/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Special beef premium is payable on all male cattle over the age of seven months. It is payable twice in the lifetime of steers and once in the lifetime of bulls. The rates of payment in 2002 are &euro;150 for first and second steer premium and &euro;210 for bull premium. An extensification premium top-up payment of up to a further &euro;80 followed by an &euro;80 per head slaughter premium is payable at time of slaughter or export, bringing total potential payments over the lifetime of a steer to &euro;540. This is equivalent to &euro;1.93 per kilo on an average beef animal at slaughter. Each farmer may apply up to an individual limit of 180 animals per first and second age categories, making a total of 360 animals per producer.</P>
      <P>The national quota for special beef premium is 1,028,153 animals and, in accordance with the relevant EU regulations, is based on the number of eligible animals for the first age and bull premium schemes. On the basis of the level of applications received up to the end of November and on a high level of applications continuing during December, it is likely that Ireland will exceed its national quota for 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his very comprehensive answer. Does he agree that the penalties imposed as a result of exceeding the quota will aggravate the income crisis in farming this year? Does he agree that the sudden and unexpected announcement regarding penalties will cause a severe impact and will, in all probability, distort the calculations on which farmers have been relying? What steps can the Minister take to soften the effects of the penalties? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, it is not a matter of what steps I take but, rather, what action individual farmers take. Applications are still coming in and each addition will make our national quota more likely to be exceeded. If individual farmers could defer their applications until next year, that would help us to remain within the national quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been known by everybody concerned for some time. If the national quota is exceeded, the number of first age category and bull premium animals on which premium is payable will be reduced to the national quota. In the event of a quota overrun, applicants who applied on 50 animals or less will be exempt from any reduction. The number of eligible animals on which premium will be paid to applicants, who applied on more than 50 animals in both categories combined, will be reduced by a rate determined to bring the number of eligible animals down to the level of the national quota. This rate of reduction will be applied to the first age, <Col N="416" />second age, bull and extensification premium payments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Later today, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food will be dealing with the motion requesting Oireachtas approval for draft regulations under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Acts, 1979 to 1996, the purpose of which is to fix the rates of diseases levies from 1 January 2003 at one cent per gallon of milk delivered for processing and at &euro;5.08 per animal slaughtered or exported live. This is in line with the recently published Estimates provision for my Department indicating a doubling of the bovine diseases levies from 2003.</P>
      <P>These levies have to be viewed in the context of a total provision in the 2003 Estimates for animal disease including BSE etc., of &euro;216 million, of which &euro;67 million relates to TB and brucellosis. The increases have also to be viewed against the background of the current overall budgetary situation, the Exchequer costs of the schemes and the fact that a major part of the expenditure relates to compensation, where the cost of reactors has increased under the on-farm valuation system. The higher rates of levies will bring in a total of approximately &euro;20 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>Revised arrangements for the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes were introduced with effect from April 1996 following agreement with the farming bodies. Under these arrangements, responsibility for arranging and paying for the first clear herd test each year was devolved to farmers. In recognition of this, the disease levies payable were reduced from £7.30 to £2.50 per animal and from 1.3p to 0.5p per gallon of milk. It was agreed that the levies would contribute some £10 million a year or 50% of compensation costs over the 1996 to 1999 period. For a variety of reasons, the levies contribution fell short of the 50% target. Compensation payments totalled some £120 million over the four years while levy receipts reached only £45 million for the same period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. Does he realise farm incomes are down by at least 8.5% this year and that it is particularly harsh to introduce this levy given those circumstances? The Department of Agriculture and Food will collect only &euro;10 million but the levy will have a significant impact on the farming community which is already suffering a drop in income. At individual farm level, a farmer with 40 dairy cows will have to pay &euro;230 more and there are many other farmers in financial difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="417" />Does the Minister intend to impose the levy on people in financial difficulty? In no other sector would extra levies be charged when incomes were falling. Will the Minister waive the levy for those people this year given the circumstances and that the amount of money collected proportionate to the Department's budget is small and will not have a great impact but will have a desperate impact on those affected by the levy?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Disease levies have to be viewed against the overall expenditure on disease eradication. The overall figure is &euro;216 million, of which &euro;67 million goes towards TB and brucellosis and I believe a contribution from farmers themselves is reasonable. Given the tight budgetary situation, I have no option but to implement an increase in levies amounting to &euro;10 million.</P>
      <P>This is a difficult year for many reasons including markets and the weather but I did not hear anyone here or elsewhere say anything about last year or the year before when there was an increase in farm incomes. The Teagasc survey, for example, which goes through the accounts of over 100,000 farmers, pointed out that last year &ndash; which saw foot and mouth disease affect many sectors of society &ndash; farm incomes increased by 27% and by 12% the year before giving a total of 39%. They are back 8% this year but farming, in my experience, has always been cyclical and one has to take a number of years at a time.</P>
      <P>I am not callous about this. I have the greatest sympathy for the farming community in this particular year. However, with some of these diseases, for example brucellosis, much is down to farm management and care and attention to a disease that is highly contagious. Farmers, as well as everybody else, need to work together to eradicate these diseases. They are costly and a major contribution is made by the rest of society in trying to eliminate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not challenge the Minister's figures from previous years because I have my own argument in that regard which is that people are leaving the land and earning income from non-farm sources. The Minister rightly pointed out that brucellosis and other diseases require better farm management but, when he is forcing a levy from people who can already ill afford it, surely he is restricting their ability to manage their farms well. Can the people, identified by Teagasc as having financial difficulties, be exempted from the levy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention to implement the levy across the board. If I was a young farmer, I would not be encouraged to go into farming from listening to some farm spokespersons. They constantly talk down their own industry and have said in recent months that farm incomes would be down at least 20% and seem disappointed they are only down 8%. They said the figure needs to be scaled up to 15% to take account of inflation. I have not heard any other profession talking down <Col N="418" />their profession and their industry. I spoke to the farmers about farm assist yet not all the money set aside for small farmers was drawn down. I cannot understand that.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for spending cuts in his Departmental budget for 2003, particularly in education, research and advisory services, development aid and on-farm investment; if he will seek the reversal of these cutbacks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall Estimates for 2003 were framed against a background of changing economic and budgetary circumstances and prudent management dictates that we will have to manage our activities carefully within available resources. Specifically, the 2003 gross provision for the Department of Agriculture and Food is &euro;1.218 billion which, after projected receipts, gives a corresponding estimated net expenditure allocation of &euro;842.2 million. While the 2003 gross provision for my Department of &euro;1.218 billion is lower than the latest projected outturn for this year, it is nevertheless, a very considerable sum of money.</P>
      <P>However, in addition to the Estimates provisions, my Department is also responsible for the payment of further substantial sums of EU funds on various agricultural measures, including direct payments to farmers. These large sums, which do not appear in the Department's Vote, amount to &euro;1.6 billion. Therefore, the total combined expenditure by my Department next year comprising Exchequer and EU funding is projected to be approximately &euro;2.8 billion. This is a very high level of public expenditure and underlines the continuing strong commitment of the Government to the Irish agri-food sector.</P>
      <P>The change in the Department's gross Estimate in 2003 over 2002 reflects the fact that some expenditures in 2002, such as agri-monetary compensation, foot and mouth disease costs and retrospective compensatory allowances in mountain areas, will not recur in 2003 and that the relatively positive outlook for animal disease should also lead to expenditure reductions. Similarly, the lower 2003 appropriations-in-aid figures also reflect that some items in the 2002 appropriation figures were non-recurring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While funding for Teagasc, Bord Bia and Bord Glas has been reduced, the 2003 allocations, nonetheless, represent increases of 30% and 50% since 1997 in the case of Teagasc and Bord Bia. The 2003 allocation for Teagasc will involve the rescheduling of its capital programme over a <Col N="419" />longer period, but I am satisfied that the funding provided will enable it to continue to provide an excellent service to the agri-food and rural sectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister about the budget in which little comfort was to be found for the farming community. The overall budget dropped by 9%, as the Minister knows. I am particularly concerned about areas such as research and development, and farm investment. If we drop our input into research and advisory services, there will be less commitment to farming. Why should young farmers remain in the sector if there is not a good on-farm investment scheme? As the Minister has said, we have heard enough negative comments from the farming bodies, so there will be many reasons to pull out of farming. Does the Minister have a view on the need to sustain a budgetary commitment to farm education, research and training?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately the same amount of money has been earmarked for agriculture in the budget for 2003 as in 2002, which is &euro;2.8 billion. Some &euro;1.6 billion of that came from Europe and some more in appropriations-in-aid, but the net voted expenditure was &euro;842 million. I would like to have obtained more and so would my colleagues, but we have had to cut back. The Teagasc budget has been cut back but mainly in the area of capital expenditure. That is a pity in many ways but Teagasc will have to reschedule its business. I was glad to have obtained additional money, especially for the upgrading of agricultural colleges over the last few years. That was a good investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned with the level of safety on our farms. Over the past ten years the number of people killed on farms remains unacceptably high. Last year, for example, 24 people, including seven children, died in accidents in this sector. Some of the accidents were horrific because modern machinery is so powerful. These frightening statistics speak for themselves and behind these figures lie terrible human tragedy and unimaginable suffering, which is harrowing. It is imperative for all farmers to acknowledge that farming is a hazardous occupation and one that &ndash; given the powerful tractors and other machinery currently in use &ndash; carries specific risks to themselves, their workers and their families. All necessary steps to minimise these risks must be taken.</P>
      <P>My Department has been involved in a number of initiatives with a view to reducing the risk to farmers, farm workers and their families. For example, in January this year I accepted the invitation of the Health and Safety Authority to be associated with the launch of their &ldquo;Guidelines on the Preparation of a Safety Statement for the Farm&rdquo;. The guidelines give detailed advice on how to carry out a risk assessment and prepare a safety statement. The Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 requires farmers to prepare a safety statement and to provide appropriate safeguards on an ongoing basis to prevent accidents and ill health on farms. The guidelines and many other farm safety information leaflets are available from the Health and Safety Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that less than 10% of farmers actually have a safety statement or even know they should have one? I appreciate that responsibility for the implementation of these guidelines rests with the Health and Safety Authority, but the Department of Agriculture and Food should also ensure every facility is in place, via Teagasc, for farmers to obtain the safety statement. Apart from accidents involving machinery, there are also risks associated with the use of farm chemicals. It might be of interest to the Minister to know that, according to a recent report, 85% of the farming community in County Cork drinks unpasteurised milk. I am not sure whether this could technically be classified under the heading of farming accidents, but it is clearly a hazard which should be emphasised. Perhaps the Minister would like to comment on that.</P>

It would be helpful and prudent to ensure that as many unsafe organisms as possible are destroyed in food before people eat it.</P>
      <P>As regards farm safety, on 8 April this year I welcomed the launch by the Health and Safety Authority of its farm safety action week.

Therefore, I will examine what Deputy Timmins has said to see if I can do something about encouraging people to be more careful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Diseases of Animals (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) (Specified Risk Material) Order of 21 February 1997, it is a requirement that SRM, consisting of certain offal including the skull, spinal cord, eyes and other specified material of cattle and sheep over 12 months of age, be separately collected, transported, processed and disposed of outside of the feed chain. In practice this material is separated from other animal offal at slaughter plants and butchers premises, dyed and sent to three dedicated rendering plants under the veterinary supervision of my Department for rendering into meat and bonemeal (MBM) and tallow. The MBM derived from the SRM is dispatched to the Continent for disposal by incineration. The tallow is generally burned as an alternative fuel at the rendering plants. The cost of collecting, processing and disposing of risk material derived from animal offal is a commercial matter and is borne by the meat industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All animals collected under the fallen animals collection scheme and animals from BSE depopulated herds are also treated as risk material and processed at the three dedicated SRM rendering <Col N="423" />plants. The rendered material derived from these animals is also dispatched to the Continent for incineration. The costs of rendering and destruction abroad of this material is borne by my Department.</P>
    <P>In 2000, &euro;1.5 million was paid for the disposal of meat and bonemeal accruing from the processing of fallen animal material in the period end 1998 to October 2000 and &euro;0.7 million for material derived from herds with a BSE positive animal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is significant controversy in Tipperary in relation to the building of an incinerator. It is an emotive issue in Tipperary. The horse racing industry is in jeopardy because of the proposal to build an incinerator. There is an alternative method of disposal known as alkaline hydrolysis which is on show in the veterinary college. Will the Minister try to establish whether this alternative method of disposal would be feasible in an Irish context? There is not enough effort to move it forward. It is a real alternative. I would like the Department to be more positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in what Deputy Hayes has put forward. I am aware of the demonstration in UCD and two senior experts from the Department of Agriculture and Food are there today looking at it. Over the past year they have met various companies which are promoting alkaline hydrolysis as an alternative way of disposing of risk material. My information is that this system works, but only for one or two animals and not the bulk of animals we have nationally. That in itself is an advance. The system has been forwarded to the European scientific steering committee for validation and approval. It has not yet approved of the system for member states. When it is, and when a credible alternative is put to me, I will be very positive and pleased. I have said many times in the past that we cannot have an industry without also having a waste disposal system. In 2001, the Department paid &euro;10 million for rendering and &euro;16.8 million for export for disposal by incineration. That is because the increase in the numbers of fallen animals is becoming a significant problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has partially answered my concerns. The costs he has mentioned are &euro;26 million. In addition, storing meat and bonemeal is not sustainable. Ultimately the cost will be borne by the producer. It is a matter of urgency to find a solution to this problem. In seeking a solution people should not play on the emotions and fears of the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Department commissioned any studies on the comparative value and risks of incineration and alkaline hydrolysis? I accept &ndash; and it is good to be able to agree with the Minister in relation to alkaline hydrolysis &ndash; that we are very much at the early stages in that tech<Col N="424" />nology. Perhaps the Minister would comment on the comparative studies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have put a huge amount of effort, time and personnel into comparing the different systems. Alkaline hydrolysis is at a very early stage and we must have it validated and approved before we can do anything with it. The fact remains that we have hundreds and thousands of tonnes of meat and bonemeal in storage. We are trying to get rid of it and more is coming on stream. We also have infected carcases in storage. If we have an industry, we must have a system of disposal. It is not good enough, in the medium or long-term, to expect somebody else to dispose of our problem for us. We must face up to the fact that a disposal system must be put in place if we are to have an industry. I agree with Deputy Timmins that playing on people's emotions will not solve the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Consumers have constantly expressed a need for better information about the origin of foodstuffs. Information on origin is a key element in building consumer confidence in a food. An Agreed Programme for Government undertakes to seek to improve the level of information available to consumers about the origins of food in this country through initiatives such as a distinctive green label for Irish food.</P>
      <P>We are in the process of giving due consideration to how this might be achieved. The food labelling group, which I established earlier this year to examine issues surrounding food labelling in the context of consumer expectations and to come forward with recommendations, has completed its review and furnished a total of 21 recommendations yesterday. The group was in full agreement that consumers should be provided with information on origin, but the manner in which this should be done has yet to be developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The labelling of origin of food products was one of the major issues discussed by the group. There was a consensus among all group members that consumers were entitled to information on the origin of food products. However, the best approach to labelling origin has yet to be determined. The group felt that not enough specific research had been carried out to enable it to draw firm conclusions on consumers' wishes in this area. The group recommended that further research on consumers' expectations on the labelling of origin be carried out. In general, it was the view of the group that the need for consumers to know the origin of a food was linked to the per<Col N="425" />ceived safety of the food. The group has made a number of recommendations on providing information on the origin of meat and meat products in the retail and food service sectors.</P>
    <P>These recommendations will now be thoroughly examined by my Department, the State agencies and my colleagues in Government, as appropriate. I will make a response in the new year taking due regard of the possibilities for a label identifier for Irish food.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I hope that report will be published in the immediate future. Would the Minister of State consider going back to that group and putting in place the necessary research to come up with the conclusions that are necessary? If we move ahead with green labelling, would that have an impact on Irish exports? Would the Minister of State agree that there is concern here about local produce. We hear about Argentinean and Brazilian beef. Many consumers are concerned. I cannot say whether or not their concerns are justified. However, they would like to know where a product originates. They are eating beef in restaurants which they assume to be Irish when it is not. It is likewise with chickens. This is unacceptable. If I put petrol into my car or a product into my house I know what it is. We should know what we are eating and where it came from.</P>

      <P>The report was launched yesterday. It is now a public document. I hope everybody will look at it. Anybody who wants to study the report and its recommendations can see it on the Department's website. We need to be mindful of Article 28 of the Treaty of Europe pertaining to restrictions on imports and so on when considering this report in the new year. We hope, now that the report has been published, that consumer research can be carried out after consultation. The consumer liaison panel, which made a request to the Minister to proceed with the establishment of the labelling group, has welcomed the report. We hope the consumer organisations, in co-operation with the Department, will be able to ensure that adequate research is done so that we know exactly what consumers want and how much information they require. We are satisfied that consumers are entitled to know the origin of the food they purchase, including packed and loose foods. We hope producers, manufacturers, processors, distributors and those involved in the retail and catering industries will take account of the report. We hope food labelling will have a heightened profile in Ireland and that we can show the rest of Europe how citizens should be treated and what information they should be given.</P>
      <P>I hope the report will receive a positive response throughout the sector.</P>

      <P>I welcome the publication of the report. It is long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="426" />I hope its recommendations will be implemented rapidly because the Irish consumer is being hoodwinked by labels which do not clearly state the origin of the food or many of its nutritional aspects. For example, a label which says a product is 93% fat free does not tell the consumer that it is 7% fat.</P>
    <P>We also have sleight-of-hand labelling. For example, when a label says &ldquo;Irish smoked bacon&rdquo; or &ldquo;smoked Irish bacon&rdquo; does it mean the bacon or the smoke is Irish? One would need to be a combination of philosopher, lawyer and food scientist to figure out some labels. There is much labelling of this sort and it is intended to confuse and not to inform.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister assure us that the recommendations of the report will be implemented rapidly?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report but I am extremely frustrated by the extent of food importation into Ireland. There seems to be a laxity regarding where these imports finish up. Is the Minister satisfied that adequate controls are in place to ensure that products such as meat, poultry and bacon which come into the country directly or indirectly are not sold with an Irish label?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister certain that products coming from other countries are produced to the same high standard demanded here? I am convinced that imported products are produced using hormones and other additives which we do not allow and which should not be allowed. Are our farmers and our food industry competing on a level playing field?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Upton has said and it has been addressed in the report. The report is broken down into seven sections within the 21 recommendations. All of the recommendations will be addressed, including the recommendation that we replace the different agencies and Departments currently involved in this issue with a one-stop shop. This matter will be addressed in the new year.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Crawford that it would be wonderful if we lived in a utopia where we did not have to have any imports. We export 500,000 tonnes of beef and the available figures show that we import approximately 12% of our consumed food products. That is a very small proportion when one takes into account the huge success of products such as Dairygold, O'Brien Chocolates and Baileys Cream which are exported in massive volume. We must be careful not only that we give absolute assurance to Irish consumers but that we maintain and sustain the incentive for Irish products to be sold and consumed throughout the EU and further afield.</P>
      <P>It is against that background that we must make our final decisions based on the recommendations of the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Recognising the importance of live exports to Irish agriculture and to the economy generally, the function of my Department is to ensure that the animal health and welfare and other conditions necessary to facilitate the live export trade are fully in place. I am on the public record in the Council of Agriculture Ministers and other fora as indicating my total support for the trade.</P>
      <P>In so far as the export of live animals is concerned, Ireland's rules in the transport of cattle by sea are among the most advanced in the world and require vessels intended to be used for this purpose to undergo an approval process involving a detailed examination by an independent marine surveyor and a veterinary surgeon. My Department has approved a significant number of vessels, with a total of 15 dedicated vessels and 16 roll-on roll-off vessels currently being available for live export.</P>
      <P>In relation to actual trade there has been a resumption in exports of younger animals to markets in the EU, particularly Spain and Italy. The trade in finished animals to Lebanon is also continuing since that market re-opened to us following the lifting of foot and mouth disease restrictions.</P>
      <P>Total live exports in this year will reach some 120,000 head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given a coded reply. He did not mention the Egyptian trade, which was announced so many times. How many cattle were shipped to Egypt? When the lifting of the ban on Irish cattle being sold to Egypt was announced it was promised, on several occasions, that a large number would be sold to that country.</P>
      <P>We have been shilly-shallying about live exports for a number of years. Every year in September and October there is a glut of cattle on the Irish market and prices drop. If there was a properly organised export trade to take those, cattle prices would not fall to such an extent in the autumn of each year, farm incomes would be higher and fewer people would be leaving the land.</P>
      <P>How many live cattle were exported to Egypt this year, compared with the numbers promised when the lifting of the ban was announced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not promise the resumption of the live trade to Egypt. On a number of occasions, before the general election and since, I stated that the ban on the importation of Irish <Col N="428" />beef to Egypt would be lifted. The ban was lifted and the Egyptian trade for beef, as distinct from live cattle, is open.</P>
      <P>I cannot take the industry by the hand and sign contracts and ship cattle on its behalf. Once the ban is lifted and the trade is opened, through political and diplomatic efforts, it is for the industry to take matters from there.</P>
      <P>A good live trade is re-emerging and is being built up since the foot and mouth disease crisis when other countries did not want live cattle from Ireland because we had had an incident of foot and mouth disease. Since then, we have gone back up to exporting 120,000 head of younger cattle to the European continent, particularly to Spain and Italy, and some more adult cattle to the Lebanon. We are pushing that trade in every possible way.</P>
      <P>The live trade is vital for competition within the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no live trade to Egypt or Libya, which were two major markets. Could the Minister indicate where the live trade is in third country markets? Six years ago the Minister said that if he was in Government there would be no problem at all in opening the Egyptian and Libyan markets for live cattle. I appreciate the Minister's comments that this is a vital cog in the industry. Unfortunately, this vital element which removed the poorer quality Holstein type steers that went to Libya and Egypt is now missing. Can the Minister give an indication if Libya or other third country markets will be opened in the foreseeable future?</P>

      <P>It was a release valve that created competition. Foot and mouth disease created a problem for us and we are trying to get back into business again. I met representatives of the industry during the past 48 hours and I said we needed to get into additional markets to sell our 500,000 tonnes of beef. There is no point in opening markets as a political or diplomatic gesture if trade does not take place. On the face of it, we have performed magnificently in the UK market as we have exported 250,000 tonnes to that country, representing half of our total beef exports. It must be remembered, however, that 75% of our UK exports are going to the lower end of the market. Our aim is to export to the lucrative end of the market to get a better return for Irish farmers. There should be a margin for farmers in the <Col N="429" />beef export industry, but if there is not, Commissioner Fischler's decoupling proposals will become more and more attractive to individual farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>I hosted a meeting on Monday, 9 December involving the main farming organisations and the chief executives of the main beef export companies to review the state of the beef industry and to consider the best market strategy for the industry in the short to medium term. The main purpose of this initiative was to encourage the beef industry to re-focus its energies on the dynamics of the market at EU and non-EU level. This is particularly important in the context of the evolving policy and trading scenarios that will arise from the mid-term review of Agenda 2000, the imminent enlargement of the EU and the negotiations on the next WTO round. These issues will impact on the beef sector in a variety of ways and it is important that the industry is properly positioned to deal with their consequences.</P>
      <P>The meeting included a presentation by Bord Bia, which analysed the core markets for Irish beef and the conditions necessary for success in these markets. There was an exchange of views on the main elements necessary to ensure that the beef sector is well positioned to meet the challenges ahead. There was general agreement that Bord Bia's strategy is acceptable to the industry and that Irish beef must move up the value chain within the EU and gain a greater spread of markets in general. It was also agreed that margins would have to be available for all involved, both at production and processing level, and that cattle and beef quality must be encouraged and rewarded. There was a clear commitment from the beef processing industry to avail of all markets open to Irish beef, especially Egypt where renewed commercial efforts will be made to use the opportunities presented by the lifting of restrictions and the increased refunds which I secured in recent months. I will examine a number of other points identified at the meeting with a view to convening a further meeting early in the new year.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that a beef summit has been held, albeit late in the year. Can the Minister outline if he intends that such sum<Col N="430" />mits will be given a permanent structure? He has indicated that he intends to hold another meeting &ndash; will there be a series of such meetings? Does the Minister draw any conclusions from the fact that Mr. Goodman, who is probably one of the biggest players in the industry, did not say anything at the summit? It would be unusual for a man with such a large role in the beef sector to keep his silence. Can the Minister tell me if the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers' Association, the ICSA, was part of the summit? If not, are there any plans to invite the organisation to participate in future meetings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to hold a further meeting early in the new year to continue the progress made at the initial meeting. While the initial courtship phase of the summit may have been a little tentative on the part of some of the players involved, I imagine that they will gain a little courage as we progress. It is important that the key agents in the industry are kept in the same paddock for some time, as no useful purpose is served by endless rows and protests. Ireland is very dependent on exports. I said to the participants in the summit that we have a serious problem &ndash; 500,000 tonnes of beef have to be exported and farmers have to make a profit as part of the process. Farmers will not be able to keep going if there is no profit margin and the industry also needs to make money. It is a great disappointment to me that the co-ops that were in the industry until ten years ago have departed the scene, with the exception of Dairygold.</P>
      <P>There will definitely be another summit meeting and it is likely that further meetings will result from that. It is vitally important that the realities of the marketplace and the signals sent by consumers are taken on board. There is no use in industry filling the lower end of the market or farmers producing without any regard for consumers. I deal with about seven farming organisations, including the ICSA which was mentioned by Deputy Timmins. I am trying to confine the beef summit to a manageable size so I have, generally speaking, invited only those organisations that are part of the social partnership process. If I did not limit it in this way, organisations like Macra na Feirme, the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society and the National Hill Sheep Farmers' Association would have to be involved. I meet such organisations on a fairly regular basis and I have no difficulties with them, but I wanted the beef summit to be a quite compact affair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I ask the Minister to review the composition of the summit with a view to including one or two more organisations? I appreciate that he does not want the meetings to be unwieldy, but I feel he should consider representations that have been made to him for inclusion by other groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister worried by the proposals made by the meat factories at the summit? <Col N="431" />There have been proposals to close down certain meat factories, which would mean that competition would be eliminated straight away. When beef is scarce at certain times of the year, prices increase as a result of competition between the factories. There will be a monopoly if certain factories such as those in south Tipperary are closed. The Minister knows about the factories I am talking about and knows that their closure would mean a great loss to the area. I would like the Minister to comment on the possibility of the elimination of competition, which I fear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider taking into account the views of consumers in future meetings of the beef summit? I appreciate that there is a large difference between the price of production and the price paid by the consumer. It is important that we listen to the consumer who, after all, is king.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he wants a clear commitment from the industry and farmers. Why did he hold the summit so late in the year? How can he demand such a commitment, given that he has cut Bord Bia's budget by 15%?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the importation of meat into Ireland damaging the market here? Does the Minister know who is active in bringing beef to Ireland? The Minister mentioned the Egyptian market &ndash; where are the Egyptians getting their meat at present? Are any Irish interests involved in the exportation of meat to Egypt from third countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hayes asked about rationalisation and I admit there are reports that the industry is interested in streamlining. The industry is in consultation with Enterprise Ireland in that regard and I have no role in the process. The summit I held related to the beef market.</P>
      <P>Deputy Upton asked about consumers and it is right that we should take account of them. In the final analysis, food is produced to be consumed and any other rationale is not sustainable. We exported beef on the hoof until the 1980s, when we started to process it for storage and intervention. After encountering troubles with BSE and foot and mouth disease, we are trying to get rid of beef at the lowest end of the market, virtually ignoring the consumer. One of the main spokespersons for consumers in Ireland is not an average consumer and I would like to hear a more rational version of the point of view of the consumer. I had planned to get a better return from Bord Bia and Bord Glas. In reply to Deputy Stanton's question on the importation of meat, we produce more than 600,000 tons of beef, we have to export more than 500,000 tons, we consume about 60,000 tons and we import about 12,000 tons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to eligibility for the early retirement scheme for farmers. The regulation under which this scheme was introduced, Council Regulation (EC) No. 1257/1999, fixes the age limits for eligibility. The retiring farmer must be not less than 55 years of age and not older than the national retirement age, which in Ireland is 66 years. In drawing up the scheme, therefore, my Department was obliged to limit eligibility to farmers between the ages of 55 and 66.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was particularly interested in the leasing of land and the options which might exist to encourage younger farmers to become involved. Perhaps the limiting age of 55 years could be removed or reduced. My point related to the encouragement of other people into farming or to at least allow for younger people to become involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I presumed the Deputy was referring to transferees and she will recall that the age limit in the old scheme was 50 years. That has been reduced under the new scheme to 45 years for the years 2000 and 2001. It is falling each year from 2001 until the age of 40 years is reached, which is expected to be in 2006. This will encourage younger people into farming. The purpose of the scheme is to encourage the transfer of land. We have made a formal request to the European Commission seeking to have commitments limited to the first five years of payment. This would mean the transferee would not have to farm as a main occupation or have enlarged the land after five years pension payment has elapsed. That is because of the change in the general practice in farming. Initial reaction to the proposal seems to be favourable, but we have not had formal confirmation of this.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
      <Quest>his views on the quality of fast food here; the way in which the quality is monitored; if the increased consumption of such food is leading to an increase in obesity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Food safety is the bedrock of food quality and an extensive monitoring, surveillance and inspection service is in place along each link of the food chain to ensure that food safety standards are respected. My Department plays a key role in ensuring that only food which meets the highest standards of food safety and quality <Col N="433" />enters the food chain. This is achieved through the deployment of some 2000 staff in monitoring, surveillance and inspection programmes &ndash; through the enforcement of strict regulatory controls regarding farm inputs, animal health, veterinary hygiene, animal remedies, plant health and pesticides, through the control of imports of food products and ingredients-materials related to food production, through the enforcement of EU and national rules relating to processing plants, storage and distribution operations, through the network of laboratories and through close co-operation with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and other agencies.</P>
      <P>The State agencies with responsibility for food promotion, Bord Bia and Bord Glas, have comprehensive programmes in place extolling the virtues of good nutrition and healthy eating habits particularly for the young. A balanced diet is one key to good health. With regard to the worrying increase in obesity in the Western world in recent years, figures suggest that from 1990 to 2001 the prevalence of obesity among Irish adults increased by 67% overall, due to a number of lifestyle changes, not least the lack of day to day physical activity. While calorie intake has not increased significantly, more sedentary lifestyles, perhaps attributable to greater affluence, have meant that while we are not necessarily eating more, we are not burning off energy and this leads to a change in body energy stores and weight gain. The Food Safety Promotion Board's safe food programme provides specific advice on how to motivate children to become active. The value of exercise coupled with good dietary habits is also widely promulgated by the heart health campaign, which comes within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Michael Martin.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the very flowery answer from the Minister of State, would he agree that statistics have indicated across the USA, Europe and particularly Britain that where there is an increase in the uptake of fast food the health of, particularly children, has decreased. Obesity has increased and there are major implications for the population. Much of it has to do with our way of life, with affluence and having less time to eat a normal meal. Would the Minister of State agree to a crusade in his new job, to look at the fast food industry? Regardless of the food quality, statistics show that as the fast food industry advances the health of a population decreases. This happens across the western world, Japan and everywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that there is an obesity epidemic not just in Ireland but in the United States in particular. Legal action is being taken against the producers of fast food and many of the fast food outlets. We should look very carefully at the quality of the fast foods from the point of view of food safety. The recent acrylamide scare is something which we should take on <Col N="434" />board. Would the Minister agree that, given that we have a plethora of agencies dealing with all of this, it might be wise to consider a Department of Food with sole responsibility for food?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given a fairly comprehensive reply but would he tell the House if any recent reports have been made on the incidence of monosodium glutamate in the preparation and preservation of food. One cannot go into any catering institution and get a bowl of soup without this very objectionable ingredient. Will the Minister inquire into the use of this ingredient in food preparation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point made by Deputy Timmins, I can only say that I do not intend to start a crusade of examining or pursuing the fast food industry. We all like a little bit of fast food now and again. The two main fast food suppliers are very generous sponsors of sport and fitness and actively promote sport across the board. At least there is a balance for the consumer. I fully agree with Deputy Upton that we have a problem. There is a modern trend of bringing young children to fast food outlets when, perhaps, they should be brought home for their meals. We should all be aware of this and I will ask the Food Safety Authority to look at the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. As I said previously, if I were Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform I would not start from this point. This inadequate legislation is unable to address the public order issue on our streets. There has been a breakdown of law and order. The legislation has a very minor function. It provides for an exclusion order to be made preventing someone who has been in a public house or fast food premises from returning to the specified premises if they are charged with a particular offence. However, they will just go to a different premises and carry on as before. The venue may change but the problem will not go away. We could find ourselves in a legal morass as far as proving culpability is concerned as regards premises which provide food rather than drink if we try to close them down. The legislation is inadequate to address the anarchy on our streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would have been much better had the extra 2,000 gardaí promised in the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats manifesto been appointed. There is no money for that now so it does not seem as if the Minister is serious about policing the streets. If we look at the annual crime figures <Col N="436" />for 2001 we see a dramatic increase in the headline offences. There was an 83% increase in violent assaults, most of which were late at night and in the circumstances we are discussing. There has been an increase in the number of all kinds of serious offences and we do not have an adequate response to that. This was brought home to us last week when the boys from Belvedere College were unable to sleep out on the streets for 48 hours because the authorities could not guarantee their safety. They were unable to continue doing what had been done for the past 16 years. That shows how much matters have deteriorated. One cannot have an overnight collection for the homeless on the streets of Dublin for security reasons. That is disgraceful. I am sure Fr. Peter McVerry who was the beneficiary of some £40,000 or £50,000 each year will miss that money.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme highlighted the degree to which law and order has broken down in terms of alcohol abuse and the frightening activities we saw on the streets. The only response from the Government was to put 35 cent on the price of alcopops as though that would solve the problem. Under the most recent road traffic legislation gardaí were to be trained and given a breathalyser kit which would cost in the region of &euro;1 million but that is not available this year, nine months after the passing of the legislation. The Government is not serious about dealing with drink driving. The Commission on the Liquor Licensing Laws has been postponed again in order to have further talks on the rights of pub owners regarding Travellers yet we talk about trying to control drinking in public places and closing premises. Surely we should have speeded that up so we could have the benefit of that multidisciplinary group that spoke for various sectors of the community.</P>
    <P>This is a small, petty, minimalist Bill that will be largely unworkable. It will not be effective in dealing with the problems it purports to deal with. It is badly drafted and thought out. It is approaching the problem from the wrong end. We should be looking at the cause of the problem, why there are so many young people on the streets, why there is such a high level of liquor consumption, the contribution of super pubs and the extensive licensing hours in some places, the limit on public houses were there are big barns of pubs in certain areas of the city and at the facilities and amenities for young people. They are crying out for facilities. There have been cutbacks down the line and we do not know if the RAPID funding will come on stream which was supposed to deal with facilities for young people in deprived areas. It has now run into the sand. We do not know if the funding will come on board. It appears not. From all accounts, those involved in the&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello will acknowledge that it is important legislation if for no other reason than the recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme which showed the abuse of alcohol by young people in particular. While the programme was based around Dublin and the problems that are encountered in the city, the same problems are experienced by every small and medium-sized town in the country. I compliment the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on putting forward this legislation and introducing it. It was the previous Government's intention to proceed with this Bill during the course of the last Administration and I am glad that it has been taken up again at such an early stage in the lifetime of this&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not see the Statute Book during the lifetime of the last Government but hopefully because of the priority accorded it by this Administration it will be signed into law in the near future. Everyone in the House is aware of the great public concern among law abiding citizens at the increased level of public disorder which seems to have escalated over the past number of years. There is not a family that has not been affected in some way. There is not a town, county or village that has not been affected by outrageous acts of hooliganism against individuals and property perpetrated by a minority as a result of over-indulgence in alcohol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently the Minister for Health and Children spoke of the staggering increase in the consumption of alcohol particularly among young children. A frightening statistic is that the consumption of spirits has grown by 50% in the past five years. Much of this increase is attributed to young people drinking shorts as opposed to beer and lager. I compliment the Minister for Finance on increasing the tax take from alcopops in the budget. It seems that young people set out to get themselves very drunk by drinking these beverages. If they stuck <Col N="438" />to longer drinks we might not see the level of disorder we are currently experiencing.</P>
    <P>As our community enjoys an increase in prosperity we are also experiencing an increase in alcohol consumption. One does not have to be a rocket scientist to make the connection. In a general context, we must be concerned by a culture in which the consumption of alcohol plays such a prominent part. We should be aware of the health implications of such a culture. Reading any of the provincial newspapers one can see the large amount of space given over to the coverage of court cases in which it is very evident that abuse of alcohol is the main contributing factor. The effect of this culture on public order and civil society is evident.</P>
    <P>I am no latter-day puritan, either in outlook or in habit: I do enjoy a drink. However, I am concerned about the direction in which our society is heading. There is no single answer to this problem. It is a multi-faceted issue and agencies such as the Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of the Environment and Local Government, along with us as legislators, have a part to play in the resolution of this problem. The Garda have a very difficult task in trying to control situations in which hundreds, sometimes thousands, of inebriated young people come out onto the streets of our county towns at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. They all make their way to local take-aways where, infused with alcohol and, increasingly, drugs, they become involved in serious incidents of public disorder. I am sure every Garda in the State recognises only too well the problem of young people <i>en masse</i> causing problems. They can easily identify particular trouble spots.</P>
    <P>This Bill goes some way towards rectifying this problem and gives the Garda some power to deal with the situation. The job of the Garda is not made any easier by the legislation on our Statute Book. Talking to gardaí, one cannot blame them. Why should they put their well-being at risk trying to uphold public order when they feel they are being let down by us not giving them the protection they deserve? Our gardaí must be given the resources to tackle this problem. I agree with Deputy Costello that the problem of Garda numbers must be tackled by this Administration.</P>
    <P>The Judiciary has an equally important role to play and the sight of individuals who repeatedly offend being given lenient sentences or being put on remand is not acceptable. The Judiciary should be mindful of its responsibilities. There can be nothing as frustrating, for gardaí in particular, as going to great lengths to apprehend and bring to justice people who are the root cause of public disorder, only to find that lenient sentences are being handed down. I know from speaking to gardaí that they are frustrated by the sentences imposed by certain judges. Persistent offenders should, in the first instance, be put under curfew, under which they are not allowed out of their homes between certain hours of cer<Col N="439" />tain days, especially weekends. If they break the curfew they should be given custodial sentences. These should be mandatory and specified in law. There is no greater incentive towards good behaviour than the threat of a custodial sentence.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give protection to people who wish to go about their daily lives free from the threat of drunken or disorderly thugs intent on causing trouble. The primary purpose of our role as legislators is to ensure innocent people have the protection of the law behind them. Talking to people, it is extraordinary to find out how many of them, particularly but not exclusively the elderly, cannot walk the streets of their own towns and cities after dark because of the fear of being picked on by these cowardly people, who normally travel around in gangs. There is an onus on the Government and on the House to ensure that the unruly element does not take over our streets at night. We must augment our legislation to make sure this does not happen. I welcome the significant powers this Bill will give to the Garda in tackling the problem. It will assist them greatly in restoring order to many places which have been plagued by the problem of antisocial behaviour.</P>
    <P>Apart from the cost to the State of the extra manpower we need to patrol our towns, particularly at weekends, and the expense involved in bringing wrongdoers to justice, a price is also paid by our health boards and hospitals as they provide facilities, at a time we can ill afford to do so, in the accident and emergency departments of our general hospitals. &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; showed the huge pressure placed on accident and emergency units by weekend disorderly behaviour and the carry-on in certain towns, especially the larger urban areas. We can come in here and be very critical of our health service and the work of the people who are at its coalface, but we must remember that we have responsibilities as well. There is a case to be made that people admitted because of over-indulgence in alcohol should pay for their own treatment. They take up the time of medical professionals who would otherwise be able to focus their attention on those who really need treatment. The Minister of State, who has first hand experience of these issues, should look at that idea. A recent survey showed that more than half of all admissions to accident and emergency units are a result of alcohol related problems. This sends a message that we must do something.</P>
    <P>The installation of CCTV cameras is a useful way to tackle street violence. Gardaí can point to a reduction in crime after two or three weeks anywhere where such cameras are in use. They can use them to identify perpetrators of disorder and use the footage as evidence against them. There should be a speeding up of the CCTV project. The previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform outlined a number of urban centres suitable for the use of CCTV and the current Minister proposes to install cameras in those <Col N="440" />centres next year. We must do this as quickly as possible to assist gardaí and rectify the difficulties they are facing. Reducing crime levels is much cheaper than bringing people before the courts. The last Government made great progress in the installation of CCTV systems in some urban areas and it should be enhanced and expanded. It would be cost effective.</P>
    <P>We must look at the legal aid system. Repeat offenders abuse the system when they are granted free legal aid. This softly, softly approach to a minority in society does not help and will have to change.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the provisions in the Bill for exclusion and enclosure orders. A curfew would be more effective. We should see how they work before we make a final commitment to them. The authorities must also get to grips with ID cards. In parts of the State there is a thriving business in the manufacture of fake IDs. We must settle on a proper system and make it available State-wide.</P>
    <P>We should acknowledge that the majority of citizens act responsibly and the individuals causing this public disorder are very much a minority. Young people now see drink driving as completely unacceptable, a sea change that has come about in the last 20 years. Then one was macho if one drank and then drove home.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill. It is small but welcome step in the right direction and the Minister should pursue it. If proof is needed about the seriousness of the problem, we should look at the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme from two weeks ago. I hope the Bill is passed swiftly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been waiting since June to speak on this Bill and welcome this opportunity to contribute to the debate. Many people believe that street violence has only become an issue since the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme. Some months ago a young man on the north side of Dublin was assaulted and murdered because he had a mobile phone. That demonstrates how bad the situation is at present. The individuals involved in that case had carried out a number of assaults prior to this but had never been reported because people believed they would not be apprehended. As a result of the lack of resources, gardaí cannot ensure that this type of incident does not happen or pursue those involved. This legislation is welcome but it will be worthless if gardaí are not given the required resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is rushed legislation as a result of the flagging of street violence as a major issue by Fianna Fáil focus groups. After five years in office, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have failed to get to grips with public order. It is a social problem that has flourished over the last five years and was ignored until the focus groups flagged it prior to the election, leading to the publication of this Bill. Street violence has grown rapidly in that period and the viciousness of attacks is increasing. The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, <Col N="441" />was a spectator watching an unprecedented escalation in street violence.</P>
    <P>The overwhelming majority of people no longer feel safe walking alone in their own neighbourhoods at night. Cities and major towns now resemble Dodge City, with a huge rise in shootings, stabbings, muggings and assaults, reported and unreported. In every town there is concern about street crime. In a survey in County Roscommon a year ago, over 85% of people of all age groups said they were afraid to walk the streets of their local town at night.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum to the Bill uses the phrase &ldquo;alcohol abuse&rdquo; but that is the only reference to alcohol in the Bill, although it is a major contributing factor in public disorder. Not only does it cause problems of public order, it causes problems for the health service, placing significant pressure on accident and emergency units at weekends. Deputy Nolan mentioned that 50% of those entering accident and emergency units do so because of alcohol related incidents. Those entering due to an alcohol overdose should be charged the full cost of their treatment. At present, those treated following a road traffic accident have to pay the full costs of treatment because the claim is put through an insurance company. The same should apply with regard to the abuse of alcohol and that would focus many minds. Huge pressure is put on waiting lists and every week, in major acute hospitals such as University College Hospital in Galway, elective surgery must be cancelled because those assaulted over the weekend are taking up much needed beds.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats talk about the deregulation of pubs across the country. It is a hobby horse of the party of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. There is no point introducing this legislation if deregulation of pubs occurs at the same time; that would be contradictory.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nolan spoke about the need to imprison more people for breaches of this legislation when enacted. The current sanction is a fine of &euro;650 and-or three months in jail. Prison seems the only solution provided in this legislation and by this Government to resolve this difficulty. The Bill makes no mention of the need to develop the probation service. The expansion of the use of restitution orders, duty service orders, probation orders, extended supervision and diversion programmes should be looked at and resourced. This would involve a much expanded probation and welfare service but is not in place because this Government will not invest resources. We see instead cutbacks and clawbacks throughout the public service.</P>
    <P>More emphasis must be paid to rehabilitation and restorative justice if we are to ensure this issue is addressed. In some cases, restorative justice can be a much more effective tool in ensuring that an individual does not become a repeat offender, especially in light of the fact that the Government is not prepared to provide the <Col N="442" />resources for juveniles who have been found to have committed offences. The spaces are not there at present.</P>
    <P>We need high visibility policing, and gardaí visible on the beat and the streets. That is not happening at present due to the huge under-resourcing of the Garda Síochána and bad management of existing resources. There was no good news in the Estimates or budget with regard to the resources being provided to the Garda to ensure this legislation is enforced. Athlone town, one of the major gateway centres the Government has talked about, is a good example. There are five or six gardaí on duty every Saturday night in Athlone. If there is a road traffic accident, that figure is reduced to four and, if the gardaí are called to an incident in Moate or Glasson, it is reduced to two in a town with a population of over 15,000, with three major nightclubs and a fourth about to open. Those are the resources available at present yet we are still talking about this legislation. Without a commitment to resources, implementation of the Bill will not be possible and no commitment has been given by the Government.</P>
    <P>On bank holiday weekend nights, instead of putting additional resources onto the streets, Garda resources were until recently focused on road traffic enforcement. That was because the Garda Síochána had become the revenue collector for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, bringing in money from speeding fines. Since the penalty points system has come in, gardaí are on the streets enforcing other road traffic legislation with regard to motor tax and insurance because they can issue fines for those offences. This is to bring in more revenue rather than policing the penalty points system which was supposed to be the core tool to improve road safety. It is now only related to the issue of revenue.</P>
    <P>There is not the same generation of resources for the Government with regard to drink driving, or the same ability to tax that through the new revenue commissioners for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda Síochána. Therefore, the drink driving legislation is not resourced. Some &euro;1 million required to bring in new breathalysers has not been found by the Government and the funding needed for the Garda overtime necessary to enforce drink driving laws over Christmas has not been provided by the Department. A dedicated Garda traffic corps is needed to focus on road traffic legislation and the Garda Síochána should be given the resources so this legislation can be implemented. That has been highlighted with regard to Operation Codladh Sámh, where funding was not available to ensure that measure was appropriately and successfully delivered.</P>
    <P>The issue of public transport should be looked at and there should be proper night schedules in our major cities. An issue that comes up mainly in rural areas is that of pick-up points for buses bringing young people into towns on a Saturday <Col N="443" />night, then collecting them and bringing them home. Many of the pick-up locations are near residential parts of towns and there should be dedicated zones where buses can collect young people after leaving nightclubs so those with alcohol on them are not brought into residential areas. This is happening all over the country and there is a responsibility on local authorities to focus on this and designate specific areas for pick-up and collection.</P>
    <P>There is a need to bring in by-laws to ensure that indiscriminate drinking on streets is stopped. There does not seem to be the necessary co-ordination between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Environment and Local Government, and local authorities. Statutory identity cards have worked well and are very successful in the United States yet we are still dithering about whether to bring them in here. Deputy Nolan spoke about the number of false identity cards available; manufacturing them is good business.</P>
    <P>The Bill ignores the difficulties and problems occurring in housing estates. There is no mention in the legislation of control in housing estates where there are huge problems for residents. Because of the pathetic resources provided, gardaí are not able to police many of the bigger housing estates in towns around the country. There is no mention of exclusion orders which could be enforced for specific areas, not just outside a pub, chip shop or nightclub. The Minister should look at these issues and provide the funding to ensure this legislation is enforced. There is no point in Members talking in the House unless there is a commitment to provide resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the last comment by my colleague, Deputy Naughten. This Bill reminds me of legislation brought through the House in 1989 by the then Minister, Mr. Michael O'Kennedy, regarding the control of meat and bone meal. The Bill was not policed until the outbreaks in the mid 1990s. This Bill may sound good but, without financial support to the Garda and those who have to implement it, it will be worthless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was at a meeting in Cootehill on Monday night at which colleagues from west Cavan pointed out that not a single garda is available between Manorhamilton and Ballyconnell at night. One must wait for one to come from the station in either town. The same is true from Ballyconnell to Cavan town. The lack of available gardaí to deal with crime or disturbances on the streets is the single biggest issue we face and people are living in fear. Those that want to cause trouble know that the chances of the Garda responding on time are limited. The Garda means well but it is impossible for it to operate. If gardaí manage to respond on time and apprehend the people who are causing trouble, justice is very often not done, nor is it seen to be done. There is not much point in the Garda going to the <Col N="444" />trouble of bringing these people to court to find that the judge decides a contribution to the poor box is sufficient punishment. It is vital that elected legislators ensure the work done by the Garda is supported by a justice system which imposes appropriate penalties.</P>
    <P>The issue of probation has been mentioned here, but I wish to mention another. When people are faced with a choice between a custodial or suspended sentence and a fine, they are often not able to pay. It is long past time to have a system whereby that fine could be attached to their social welfare payments or their earnings. They would then feel the pain for some time in the future and it might have the effect of curtailing their use of alcohol. If someone overdraws from social welfare or pension funds, they often find they have to pay the money back over a number of years. There is no reason fines imposed on people cannot be dealt with in the same way. If that is done along with some social involvement by the people concerned, some good can come of these matters.</P>
    <P>Recently, I asked a question about problems in Cootehill and some gardaí were quite annoyed. I am not annoyed with the Garda, I am annoyed about the resources it has to provide services the people in that town, or any other, deserve. All of us in this House are guilty of allowing the extended hours and I understand the Progressive Democrats want to allow for a complete opening up of the law in this regard. We have to take another look at the legislation to curtail pub opening hours. What is happening is ridiculous. People leave pubs late at night and go to fast food outlets, which are often on main streets, where they cause mayhem and serious trouble for the elderly.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of fear on housing estates with people being forced from their homes. This is happening in Monaghan and other towns where one would never have expected problems of this nature. It is not just the case in some of the estates we would imagine. The Garda is not able to deal with the fear. Only last night, I spoke to a garda from another town who told me that the problem is getting witnesses to come forward in the face of threats. People are afraid that if they say something, they will be the next victim. We need the 2,000 extra gardaí the Minister promised to be put in place, but if they cannot be provided, civilians must be appointed to do some of the jobs currently being done by members of the force. That would ensure that gardaí would be on the beat to enforce the provisions of this Bill. I support any move to control late night hooliganism and abuse, but without the necessary funds, this Bill cannot be put into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Ms Hanafin)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of public disorder on our streets is the result of a lack of respect, a lot of attitude and too much alcohol. It is not just a problem for the Government and public representatives, it is a problem for society. Alcoholism and the abuse of alcohol through <Col N="445" />binge drinking by young people leads not just to serious health and social problems but to serious public disorder. This disorder is taking place outside licensed premises, on our streets and in our housing estates during the late hours of the night. We can point to many who enjoy alcohol responsibly and do not create problems for themselves or others, but it is very serious when it comes to young people. We have seen violence and risk-taking by young people which leads to ill health and societal worry.</P>
      <P>It is particularly worrying to look at the statistics regarding the level of drinking among young people. There has been a 50% increase in the consumption of spirits over the last five years. While in other EU member states alcohol consumption per capita has decreased, in Ireland it increased by 41%. When we considered extending the pub opening hours we pointed to other countries in Europe which did not have public disorder but did have later closing times. It was thought that later opening hours here would mean that people would not be spilling onto the streets at the same time, but we failed to consider the fact that Irish culture is different. The Irish attitude to alcohol is very different to the attitude in any other country and extended hours have meant people are spilling onto the streets at later times of the night to cause public disorder.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Naughten complain about what is not in the Bill. He overlooked the fact that everything he mentioned is in the Children Act which was passed last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>That Act mentions restorative justice, parental responsibility and the extension of the probation service and the Garda youth diversion projects. We all recognise how valuable the Garda youth diversion projects are and the number of them has been increased from a mere 12 in 1997 to 64. We can divert young people and keep them aware. We can ensure that parents take responsibility for where their children are and we can make them face the cost by fining them. As the Children Act is implemented over a short period of time, wider society will perhaps take responsibility for what is happening among young people. We do not have to look at &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; to know what is occurring, we can see it on our streets all the time.</P>
      <P>In his opening statement the Minister spoke about the numbers of offences which are committed. Of relevance to this legislation are the 14,687 offences of intoxication in a public place committed in 2000, a figure which took four years to jump from 3,900. That points to a serious problem and to a serious need for the kind of legislation we have brought before the House. This Bill reflects the need for a co-ordinated Government response as does the strategic task force on alcohol, established by the Minister for Health and Children, and the educational campaign Think Before You Drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" />The Children Act, the Garda diversionary projects, the Bill which was before the House last week dealing with nightclub security etc. are all interlinked, as is the issue of advertising. We have been very strong in this Dáil on advertising of cigarettes and we need to be just as strong on alcohol advertising, in so far as it relates to young people.</P>
    <P>This Bill is important in relation to exclusion orders. It is ridiculous that night after night the same people, drunk and disorderly, can turn up seeking entry to licensed premises and have to be turned away. An exclusion order for people who have been convicted of certain offences gives a certain guarantee and extra rights to the owners of the licensed premises ensuring their own protection and the safety of those on their premises and on the streets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be for a specific premises but it means we can keep those people away from premises which we can all identify are the cause of many problems. In all our areas we can point to the specific nightclubs where there is trouble. We do not need the Garda to tell us that. This Bill will provide the backup. Publicans and owners need to take greater responsibility. It is already an offence to continue to ply a client with drink until they are drunk to the extent they are no longer able to take responsibility for themselves. Yet profit appears to be the over-riding factor where publicans continue to sell drink to people who have obviously gone beyond the need for it. It is a case of a societal response. I am concerned where this relates to young people. We have strong laws on selling to under age persons. We have seen throughout the country, but not in the city of Dublin, where premises have been closed for selling to under age persons. I would like to see greater enforcement of those laws. It is only when publicans and owners lose profits that they will begin to act more responsibly.</P>
      <P>There is a growing problem of youth binge drinking. When I hear young people talking about alcopops I am worried when they say they do not like if they can taste the alcohol. That shows the kind of deception which is going on in the drinks industry and in advertising. Young people can end up drinking five or six alcopops such as WKD because they like the taste. They are getting the effects of the alcohol but they only realise that after having consumed five or six. What they taste is orange, lemon or some fruit. It is a very deceptive drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same way as we can ban under-cost selling of bread, milk and other products it should be possible to do the same in the case of alcohol. It <Col N="447" />is unacceptable that in the colleges one can walk around and find promotion nights offering a Vodka and Red Bull at a cheap rate of &euro;1 or &euro;2. A way needs to be found to ensure that is not continued. That would not happen with basic products and it should not happen with alcohol and young people. Marketing is only one element but it is leading to serious societal problems, not only of public disorder but of under achievement in third level colleges and in second level schools.</P>
    <P>As a teacher I know that on a Monday morning one can come across young people with hangovers. Other teachers tell us of children of 11 or 12 years of age who are unable to function. In my dealings with children for the national children's strategy, I witnessed young children who, quite obviously, had all the features of foetal alcohol syndrome. Their parents, and particularly the mother, had such alcohol problems that one could see it in the child's features and the child will continue to suffer because of it. It is only with the concerted effort we are trying to put in as a society and a Government that we can tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten spoke, in the light of Christmas, about the drink driving campaign. The Garda has indicated it will be out on the streets as in the past and it does not need a particular implement to enforce the drink-driving laws. I was amused to hear Deputy Naughten speak about what should be done. He was the very one who stood up here and criticised every single element of the points system, saying it should not be introduced now, the Garda was not ready for it and that no preparation was done. Yet we can see its effects where, thank God, for the first time in four and a half years, last weekend not one single person was killed on the roads. I did not hear him say, &ldquo;Well done, Minister&rdquo;. We need to recognise that where there are policies and programmes they need to be implemented immediately. The legislation is only one element of it. This Bill will provide that extra support to those who own licensed premises, nightclubs, dance venues, amusement arcades, chip shops, etc. It will also highlight the issue in a positive way, that as part of the Government's concerted effort this is just one other way in which we are trying to tackle this serious issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>He was a friend of mine. I will deal with that. The earlier discussion on Second Stage took place on 19 and 20 June 2002. Overall, it is fair to say there was a general welcome for the provisions of the Bill. While some Deputies criticised it for not going far enough, others faulted it for going too far. That means the Government got the balance just right.</P>
      <P>This is a public order Bill, it is not an intoxicating liquor Bill nor is it a public health or control of alcohol Bill. When reviewing the contributions made in June one could be forgiven for thinking a different measure was being examined. There are some who wish to attribute the decline in public order to the extension of licensing hours provided for in July 2000 but this is to miss the point completely.</P>
      <P>It is significant that between 1989 and 1999, alcohol consumption <i>per capita</i> in Ireland increased by a staggering 41% and that the consumption of spirits has increased by 50% during the past five years. These factors alone are worrying and probably point to one of the principal reasons behind the problems now being faced in this area. However, the increase cannot be attributed to the reasonable increase in opening hours introduced in July 2000 under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000. In view of the representations made to him, the Minister has asked the licensing commission to look at that again and we expect its report shortly.</P>
      <P>The Minister has already alluded to the other matters relevant here. The drinks industry is pushing out the boundaries of what is acceptable in terms of drink advertising by suggesting through sophisticated messages, subliminal, sporting and otherwise, that alcohol is cool and even sexy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister for Health and Children has indicated this is something that needs to be addressed aggressively. Of special interest and concern to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the question of the licensing <Col N="449" />regime and specifically the availability of ordinary pub licences. That is being examined by the Commission on Liquor Licensing.</P>
    <P>The work of the special task force on alcohol is of paramount importance, not just for issues dealt with in his interim report but also other matters which it could usefully take into account, such as advertising, the sponsorship of events by the drinks industry, especially those that appeal to and involve young people, and the promotional practices that encourage excessive consumption of alcohol in society.</P>
    <P>I return now to the area covered by the Bill and to the context in which the Government is promoting it. Gardaí have strong powers in regard to public order matters in the 1994 public order Act. However, it must be accepted that, for the benefit of society, it is necessary to add to those powers to help them deal with the problem of drink related street offences. All reasonable people would wish the situation was otherwise but it is not.</P>
    <P>Gardaí have had considerable success as a result of Operation Encounter which came into force on 23 February. Particular attention is being paid to night clubs, fast food outlets and other venues in which large numbers of young people gather late at night, where experience has shown there is a potential for public disorder. Additional resources were made available to deal with the problems and specific plans were drawn up by regional commanders to prioritise the deployment of those resources. The precise timing is decided locally, based on the specific circumstances prevailing in each location.</P>
    <P>The figures made available by the Garda on 16 October 2002 indicate that since the scheme was introduced, the following incidents have been recorded: 1274 assaults, including assaults causing serious harm; 14,314 incidents of threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour; 21,386 cases of public drunkenness; 6,480 instances of refusing to obey Garda directions; 3,276 cases of disorderly conduct and 371 cases of alcohol being sold to minors.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the Bill approaches the matter in a novel way. If the sale of alcohol is a privilege which society grants to a proper licensing system, then the people in that privileged position not only have responsibilities under civil law but also have a duty to ensure that their clients and patrons do not leave their premises in such a state as to be a danger to themselves and a menace to others.</P>
    <P>The owners of fast food outlets, which, unfortunately, can act as a magnet for troublemakers, also have to see the measures in the Bill affecting their interests in the wider context of protecting them and their law abiding customers and neighbours from thuggery. I reassure those interests that the closure provisions will not creep up on them. As is the case with the other premises covered by this Bill, serious trouble will first have to have occurred, and a warning issued by gardaí as a result. Only if the problem manifests itself <Col N="450" />again will the closure order option become a possibility.</P>
    <P>Business interests in certain areas of the country, Galway in particular, have already come together to plan their strategies. They have introduced business watch schemes and other initiatives to share strategies and information as to how they can avoid problems. Even before its enactment, the Bill is having a positive and pre-emptive effect.</P>
    <P>We know there are already provisions in the licensing code relating to the obligations on licensees not to serve drink to a person who is drunk. There are difficulties in policing those provisions, not to mention the provision of proof. The closure order provisions in the Bill may be seen as a blunt instrument but the Government believes that most sensible people will see their introduction as a reasonable and justifiable means of dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>Similar changes were introduced in England and Wales last year in the Criminal Justice and Police Act, 2001, to deal with the same problems. Those changes have been successful. We already provide for closure orders in the liquor licensing code for the sale of drugs on a premises or for the supply of drink to people under a certain age. The closure orders in the Bill, however, will apply only after the owner, manager or licensee of a particular establishment has been warned that trouble has occurred outside the premises caused by people who were on the premises. This differs significantly from the UK provision which allows for the immediate closure of premises by the police and the subsequent variation, rescission or confirmation of that closure by a court. The exclusion order in the Bill is there to ensure that a convicted troublemaker can be ordered by the District Court to stay away from a particular premises. Licensees will welcome that development.</P>
    <P>I have only come to this Bill and today is my first day dealing with it. Deputy Costello raised the matter of people moving on to another premises if one premises is subject to a closure order. Even a cursory examination of the Bill will show that more than one premises can be closed. If there is a difficulty in a particular area several premises can be closed by court order. The Deputy also referred to the Bill as an inadequate response and said there were insufficient gardaí on the ground. Listening to contributions from the Opposition one would swear there are no gardaí in the country.</P>
    <P>The strength of the Garda is at an historic high. There was a commitment in the Government manifesto to 2,000 more gardaí over the lifetime of the Government. That did not say over the first six or 12 months but over the lifetime. Anyone who can read would understand that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>A Social Welfare Bill cannot be considered in an isolated context. We also have to look at the economic policies of recent years and to acknowledge that great strides have been made in job creation and tax reduction, particularly personal taxation. From the Opposition contributions, there seems to be a collective forgetfulness with regard to the Government's achievements of the last five years and a preoccupation with their short sojourn in office from 1994 to 1997. On any reasonable comparison, it has to be acknowledged that this Government has been very successful in implementing policies and addressing social problems. Undoubtedly, the most effective avenue out of poverty is through employment. This Government has created up to 400,000 extra jobs in the last five years.</P>
      <P>One can only listen to the Labour Party's contributions to this debate with a wry smile. When that party had a Minister for Finance and a Minister for Social Welfare, pensions were increased by the paltry sum of £1.80.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>In the final analysis, we will be judged as a Government which has secured significant increases, in the last five years, for pension and social welfare recipients across the board. The recent budgetary package, and the Social Welfare Bill which enacts it, clearly demonstrate the approach which the Minister for Social and Family Affairs is taking and her success at the Cabinet table in securing agreement that we have to protect the income standards of those at the bottom rung of the financial ladder. At a time when difficult decisions had to be made, the social welfare sector has been protected by the increase of &euro;6, keeping it ahead of inflation.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party appears to judge success in terms of taxing workers to the back teeth, losing competitiveness, putting people on social welfare programmes and boasting of the amount of money it has spent on social welfare. In my view, the measure of success of any Government in relation to social welfare is to have less people on unemployment benefit and assistance. That indicates that a Government is working well, creating wealth and employment and making a positive contribution to social inclusiveness.</P>
      <P>In parts of the country, especially in large urban areas, there have been significant social problems for many years. It was said that those areas were by-passed by the Celtic tiger.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>Improvements are clearly evident in areas where there was significant social deprivation, caused primarily by generations of massive long-term unemployment. If we are to be consistent in addressing those problems, we have to look at education in socially disadvantaged areas. Most importantly, we must ensure that when people come off social welfare, they are rewarded for a fair day's work. Recent budgets have addressed that situation at the minimum wage level. Over 90% of people on the minimum wage are now out of the tax net. Looking ahead, <Col N="454" />the new programme for Government will ensure the further evolution of that situation so that those on low pay will not be subject to any form of income tax. That is a positive move.</P>
      <P>The minimum wage will be part of ongoing negotiations. Although we have been accused of being right wing and not caring for those in need of assistance, the fact is that it was this Government which implemented the minimum wage. Looking back over the past ten years, the evidence is there for all to see. This Government's policies of reducing taxation and responsible budgetary measures meant that, in times of plenty, we were able to spend on the public sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>In changing international circumstances where the economy is now in a different gear, we are still in a position to bring forward a substantial budgetary package for social welfare. The Opposition appears to lose sight of that. Reference has been made to pension funds being raided. With due respect to the Labour Party, does it take advice from anybody? It is clear from the demographic structure and age profile of our population that we are sitting on a time bomb unless we address the need to invest now in order to ensure that we are in a position to pay for pensions in future years. For far too long, pensions have been paid out of current revenue, workers were taxed to the point of being forced on to social welfare and the situation developed into a vicious circle, with generations of Irish people being driven abroad to find work.</P>
      <P>Great strides have been made in the area of child benefit. From a level of less than &euro;40 under the rainbow Government, we have now progressed to the present level of &euro;125 for the first and second child. That is a major contribution towards addressing real poverty in the areas concerned.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, was very apt in his recent reference to the filibustering tactics of Fine Gael. Year after year in this Chamber, Governments have been accused of announcing social welfare increases at budget time but not implementing them until several months later. This Government has consistently brought back payment dates which now coincide with the calendar year in most cases. That is a very positive step to address the issue of child poverty. I welcome the large increases in child benefit in recent years. A note of caution must be sounded, however. If we are to target the areas in which child benefit is most required, we must examine whether it is sustainable to increase child benefit across the board, regardless of income level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>While not directly related to the Social Welfare Bill, 2002, the issue of planning for child care facilities is creating insurmountable problems in urban areas. People are unable to get planning permission in housing estates for the provision of small crèches which is driving the cost of child care through the roof. Why can a person not be granted planning permission for four or five crèche places, under health board guidelines, on housing estates? I am sure the Green Party would support a measure whereby people going to work could drop their children to a crèche on their estate rather than driving long distances across the city. If we keep increasing child benefit and continue to have limited crèche places, we will drive up the cost of the child care. We must examine the issue carefully because, while one Department is providing funding for child care, other Departments and local authorities are refusing to take their responsibilities seriously to address an issue that is creating significant problems for working parents, particularly in urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a huge black economy which we must acknowledge if we are serious about protecting children. We must ensure child care facilities are <Col N="456" />up to the high standards the health boards demand. There should be some mechanism whereby we can bring the child care industry into the tax net to ensure everything is official, above board and that people who are paying large child care costs can avail of some sort of tax rebate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>While we are talking we are also doing, unlike Deputy Healy, who does a great deal of talking but no doing.</P>
      <P>Any Government can be judged on how it cares for the elderly. This Government can be judged to have cared for the elderly fairly with the pension payments provided for in recent years. The elderly made significant sacrifices and played a major part in getting us where we are today. The generation that got through the difficult times of the 1960s and 1970s are now the people we are caring for and they deserve it. I congratulate the Government for the increases in pensions. The Government gave a commitment in the 1997 manifesto that it would bring pensions above the £100 threshold and broke that threshold by a substantial amount. Even in changed budgetary circumstances, we were able to give a &euro;10 increase to old age pensioners and I hope the Minister will continue to argue for old age pensions that are well ahead of inflation and that we strive to meet our target of &euro;200 by 2007. For many years, widows were left behind when it came to social welfare payments and I welcome the increased payments to them proposed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disappointing the Labour Party benches are empty because when Deputy Quinn was Minister for Finance he had budget surpluses but only managed to take 38,000 people out of the tax net in three budgets and added just £1.80 to the old age pension. It is disingenuous to say economic circumstances were different then because the same circumstances pertained up until this budget and, even in difficult times, we were able to make major increases. Overall, the next few years will tell much about how we shape ourselves as a society. If we have difficult decisions to make in the years ahead, we must still ensure that the most marginalised will be protected by social welfare packages that ensure they stay ahead of inflation. I am convinced the correct budgetary policy is being pursued because the last time we found ourselves in difficult circumstances, when Governments refused to make tough decisions, this country slid into a quagmire of financial recklessness, the population fell to a critical level and many of our young people left the country with a poor education. We have forced generations out of the country because of reckless spending and the inability of Governments to take tough decisions. I will defend any Government &ndash; even on unpopular decisions &ndash; to ensure we retain a fiscal policy that ensures <Col N="457" />prosperity on a longer term basis. No more short-sighted decisions like we had in the early 1980s, when people failed to grasp the nettle and make difficult decisions. That period of mass emigration is the legacy of previous coalition Governments.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on her first time presenting a Bill in the Dáil. I wish her success with her new portfolio. I know she argued admirably at the Cabinet table in view of the fact there are large increases in social welfare payments across the board, particularly for the elderly. I commend this Bill to the House and hope that, when all its measures are implemented, they will ensure the standard of living of the most marginalised in our community is protected from inflationary pressures and that next year we will do the same thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Gogarty, Connolly and Healy. Budgets are a series of choices of what to cut and what to spend, what to tax, who to tax and how much to tax them. The choices the Government has made indicates its priorities and demonstrates which groups in society it is most likely to help. Last week's budget tells us a great deal about this Government; it tells us that it put a higher value on animals than on people. How else could it explain why the horse and greyhound racing industries cost the Exchequer almost &euro;64 million, or why a Minister decided not to introduce a tax on bloodstock? It was not only the horse and greyhound industries that did well out of this budget, however. Another section of society, even more beloved by the Minister, also did well. Big business and the rich did very nicely as hundreds of millions of euros were thrown away on a corporation tax cut.</P>
      <P>We have heard much from the Government benches about the increase of &euro;10 per week for pensioners &ndash; the men and women who built this country. There is no shortage of business people, politicians and economists telling us about the economic boom and claiming credit for it. The reality, however, is that the lead up to the economic boom was created by those who are now our senior citizens. Yet, all they will get is &euro;10 per week and a promise that by 2007 pensions will be up to &euro;200. Over the past 12 months, we have heard many promises that have not been delivered upon. I am sure pensioners will await 2007 with bated breath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few nights ago, just 300 yards from here, I encountered four homeless people sleeping on the street. This is a reflection of the inequalities and wrongs in our society. It is also a reflection of the continuous neglect demonstrated in successive budgets and the attitude of successive Governments towards poor people. After every budget, old age pensioners are hit by a rise in local authority housing costs, so what they receive from one hand is taken away by the other. The cost of electricity, gas and VHI cover has risen, in addition to all the other indirect taxation that <Col N="458" />will affect the elderly. The &euro;10 rise in pensions is just a spin doctor's attempt to create the impression the Government cares about those who suffer most.</P>
    <P>The cut in community employment schemes is to the detriment both of those on the schemes and the communities in which they work. They have rendered a tremendous service to their communities. A number of Government Deputies referred to a major American company that has relocated to China because labour is cheaper there. Is this an indication of what the Government thinks about workers? Is it a threat to workers that if they do not accept lower wages this will be the inevitable outcome? It is an ominous sign when a Government Member of the House makes such a contribution.</P>

      <P>The Bill is linked to the budget debate so I may be criss-crossing somewhat in my remarks. With the various changes in time allocations for this debate, the opportunities to contribute have been mixed. The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, has been in and out of the Chamber on various duties. I wanted to reiterate what my colleague Deputy Boyle said earlier when the Minister was absent, but unfortunately she is not here now either. It is worth pointing out to the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, that the Government will lose more money through the special savings investment scheme than through the budgetary allocations for social welfare recipients. As Deputy Boyle pointed out, it shows the Government's priorities in these tough times. In tough times we should make tough decisions. While the increases in social welfare for pensioners, those with disabilities and for carers are laudable to an extent, they are only in line with inflation. To talk about an increase in pensions to &euro;200 per week by 2007 is facetious because if we continue with a 6% inflation rate that sum will not be worth diddly-squat in four years time.</P>
      <P>Higher earners, including TDs, have come out of the budget with more than they had before. We can deal with the VAT issue and the increase in the cost of living because we have money to burn but people who are scraping a living at the other end of the scale do not. I was not being facetious when I sent an e-mail to Senators and TDs asking them to consider foregoing their recent 4% pay increase and to make a contribution towards education or the first time buyer's grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that the Deputy has pointed that out. I used to do something that was cynical and naive in one sense: I used to go <Col N="459" />around with £20 notes with a little note tied to them. I gave them to people begging on the streets and people in cars. I threw it in through their car windows with a little note saying &ldquo;Give half this away and keep the other half. Spread it around and give good fortune&rdquo;. It was a little bit naive in the sense that I scared the hell out of some drivers.</P>
      <P>TDs are called upon in their constituencies to donate to various charities and no doubt the majority of them do so generously, but why do we have tax if not to ensure that we gain a certain amount of revenue? TDs will obviously pay more in tax than they would ever donate of their own goodwill.</P>
      <P>I was shocked to read in the paper recently that we are due for another pay rise that was decided before I was elected. To be honest, having gone from earning around the average industrial wage to a TD's salary, I know we can afford to do without this pay rise in a time of fiscal rectitude, if it means allowing something more for those who are less well off. I call on the Minister for Finance to do this, although I doubt if it will happen.</P>
      <P>There are cars parked around the plinth and on the Merrion Street side of Leinster House, which represent a practical tax benefit. Do TDs pay a benefit in kind tax on the free use of these car parks? They do not. Do TDs get subsidised meals in the Dáil restaurant? They do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill gives effect to the social welfare changes in the budget. The Government has again missed an opportunity to reduce the level of poverty by narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor. For a number of years we have been spending a lower percentage of our wealth on social welfare than any other country in the EU or any of the applicant countries. The proportion of GDP spent on social welfare continued to shrink during the tiger years of the 1990s, and we rank in the lower echelons of the industrialised nations.</P>
      <P>The &euro;6 per week increase in unemployment benefit is only one instance of the Government's failure to reach its PPF target of &euro;127 &ndash; it rose from &euro;118.80 to only &euro;124.60. Child care has once again suffered, with a token &euro;8 monthly increase in child benefit for the first two children and &euro;10 for subsequent children. A sum of &euro;125.60 monthly for each of the first two children is significantly short of the aspirations expressed in the programme for Government where the Government expressed its intention to raise this to &euro;149. Similarly, the allowance for the third and subsequent children will be pitched at &euro;149, which is considerably short of the expressed aim of &euro;185 per month. In families where both parents are required to work outside the home, childminding costs are crippling. The &euro;25 to &euro;30 a week which these payments represent are a mere pittance if a family has to shell out &euro;200 weekly on childminding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By his own admission, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, succeeded in allocating merely 25% of the promised &euro;414 million to child benefit, which is only one of the false figures with which the general election was fraudulently pur<Col N="461" />chased. Old age pensioners will have to make do with an extra &euro;10 weekly, or approximately &euro;1.43 per day, which would not get anyone far in McDonalds. With spiralling costs for heating, food and services generally, pensioners have only a bleak mid-winter to look forward to, and the 1% VAT increase will mop up any remaining cash they manage to scratch together.</P>
    <P>The Minister exhibited his contempt for the disabled who are among the most vulnerable in society. While appropriate lip service is paid to the Special Olympics with generous people in towns throughout the country making a major contribution to the hosting of the various nations' special sports people, the Government throws token crumbs in the direction of people on disability benefit or the blind pension in the form of a weekly increase of &euro;6. How can parents be expected to feed, clothe, shoe, pay bus fares, buy school books and stationery for each child on an extra &euro;2 per week or 30 cent per day and an annual back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance of &euro;30, or 58 cent per week? Social welfare recipients have not been safeguarded as the Minister suggested. Let him exchange places with someone in receipt of social welfare for one week. I doubt if he would dare to do it. He would be singing from a different hymn sheet afterwards.</P>
    <P>The 8.8% increase in the social welfare budget may appear impressive, but to pensioners and other recipients, 8% of very little is still very little and still very inadequate. Any gains made in the past years have been eroded by a combination of higher inflation and euro-triggered price increases. Purchasing power or spending power have steadily diminished in many households. The almost universal condemnation of social welfare proposals outlined in the budget by the many organisations catering for families in need merely serves to underline the Government's betrayal of the weakest in society.</P>
    <P>The Minister may try to blame current budgetary circumstances for the Government's failure to fulfil its commitments. However, he must accept that the Government is the author of its own fall from grace, having embarked on a pre-election splurge from which the country will take a long time to recover.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the sixth budget that continues the policies of this Government which are policies of making the rich richer and handing some crumbs to those who are on social welfare or low pay. The priority of the Government is clearly evident in two provisions in this Bill and in the Estimates that preceded it. The fact that the Government was prepared to continue the promised reduction in corporation profit tax from 16% to 12.5% while at the same time refusing to continue the promised increases in child benefit, is an indication of where this Government stands. It is, as Deputy Ned O'Keeffe said, the most right-wing Government in the history of this State. The priority should have been children and <Col N="462" />people on social welfare and low pay. Instead, the priority is people who are already super rich, already wealthy and who do not need the money.</P>
      <P>The budget submissions of various organisations, including the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, CORI and the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed indicated that there should be an increase of at least &euro;11.20 in the basic rate of social welfare. That was not a figure that was pulled out of the air. It is based on 30% of gross average industrial earnings. It is in line with the report of the Social Welfare Benchmarking and Indexation Working Group set up under the PPF. It is also linked to the Government's commitment to raise the minimum rate of social welfare to &euro;150 in 2002 terms by 2007. That the Government has only been prepared to increase the basic rate by &euro;6 is a clear indication of another broken promise.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated at the beginning of his Budget Statement that his priority was to protect the weaker sections of society. An increase of &euro;6 for social welfare recipients is hardly protecting the weaker sections of society. That payment breaks another promise. Unemployment assistance is now gone from &euro;118.80 to &euro;124.80 and that falls way short of another Government commitment that it would, during the life of the PPF, bring the lowest social welfare rates to &euro;127. Again the priority for the Government was not social welfare recipients.</P>

      <P>Another promise, like all the promises made during the general election, like all the lies told during the general election, was that the qualified adult rate would be raised to 70%.

      <P>The qualified adult rate is 66%. The Government made a commitment, which it has not fulfilled, to bring that to 70%.</P>
      <P>The real nastiness in this budget relates to how children were treated. The Government has refused to fulfil the commitment it made in relation to child benefit but is prepared to forego &euro;350 million to people who are already super rich. The fact that the child dependant allowance has not been increased since 1996 is an utter disgrace and it is totally unacceptable. I would have thought Fianna Fáil backbenchers would have been up in arms about that as well. However, few of them seem to be saying anything about it.</P>

      <P>The child dependant allowance is now &euro;13.80. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul asked that it be increased to &euro;21.80 but the Government did not do that. It expects a child to <Col N="463" />be looked after for &euro;13.80 per week. That cannot be done, as anybody who has children knows. To add insult to injury, the Minister has been talking about child care costs for years but there is nothing in this budget on child care.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have been given the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the social welfare provisions and resolutions in relation to the budget day announcement. I say this advisedly and with great pride. This budget is the product of hard times and we are facing into harder times, when we cannot be sure we will see a global or US recovery. I speak of the US because we are dependent, in trade and investment, on the United States. The potential for the United States economy to improve or go into recovery is integral to whether our boat lifts or not.</P>
      <P>Mindful of these hard realities I was delighted that the Minister for Finance, in conjunction with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, decided to actively discriminate in the budget in favour of the less well off and those receiving social welfare payments.</P>

      <P>The word discrimination is often given a bad connotation. However, every budget is based on the principle of discrimination. It must discriminate in favour of one group over another. We must actively, in some cases pro-actively, encourage one group to go ahead and to move forward. This budget discriminated in favour of the less well off. In a downturn the people most exposed to rising prices are those who are dependent on social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="464" />The marvellous achievement of this budget, and of Deputy Coughlan who is a new entrant to the Cabinet, is that despite these hard times and the undeniable need for corrective action in relation to the public finances and to adjust the planning and forecasting of financial and social services to the harsh reality of lower growth in the world economy&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the Social Welfare Bill, 2002. I have seen quite a few such Bills in good and bad times since I was elected to this House. This is probably a harder time than we have seen for four or five years. It is right that we should look back on the progress that has been made since 1997. An additional 400,000 people are at work compared to 1997, which makes a total of 1.8 million workers in Ireland at present. The rate of unemployment has fallen dramatically from 10.3% in 1997 to 4.6% now. The number of long-term unemployed has dropped from 90,000 people to 22,000 people. Social welfare expenditure increased by &euro;3.5 billion between 1997 and 2002, far in excess of the rate of inflation and way beyond the expectations of those who were trapped in the welfare system in the mid-1990s. Major progress has been seen in relation to the number of benefits available and the equalisation of such benefits.</P>
      <P>When we look at the various areas covered in the Social Welfare Bill, 2002, we can see the progress that has been made. A considerable amount of new schemes have been introduced since the Government came to power. Although not all of them have been funded to the extent that certain Deputies would like, there has certainly been progress. It is a shame that Deputy Healy is no longer here, as I am sure he would be interested in the fact that the level of consistent poverty dropped from 15.1% in 1994 to 6% in 2000. I admit that 6% is too high and I do not think we will have succeeded until poverty can be described as non-existent in Ireland. A certain amount of the poverty we find can be self-inflicted as a result of social problems within families. I have to be fair to social workers and others involved with those who encounter such problems, as they make enormous efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pensioners are extremely well looked after in this Bill and in the budget as a whole. The increase in the old age pension of &euro;10 is no more than pensioners deserve, as they have made a contribution to the welfare of this country by building it. In their retirement years, they are entitled to receive a decent income. I do not doubt that the Government will meet its commitment to a pension of &euro;200 per week by 2007. The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government <Col N="470" />made promises in relation to social welfare when it came into office in 1997 and the pensions promises were fulfilled in its first term. Many Opposition speakers have spoken about child benefit in the course of this debate and they should accept that the Government has made enormous progress in that area. The increases in child benefit in the last three years are sometimes not taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>When I recall some of the budgetary increases I have seen in my time as a Deputy, it strikes me that many younger Deputies would be shocked to compare them with the enormous increases of the last three years. I remember that the former Minister, Proinsias De Rossa, made a big song and dance in 1997 when he gave pensioners an extra £1.75, which is the equivalent of about &euro;2. It makes one wonder why there have been so many complaints from the other side about this year's &euro;10 increase for pensioners.</P>
    <P>The increase of &euro;11 for widows is also to be welcomed, as I have always felt that they should receive the same pension levels as others and they are now within &euro;1.50 of that rate. The increases in social welfare, including the much maligned &euro;6 increase, are in line with inflation. I do not doubt that we will see progress regarding the budgetary situation in the years ahead. It would have been foolish of the Government to have decided to introduce an unbalanced budget, as people in years to come would have had to suffer as a result of our over-spending.</P>
    <P>I was in this House in 1987, when supplementary budgets had to be introduced and when Fianna Fáil was accused of introducing a hairshirt budget that would mean a return to the days of sackcloth and ashes. If we had not introduced such a budget, however, the IMF would have come in to run the show for us. I do not doubt that our European colleagues would not have given us any bouquets if we had stepped out of line as regards budgetary policy. The budget introduced last week by the Minister for Finance will help to stabilise the social welfare system and will help people to cope with the hard times we face in the short-term. A little pain at this time may be much more beneficial than avoiding it and having to take twice the pain at some future date.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the timing of the increases. When budgets were passed at the end of January and Social Welfare Bills were passed in February, people would receive their increases the following August in some cases, without retrospection. All social welfare recipients will receive their increased payments from 1 January 2003, just as the tax year now begins at the start of the year. This is of considerable assistance to those in receipt of social welfare, who appreciate the fact that they now have the same status as those in employment in so far as they receive their benefits from 1 January.</P>
    <P>Social welfare recipients will also benefit from changes to schemes I have not yet mentioned. The thresholds for the family income supplement <Col N="471" />scheme will increase by &euro;17 from 1 January, leading to a net gain of &euro;10.20 per week in the average FIS payment. This is to be welcomed as it will encourage people to go back to work. The changes with regard to PRSI are minimal, but the standard rate of contribution has been reduced from 5% to 4% and the minimum flat contribution has been reduced from &euro;253 per annum to &euro;200 in certain sections.</P>
    <P>This, the Minister's first Social Welfare Bill, is prudent. I compliment her on her appointment in her absence. She has done an enormous job for social welfare recipients. She fought her corner at Cabinet to make sure that social welfare received its fair share. In times when money is not as plentiful as in previous years she did some service to social welfare recipients in ensuring that a level of benefit which would keep them ahead of inflation was brought in. Everyone gets their payments from the beginning of January which means that some lump sums will not arrive until February. However, they will appreciate that they are being paid retrospectively. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatBreen" hpid="Mr. P. Breen Mr. P. Breen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Durkan. We saw the rip-off which took place during the euro changeover and how the consumer was affected. Everyone was affected by the changeover in the currency.</P>
      <P>Before the general election there was the famous slogan, &ldquo;A lot done, more to do&rdquo;. Many people were done and many will be done again over the next few years. This emerged again when the Minister for Finance made a speech on national radio stating that we will have similar budgets for the next two to three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last number of years there was great prosperity. We have just come through one of the most prosperous periods in the nation's history. We should have been able to say to the weakest or most needy in society that we had done them proud. Unfortunately we have not. Shame to the Government because the budget has done nothing to redress this. There are more people homeless seven days a week in Dublin than in London. The budget and the Estimates provided nothing for carers or the sick or to cherish our children. One just has to look at the disabled person's grants. People are coming into my office in Ennis every day with problems. Local authorities are facing terrible problems with lack of funding and there was nothing in the budget for disabled persons grants. Local authorities are using this year's money to pay last year's applicants. People come into my office about leaking roofs and applications for showers and replacement windows. It is a shame that we are unable to look after the vulnerable in our society. The elderly got &euro;10 per week from the budget. To offset that there were VAT increases of 1% while diesel increased by 3 cent per litre. This will affect all of the basic essentials which the elderly use and the <Col N="472" />&euro;10 per week will not make much difference to them, the most vulnerable people in society.</P>
    <P>Poverty is something which we look at everyday of the week. The budget should have been about people but unfortunately it has been about what people have, not what they need. In a just and caring society progress for people with disabilities would not be linked to the current economic climate. The budget has proved that we do not live in a just and caring society. Along with the poor rises in social welfare, which are negated by inflation and rises in charges, you could mention that, as the NESC report which has been ignored by the Government stated:</P>
    <P>There is substantial international evidence that relatively generous rates of social welfare payments are incompatible with high employment rates and good economic performances. There is a disincentive. Effects on social welfare more usually flow from the aspect of programme design and delivery rather than payment.</P>
    <P>It states about child poverty that:</P>
    <P>There is mounting international evidence that a dynamic, knowledge-based society is putting a growing premium on the quality of childhood. A society which does not accord a high priority to tackling child poverty is, by omission, perpetuating major social inequality. In the light of the evidence the council recommends that this Government should pursue with even greater vigour its goal in eliminating child poverty from Irish society. Ireland may still have found the best package of income support for low income households. In the year 2000 more than 8% of children were below the 60% income threshold and experiencing basic deprivation. Child benefit has been raised substantially in recent years, we note that, but some 28% of the increase is estimated to have gone to the top 30% in the income distribution, as against 21% to the bottom 30%.</P>
    <P>The Government should not have cut the back to work allowance. It has helped 30,000 long-term unemployed people back to work. The three member independent Estimates review committee, which examined all existing public spending, recommended last week that no new people should be taken on the scheme next year. In the 2003 Estimates the Department of Finance cut the budget for employment support services by 31%, down from &euro;198 million in 2002 to &euro;137.3 million.</P>
    <P>The Government is actively encouraging women back to the workforce but cuts in the scheme blatantly contradict this. The numbers on the scheme have been steadily falling in recent years. In December 2000 there were 39,000 participants. This fell to 32,000 a year later and by last October 25,000 people were taking part. The scheme helped 28,483 people to take up jobs in 2001, while 3,708 more were allowed to keep <Col N="473" />most of the benefits for up to four weeks to encourage them to start their own business.</P>
    <P>There is a huge housing waiting list which has not been tackled in the budget. Between March 1999 and March 2002 the numbers assessed as in need of social housing rose by 24%, to more than 48,000 households. I notice the amount of people on housing lists in the Ennis area who are coming in on a daily basis to me looking for houses and about which the town councillors can do nothing. This was not a good budget for the poor. It concentrated more on roads and taxation and there were no increases to help the poor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked Deputy Conor Lenihan whether child benefits would be paid in a lump sum like last year. It was a genuine question. We all know that much was made about the payment of the lump sum in child benefit. This year it is a different story. We have heard from Government backbenchers, among whom the Government commands considerable support, whatever about among the general public, who are openly talking about limiting child benefit. They were not talking about that last year. There was no mention in the envelope with the cheque last year that their could be a possibility that Government backbenchers might decide to limit the number of people to whom child benefit could be paid in the future but, alack and alas, that was before the general election.</P>
      <P>It would have been terrible if an unsuspecting public got wind of what was in store for it before the general election. There is a difficulty with this payment. The increase works out at 3 cent per day. We must wait to hear from the Government backbenches how it will be paid, but if it was paid in a lump sum, it would require special packaging that would carry coins of a small denomination.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about nothing. Much has been said about the various social welfare increases, but the fact is each payment has been eroded by the increases in taxation and VAT. Every item purchased in a household will be hit by VAT. A great deal has been said about the old age pension. Take old age pensioners who smoke. They will be in a different position after the budget and this Bill because their increase has gone up in smoke. If they have a little tipple, a drink of spirits, they are in trouble. What a Social Welfare Bill. What an awful thing to deprive people who are retired and gave their life's labour to the country. What a mean scoundrel type of act at this time of year when it is supposed to be a time for giving. In this case it is a time for taking away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a headline in one of the national newspapers a few years ago which stated it was pay back time. I did not know precisely what was meant by that phrase at the time, but I know now. This is pay back time because all the unfortunate people who voted for the Government parties are being paid back. Let there be no doubt about this and all the huffing and puffing from the Government backbenches about what they were going to <Col N="474" />do, when and how often is to no avail. The budget has come and gone and now we have the Social Welfare Bill which gives effect to the changes in the budget, but, unfortunately, they are not for the better. They are a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>As regards capping the rent subsidy which is administered jointly through the health boards and the Department of Social and Family Affairs, I do not know from where the notion came to apply a cap at this time. The theory is that rents are becoming too expensive. If it is not paid in the scarce housing position that exists, the unfortunate people concerned will have no home. This has been the trend for the past five or six years. Year on year, instead of building local authority houses the Departments of Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs operate the rent allowance scheme. We have come to the end of the tunnel. It is not that there is light there but a brick wall. The people cannot go any further. What will happen in the next few months when landlords want a rent increase and people are told by the health boards, as agents for the Department of Social and Family Affairs, they cannot get an increase in the rent allowance and to leave their present accommodation? They will be left on the side of the road. It is easy for me to say that here, but in the near future the reality will dawn on those who are directly affected.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate officials are being conditioned through the health boards and the advice given by the Department is to take no nonsense from public representatives, that they have no hand, act or part to play in these matters and that they should not come to them for advice or to make representations. I have tabled a matter on the Adjournment tonight to deal with the issue in greater detail. My advice to whoever is saying this to those unfortunate officials is that there has been enough colonialism, leave the officials alone, they were able to do their job without getting political advice. Any attempt by anyone in Government from either party to exclude the public from access to their public representatives would be a very dangerous precedent. If I find public officials are telling constituents to avoid members of the Opposition, there are ways to resolve the matter. I have no doubt but that advice is being given and in such a way as to indicate that it has the full political imprimatur. I do not propose to speak about it further at this point other than to say it is unfair to the officials concerned to expect them to behave in this fashion. It is wrong of Departments to attempt to colonise officialdom in this fashion and totally alien to the public service.</P>
    <P>This is a time for giving, a time of goodwill. Some time ago a number of FÁS schemes imploded. That is not the direct responsibility of this Department, but it will impact on its expenditure. A number of people were on FÁS training and retraining schemes where the agencies which employed them found them very beneficial. It was found that it was beneficial in terms of retraining and education. The job the people con<Col N="475" />cerned were doing was environmentally enhancing. It is very sad that there should be a curtailment in the operation of these schemes, particularly at a time when there is a general restriction in funding to various Departments. The knock on effect will be that more people will be pushed on to the live register. There are already signs that this is happening. I did not hear anyone on the Government benches mention an increase in unemployment levels. The trend in unemployment is upward and alarming.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about the fact that economies throughout the world are going badly, but there was nothing wrong with this economy until the Government started tinkering with it. It fiddled with it to such an extent that it lost control and everyone has to pay back. That is the real meaning of the pay back. In its efforts and zeal to achieve the ultimate objective, that of an overall majority, prior to the last general election the Government decided to put the pedal to the floor and go for it for all it was worth. That request went out to all Departments. Suddenly the hand brake was pulled. The whole thing was spun around. There was a screeching of tyres, a smell of burning rubber. In all such situations the price is paid by the most vulnerable in society. I have never in my life had more people at my clinic requesting help from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other agencies. The reason they need more help than ever before is that instructions have been applied through the various Government agencies to the health boards in relation to supplementary welfare because of the so-called reviews, or cutbacks. That is sad, because supplementary welfare is there to ensure that there is a safety net for those who are in need, when they are in need. There now appears to be a concerted effort to ensure that each applicant for social welfare payments will have to wait. The latest thing is a waiting list for the processing of applications: this is also a saving device.</P>
    <P>I am sorry my time has expired because there is so much I would like to say, very little of it complimentary to the Bill. I bear no malice to the Minister in the House or the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, but it is a sad reality that after five years of unprecedented wealth generation in this so-called tiger economy, we have heaved a sigh at the end of it and produced so little, in view of the expectations created before the general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Callanan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this legislation. Listening to this debate for the past hour or so I have been struck by one thing: the genuine lack of interest on the part of Opposition speakers in this Bill. Their hearts are not in it. After the verdict of the public last May, it is easy to see why. The public saw the commitment of the last Government to the less well-off in our society and they saw what the Government and <Col N="476" />the former Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs had done for those people. This year's budget increases, totalling over &euro;1 billion, are evidence of the commitment of this new Administration to the less well-off. The problems identified by some of the speakers are not ones to be dealt with solely by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. They are social problems extending far wider than the simple payment of allowances.</P>
    <P>The result of the Government's increases in pension rates will be to maintain its commitment to older people and its strong record of putting older people first so that they can continue to live in dignity and the immense contribution made by them to the development of the country may be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>One issue which struck me over the years, particularly during my membership of a local authority, is that aspects of the work of local government, county councils and town councils would be better administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. I am talking about such things as higher education grants, disabled person's grants, housing allocations and house loans. The Department of Health and Children has officers in the various health boards who do means tests and carry out various investigations of the eligibility of people for entitlements. This system would be appropriate for the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>For such things as higher education grants and disabled person's grants we should co-ordinate the work of the Departments. Much criticism has been made of the role and the lack of functionality of the Department of Health and Children and its staff. It is unfair to say that they should be working towards providing a better health service when their work is being diluted by functions outside their areas which they are obliged to carry out. I would like to see the Minister address this problem. A lot of work is being done in the area of means testing at the moment. We should direct our attention to this system.</P>
    <P>Some of the previous speakers mentioned the rate of unemployment. It is only fair to point out that 400,000 people are working now who were not working in 1997. A total of 1.8 million people are working now. The Minister for Finance is to be commended for reducing the direct income tax rates to 20% and 42%. At the same time as reducing the percentage tax take from workers, he is taking more income tax from the workforce. If this is not an indication of the positive results of the Government's policies, I do not know what is. It is also important to note that &euro;3.5 billion more is being spent on social welfare now than was being spent in 1997, even though the rate of unemployment has fallen to its lowest level in a long time. Tax receipts have increased so we can now pay greater increases to our social welfare recipients. A total of 55,000 new houses are being built this year, 5,000 of them by local authorities for people who are unfortunately not in a position to pay for the construction of their own houses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="477" />This Government is mindful of what is going on out there. It is unfortunate that in the area of child care and child benefit we were not able to make the increases we had hoped for this year but it was confirmed in the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs wants this rectified over the next two years. In commending this Bill to the House I remind us to be mindful of what we have achieved. It is to be hoped that we can continue to improve the rate of payments to the less well-off in our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCallananFF" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on her appointment and on securing an extra &euro;530 million in social welfare payments this year. This brings the total cost of social welfare to &euro;10.2 billion, which is an increase of 80% or &euro;4.5 billion since 1997. That is no small money. I welcome the increases of &euro;10 for pensioners, &euro;11 in the widow's contributory pension and &euro;8 in child benefit for the first two children and &euro;10 after that. That increase comes on top of the high increases of the last few years. The main development to be welcomed, however, is the increase in the carer's allowance of &euro;10 per week. There has been a change in the means test which allows a couple to earn &euro;429 before they are means tested. A few years ago, if people came to me and asked whether they qualified for carer's allowance I would almost tell them to go home and not waste their time. Now, however, things are much improved. I have pursued Minister after Minister on this because I feel very strongly about it. Instead of talking about keeping people in their own homes we should do something about it. We must give every possible financial aid to carers. This budget and this Minister have done so.</P>

    <P Just="Center">&ndash;deplores the lack of Government commitment to tackle educational disadvantage;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;appalled that thousands of pupils and teachers are forced to risk their health and safety by spending their school hours in grossly substandard classroom accommodation in hundreds of primary schools throughout the country; and</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;concerned that the Government has cut the budget for primary school buildings by almost &euro;70 million for 2003 and 2004,</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>For the vast majority of Irish people, the education system is first class. It has proved to be one of the best systems in the world. Collectively, we should recognise its broad excel<Col N="480" />lence and acknowledge the vast contribution made by so many. Unquestionably, our education system is a key driver of our economic and social development as a nation. However, in recognising its excellence, we should constantly seek ways to make it better. That is my focus as Minister. It should be acknowledged that the teachers within that system have given sterling service, even though in recent years some people have used the difficulties in education to have a go at the teaching profession. I am not referring to anybody in the House. I am sure I speak for most Members when I commend the teaching profession for its professionalism, commitment and dedication.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment to primary education is unparalleled across the whole range of services. Since 1997, some 2,900 additional teaching posts have been created in primary schools. These teaching posts have been used to reduce class sizes and to provide additional resources for children with special needs. If one takes into account the demographic dividend, there are up to another 1,000 teachers in the system as a result of their absorption. The staffing schedule for primary schools is currently designed to ensure a maximum class size of 29 pupils by reference to the enrolment on 30 September of the previous year &ndash; down from 35 in 1995-96.</P>
      <P>The allocation of posts for children with special needs and improvements in the staffing schedule together with the decline in enrolments has helped to ensure that the overall pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools has improved substantially in recent years, down from 21.7 in the 1997-98 school year to 19.0 in the 2001-2002 school year.</P>
      <P>An Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to reduce the pupil teacher ratio in our schools, to progressively introduce maximum class size guidelines which will ensure that the average size of classes for children in junior classes will be below international best practice guidelines of 20:1 and to implement changes to retention and support policies which will assist schools in areas of significant disadvantage to recruit and retain teachers.</P>
      <P>Nowhere has this Government's commitment to the primary system been more evident than in its response to children with special educational needs. I am proud to have been a member of the Government which, in 1998, took the unprecedented decision that all children with special needs in the primary system should henceforth be entitled to an automatic response to their needs, irrespective of their level of need or location. This decision has had a profound impact across the spectrum of special needs. It has resulted in unprecedented levels of investment in special education services and has laid the basis for major advances in the quality of the State's response to this most deserving group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact of this decision and the present Government's ongoing commitment to the special needs area are reflected in the fact that the number of special resource teachers support<Col N="481" />ing children with special needs in ordinary primary schools will have grown from about 100 at the end of 1998 to more than 2,200 by the end of this year. In addition, the number of special needs assistants in the primary system will have grown from some 300 to 3,800 full-time and a further 1,000 part-time assistants in the same period.</P>
    <P>These figures represent real and substantial growth in services. They represent the welcome reality that children assessed as requiring such services now have ready access to special teachers and special needs assistants dedicated to ensuring they gain maximum benefit from the education system.</P>
    <P>That is only part of what is being achieved. Right across the spectrum of special needs investment in support services is now at unprecedented levels. For example, since 1998 the number of learning support, remedial, teachers has increased from 1,302 to 1,531. Investment in part-time tuition services for children with special needs will have increased from just over &euro;5 million to a funding allocation of &euro;19 million for the coming year.</P>
    <P>Some &euro;43 million is allocated to the special school transport service and &euro;4.4 million is provided for the appointment of escorts on special school transport services. I should add also that funding for special equipment for children with special needs has risen from &euro;635,000 to &euro;3.2 million.</P>
    <P>In addition to increasing investment in services at school level, it is equally important that the necessary legislative and structural arrangements are put in place to ensure that services can be delivered in an effective and efficient manner which meets the needs of parents and other service users. Two key developments in this regard are currently receiving priority attention in my Department. The first of these relates to the establishment of the National Council for Special Education. The council will have two key functions. It will carry out research and provide expert advice to the Minister on special education issues. It will also ensure the co-ordinated delivery of a comprehensive range of special education services at local and national level for persons with disabilities. A chief executive has already been appointed to the council and it is intended that the council will be vested by the end of March 2003.</P>
    <P>I intend bringing forward legislation as soon as possible to clarify and confirm the rights and entitlements of persons with disabilities to an education service and to put in place the necessary framework to deliver the required services. This legislation will be based on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, which was published shortly before the dissolution of the last Dáil and which has since been the subject of ongoing consultations between my Department and interested parties. I intend to advance this legislation as speedily as possible with a view to having it enacted before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="482" />Since my appointment as Minister for Education and Science, I have made it clear that assisting the most disadvantaged people in the educational system is my top priority. Consequently, during my negotiations with regard to the 2003 Estimates, at a time when prudent decisions were needed to protect the gains of recent years, I decided that priority would be afforded to specific targeted programmes for tackling education disadvantage, and for primary and post-primary education. I can assure the House that this is a direction that I am determined to progress with vigour and determination during my term in office as Minister.</P>
    <P>The level of investment provided to date, and for next year, will ensure that we make further progress in providing resource teachers and special needs assistants in primary schools. There will also be increased provision for school retention initiatives generally, including the school completion programme, which involves in excess of 370 primary and post-primary schools in 80 clusters with a budget in 2003 of some &euro;23 million &ndash; up from &euro;15.4 million in 2002.</P>
    <P>The Giving Children an Even Break programme applies to 2,320 primary schools and involves the appointment of over 200 additional teachers to ensure that there will be a maximum class size of 20 in junior classes in those disadvantaged schools with the highest proportion of disadvantaged pupils. The expenditure for this programme combined with the resources dedicated to the Breaking the Cycle project, the support teacher project and the disadvantaged areas scheme will be over &euro;36.7 million in 2003.</P>
    <P>There will be continued support for the home/school/community liaison service in all primary and second level schools with designated disadvantaged area status in addition to a wide range of other supports including those for Traveller children, children of non-nationals and other vulnerable groups.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the area of school buildings. I assure the House that the programme of capital investment in the primary sector will continue. Since 1997, the Government has invested &euro;600 million in the capital programme at primary level. For 2003, the allocation of &euro;147 million will enable me to consolidate the very considerable progress that has been made over the last several years although, in view of current economic realities and the tightening of the financial position, the rate of progress in 2003 will inevitably be somewhat slower than I would have liked.</P>
    <P>As a result of historic under investment, especially during the term of office of the rainbow coalition, a significant number of schools require investment in extensions and refurbishment while new schools are also needed in developing areas. Also, with the increased numbers of teachers, resource teachers, special needs assistants, etc., there is need for extra space in primary schools.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Government's ongoing commitment to funding educational infrastructure, in excess of 120 major capital projects in the primary <Col N="483" />sector have recently been completed or are currently under construction. Many of these projects will continue in construction into 2003. In addition, this year a further 1,700 schools received grant aid for significant improvement works while each of the 3,300 primary schools received a devolved capital grant. This devolved grant empowers schools to deal directly with problems such as hand washing/drying facilities, heating and replacement of windows and doors without any need to get approval from my Department. The vast majority of schools now deal with these minor works themselves and do so very effectively.</P>
    <P>I want to dispel a misunderstanding that has arisen in regard to the 400 major primary school projects in architectural planning that are listed on my Department's website. These projects were not included in the 2002 construction programme. Because they are major projects, they have to go through a detailed process of architectural planning which can take a considerable period of time to complete. The financial commitments to be met from building projects already in construction is also an important factor in determining the number of projects that may proceed at any given time. It is my Department's intention to release the projects in architectural planning to construction on a phased basis over a number of years, with due regard to the availability of capital funding.</P>
    <P>Despite the increase in the level of funding over the last several years, there is an historical deficit. It is not realistic to expect that all the problems relating to school accommodation can be addressed immediately. The Government remains committed to continuing the work that it has started and to consolidating the substantial progress already made so that it may ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time. The process of investment in educational infrastructure begun by the previous Government will be continued as outlined in An Agreed Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>I will look closely at the potential for using PPP mechanisms and at the concept advanced in An Agreed Programme for Government of a multiannual schools' modernisation fund to be financed through the national development finance agency. I intend publishing my expenditure proposals for primary school buildings in the new year. My Department's website will be updated at regular intervals from that point on.</P>
    <P>In 1963 John F. Kennedy addressed us in this House and spoke about the problems of the world never being solved by sceptics or cynics whose horizons are limited. Today, those comments seem appropriate to a Fine Gael Party that could not bring itself to recognise the broad success of our primary education system. Worse still, it cannot manage a constructive suggestion among its 31 Deputies.</P>
    <P>The quality of our primary education system, and this Government's determination to continu<Col N="484" />ously improve all aspects of the system, will ensure that even more of our children will prosper in primary education. I am proud to be a member of a Government that has prioritised and invested extensively in education at this level. As Minister for Education and Science, it is my intention to continue to build on the progress which we have already made.</P>
    <P>I commend our amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I read through the Opposition motion in detail. It does not reflect well on the Opposition Members who proposed it nor does it reflect a need for parliamentary scrutiny of all debate here, particularly in regard to education. I was pleased to hear the Minister's point by point rebuttal of the Opposition's case. It must now realise that it has a weak case. I have yet to hear any Opposition Deputy put forward positive alternatives.</P>
      <P>I have 30 years service at primary school level and since 1985 I have had some responsibility for policy at post-primary level. I also spent some years on policy making at third level and have been involved in educational research. I have spent all my teaching career teaching in a disadvantaged area. Since the last Administration came to power in 1997 there has been a remarkable improvement in the level of resourcing of education, particularly at primary and post-primary level. I recall when education was governed by a Department of Education rule book which was updated annually by circular letter. The previous Government took the situation in hand, after many requests from many teachers' congresses, by bringing in an Education Act which now forms the firm foundation for an education system which is growing exponentially. However, that Act must be matched by a commitment of resources. I am very confident in that regard and very happy with the level of resources provided to education at all levels since my party came into Government in 1997. I also acknowledge that previous Governments made attempts to resource education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems in education over many years has been the lack of coherent planning. I welcome the fact that the present Minister for Education and Science and his two immediate predecessors have embarked on a coherent plan, focusing rightly on primary education and educational disadvantage. It is a sweeping generalisation to say that Irish schools have the largest classes and the least back-up services in western Europe. That assertion simply does not stand up. It is true that there are areas where, due to lack of co-ordination between local authorities and management bodies, there has not been sufficient planning for school buildings. Undoubtedly, there are large classes in those areas. However, there are other areas where class sizes are 20 and below. One sometimes wonders what is the optimum class size. When I started teaching, I had a class of 57 boys in third class and I do not pretend it was an easy or effective situation. I also taught <Col N="485" />a mixed sixth class of only 16 pupils but I believe my teaching was far more effective in classes with slightly larger numbers. I suggest there is an optimum number of approximately 20 at which teaching is more effective and the children interact with each other.</P>
    <P>In relation to back-up services, the national psychological service is still inadequate but it is building. There are problems with the National Education Welfare Board but it is in operation. I welcome the Minister's comments about a council for special education. Following all the discussion of recent years on special education, I commend the Minister for taking action. Twenty eight percent of children in Irish schools have special needs. Unfortunately, for a long time, there was no way of assessing children with special needs. I recall a time when one almost had to go on bended knee to the Department of Education for the establishment of a special class in a parish, let alone a school. We have come a long way and I commend the Minister, his predecessors and key Department officials for the manner in which they have moved forward.</P>
    <P>There are areas, such as autism, which are not yet adequately addressed. Integration of children with physical disability is progressing. The Minister cited the number of classroom assistants, resource teachers and other staff who have been made available. Although the numbers are quite large, they need to be increased. While this year's Estimates show many minus figures, there is a significant increase for resource teachers and special assistants &ndash; of the order of 98% if I recall correctly.</P>
    <P>With regard to the embargo on public service recruitment, I recall when primary teacher training was a two year programme. Thankfully, there is now a more enlightened approach and that needs to continue, with graduate entry to the profession at primary level and modular and weekend courses. Those developments need to be further expedited. As a result of the increasing number of non-national students in many of our schools, it is time to look at recognition of teachers trained in other EU member states and even outside of the EU, for reasons of language and other very good reasons. The number of teachers trained and on stream will more than counteract the demographic changes, which are actually levelling off, and will counterbalance the number of teachers retiring. We have a blip situation currently with regard to the number of primary teachers retiring. That arises from a decision taken 30 or 40 years ago to reduce the number of teachers in training.</P>
    <P>That part of the Opposition motion which, &ldquo;deplores the lack of Government commitment to tackle educational disadvantage,&rdquo; is simply not credible, having regard to the provisions which the Minister listed in his statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy aware of the number of parents who had to go to court regarding rights for their children with special needs? </P>

    <Col N="486" />
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. The Minister addressed that issue in his intervention tonight. With due respect to the Deputy's point, one could count with the fingers on two hands the number of parents who had to take that course. Educational disadvantage in this context relates to economic and social disadvantage. I realise there are other areas of disadvantage which also need to be addressed. I commend the former Minister and former Deputy Niamh Breathnach for her initiative on the Early Start programme, which has been built on by this Government. The Breaking the Cycle and Stay in School retention programmes are also making a huge impact and there are excellent pilot initiatives in many areas of the country, including one in Waterford underpinned by voluntary effort and one in central Dublin where religious orders and the local community have come together. There are clusters of schools throughout the country which are benefiting from such initiatives.</P>
      <P>I was involved in the early stages of research into reading standards in this country in 1967. At that time, nine year old students were regarded as being four years behind their counterparts in the UK in terms of reading standards, whereas we are now ahead as, indeed, we should be. That situation did not come about easily. It is due to such factors as the library initiatives and the Read Write Now initiative for parents. I do not pretend that we should be complacent about the level of resources being committed to education. However, it is wrong to decry the initiatives which have been taken and pretend nothing is happening in the area of educational disadvantage. It is a long time since the Van Lear foundation funded the Rutland Street project in the inner city in the late 1960s and early 1970s. People tend to forget the progress made in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition motion also speaks of, &ldquo;being appalled by the thousands of pupils and teachers who are forced to work in poor conditions.&rdquo;  I often wonder why boards of management allow their schools to deteriorate even though funding has been available through the devolved capital grants programme. In the 1970s, as I recall it, one could paint the outside of a school every seven years and the inside every ten years. That provision lapsed as, regrettably, did many other provisions. More recently, Ministers for Education and Science, including Deputies Martin and Woods, and now Deputy Dempsey, have developed the idea of giving money to boards of management to ensure that schools are not left unheated, rat infested or with damaged windows. In my constituency, there are small schools and large ones, old schools and new. Where there is a proactive board of management, working constructively with the principal, the parents association and the local community, there is an unparalleled programme in progress. In that regard, my constituency is in no way unique. There is a &euro;1.5 million programme of refurbishment under way in my local school which was built to very poor <Col N="487" />standards in 1973. It now needs an apex roof, new windows, double glazing and proper toilets, all of which are now being provided.</P>
    <P>Under the schools IT programme, every school, disadvantaged or otherwise, is connected to the Internet, involving a huge investment at primary and post-primary levels. We tend to be amnesiac in our comments on the quality of our education. The Opposition motion also alleges the Government has cut the budget for primary school buildings by almost &euro;70 million. Deputies opposite know the stages through which we have to go to get approval for a school building. My school was built in a quarry because it was the only place left after the builders moved out. This is an example of particularly bad planning, but it was not unusual.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister and his predecessors for the Commission on School Accommodation and Planning because we must have a focused, coherent plan. I welcome the listing of projects on the Department's website so that people know exactly where their school is in the queue. A Deputy might get kudos for telling constituents their school is top of the list but it also means another school has gone down the list. This system gives some objectivity to the system. I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Crowe, Harkin, Finian McGrath and Cowley. I heard a comment earlier in the debate that there could be an optimum size for classes, for example 20 pupils, in which to best teach average pupils from an average background. I hope the Minister and Deputies agree that students suffering from learning disabilities need as much focused support as possible. While I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Government and take on board the Minister's commitment to education, there is a collective Cabinet responsibility to ensure that there is sufficient investment in education. Unfortunately, this has not been the case. In this context, I support the motion tabled by Fine Gael which notes, for example, that Irish schools have some of the largest class sizes and fewest back-up services in western Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to recently, more than 400 schools were listed as being at architectural planning stage and remain as such. In my constituency, this applies to Scoil Bhríde, Palmerstown; St. Thomas's Junior School in Esker, Lucan; St. Mary's Junior and Senior Schools in Rowlagh, Clondalkin and St. Bernadette's Junior and Senior Schools in Quarryvale which were listed as being at architectural planning stage in April and remain at that stage. As the Minister said, in many cases the term architectural planning represents a holding phase. Many schools are in need of upgrading, refurbishment or new buildings. The devolved capital grants programme allows some leeway but there are some boards and principals allowing their schools to fall into disrepair in the hope it will <Col N="488" />speed up a new school building project. As the Minister has stated, that will not work.</P>
    <P>This budget shows that not enough is focused on the education sector. If we want disadvantaged children to have the opportunity to go on to second and third level education and contribute to the country economically &ndash; which is the only way Ministers seem to understand &ndash; the schools need to have the investment from an early stage. We need more investment in breakfast clubs. I heard a Fianna Fáil Senator on &ldquo;The Vincent Browne Show&rdquo; last night say her children do not eat the food available in the school. She asked why the food should be provided at all, but for many children from disadvantaged areas, a proper breakfast is the only meal they eat and anything that can be done to continue that and the other incentives the Minister has suggested for teachers in disadvantaged areas is welcome. Some work has been done but there is a great deal more to be done.</P>
    <P>Some 90% of crime in Dublin is, in some way, drug related. However, a heroin addict from Foxrock is less likely to engage in anti-social behaviour to pay for the habit than one from a disadvantaged area. Breaking the cycle early is of the utmost importance because a heroin addict from a disadvantaged area is more likely to get caught up in the poverty cycle and go to prison. Friends, colleagues and political associates of mine have all seen pupils at the age of seven whom they can pinpoint as ending up in prison. That is not good enough at such a young age.</P>
    <P>Education and welfare officers, making sure teachers give proper attention and providing food for children requires investment but the cost of a prison space is greater to the economy than the cost of breaking the cycle at an early stage. I implore the Minister to ask the Minister for Finance to give more emergency funding to schools building projects and other projects that are sorely necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF" hpid="Mr. Crowe Mr. Crowe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's statement regarding the historic under investment in the education system. Successive Administrations have left us with the problem and I do not blame it all on the current Minister. Like anyone listening at home, when Ministers talk in terms of remaining committed to solving something, I worry that we are hearing the usual political speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>OECD figures suggest that we have the worst pupil-teacher ratio in Europe and are among the bottom seven countries on pupil spending. At a recent INTO conference, Deputy Woods, the previous Minister for Education and Science, spoke about the 3,200 schools which are unsafe, posing a safety risk to pupils and staff. We all know schools with asbestos, where roofs are falling in or where teachers are trying to teach in corridors and I know of kids that have spent the entire of primary school in prefabs. The system is wrong and needs to be addressed. As Deputy Gogarty said, there must be collective responsi<Col N="489" />bility. There was an opportunity in the budget to invest more in education, health or housing but the decision was made that the less well off would suffer. School offers children the opportunity to break out of the cycle of poverty but resources are needed in the schools and it is not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>We have the overcrowded classrooms, yet the Government has indicated there will be an embargo on teachers which will cause further difficulties. We admit that 3,200 schools are unsafe and unhealthy yet the Government is cutting back on the programme of building and refurbishment. It is not right for Members on the Government side to be saying, &ldquo;Things are great and we will be investing in this,&rdquo; because we are tinkering with the system and are not coming to terms with the problem. Children are going to school hungry but when they get to school the building should be warm and safe, with no danger of the roof collapsing. We cannot be sure that will not happen, however, because such unsafe schools exist. The Minister is possibly doing his best to resolve the situation but more investment is required. That investment has not been forthcoming from the Minister for Finance and things will get worse rather than better. Government Deputies may put forward positive arguments but they know that primary school children are suffering in their constituencies.</P>

      <P>Like other Deputies, I attended many pre-election meetings where parents, teachers and school boards of management put forward strong arguments, and presented us with concrete evidence, as to why their local schools should receive money for refurbishment and upgrading. These people had lobbied for years while their children and teachers had to put up with substandard facilities and overcrowding. These conditions were totally inappropriate in a country that was supposed to be experiencing the effects of the Celtic tiger economy. In many cases the same people had been fund-raising in order to provide basic equipment, including sports facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own constituency, many schools have been disappointed when it came to funding. I will not go through the entire list of schools affected because it is too long, but I would like to mention a few examples. Huge efforts have been made by <Col N="490" />the local community to try to get Calry national school upgraded. With other public representatives, I attended meetings before the general election, yet the school is not on the list. The same situation pertains to Brockley national school in Coolaney.</P>
    <P>Prior to the election a certain Government Minister visited Ard Cairn national school in Riverstown and was pursued by photographers in a blaze of glory. Yet, those children are still sitting in substandard classrooms and there is no sight of any progress on the horizon.</P>
    <P>At a public meeting before the election, promises were made by a Deputy that Mohill national school would see work on the ground before Christmas, yet there has been no progress. The school has a leaking roof, cracks in the walls, and toilets that remain unchanged since the 1940s. Children are experiencing terrible conditions in Cornagee national school outside Dowra in Ballinaglera, and no progress has been made there either.</P>
    <P>Since last week's budget, I have listened to various Government Deputies lecturing us about taking the pain associated with cutbacks. I have a suggestion to make in this regard, however. The Minister for Finance should divert some of the money he is putting into the national pension fund to primary school infrastructure. It might seem prudent to put money away for pension funds but I would question that because we do not have the same demographic time-bomb that exists elsewhere. In the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe one third of the population is over 50 and a quarter is under 20. We have the opposite situation here, however, so we do not have an ageing population. Instead we have a young, active, wealth-creating population. Our birth rate has increased enormously to 60,000 per year, while the mortality rate is only 30,000. Coupled with inward migration we now find ourselves in a very different situation to some years ago. Therefore, the Minister should reconsider putting huge sums of money into a pension fund. Why not invest in capital projects for the primary school sector? That would be a much wiser investment for the future.</P>
    <P>As a teacher I commend the previous Government on the provision of resource teachers for children with special needs. That was a positive step but the current Minister should note that at least 10% to 20% of the present school population require learning support teachers. They are not getting them, however, and these children will fail without such provisions being made. I would ask the Minister to take this point into consideration during his term of office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
      <P>If one were to accept the wording of the 1916 Proclamation one would assume that the children of the nation would be treated equally. However, as in Orwell's <i>Animal Farm,</i> some children are treated more equally than others. It is a terrible indictment to hear Deputies describing the lack of primary school facilities in <Col N="491" />their own counties. This represents a terrible vista of neglect by successive Governments over the years, yet it looks like it is set to continue into the future. Since being elected to Dáil Éireann, I have tried to highlight the needs of schools in my area, and in particular the plight of those who must use these school buildings. There is an urgent need to repair, and in some cases, to replace schools. To say that there has been gross neglect of our national schools would be an understatement.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer specifically to some of the schools affected. I have been highlighting the case of Cooneal school in north Mayo, near Ballina, which is in a terrible condition with dampness, unsafe electrical fittings and heating systems. The school has been blacklisted as one of the worst in the country and is in urgent need of repair. All sanitary accommodation is substandard and the windows and doors are in a state of decay. The electrical wiring is substandard and in a very dangerous condition. Dampness and wall cracks abound. This case is typical.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that I have raised the case of Cooneal school on a number of occasions my remarks have fallen on deaf ears. Although the school building project went to the architectural planning stage some years ago, nothing has happened. Similarly, in Drumslide school in Ballycroy, dampness and poor conditions generally pose a hazard for the pupils attending. They are babes in arms who have just left their mothers; they have delicate chests, yet they are subjected to dampness every day. That is not right from any point of view. If they lived in such conditions at home I would be making representations to have something done about the dampness, their frequent colds and the asthma they suffer. However, this is happening in our schools all the time. Our children have every right not to have their health jeopardised in this way while attending school. They spend a lot of time at school, particularly in the winter months when the weather is at its worst, including increased damp conditions which can promote coughs and colds. Children do not need conditions to be made worse by attending an unsafe school. A new school is urgently needed to replace Drumslide school in Ballycroy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Scoil Íosa in Ballyhaunis, County Mayo &ndash; which was recently amalgamated &ndash; is a danger under the health and safety regulations. In my own village of Mulranney a terrapin school building is rotting away. A storm could easily blow the lot down on top of the young children. It has been repaired but a shell of plaster seems to be holding the structure together. The windows are in a terrible state but it would not be possible to repair them because they would fall apart if one even touched them. The school itself has a large crack running from the top of the building to the bottom, through which one can look outside. It lets in cold and damp, and while it lets in ventilation in the summer it is a health hazard in the winter. Teachers spend much time in the mornings mop<Col N="492" />ping up rain water on the floor, rather than taking the roll call. Dampness and leaking roofs are to be found everywhere in the school.</P>
    <P>Our young people are expected to use unsuitable schools, yet justice demands that they should enjoy warm and safe conditions. We demand safe conditions for people in the workplace, but what about our children? They are the most vulnerable of all and they should be entitled to attend safe schools at least. Crumbling schools and stop-gap pre-fabs are a damning indictment of the failure of successive Governments to invest adequately in our schools over the years. It is a gross understatement to say that these schools are past their best before date. It is a tragedy and a scandal that committed teachers, supportive parents and enthusiastic pupils are condemned to exist in such schools, which are hazardous. The Minister said he would like a transparent system where real need can be identified and prioritised. If the Minister wants clarity, he should come to Mayo and I will show him these schools, or rather crumbling, leaky, damp buildings which are more suitable as outhouses for cattle than for educating children.</P>

      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Wall.</P>
      <P>I congratulate my county colleague on his appointment as Minister for Education and Science and I hope he will bring about great change.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that the Minister has complained about the tabling of the motion because many of his colleagues congratulated us on it and agreed it was a good idea to have a debate on education. It is important to use Private Members' time to discuss relevant issues. Until the Dáil is reformed it is our best chance of having a good debate on a subject and making our points. It is our job to mirror the thoughts of people on the ground on various issues. Deputy Enright's motion does that quite well in summing up some of the problems. I hope we will have a healthy debate and offer positive suggestions, although it has been claimed that we are not being positive.</P>
      <P>We need to know where we are coming from in order to offer solutions. Parents are concerned about their children's health and education. Both are relevant to schools where minor problems could be fixed to improve the comfort of children at school. That is what parents are concerned about. The urgency about it is best summed up in some lists I have here. One refers to limited progress in a number of primary schools and consists of only two pages. Another refers to schools where progress is being made and consists of two sheets covering about 40 schools. However, the list of schools that are making no progress runs to 15 pages. There is, therefore, an urgent need to invest in primary education in particular and education in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was at the official opening of St. Oliver's Secondary School in Oldcastle during the week and gave a great speech on the future of <Col N="493" />education. It was wonderful to see what is happening there. Many of the children from first and second year were involved in sports, dancing and music. However, that involvement began at primary school and that is where it must start because primary school is the foundation of education. That is where we must invest in order to set children on the right road and give them the best chance but I fear we will slip up because of the problems in schools.</P>
    <P>They are not the Minister's fault. He has been only seven or eight months in office. The problem is one of neglect over the past 20 or so years on the part of various Governments, although it is important to note too that Fianna Fáil was involved in Government for 18 years. There is a history of neglect right across the board and that is what we must address. Sadly, not enough money was provided to solve all the problems in the next year or two, and I am greatly concerned about what will happen in the succeeding years because predictions are bad for the next three years or so. It is time to look at new ways of raising finance to solve the problems. That is what the Minister is here to do. Deputy Enright is a young person who has plenty of ideas about education. We are here to impart those and mark the Government's card.</P>
    <P>Finance is an issue in schools although not the only one. As this Government cannot provide the money to fix the schools, we need to find other ways of raising money. If we admit the funds are not there we can look at other alternatives. We have a great resource in all our communities in people who could actually build schools. Communities want to get involved. New public-private partnerships are involved in various projects. We should involve the local community in the areas affected. That is how schools were built hundreds of years ago. Everybody got together and contributed, but we are not giving people a chance to do that. Everyone pays tax and that is relayed back through the Department of Education and Science. Perhaps there might be a way to ring-fence some of that tax and put it into the local school where the benefits would be seen directly. Perhaps the Minister might consider approaching the Minister for Finance about that.</P>
    <P>If people see their money going directly into their school they will want to be more involved, and schools could be built for half the price if they were built locally because there would be no red tape. The era of volunteers is slipping away fast, but this would mean people would be more involved in maintaining their school and keeping it clean, and the children attending it would have more interest in it. We must first admit we have many schools that need attention and then look at new ideas.</P>
    <P>Children deserve to be given opportunities. As a councillor I had different types of offices and was often stuck in this or that corner of a room. Since I got my new office I am much happier going to work. It is much easier to work in a nice office that is clean, warm and comfortable. The <Col N="494" />same applies to children and schools. We should give them every opportunity and make school as comfortable as we can for them. They will then perform better in education. They will probably listen more carefully to the teacher and be more motivated. If the Minister's office was not nice he would not look forward to working in it. We owe it to our children to do the same for them.</P>
    <P>The size of classes consisting of children of the same standard of education is a problem. I understand the Minister intends to try to reduce class sizes from 35 to 29. I am more concerned about classes comprising children of different levels. When I came through the school system our class, which was a big one of 45, held together. However, in many schools where the number of teachers is reduced, children at different levels of education are being grouped together and that does not really work. That is an area where we could make progress.</P>
    <P>I want to see children getting the chances I got. The only problem I had with my education was having to spend four years in prefabricated buildings. In summer it was too warm; in winter it was too cold. If I wanted a day off I could complain that the school was not good enough. At many schools around the country there are four, five or six prefabricated buildings. This reduces the size of playgrounds. We need to move faster and address these issues. We need fresh thinking.</P>
    <P>Another problem is shortage of teachers and controlling classes. There are two approaches we can adopt. We need to address the issue of dwindling respect for teachers. If we can restore that pupils will learn more. Providing a good school is part of that process.</P>
    <P>Many people are willing to be involved in running schools and helping with sports. It is sad that nowadays because of the lack of a physical education curriculum in schools children of 9, 10 and 11 years of age do not react when a ball is thrown to them. In my parish, children of 10 years of age play football on the local football pitch and when a ball is kicked to them they do not know what to do. In terms of sport, children must start between the ages of five and nine years. Deputy Deenihan mentioned this last night. One must get children moving and thinking at that age so they will go on to greater things because sport is part of education. I hope we can develop this.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies English and Neville for sharing time with me.</P>
      <P>Over the last two evenings the Minister has heard much about the capital aspect of the problems facing the primary education sector. Every Deputy spoke about his or her own area and I will be no different. Many schools in Kildare need new buildings and extensions to existing buildings. The needs of Castledermot, Ballyshannon, Nurney and Brannockstown are particularly urgent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows the problems and has set up a website to deal with queries. When a parent <Col N="495" />comes to a public representative we can tell that parent to look at the Department's website to see the status of his or her school. This is an advantage. When people see the position of their own school on the Department's list a momentum is created and the board of management and parents can combine to progress the application.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take note of a number of specific cases. I listened to Deputy Carey talking about what boards of management are entitled to do and should do. I challenge anyone to identify a better board of management than that of Scoil Mhíchil Naofa in Athy, yet the school's problems are such that the board is crying everywhere for help.</P>
    <P>The school has a class for autistic children, who come from three different health board areas. Only one of the health boards provides a speech therapist. When she visits the class she deals only with the children from her own health board area and the children from the other two areas receive no therapy. I have asked parliamentary questions of the Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children and I hope common sense will prevail and the problem will be resolved. I ask the Minister to ensure this problem is resolved and that all the autistic children in this class benefit from the services of a speech therapist.</P>
    <P>An inspector from the Department visited the school and told the principal that the classroom in which the autistic children were being taught was a red alert area as far as the school's electrical system was concerned. This situation would not be acceptable in any part of the country, particularly when the children concerned are autistic and have problems in relating to the teacher and their special needs assistant. The Minister must look at this case.</P>
    <P>In reply to my questions the Minister has said the board of management must deal with the matter. The board of management does not have the money to deal with it and it is not feasible for it to do it. I ask the Minister to look at these two cases and to see if they can be resolved.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Enright on her initiative in raising this important issue. The question of investment in primary schools is of extreme concern. Promises were made &ndash; perhaps not overtly &ndash; to many schools during the general election campaign that they could expect the refurbishment or construction of their buildings.</P>
      <P>St. Nicholas's primary school in Adare is situated in an old Augustinian abbey. The children are accommodated in a 16th century building and a pre-fab. In 1999 the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, promised a new school for Adare. The children must use an outdoor toilet which is also used by some of the many tourists who visit Adare. There is concern about the safety of the children in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Scoil náisiúnta Dhrom Trasna in Abbeyfeale was a two teacher school in the 1980s. It is now a <Col N="496" />seven teacher school and in urgent need of extension. I know the Minister has examined this case but nothing is happening.</P>
    <P>I am also particularly concerned about Pallaskenry national school, which requested an extension in 1995. The pre-fabs in this school are supported internally by scaffolding because otherwise the roof would fall on the children. In this day and age it is unacceptable that children have scaffolding throughout their classrooms and must cross the yard to use the toilet.</P>
    <P>Kilfinane primary school in County Limerick was promised a new school some years ago but nothing is happening. I raised this case on two occasions on the Adjournment and was promised that something would be done. Recent Adjournment debates often do not refer to the matter raised in any case.</P>
    <P>In Kilcolman refurbishment and the extension of two classrooms was promised. Will this happen? It is urgently needed. Gaelscoil Uí Dhuibhir in Newcastle West is in need of comprehensive refurbishment. This has been promised but nothing is happening. Christ the Saviour national school in Ballingarry needs a GP room, a library, a resource teacher's room, a principal's office, storage facilities and a multi-purpose room. We do not know when these will be provided. Promises have been made but the Minister refers queries to the website. St. James's national school, Cappagh, is also in need of an extension.</P>
    <P>There has been no investment in Charleville Christian Brothers school in 40 years. Many children from Kilmallock and the surrounding area travel to this school. Three junior classes have been in pre-fabs for 15 years, the science laboratory is out-dated, there is no language laboratory, woodwork cannot be offered due to lack of facilities, there is no assembly hall or gym and there is a lack of space for physical activities.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties with regard to learning support teachers. In Kilfinane one learning support teacher travels between five different schools. Similarly, Scoil Íde Naofa in Raheenagh is served by a learning support teacher who serves four other schools. The brevity of her visits has forced the school into prioritising literacy help for those in most need and children with numeracy learning needs are not catered for. Is it fair that children who have special needs are not catered for?</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister last week to put on the record of the House the number of schools in my constituency which have applied for refurbishment grants. This simple question received a single line reply referring me to a website. I know how to access the website but I wanted the list of schools to be placed on the record of the House. The Minister avoided this by referring my query to the Department's website. Is this a fair way to answer a Deputy who wishes to place the needs of primary schools in County Limerick on the record of the House?</P>

      <P>The amendment to the motion before the House outlines the Government's excellent track record in increasing provision for primary education. Regardless of the views expressed by the Opposition in this regard, the advances made by the Government in providing for children in our primary schools cannot be denied. The advances have brought tangible benefits to children throughout the primary sector, especially those who have special educational needs and those who are most disadvantaged. The scale of additional resources, as well as their impact on class size and pupil-teacher ratios, bears this out. Some 2,900 additional teaching posts have been created in primary schools to reduce class sizes and to provide additional resources for children with special needs. The maximum class size has been reduced from 35 to 29 over the last five years and the overall pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools has decreased from nearly 22:1 in 1997 to 19:1 now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's commitment to the primary system has been demonstrated most graphically in its response to children with special educational needs. The 1998 decision that all children with special needs in the primary system should be entitled to an automatic response has transformed provision in this area. The Government has <Col N="498" />achieved significant increases in the numbers of special resource teachers, learning support teachers and special needs assistants employed in schools. These teachers are dedicated to ensuring that children with special educational needs gain the maximum benefit from education. We will continue to build on this progress through the establishment of a national council to deal with special education, the publication of legislation to clarify and confirm the rights and entitlements to an education service of persons with disabilities and the establishment of a framework to deliver the required services.</P>
    <P>Social inclusion is a key Government priority and its approach to tackling educational disadvantage has been framed within the context of the national anti-poverty strategy. The approach is based on a continuum of provision, from early childhood through adulthood, with a focus on preventative strategies, targeting and integrated community responses. We have set challenging and ambitious targets under the key headings of school literacy, adult literacy and school retention, designed to bring about an education system that allows all citizens to realise their full potential. As a result of the high importance attached to tackling educational disadvantage, the Government provided for the establishment of a statutory committee on such disadvantage under the Education Act, 1998, to advise on policies and strategies to be adopted to identify and correct educational disadvantage. The committee brings together experts from across the community of education interests and will be an important resource in ensuring that progress is made in this area. I certainly dismiss, therefore, any notion that the Government lacks commitment to tackling educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The level of investment provided for in the Estimates enables us to maintain existing services and to make progress in the primary and post-primary sectors. This will be done through increased provision for resource teachers and special needs assistants in primary schools and increased provision for school retention initiatives, including the school completion programme involving over 370 primary and post-primary schools in 82 clusters, with a 2003 budget of about &euro;23 million, up from &euro;15.4 million in 2002. The Giving Children an Even Break programme, which applies to 2,320 primary schools and involves the appointment of over 200 additional teachers, will ensure that maximum class sizes in junior classes in the disadvantaged schools with the highest proportion of disadvantaged pupils will be 20. Expenditure for this programme, combined with the resources dedicated to the Breaking the Cycle project, the support teacher project and the disadvantaged areas scheme, will be over &euro;36.7 million in 2003. There will be continued support for the home, school and community liaison service in primary and second level schools with designated disadvantaged status.</P>
    <P>In addition to these schemes and initiatives, there is a wide range of other supports including <Col N="499" />those for the children of Travellers, non-nationals and other vulnerable groups. I reiterate that the programme of capital investment in the primary sector will continue. Despite the huge increase in funding in recent years, there is a great level of demand due to an historical deficit. It is clear that all the problems relating to school accommodation cannot be addressed immediately, but the Government remains committed to continuing the work it has started and to consolidating the substantial progress made in meeting the needs of primary schools. The investment in educational infrastructure commenced during the previous Administration will be continued. The allocation of &euro;147 million will enable the consolidation of the progress that has already been made.</P>
    <P>The Government has massively improved the infrastructure, teaching resources and other services made available to primary schools. I assure the House that the Government is fully committed to continuing the enhancement of services in the primary sector and it will continue to do so, particularly for children with special educational needs and the most disadvantaged in society. I commend the amended motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share time with Deputy Enright, with the agreement of the House.</P>
      <P>As the future of Irish education is being debated in the House, I am disappointed that the Minister for Education and Science felt the need to be so defensive in his opening remarks. He accused Fine Gael of being negative, although I suppose he is entitled to be defensive in some respects. I commend, as others have done, the fantastic work done in our primary schools by teachers and others, but they need support. This is a competitive era in economic terms. In the 1960s, Fine Gael produced the Just Society document, which continues to be the basis for my party's policies to this day. I mention it because it recognised the importance of investment in education and many of the education initiatives of the 1960s sprung from the debate that took place as a result. I contend, however, that a new debate is needed &ndash; we need to debate the direction of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report produced by the Conference of Religious of Ireland in response to last week's budget shows the great gap that exists between the rich and the poor in our society. The gap can be seen in our education system. Fine Gael is putting down a marker for the Minister and the Government by making clear that it will not allow any drift where education is concerned. My party insists that education should be resourced and funded in a suitable manner between now and the end of the Government's term in office. The Minister and his colleagues have said that they did certain things in the Government's first term, but that was because plenty of money was available in 1997 after the rainbow coalition left office. As someone said earlier, there was a crock of <Col N="500" />gold at the end of the rainbow. After five years of a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Administration, however, the public finances have run into major difficulties and many people are worried.</P>

      <P>Much has been said in recent months about the Department of Education and Science's famous website. Deputies who have tabled questions seeking information for our constituents &ndash; parents, teachers and children &ndash; have been told to refer to the website. Why can the Department of Education and Science and the Minister not tell us, after all this time, when schools will be repaired or replaced? It is a simple request and taxpayers are entitled to a response to it. I am delighted that the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has apologised to my colleague, Deputy Neville, and to the House for the appalling answers Deputies receive to parliamentary questions. It is an appalling slur on parliamentary democracy that a Minister will not give a proper and civilised answer to a simple question.</P>
      <P>My colleagues have said that parents and teachers are working in very difficult conditions and they want to know when they will see improvements. The Minister has a duty to be in a position to tell the parents and students when this improvement can be carried out. It is a simple request. I am concerned about the state of the Department when it cannot even answer such a request. The Minister has his work cut out. He tells us that he will have this information available in detail by January. I welcome that. I look forward to it and support it. It is important for parents to get that information on time.</P>
      <P>In the committee last week the Minister and I discussed support services and special needs education. He said that, in Ireland, 11% of students in primary education require support services and special needs education. He maintained that the level in Europe was 3%. He then indicated that there was something wrong here. There is certainly something strange. There are statistics and statistics, but why is there such a difference? Perhaps we are being very generous and that is as it should be if the need is there. Maybe there are different ways of measuring. Maybe it is catered for by health in some countries while it is education here, I do not know. Has there been a major leap or explosion or was there always a problem which was not addressed in the past. I welcome the Minister's commitment to research this area and find out the problem. The figure of 11% needing special education seems to be very high. Maybe it should be higher but it needs detailed investigation and support. I support anything the Minister does in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The psychological services are another area where many children are waiting for assessment and help. A number of months ago I asked the Minister how many people were waiting and he was not able to tell me. He did not know and <Col N="501" />the national psychological service was not able to supply him with information on how many pupils are waiting for psychological assessment in school. How can you satisfy a need if you do not know the demand? I urge the Minster to ask his officials to find out the need. How many primary school children have psychologists on their waiting lists? It should be easy to find that out. When we know the problem we might be able to do something about it. I will be asking questions again in the next few months because it is a very serious issue. I know, as do my colleagues, that there are children awaiting psychological assessment who have been told that it will be a long time before they receive it. That is not good enough and we need to have facts and figures.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the growing tendency on the Government side to blame boards of management. They are doing the best they can. If there are boards of management that are doing something wrong it should be sorted out. I do not accept Members on the Government side blaming them. Many of these people work in a voluntary capacity to better the schools. The Minister should not blame someone else for failings in the Department and the Government. It is not good enough. Let us stop doing that and commend members of boards of management who are working in a voluntary capacity for the good of the school, the pupils and the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey said that he could count on one hand the number of court cases taken. In 1998 there were 38 cases before the High Court relating to action on behalf of people diagnosed as autistic. The previous Government dragged parents of autistic children into court. That should stop. I invite the Minister to visit the CABAS school in Cork, if he has not done so already. It is an eye-opening experience and an excellent school. However, there is a fear that there will be cuts in services there.</P>
    <P>Many of the schools that we are concerned about were built in the 1970s and contain asbestos. It will require much money and maintenance to upgrade them and I urge that this programme be speeded up. We must also ensure value for money. I do not think that the public private partnership will give this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG" hpid="Ms Enright Ms Enright">
      <NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Members for their contributions to this motion. The Minister made comments about the newer members of Fine Gael being led up the garden path by other members of the party. That should be refuted outright. Deputy Stanton and I set the education policy for Fine Gael. We make the decisions in consultation with our party. It is also wrong for the Minister to come into the House and criticise any Member for using Private Members' time to raise urgent and important issues. Unlike the Minister, we discuss the issues and try to raise them in the House. We do not run to the front pages of the national newspapers with kite-flying exercises concerning every issue in the Department of Education, as he is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="502" />It is time that everyone here faced some facts. I do not deny the truth in some of what was said by the Government parties on education. There has been progress in some areas. We cannot use the phrase which was much used this year, a lot done. That would be exaggeration. It is more a case on the Government's side of picking out a few good bits of news and hoping to hide behind them. That will not work any more.</P>
    <P>We heard much in the last two nights about pupil/teacher ratios, class sizes and statistics. I quoted statistics last night from the Department of Education and Science. They showed that 125,000 school children are in classes of 30 or more. One quarter of a million are in classes of between 20 and 29. Deputy Carey talked tonight about the optimum class size being 20 and we were doing well on that. Less than 20% of primary school children are in class sizes of fewer than 20 pupils. That is the reality.</P>
    <P>Members of the Government parties clap themselves on the back for the provision of services to schools in disadvantaged areas and yet one of their first steps was to cut the schemes directed at disadvantage. The Minister's commitment was displayed by his actions. Every year 800 children leave school after their primary education. The Minister failed to increase the back-to-school allowance for under 12s as if they do not need the same clothes and shoes as children over that age.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey mentioned the national education welfare board. It exists but is not working yet. He mentioned children being assessed by NEPS and yet Deputy Stanton highlighted the delays and difficulties being experienced there. Deputy Carey used the phrase &ldquo;all moving along&rdquo;. These schemes are moving as fast as traffic in Dublin on a Monday morning.</P>
    <P>The Minister has ignored the massive increases in charges for insurance, heating oil and cleaning costs which schools will face because of the increase in VAT. Schools must fork out for these increases and there is no increase in funds for the day to day cost of running primary schools. No matter what area of primary education we wish to provide for, it requires proper and adequate facilities. I do not blame the Minister for that, it is the responsibility of successive administrations. We know who has been in Government for the longest time over the past number of years. Nobody expects every school to be completed overnight. What we do expect is a clear, coherent strategy for tackling the issue, with fairness and equity as the cornerstones. That is what we want and require. The expectation which was created in relation to school buildings was created by Members on the opposite benches during the general election. That is the reality.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Government to social and educational policy is to view it as a burden on the State's finances. It has failed to view education as a vital part of our infrastructure and feel it is better to invest in foreign stock markets than in our education system. We will all pay for this short-<Col N="503" />sighted attitude. Instead of a coherent and planned approach to education at all levels it is treated as if the three sections of primary, secondary and third level are totally alien to each other and not interconnected. The Minister tries to heap on charges in one area, like third level, as a way to pay for another area. This is not acceptable either. Article 42.4 of the Constitution requires the State to provide for free basic and elementary education for all of our children.</P>
    <P>In last year's High Court judgment in Sinnott <i>v.</i> the Minister for Education and Science, which I know was overturned, but not on the grounds I am about to mention, Mr. Justice Barr said that <Col N="504" />education constituted giving each child such advice and instruction in teaching as would enable him or her to make the best possible use of his or her inherent and potential capabilities &ndash; physical, mental or moral. With class sizes way beyond what is required to help a child achieve his or her maximum potential, schools without physical education facilities, children squashed into over-crowded, damp classrooms, filthy toilets, leaking roofs, no facilities for specialist teachers to work from, by any standards the Minister has failed this test. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I complimented the Minister on the disregarding of the first &euro;420 for a couple in the means test for a carer's allowance. It is a positive move that will mean that more people will qualify for the allowance, thus maintaining more people in their own homes for as long as possible. This is one of my pet subjects and I feel that every help should be given to people to stay in their own homes. I have nothing against nursing homes but older people like to stay in their own homes and I hope this will continue to be Government policy.</P>
      <P>The respite grant has been increased to &euro;735. This is a help for carers because it will give them a break from caring. Also, the hearing aid grant has increased by &euro;350 to &euro;700. All of this proves that the Minister cares and that this budget has protected the weaker sections of society. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>If that money had been spent in an area that required &euro;19.5 million, there would be many happy faces in the run up to Christmas.</P>
      <P>Many people in Wexford depend on the carer's allowance and the amount given last weekend will not help them. These people look after the elderly in their own homes but the increase granted to them, once inflation is taken into account, is very disappointing. The huge number of carers were not recognised. I wonder if this Government has ever noticed them.</P>
      <P>This budget is anti-social welfare recipient. It shows who this Government looks after. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. I tried to stand up for the Minister in my clinic on Saturday. I told people she is a lovely lady but they did not listen to me. Increases in social welfare payments of between &euro;6 and &euro;10, with inflation running at 5% and food prices spiralling out of control, are an attack on the most vulnerable. There was also a 1% increase in VAT, alongside increases in ESB prices, the cost of heating oil and other necessities those on social welfare require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes to the back-to-work scheme are the greatest load of codswallop I have ever heard. I have never seen such rulings. A person must be <Col N="509" />out of work for five years now to qualify for the scheme as opposed to the previous 15 months. We are supposed to be encouraging people back into work. I hope those people beside the Minister are not her spin doctors because I would get rid of them fairly quickly. She is being led up the garden path. She should go back to the Department after this debate and ask them to go back to the original rule.</P>
    <P>I looked at the report published by CORI before I came to the House. It is not a happy organisation. It is disgusting to see an unemployed couple with one child being 25 cent better off. If I gave 25 cent to a child going into a shop he or she would throw it back at me. If I saw a man in the street with a plastic cup in his hand, I would give him 25 cent because it is only loose change.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had her fair share of cutbacks in the recent past. The rent supplement was increased by only &euro;6, when rents are getting out of control. A lady came to my clinic on Saturday and the cheapest one bedroom apartment she could find cost &euro;135 per week. I went to look at it and it was in appalling condition. I would not have allowed a dog live in it. The Minister would not accept that an unmarried mother could go into it with a three month old baby. She had to leave her house because her parents had a big enough family without keeping the unmarried girl in the family home. I was disappointed to see this happening.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to get her house in order. Widowers under the age of 66 should have got the same increase as other widowers. I welcome the &euro;11 increase but these people have only been awarded a &euro;7 increase. Widowers are being badly treated by the State and I hope the Minister does something about it. A widow or widower should be allowed to retain the free schemes that applied to his or her spouse before his or her death. People under 60 should be allowed this for a year or two.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the carer's allowance and the national fuel allowance. I was disappointed there was no change in the national fuel scheme this year, particularly with the bad weather. The amount of money people get from the scheme is tiny. Elderly people should be well looked after. The Minister got a roasting in the past week over what was done with social welfare in the budget. I know she does not need heat in her home because the roasting she got in the House and from her constituents is enough. Deputy Ring has given the Minister a fair roasting in the past couple of days and will continue to do that.</P>

He had to get seven letters stating that he was looking for work. I wrote to the local social welfare office to try to get his allowance back. There were so many letters involved between those I wrote and those he received that he could have had three or four weeks' social welfare payments before he was finished.</P>
      <P>The Minister should look back at what she did in last week's budget. She should go back, make the right decisions and look after the most vulnerable people, those on social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kehoe is a hard act to follow. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. There is no doubt that this Bill, with the budget introduced last week by the Minister for Finance, is another round of the stealth cuts we have seen. These cuts hurt the old, sick and handicapped. The cutbacks this year and in the Estimates for 2003 can be seen in the lack of resources for the physically and mentally disabled. There is a lack of resources in the health service where cutbacks have taken place over recent months and now the Minister for Social and Family Affairs is bringing forward this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kehoe made the important point that &euro;19.5 million has been spent on public relations <Col N="511" />for the PPS number. That works out at several million euro per number. Money is being squandered but measly funds are provided in the Bill before us. An example is the carer's allowance which Deputy Callanan spoke about. The paltry increase of &euro;7 will not even keep it in line with inflation when the rate of 4.5% is taken into account for the current year and 6% next year, as was admitted by the Minister for Finance this week.</P>
    <P>What is the excuse for the paltry increase in the rate of social welfare? It is the economy, stupid. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs or the Minister for Finance should explain what is wrong with the Irish economy, which is growing at 3.3%. What is wrong with the European economy which is growing at about half that? What is wrong with the US economy which is also growing, if perhaps at a slower rate than in the past? All three major economies this country relies on are expanding yet we hear the traditional tripe from the Government that the economy is the reason for the stealth cutbacks. The economy is growing; the problem is that this Government cannot manage the money being taken in and the money being spent. Because of that, the most vulnerable in society will have to pay dearly for this legislation.</P>
    <P>Rent are being hiked up across the country. As Deputy Kehoe said, there is accommodation offered that would not house pigs, never mind human beings, yet it is rented for &euro;135 per week. Despite that, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has increased the threshold at which the rent allowance kicks in.</P>
    <P>On top of the additional charges and the hikes in rent, a further hike has been put in place. The Minister for Finance increased the rate of VAT which increases the cost of telephones, electricity and heat, whether oil, coal or briquettes, yet the Minister for Social and Family Affairs gave not one cent in the fuel allowance to compensate for the hike in the VAT rate. Again, it is the most vulnerable in society that are subventing this budget and Government. They are losing out with regard to the Bill before us and due to the policies of this Government.</P>
    <P>The cutbacks that have taken place to date will impact on a typical household in 2003 to the tune of &euro;1,787. The average household will be that much worse off because of the budget and the cutbacks since this Government was returned to office. It is well known that the rate of inflation is increasing dramatically and that makes people poorer. What has the Government done to address that? Children's allowance has been increased in real terms by 54 cent per week, which will not succeed in cancelling out the 1% increase in the VAT rate. Children are worth 54 cent to this Government. The failure to increase child dependent allowance is another example of the actions of a Government which claimed it would support young families. At the other end of the scale is the dependent allowance for those <Col N="512" />over 80 years which has not been increased by even one cent above the rate for those between 65 and 80. It is another example of a stealth cut by this Government. It has clawed back money from the most vulnerable in society, many of whom do not cast their votes and, therefore, do not register the hatred they feel toward the policies of this Government over the past five years.</P>
    <P>Over the coming year, many more people will be forced to call on the expertise of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service. The difficulty a great number have in surviving is something I am sure the Minister sees in her own constituency. Many are forced to borrow, especially at Christmas, as Deputy Keogh said, if they want to see Santa Claus. Despite the fact that these people will have to turn to MABS next year, the Minister has cut its budget by 8%, or 12% in real terms regarding the level of service provided in the past.</P>
    <P>With this budget, the single person who is long-term unemployed is &euro;6 per week better off while those earning &euro;25,000 are &euro;23 better off. A person earning &euro;50,000 per year will be &euro;32 better off thanks to this Government. These trends are repeated regarding couples with a single earner, couples who are long-term unemployed and couples with double incomes. The differential increases every time and those who have benefited most over the past five years of Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats budgets have been the best off. High income earners are the ones to benefit most when the Minister knows as well as I do that most of them could not give a damn about being a few euro a week better off. For someone on the minimum wage or a social welfare payment those extra few euro could have a significant impact on their quality of life. It is a damning indictment of the policies of this Government over the past five years. Sadly, the Minister for Finance has repeated the same measures in this budget. I feel sorry for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs who must try to defend this while doling out the usual tripe that social welfare recipients are better off. Telling a family that they are better off regarding children's allowance by 54 cent per week, typifies the meanness of this Government.</P>

      <P>It is a privilege and an honour for me to make my maiden speech in the House this evening. Fianna Fáil strives for a society in which all citizens receive an equal opportunity to realise their full potential. Our aim is an Ireland in which gender, race, creed and economic and social background are not barriers to advancement. That is what moulds our social policy, that is our guiding principle. It is a vision which has shaped the party's policies in Government. Our republican beliefs are based on two fundamental prin<Col N="513" />ciples in respect of the relationship between Government and society and the citizen. Unlike the Thatcher-style conservatives, we believe in society and community. People are not simply self-interested individuals which is why Government must play a role in ensuring the welfare of all in society. That is the reason I joined Fianna Fáil. It is the reason I stood for Mayo County Council in 1999 and the reason I am proud to represent the people of Mayo to whom I am grateful for affording me the opportunity to stand here.</P>
      <P>We have achieved a great deal. Fianna Fáil is committed to balancing the welfare of society and the rights of families and individuals. Each of our budgets has been characterised by measures which were designed to improve the circumstances of the most vulnerable. As a democratic society, we have a responsibility to care for older people, children and others who are in need of support. With that in mind, the social welfare improvements in this year's budget were costed at &euro;530 million. The figure stands in stark comparison to the &euro;273 million provided under the rainbow coalition's last budget in 1997.</P>
      <P>I am particularly delighted that the Ministers for Finance and Social and Family Affairs safeguarded social welfare payments in the budget for the coming year. It is fitting that the generation that worked so hard to build a strong economy is being given priority with the significant boosting of pension rates. To continue our commitment to older people and maintain our record of putting older people first to ensure they live a life of dignity, we have increased the old age pension by 59% during our term of office. The increase of &euro;10 per week in this budget puts us well on the way to meeting our election promise to bring the State pension to &euro;200 per week. I am sure this Government will deliver on that commitment. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs was conscious of the hardship experienced by widows and widowers in terms of contributory pensions for those aged over 66 years when she sanctioned an increase of &euro;11 in their weekly pensions. It was correct of the Minister to increase the deserted wives benefit for those aged 66 and over by the same amount and to increase invalidity pensions for those under 65 by &euro;7 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once again this Fianna Fáil led Government has proved its commitment to the family, recognising it as the core of society. Despite the troubled economic environment, this budget has provided further increases in child benefit. It will be increased by &euro;8 per month for the first and second child and by &euro;10 for the third and subsequent children. In other words, parents will receive &euro;125 for each of the first two children every month and &euro;157.30 for the third and subsequent children. When we returned to Government in June 1997, child benefit was payable at a measly rate of &euro;38.09 per month for the first and second children and at &euro;49.52 for the third and subsequent children. The prioritising of the family by the Fianna Fáil Government cannot be <Col N="514" />denied. It has ensured that child benefit payments actually make a difference in contributing to the expenses of every parent. Child benefit is an essential support for families with dependent children. It takes the sting out of child care costs and contributes to food and clothing bills. It is a key instrument for tackling child poverty. This universal payment, essential to assist parents to support their children without being stigmatised, has proved to be the most successful method of supporting children without contributing to work disinterest or poverty traps.</P>
    <P>In budget 2001, the Government announced its intention to allocate a staggering &euro;1.27 billion in increased child benefit and we have achieved over two thirds of the objective already. As a result, Fianna Fáil has more than trebled the payment rates. We also introduced a range of other social welfare improvements including a further easing of the home income disregard for carer's allowance to benefit 3,400 new carers and 2,300 existing ones. The increase in the annual respite care grant brings the payment to &euro;500 and there has been a 20% increase in the number of free units granted under the free electricity allowance. There has been a relaxation in the qualification criteria for the free telephone allowance. The free travel companion pass has been extended to invalidity pensioners. The income threshold for family income supplement has been increased to bring the average payment to recipients up to around &euro;59 per week and the earnings disregard for recipients of disability allowance has been increased.</P>
    <P>Continuing to invest in health and education is central to this Government's policy even during a global economic downturn. We will press ahead with the infrastructure which is so badly needed. All of this will be done without being reckless with taxpayers' money and without spending more than we can afford. Fairness and prudence are at the heart of this budget. I congratulate the Minister on her first budget in the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>I join my colleague in complimenting the Minister. It is her first budget in the ministry and she is certainly in touch with those she represents and has displayed that already. Much of the criticism directed at her today, and many of the figures trotted out, came directly from the well-produced budget analysis by CORI. While it has been used extensively I am surprised nobody has quoted from page three of its analysis. The whole premise of the argument is set out in the third item in that page which states clearly, in a banner headline, &ldquo;Ireland is a too low tax economy&rdquo;. It has been denied by the Opposition but this reinforces the fact that Ireland has evolved into a low tax economy. Latest figures from the OECD confirm that the Irish Government now gathers a lower proportion of gross domestic product in tax than any other European country. Indeed, across the 30 OECD countries it is the third lowest. It quotes Michael L. Collins, <Col N="515" />an expert on the economy, who stated in an article that it is highly unlikely that any significant impact would arise for the economy if the tax burden was slightly increased above its current level. That depends on one's interpretation of &ldquo;slightly&rdquo;. The document goes on to state that Ireland may wish to retain its international position as a low tax economy but currently we are a too low tax economy.</P>
      <P>I did not hear anybody quoting from that part of the document and subscribing to the sentiments expressed in it. I am glad we are continuing to proceed on these lines and looking after the taxpayer. During the past five and half years we have witnessed the most dramatic changes in the area of social welfare and the many other areas that affect us all, including, in particular, the important issue of income taxation. It is crucial that everybody gets enough money to live on. Those who are earning must pay for those who are not earning.</P>
      <P>It is important that our young people are not driven out of the country by being over-taxed. I have previously given an example from my own experience, namely, that for the last year I worked in Irish Steel before coming to this House I was paid 67% during stoppages out of which I had to feed nine people. According to the definitions used here I would have been wealthy but, of course, I was not. I am glad Fianna Fáil got a grip on that issue.</P>
      <P>During recent months I have read the comments of some Opposition Members who claim that this Government, over the previous five years, squandered much public finance. In a chart used by one of its Members, the areas quoted include the squandering of &euro;22.6 billion on social welfare, including the increase for the elderly and the trebling of child benefit, as mentioned by my colleague, Deputy Carty. Also included in that criticism was the placing of funds in the pension reserve fund, an area that Ministers over the past 20 years described as a powder keg waiting to explode if action was not taken speedily to protect the future payment to pensioners. If that is an accurate description of our activities on this side of the House I can only ask the Minister and our colleagues to squander a good deal more on behalf of the elderly and the children of the country. Fianna Fáil can always be counted on to protect the lowly and the disadvantaged. I expect to see that pattern continued by my colleague the Minister, Deputy Coughlan. She has a complete grasp of her brief and long may that continue. It is important that each Minister is in touch with the difficulties being faced by the people.</P>

      <P>&mdash;when, despite three failed attempts, we joined with the workers and the employers to face a more prosperous State. Hopefully, we will do so again over the next couple of months. It was Fianna Fáil who promoted the idea of joining the EEC and worked on it. Ireland was one of the poorest countries at that time within the Community. One cannot argue with figures and facts. However, we have turned things around to the extent that we are being quoted in CORI. I am glad we are being quoted as being one of the countries not taking much tax off workers. What was happening was a disgrace. I am proud that we are republicans. We have always wanted an equal Ireland where the poor can obtain the best service.</P>

      <P>We wanted jobs, a decent wage and good housing and that is what we still want. People shout when we mention that 300,000 additional jobs were created and that unemployment was more than halved to about 4.5%. My colleagues on Cork City Council worked on trying to get employment schemes going locally.  We did not think long-term unemployment could be cut by 80% but it was. Long may that continue.</P>
      <P>The national debt was reduced from 74% to 36%. Deputy Durkan, if I am not mistaken, was a Minister of State when we were technically bankrupt and the moneyed people of Europe were coming in. Our debt was at 126% of GDP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>Nearly &euro;5 billion in personal income tax and PRSI reductions were delivered in the five budgets. Deputy Kehoe as a new Member may not remember the last five but I hope he reads up on them. As the Minister for Finance said, this is the first of five budgets. People rolled in the aisles when he announced his first budget. The second year it was less noisy and the third year there was not even a chuckle. People accepted he was right and was delivering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national pensions reserve fund was established. That was an important move and took a lot of courage. Most other Ministers down the years would have spent the money on today's issues and said to hell with the future pensioners. To date, &euro;8 billion has been invested in that fund. Deputy Lynch will agree with me that at conferences we attended we were told that Ministers were waiting to explore that area. This Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, took on the issue <Col N="519" />and there will be money there for the people when they need it.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Durkan knows, last May under the leadership of the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, we got a renewed mandate. We are determined to continue the pro business policies which in turn create the revenue to support our record increase in social welfare over the last five years. Our commitment is to keep conditions suitable for increased investment and job creation until the upturn in the world economy occurs. The facts support us. Many people have already mentioned that &euro;530 million will go to social welfare improvements this year. Young Deputies like Deputy Kehoe would not even know what the figure for child benefit was in 1977. I will get it for him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>This &euro;530 million means that social welfare expenditure next year will be almost double the level set by Labour and Fine Gael when last in Government. As a result of changes made in last year's budget all social welfare increases are paid with effect from 1 January. In the Fine Gael and Labour Government one of the damning proposals was the movement of the increased payments to September. I hope the people with the calculators will factor that in when making calculations.</P>

      <P>I will share time with Deputies Lynch, Wall and Gilmore.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dennehy is normally sensible and keeps his feet on the ground. Things may be different in Cork but I suspect not. Perhaps Deputy Lynch will correct us in a few minutes. Let me remind Deputy Dennehy that there are a lot of people in the country who have been given a paltry increase of &euro;6 in their basic social welfare income. That brings them up from &euro;118.80 a week to &euro;124.80 per week. These are people on disability allowance, unemployment assistance and basic widow's non-contributory pension. I would have thought Deputy Dennehy would be concerned about these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we divide the allowance into what people are getting per day it is a mere &euro;17.83 per day. Any<Col N="520" />body who has gone shopping lately knows that one cannot buy much for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister probably has someone shopping for her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably. From that &euro;124.80 people have to pay for foodstuffs and local authority rents, which will probably increase in the new year. They will have to pay the extra 1% on the basic VAT rate on their fuel allowance which has not increased at all. Their TV licence went up today and bus fares have also gone up. They will not be too concerned about the car tax as most of them cannot afford cars. These people are trying to live on a basic amount of money. It is appalling that we expect people to live on that kind of money. The Minister must agree with me on that.</P>
      <P>We need to look at the reality. We tend to talk in large figures here as Deputy Dennehy did in regard to social welfare. This basic figure of &euro;124.80 is what people are trying to live on. If people try to spread the extra &euro;6 per week around the various increases they will not be able to meet their basic household bills at the end of the week. That is without paying any regard to inflation. We are not speaking about luxuries or Christmas shopping here, just the basics. We need to look at this issue in the context of our priorities. Not alone in the last budget, but in those over the last five years, there has been an emphasis on looking after the better off. No thought has been cast to the shopping baskets of people on basic incomes.</P>
      <P>We can look similarly on the child benefit increase of &euro;2 per week for the first two children. That amount would not buy a loaf of bread and a carton of milk. These sums are infinitesimal in terms of the costs people must bear. Despite cutbacks this year we are a rich country. In a time of such plenty the fact that we cannot afford to give a better basic increase to people is a scandal.</P>
      <P>There has been no increase in the back to school clothing and footwear allowances for those under 12. While the cost of clothes and shoes go up people are expected to pay for them from the same amount of money as last year. That is shameful.</P>
      <P>A recent announcement was that the back to work allowance was to be cut from the current length of time to five years unemployed. That is a severe hardship for those who are unemployed through no fault of their own and who are trying to get back to work. Again, it is shameful that this allowance which they had as an incentive and support is now being cut back. We have heard fine talk about looking after the less well-off and the disadvantaged but the reality is different.</P>
      <P>In the area of education, primary school building programmes have been cut back and frozen. Nothing is happening at the moment and schools that were promised by Ministers and Deputies before the election that work would be done have heard nothing. They do not know where they stand now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="521" />The entirety of what we have been presented with in Deputy McCreevy's second book is unacceptable. It is unbalanced in terms of its concession to the better off and its lack of consideration of the real financial burdens of people on basic incomes. I would have expected better.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that Deputy Carty has left the Chamber as I wished to compliment him on his maiden speech which was typical of a Fianna Fáil mission statement.

He must have realised by now that Fianna Fáil does not stand for any of those ideals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Ms Lynch Ms Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir. Deputy Carty referred to the achievement of Fianna Fáil's promise to increase the old age pension to &euro;200. The figure was not &euro;200 but £200, which equates to &euro;254. The increases which this Minister has given to the poorest in society will ensure they will face this Christmas cold and without sufficient supplies to meet their needs. I challenge the Minister &ndash; and if she takes it up, I will undertake it with her &ndash; to live on &euro;134 per week in the circumstances in which unemployed people find themselves. Let me give her some idea of what it is like to be unemployed. It is not just a daily grind but rather a year-round grind. The unemployed become very good at planning how to live on that amount of money, whether they are single or married with or without children. They make a list each week in preparation for their shopping on the day their dole or disability payment is made. They are confined to that list, with absolutely no flexibility. No matter what the bargain of the week may be, they cannot avail of it if it does not fit into the list.</P>
      <P>That is how poverty affects people. In September, one starts to plan for Christmas, buying little bits and pieces from week to week. By the time Christmas comes, there is not a penny left in the house and one is desperately hoping there will be enough to keep going. From January onwards, the money goes on fuel. While the children are at school, regardless of how cold it may be, the fire remains unlit until about three o'clock, just before the children arrive home. People go hungry in order to feed their children. Come May, one starts to prepare for the return to school in September. Recently, a woman showed me the receipts for her outlay of &euro;500 on basic clothing, not expensive brand names, for two children. That is in addition to the cost of fulfilling the normal Christmas expectations of her children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="522" />Three years ago, the cost of home heating oil doubled in price in the space of one year and, as a result, the Government's fuel tax revenue also doubled. I pleaded with the Minister of the day to hand back that money in some form in order to ensure that the elderly would not have to stay in bed until midday to stay warm. Those are the realities of life. Yet, Deputy Dennehy has said all is well in the republic of Cork. I know of an elderly Corkman &ndash; he should also be known to Deputy Dennehy &ndash; who, according to his doctor and specialist, should be in hospital but is still desperately seeking a bed in the constituency which the Minister for Health and Children represents. Conditions are not good in Cork. The situation is no better than it was at any time. One cannot live on the amount of money which currently goes to the unemployed. It is adding insult to injury to tell them they are well-off.</P>
    <P>Two years ago, the Taoiseach said he would ensure that widows were provided for in the following budget. Yet, young widows are left in an appalling plight, having to look after children on a miserable income. They should be allowed the same secondary benefits as widows over 66. The lack of attention to their plight is disgraceful. I repeat my challenge to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. If she will try to live at the social welfare income level for one week, I will do likewise. However, I guarantee that she will not be able to do so.</P>

      <P>The Minister has laughed and joked shamefully to the point of embarrassment during this debate. Does she realise this is the most important Bill to pass through this House for the poor of this country? Her performance indicates that she does not care. Last night, in streets adjacent to this building, I saw many people huddled in doorways under cover of cardboard boxes. In that context, it is relevant to recall the action of this Minister in capping rent subsidy. As a result of her decision, there will be even more people in those doorways during the coming months. Yet, she has laughed and joked during this debate as if nothing mattered. She was afraid, or lacked the courage or determination to cap rents, place the burden of responsibility on landlords and protect poor people trying to live in rented accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those people are in a desperate position as Christmas approaches and what the Minister has given them in the recent budget will make no difference. They will still have to gather up their pieces of cardboard each morning and put them by for the following night. The cap which the Minister has placed on rent subsidy will ensure that they remain in their present plight, with no prospect of obtaining rented accommodation and restoring some sense of pride to their lives. Yet the Minister has laughed and joked during the <Col N="523" />debate on the most important Bill to pass through this House before or after Christmas.</P>
    <P>In relation to the carers' allowance, the most important people to the disabled are the mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters who care for them at home in the absence of any other facility. Nothing has been done to alleviate that problem, despite repeated promises by Fianna Fáil in Government. That neglect will continue because the Government knows those people will always care for their own. Is there no responsibility on the Government of the day to improve the financial position of those people? Instead of taking that responsibility seriously, this Minister has laughed and joked at the expense of the poorest in our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is sad to see Fianna Fáil Members clutching at one issue or another to justify their claim that this budget and Social Welfare Bill protect the poorest in our society. It is also sad to listen to Deputies Dennehy and Carty struggling with their republican consciences to find some ideological justification in the dim and distant past for what is an appalling Social Welfare Bill. Earlier today, I listened to Deputy Ellis almost getting excited about widows over 66 getting &euro;1 extra more than everybody else. What he did not tell us was that widows under 66, in many cases with young families and all the financial commitments that go with running a household, are getting the princely sum of &euro;6 in the budget &ndash; the same as the basic increase in social welfare. If these people were getting &euro;6 extra, it would be one thing, but they are not and that is the con in this budget because the &euro;6 will be clawed back.</P>
      <P>Anyone in local authority housing will have to pay a rent increase in February or March which will claw back the bulk of that and anyone in private rented accommodation has already had it clawed back because the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has increased the personal contribution required from people on rent allowance from &euro;7.62 to &euro;12 &ndash; an increase of &euro;4.38. That leaves someone getting an increase of &euro;6 in the Social Welfare Bill at the lowest rate with a net increase of &euro;1.62.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the rent allowance provision was first announced, I thought the Minister intended to cap the maximum rent allowance and, if rent was increased over that, people could still get rent allowance &ndash; just not as much. That would have been bad enough because it exposed poor people <Col N="524" />to paying higher rents to private landlords but what the Minister has done is worse than that &ndash; one of the clauses in the regulations she has made states:</P>
    <P>A rent supplement shall not be payable where the amount of rent exceeds the appropriate maximum amount of rent as determined under paragraph (<i>g</i>) of sub-article 2.</P>
    <P>In other words, if the rent payable goes over the maximum permitted by the health board, people will not get rent allowance at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what is in the regulation and that is the interpretation I have been given by staff who work in the community welfare service of the health boards. The case will arise where a landlord increases the rent over the maximum allowed and the community welfare service of the health board will withdraw a person's rent allowance entirely. The unfortunate tenant will find him or herself with a notice to quit being issued. I want to give notice to the Minister that the Labour Party will be tabling a motion in the House to have this regulation annulled. I advise her to withdraw it before her own Deputies get to hear about the fact that their constituents are going to have rent allowances withdrawn from them entirely when their rent goes over the maximum permitted by the health boards. It is the most savage, meanest, lousiest and nastiest cut made by the Government since it came into office and it has been inflicted on the poorest people of this country who are not organised into a lobby. They will now be particularly vulnerable when they go to community welfare officers because it is their last hope. They will go in with the announcement of rent increases from their landlords to be told by their community welfare officer that not only will their rent increase not be matched, but their rent allowance is being withdrawn altogether. I ask the Minister to get the regulation changed and bring forward a new regulation which withdraws this SI 527 of 2002 which is flawed and will result in additional people being made homeless.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Hanafin.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate her on her appointment to Cabinet. Reading the pre-budget submissions made by many lobby groups, I suspect the Minister took everything into account. I refute the allegation that she was laughing through the debate. Members will be aware that the Minister is a popular Member of the House and it is her demeanour to take things seriously. I do not think she projects an uncaring image and that can be proven by reference to the allocation she secured from the Estimates and the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" />I am not here just to talk up the Fianna Fáil manifesto or proposals but to highlight the recognition of the various groups' submissions in the Social Welfare Bill. I appreciate that everything sought in submissions in recent weeks has not come to fruition but the package for social welfare goes a long way towards meeting the needs of many groups. I wish to highlight the carer's allowance in the context of the previous Administration and this one. While it may not be the easiest one to take out of the social welfare package, it has taken years to get to a level where the disregard has been increased in each budget. While we have had many submissions from various groups over the years that suggest we should disregard the means test, I would prefer to see the income disregard increased rather than the means test abolished.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest means of measuring a Government's success in dealing with poverty and funding for social welfare is that of consistent poverty. The ESRI report has recognised, particularly since 1994, that consistent poverty has been dealt with fairly successfully through the policies of this Administration and the previous one. I hope to see the Minister continue with these policies so we see a reduction from 15.9% to 6% in 2002. Policies of this nature recognise that, in an economy growing at full speed, we often see the gaps between the well-off and the less well-off widen and it is something of which Government's need to be aware. This Minister has recognised that.</P>
    <P>We should recognise the commitment of officials in the Department of Social and Family Affairs to become more customer-friendly and I wish them good speed with further decentralisation to rural areas where people have the opportunity to deal with officials face to face. I ask the Minister to speed up the appeals system. It is nonsensical that people may be brought in for second or third medical examinations within a short period of time. This should be resolved.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks, the main lobby groups have been talking about the need to increase child benefit, pensions and the carer's allowance. I welcome the increase in child benefit. While we never realise the increase we hope for, the whole child benefit proposals and what is contained in this Bill recognise that it is an essential part of family income and gives independent status to the woman in the home. I hope this benefit is never taxed or means tested.</P>
    <P>The point is often made that many people do not need child benefit and lodge it directly to post office savings accounts but that is often a means of ensuring that children can get third level education. We are clearly engaged in a political debate as to what the Government must prune and what it can deliver upon. As a Government backbencher I recognise that the commitments to increase the <Col N="526" />value of rates in all systems in real terms have been realised in the budget. While additional increases to those over 66, including widows, may not have reached the targets we had hoped for in this budgetary year, we are in a time of financial constraint and the Minister must take account of that.</P>
    <P>As regards the carer's allowance, health boards and voluntary bodies have recognised the value of carers' work in the home for years. We understand the extra cost the State would have to bear if the same care was being provided in institutions. I am not indulging in political plámás but we can never overstate the case for continuing such supports. The Government has recognised the role of carers in providing first rate care. Further recognition has been demonstrated by providing an extra &euro;10 per week for those over 66 and &euro;7 for those below that age.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise the improvements in the means test for the carer's allowance by increasing the weekly income disregard by &euro;19 per week. That is moving towards a system whereby most people will be able to apply to be cared for at home. The Government's social welfare policy is working and it should be recognised that a consistent policy has been pursued to ensure that people return to work. Some 400,000 additional people are now at work compared to the period of the last Administration and that reduces the need for extra budgetary measures in that regard.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to carer's groups who have consistently made the point that the level of support they have received from the Government in recent years reflects the recognition of their contribution in the home. The former Minister made provision for a bereavement grant which had not been recognised previously. I am not promoting such an increase this year or next, but the former Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, increased that subvention to £500. While there is no immediate need to review the issue, I hope it will be reviewed every five years. On the last occasion the grant had not been reviewed for ten or 15 years. I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on securing this level of investment for social welfare. I am certain that over the coming months and years the Minister will prove her worth. It is not just a matter of accepting submissions and listening because this Minister will be active in implementing policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides evidence that even in times of global uncertainty the Government is determined to press ahead to try, as far as possible, to meet the needs of the most vulnerable members of our society. The legislation should be seen in the context of the changes we have produced in the past five years, including social welfare increases. The Bill builds <Col N="527" />upon the progress that has been made during that time by the Government parties. It will ensure that we meet our core objective of providing for those whom we need to help most, our children, pensioners and social welfare recipients generally, even when money is not as flúirseach as it was.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years we have prioritised different facets of social inclusion, including the tackling of poverty and drug abuse, stimulating employment, providing better retirement conditions for the elderly and supporting families. Members of the House would have to agree that we have reduced poverty to historically low levels during that period. We have increased the basic income of welfare-dependent people by up to 50%, which is way ahead of inflation or industrial wage increases. It addresses our commitment to these people and shows that we are focusing on improving the lives of young and old alike. The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, has demonstrated the necessary compassion and I congratulate her on managing to achieve such a package of measures in the current budgetary circumstances.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Moloney and others have said, the Bill should not be viewed in isolation. In 1997, the rate of child benefit was the equivalent of just &euro;38.09 per month for the first and second children, and &euro;49.52 for the third and subsequent children In budget 2001 we announced an unprecedented investment of &euro;1.27 billion in increased child benefit over a number of subsequent budgets, and we have met two-thirds of that target. The Bill allows for another &euro;105 million to bring child benefit payments to &euro;125.60 for the first and second children, and &euro;157.30 for the third and subsequent children. When these rates come into effect on 1 April 2003, they will represent a 250% increase on the 1997 rate. In anyone's language this is a spectacular increase and is clear evidence of the Government's determination to tackle child poverty. Mothers are the ones who receive child benefit payments and they can judge how best to spend it on their children.</P>
      <P>Another example of this trend is the 25% increase in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, which targets children when they most need such assistance. Some 65,500 children will benefit from this allowance. We all recognise the added pressures on parents in the autumn, so this payment coupled with the child benefit scheme will ensure we can continue to address their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my previous responsibility for children I was involved in tackling child poverty. In the national children's strategy we pledged to eliminate child poverty and we have worked towards that goal quickly. A major contributing factor has been the increase in child benefit which, over the past six years, has lifted 75,000 children out of poverty. No level of child poverty is acceptable in a pro<Col N="528" />gressive society, so it is vital that we continue to move forward in implementing all aspects of the national children's strategy. The Minister has a particular interest in the national anti-poverty strategy and it is important that all these aspects be tackled in the context of the coming few budgets.</P>
    <P>The role of the elderly was unappreciated and undervalued for a long time. For comparative purposes, in 1997, the old age pension was the equivalent of &euro;99 per week. Over the past six years, the cumulative increase of &euro;53, or 59%, has made a real difference to the lives of more than 100,000 pensioners, people who have made an important contribution to the economic and social development of the nation. As a Government, we say that these people matter. Even in times when we did not have as much to give to others, the priority given to the elderly in the pension increase of &euro;10 is the first increment in our commitment to increase the State pension to &euro;200 per week by 2007.</P>
    <P>We will resist all calls by the Opposition who have asked us to play roulette with the pension reserve fund. The security of this fund is essential to ensure that today's pension increases can be paid for in the future. I cannot understand how members of the Opposition would ask us to jeopardise the security of the pension fund because providing for the elderly must be the cornerstone of our social policy. One of the most courageous decisions taken by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in the past couple of years was to set aside investment for that fund. We should be mindful of the fact that the people currently in this House will benefit from the fund's existence.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have mentioned carers and the Government obviously wants to give full recognition to their role. Until a few years ago very little, if any, recognition was given to the fact that so many people worked around the clock caring for the sick and elderly in their own homes. Enormous fees would be involved if they were to provide the same services professionally, but they do not. They do it out of love for people who are close to them. It is important in an increasingly individualistic age to do all we can to encourage and reward carers. They have been long neglected, but we are determined to continue to make the impact we have been making for the past couple of years. Last year we extended the carer's allowance scheme from 9,000 to more than 20,000 recipients, and the improvement in the means test for the carer's allowance in this Bill will help to extend the numbers even further. The increase in the payments by &euro;10&mdash;</P>

      <P>I commend the various agencies and the money being allocated to them. Agencies such as Comhairle are playing a valuable independent role in empowering people and providing them with information on their entitlements. With one of the three or four hats that I now wear, the information society being one, let me say that the Comhairle website provides valuable information. As soon as the Minister for Finance had finished his Budget Statement, the Comhairle <Col N="530" />website had all the budget changes up. As a Government, we need to ensure that information is readily available to as many people as possible. That depends not just on Deputies holding clinics and running advice centres. Agencies like Comhairle help us to meet that challenge. The extra &euro;1 million allocated to it by the Minister is recognition of its work.</P>
      <P>The same is true of the &euro;1 million allocated to the family support agency. New research launched today proves that family mediation and counselling works. Anything that can help families at times of stress should be supported. When the previous Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, put the Family Mediation Service on a statutory footing it brought together all the different schemes and programmes that try to help couples, particularly where children are involved. The value of that service cannot be exaggerated. The results of the research from Accord highlights its importance. We should give whatever support we can to groups like this not just in the interests of individual families under stress but in the interests of the wider society, because the whole of society gains from something like that.</P>
      <P>Almost &euro;1 million is being allocated to MABS which does tremendous work in all areas of the country. It got an increase of &euro;960,000, which will go towards offering good advice to people. The &euro;200,000 extra for the Combat Poverty Agency and the &euro;300,000 for the emigrant advice centres constitute recognition by the Government of the work of these agencies.</P>
      <P>We aim to continue to protect the vulnerable despite economic uncertainty. We will ensure that the welfare of our children, our elderly and our social welfare recipients remains at the heart of Government policy. This Bill safeguards those and enables us to make progress. We are cognisant of the challenges of the global economic downturn. We must be fiscally prudent and avoid the failed tax and spend measures of the past. Despite all of that, this Government will remain committed to those who are most in need and it will rise to the challenge of ensuring an improved standard of living for everybody.</P>

      <P>The consequences for social welfare recipients of this budget are serious. It means the difference between having food or being hungry for some. It is tragic that many families will suffer severely as a consequence of the miserly contribution of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" />One of the benefits on which social welfare recipients depend heavily is the back to school clothing and footwear allowance. While the increase of &euro;150 for secondary school students is welcome, even if a bit miserly, the decision not to change the rate for primary school students is unbelievable. Deputy McCreevy is out of touch if he thinks &euro;80 goes anywhere near clothing and preparing a youngster to go back to school. The cost of clothing, footwear, runners, copy books, text books and so on must be met and people are being given &euro;80 to do it. One could not imagine Deputy McCreevy going to the bookie's hatch and searching through his wallet for &euro;80 for a bet at the Curragh. The clerk would probably fall out of her standing if he presented such a token. However, this is the difference between a youngster being able to face into the classroom with some warmth and comfort, and that is denied by this Minister. It is interesting to compare that with the range of tax loopholes that we were promised would be dealt with and were not touched. There were many other funding opportunities. For example, the Revenue Commissioners' examination or audit in 1997 that found that some 5% of the richest people in this State were paying as little as 5% tax. The money was unquestionably there but there was no desire to go after it from that source. It was an easier option to cut payments to those in society who are least well-off.</P>
    <P>It is scandalous that a range of organisations that do such good work in the State have had their funding cut. The Money Advice Budgeting Service, which deals with the poorest of the poor in society, those who are struggling to pay their ESB bills and whose local authority rents are grossly in arrears, has had its budget cut by 8%. It defies logic. Other areas of the community and voluntary sector have also been raided by the Minister to ensure that he does not have to do anything that might worry his rich and powerful friends. Grants for community and voluntary services have been cut by 16%. Funding for the anti-racism awareness programme has been reduced by 63%. Funding for the Council for the Status of People with Disabilities is to be reduced by 44%. The most vicious and mean-spirited of all the cuts is that another 5,000 jobs are to go in community employment schemes. These schemes provide opportunities in the most difficult and impoverished areas of society. They provide essential services such as child care and assistance to old people, and 5,000 jobs are going at a time when they should be considerably increased. However, to do so would have involved Deputy McCreevy searching for funding elsewhere, and we know where, and we know where he did not want to go and so, as was said in this House many times in the course of this debate, the stallions in Kildare got the benefit while the youngsters of <Col N="532" />this nation were left, in some cases, quite literally cold and hungry.</P>
    <P>The Minister is as devoted a disciple of the principle of redistribution of wealth as I have ever seen, but he seems to have misunderstood one of its most basic rules, that wealth should be redistributed from the rich to the poor and the disadvantaged. Unfortunately, the Minister has got it the wrong way around.</P>

I have been a Member of this House for 15 years and I have never known any Member to feel he or she was better than another. I take umbrage at the remark by the Deputy for the Labour Party who would question my sincerity in caring for others. It is equal to his own or that of any other Member, regardless of whether we hold a different philosophy. I am as sincere as any Member of the House. I may not agree with the views of other Members but I regard every Member as being sincere in the expression of those views. Nor do I appreciate the fact that some feel they are equipped to tell another Member of the House what it is like to be in poverty. If we were all as sincere as we profess to be, some of us might not be in this House because we would be unable to live up to our own standards. The members of my party and I are as committed to the alleviation of poverty as any Member of this House. It is incumbent on all of us, as servants of the public, to be that way.</P>
      <P>I was faced with choices. Opposition Deputies asked was I going to be one of those Deputies who hark back to what we did five years ago. I normally would not. My choice was between giving everything to everybody or targeting resources to those whom my party and I decided were most in need of support. I decided to target resources. In 1997, on the other hand, &euro;3.81 was given to everyone. That is what the rainbow Government decided to do and my party did not agree with it. This Government decided to target spending. We gave &euro;10 to pensioners and &euro;11 to widows over 66. They have a problem which is recognised by all Members and we are addressing that issue. We also targeted carers. We have increased the disregards and allowed 1,700 extra people to participate in the carer's allowance or carer's benefit schemes. We have a target of 5,000 more participants in the next five years. I hope to reach that target and go beyond it. If I had &euro;500 million I would allow every carer to participate in the scheme but I had a choice to make. I had to make choices in those three areas and those are the choices I made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of people putting forward their cases, Members of the Opposition mentioned a figure of 25 cent. However, we must look at the baseline. Five years of increased benefit has been <Col N="533" />continued by me, with further targets to be reached over the next five years in delivering on the national anti-poverty strategy. We would like to go beyond that.</P>
    <P>I agree that child benefit is the best way to alleviate child poverty and I believe the majority of Members agree with that. We delivered on the first two tranches. It would be totally disingenuous of me to say I will try to reach our target in one year or two. The Minister for Finance and I have undertaken to reach the target in three years. With &euro;105 million I was in a position to give increases of &euro;8 and &euro;10. We will deliver on the promise in the next three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to raise this issue. Anyone who saw the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme last night would have been shocked at the exposure of such an organised cartel, the object of which was to defraud the Irish people by having higher prices and controlled marketing of that basic commodity, milk. I do not know if it shocked people or confirmed their worst suspicions about what is happening in the country at present. It seems that no matter what area one turns to one is subject to incredibly high prices. We are becoming uncompetitive from inflation. It is also a difficult country in which to live due to the exceptionally high prices in areas like insurance, where again there are concerns about cartels, banking costs and professional services. I could list a range of areas where we seem to be willing to let large business interests set the agenda in terms of price and market conditions.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the programme makers for going about their work so furtively. It highlighted something which we all know is there but feel we can do nothing about. It makes us deeply unhappy about the way the country is run. I raised the matter to ask the Minister what he feels can be done about it. It is not that I expect the Minister to come out tomorrow and start sorting out the Irish milk industry or any other industry. It is impossible for the Minister to completely interfere in set market conditions. The job is most properly taken on by the Competition Authority, which has been working hard in this area and in a number of other areas. While the Competition Authority may huff and puff and act as an advocate for open and perfect competition, we have an atrocious record on enforcement. We cannot apply the legislation we have introduced to actual final effect. That is what I wish the Minister to address. How do we now move the three pieces of legislation we have enacted in swift order, the 1991, 1996 and 2002 Competition Acts? </P>
      <P>This is an amazing amount of legislation in one area over a short period of time. However, the legislation is failing to work because, like in so many other areas of Irish life, we are seemingly unable to enforce it. I know it was not highlighted on the programme last night but the Competition Authority used whatever resources it had to try to pursue enforcement in the case of the dairy industry. A case for criminal proceedings was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions but because of the difficulty in pursuing evidence, the director decided not to proceed. I have been told that the Competition Authority is pursuing a civil case against some of the people who operated in this case and I am glad of that. However, a civil case has little teeth and will only result in an injunction or a rap on the knuckles rather than a real move towards change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A European directive on competition law enforcement has just been passed and it is opportune for the Opposition to ask the Minister how we will proceed in terms of enforcement. Why are we failing in court to bring about change in sharp <Col N="541" />practices engaged in by big businesses which are becoming increasingly apparent in the cement industry, insurance, banking and other areas? I do not wish to presume guilt until a case has been proven but the public is aware that it seems to be the victim of certain market conditions that support the business community rather than the customer.</P>
    <P>In regard to a philosophical point about competition, our party welcomes the work done by the Competition Authority in trying to create perfect conditions in the domestic market. That is welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ryan for raising this matter. I am aware of the general contents of last night's RTE &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme which carried a report on possible cartel activity in the liquid milk sector. Allegations of this type give rise to concerns with regard to the effective operation of competition in this sector and the negative consequences for consumers arising from alleged restrictions in the sector.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to state that it is not my Department's function to investigate allegations of anti-competitive activity. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for competition policy. Responsibility for the enforcement of competition law is a matter for the Competition Authority.</P>
      <P>Cartel activity and the elements which constitute it is a serious offence. It is one of the hard-core offences set out in the Competition Act, 2002. It consists of price fixing, limiting output or sales or market rigging. It is a criminal offence and there are serious sanctions for those convicted of such activities.</P>
      <P>The issue of price fixing in any area of the economy is a serious one for producers and consumers alike. It stifles the market, producers become locked in and are prevented from increasing market share by offering a better deal and consumers cannot avail of the benefits which lower prices can bring. Producers become inefficient and consumers lose out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year the Competition Act, 2002, was passed by the Oireachtas. This Act consolidates and modernises the statutory arrangements for competition and mergers. The enforcement of <Col N="542" />competition law has been strengthened by a number of measures including powers of arrest and detention for hard-core competition law offences. Tougher penalties have been introduced for hard-core competition offences such as price fixing and market sharing. The maximum imprisonment penalty is increased from two to five years in the case of the more serious category of offence such as price fixing. The category comprises agreements between competing undertakings, a decision made by an association of competing undertakings or a concerted practice engaged in by competing undertakings, the purpose of which is to directly or indirectly fix prices with respect to the provision of goods or services to persons not party to the agreement, decision or concerted practice, to limit output or sales, or to share markets or customers.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, implementation of the Competition Act, 2002, is a matter for the Competition Authority which is an independent enforcement agency. The remit of the authority extends to all areas of the economy. It has the power to investigate breaches of the competition law by virtue of section 30(1) of the Competition Act, 2002, which provides for the authority, &ldquo;to carry out an investigation, either on its own initiative or in response to a complaint made to it by any person, into any breach of this Act that may be occurring or has occurred&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 31 of the Act provides that the authority in its investigations may summon witnesses to attend before it, examine on oath the witnesses attending before it and require any such witness to produce to the authority any document in his or her power of control.</P>
    <P>Section 45 also gives enhanced powers to authorised officers of the authority when carrying out investigations. These powers include, <i>inter alia,</i> enhanced search and entry powers, powers to seize and retain books, documents and other forms of records and powers to inspect and take extracts from any such books or records.</P>
    <P>The authorised staffing levels in the authority have also increased substantially over the past few years, from 29 in 2000 to its current level of 47. The majority of the additional resources are at professional level, economists and lawyers, to assist it in its enforcement and advocacy functions.</P>
    <P>I urge anyone with evidence of price fixing or any other anti-competitive offences to give that information to the Competition Authority. To deal with anti-competitive activity one needs to obtain evidence which can be used in court which is the final arbiter in deciding whether the Competition Act has been breached.</P>
    <P>There are two alternative ways in which action can be taken. Any evidence of price fixing should be passed to the Competition Authority and those with allegations to make should use the public enforcement system via the Competition <Col N="543" />Authority. Section 14 of the Competition Act, 2002, provides that any person aggrieved in consequence of anti-competitive activity has a right of action in the courts for relief by way of injunction or declaration and damages including exemplary damages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me raise the important issue of Ranbaxy Ireland Limited, Cashel, County Tipperary. I will give a brief history of Rambaxy. In 1966 the factory on the outskirts of Cashel traded as Rema Ireland. It ran into difficulties and, some time in 1966, Ranbaxy took over the company and invested in it. Since then it has enjoyed a good relationship with the local community. Some 100 people worked in the factory, some on a part-time basis. Since 1966 seasonal workers would be let go but were taken back after a short period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over recent weeks we have been led to believe that negotiations are taking place between the management and the union regarding 18 redundancies from among those working full time and the letting go of all part-time workers. This will be a significant blow to the economy of Cashel. It may seem a small number of jobs in the context of Dublin, Cork or Limerick but in a town such as Cashel which has only one factory, admittedly there is a new factory opening in the locality in the not too distant future, the loss of 18 full-time and 15 part-time jobs will be a devastating blow particularly to west Tipperary. People make pleas on behalf of the west, but west Tipperary contains the poorest town in Ireland, Tipperary town, which is close to Cashel and in the same region. West Tipperary is the context in which this matter must be viewed. As well as that, no town in south Tipperary was included as a hub or gateway town in the recently announced spatial strategy, and there are worries about decentralisation. Tonight, however, I am concerned about the future of Ranbaxy in the current climate. I expect the Minister will be able to help. I must point out the urgency of the situation: the number of jobs may <Col N="544" />seem small but because of the region with which we are dealing, I expect some help from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited was established in 1961 to manufacture pharmaceutical products. With headquarters in New Delhi, India, Ranbaxy's operations are divided into pharmaceutical, animal health care products, fine and synthesis chemicals and diagnostics. The company recorded sales of &euro;475 million in 2001 with profits of &euro;53 million. Ranbaxy is India's largest pharmaceuticals company, employing approximately 7,000 people worldwide.</P>
      <P>In 1996, Ranbaxy Laboratories acquired Rima Pharmaceuticals Limited, a generic pharmaceuticals production facility in Cashel, County Tipperary. The company currently employs 83 permanent and 15 temporary people. Ninety-five per cent of its products are sold to the UK market, which is extremely price competitive. This has had a negative impact on the company's performance over the last six months and production volumes have declined. As a result, the company will move to a single shift operation from January 2003 and will therefore reduce manpower by way of redundancies. These redundancies will involve 18 permanent and 15 temporary staff.</P>
      <P>The company has informed IDA Ireland that it is committed to maintaining a presence in Ireland and the IDA will maintain close contact with it. FÁS, the national training authority, will be in contact with company representatives tomorrow to discuss a detailed programme to assist those who are being made redundant in finding suitable alternative employment. FÁS will make available its full range of support services, including skills analysis, jobs placement, guidance and counselling interviews, identification of training needs and suitable training courses.</P>
      <P>There have been some positive developments for south Tipperary. The ALZA Corporation is currently building a 60,000 sq. ft. facility in the IDA Cashel business park. Scheduled to open in the second half of 2003, the facility will manufacture patch technology products. Current employment is 22 but this is expected to grow to 100 employees at production stage. Total investment in the project is expected to be &euro;162 million. South Tipperary has a good range of foreign direct investment companies in the growing pharmaceutical and health care sectors. Companies such as Guidant, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme and Clonmel Healthcare in Clonmel and now the ALZA Corporation in Cashel provide a solid base of employment. These are complemented by other significant employers such as Pall Corporation in Tipperary town and SRAM Ireland in Carrick-on-Suir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="545" />The main focus of IDA activity in the south east will be on Tipperary town, with the upgrading of the IDA business park. In addition, planning permission will be sought for an advance technology building, sponsored by the business expansion scheme, in the business park in Tipperary town. In terms of increasing Tipperary's attractiveness as a location for investment, the Tipperary Institute is currently operating two campuses, one in Clonmel with 300 students and the other in Thurles with 500 students. The Clonmel campus commenced courses in 2000 and is expecting the first graduate output in 2003. It is hoped to develop the institute's range of courses to take on more business and science students.</P>
    <P>The State development agencies, under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, are fully committed to the promotion of employment creation in south Tipperary, including Cashel. The agencies work closely with each other and with the development bodies in the area, as well as other local bodies and interests, in facilitating an integrated approach to enterprise development in south Tipperary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND" hpid="Dr. Cowley Dr. Cowley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I am grateful to you for the opportunity of raising this very important matter on the Adjournment, namely, the decision by the Independent Estimates Review Committee to propose, selectively, the elimination of the Western Development Commission. I cannot understand this decision, taken by these unwise men from the east. They are certainly not bearing gifts like the original three wise men: rather, poisoned daggers to try to finish off the west once and for all. We have come to expect no great gifts from the east. Centralised Government and party politics over the years have ensured that we only got the crumbs. Even in the national development plan we lagged behind, and the Fitzpatrick report points this out very clearly.</P>
      <P>The future of our young people depends on the areas becoming competitive so that they can find work locally. Professor Seamus Caulfield's work on the census figures shows that west and north Mayo are the most economically deprived areas of Ireland. They should be a high priority. Yet we should not be surprised at the actions and recommendations of these so-called independent experts. By their fruits ye shall know them, and they have not changed their spots. It is telling that in describing their guiding principles this anti-west trio said, &ldquo;In framing proposals we made every effort to identify lower priority programmes that could be abolished in a short timeframe but the reality is that few programmes readily fit into this category.&rdquo;  Yet they had no difficulty in finding that the Western Development Commission fitted their criterion very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" />It is not surprising, for those who have seen over the years the disregard for the west shown by Governments and senior public servants, to find that these three former top civil servants regard the main development agency for the west as a low-priority programme. This is the public manifestation of the private policy operated by Governments since the Western Development Commission was formed, which put every single possible obstacle in its way to prevent it from doing the job for which it was established. This very policy, which led to the resignation of the chief executive of the commission, continues to insult the members of that board and its staff.</P>
    <P>The Western Development Commission was announced in January 1997. In February 1999 it got its statutory standing and only recently, three years later, did it get its staff. It has done great work. Twenty-nine projects have been evaluated at a total cost of &euro;11.8 million. Last July a review was arranged, which turned out to be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Contempt was shown for the good work of the commission. The reduction of the western development fund &ndash; the life blood of the region &ndash; by 68% was a clear indication of a death wish for the commission within the Government. The fund consisted initially of &euro;127 million over five years. It was then reduced, unbelievably, to &euro;32 million and this has now been cut by a dramatic 68%. We were always bedevilled by lack of resources for our infrastructure development, but this is the <i>coup de grâce, </i>delivered to the one agency with ringfenced funding for the west.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, to come clean immediately on the proposal to abolish the Western Development Commission and to clarify whether he made this proposal to the review committee or agreed with its contention that the commission is a low priority today. What were the grounds for its abolition? According to the report, the three most unwise men felt that the activities of the commission overlapped with those of the county enterprise boards, Údarás na Gaeltachta and Enterprise Ireland. This is tommyrot &ndash; bruscar. Enterprise Ireland is a national organisation which targets high-potential start-up projects with the growth potential to export in three years. Very few indigenous west of Ireland enterprises fall into that category. We all know that Údarás na Gaeltachta is a national body located and operated in Irish-speaking areas. What about the county enterprise boards? There is no duplication of roles there. The Western Development Commission co-ordinates on matters which can be best dealt with on a regional basis, such as renewable energy.</P>
    <P>The Minister is due to launch an important telecoms report on Monday next for the Western Development Commission. I ask him to take this opportunity to meet the board and explain what <Col N="547" />he is doing. Will he respond to the report they sent to him in the context of the review he is conducting, or has he already decided the outcome as was perhaps indicated in the remarkable statement by Senator Paschal Mooney last night when he said the Western Development Commission should be abolished? Does the Minister agree with Senator Mooney or will he denounce his intervention which pre-judges the outcome of the latest Government study?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>I never met the Independent Estimates Review Committee. The first I knew of the proposal was when the completed document was presented. The area of operation of the Western Development Commission includes Galway, Ennis and Shannon, all counties in Connacht and Counties Donegal and Clare. It was in that context that I initiated the review because SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta already work in those areas.</P>
      <P>The Government did not act on the recommendation of the Independent Estimates Review Committee, set up to review spending in all areas in the run up to the budget. The work of the committee is now complete and any decisions made on foot of that work have been made. No decision was made about the Western Development Commission.</P>
      <P>I have made known my concerns about the structure and role of the Western Development Commission in the past. My concern is that, as a body, it does not have the remit to make a significant difference. I could compare it to Údarás na Gaeltachta, which is well resourced and has the statutory authority to do the job.</P>

      <P>Accordingly, in July I announced a review of the purpose, functional area and operation of the Western Development Commission in the context of the newly established Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, with a view to bringing proposals to Government. I will be honest, I do not know why the commission operates in Galway city even though I represent the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" />The purpose of the review is to identify and eliminate any unnecessary duplication between State agencies operating in the western region, thus ensuring value for money in public expenditure on promoting development in the region and maximising that development.</P>
    <P>The review being undertaken by officials of my Department is ongoing. It is expected that the review will be completed and its findings presented to me at the end of the year. I can assure the Deputy that I have no fixed notion about the outcome of the review. I have also made arrangements with the board to meet it next week to clarify these issues.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, even with the 10% reduction in the grant-in-aid in 2003 for general expenses, the commission will be able to operate effectively. While &euro;1.5 million was provided in the 2002 Estimates, only &euro;1.413 million was required.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue, which increasingly demands our attention, and I also thank the Minister for coming to the House to respond to it.</P>
      <P>This case has been going on for some time and, strictly speaking, I should not have to raise it in the House at all. It is a simple issue of a public representative writing to the relevant authority to seek assistance for a person in need. This lady separated from her husband four and a half years ago. At that time she had accrued some arrears but that was through no fault of her own. She and her husband had a shared ownership loan, giving the local authority a considerable equity in the property in question and there was no difficulty re-adjusting the payments when her income was determined. The arrears, however, still remained.</P>
      <P>The manner in which this issue was dealt with is the matter I wish to raise. I was a member of a health board for 15 years and I have been making representations for constituents for 27 years and I was appalled recently to get a smart ass letter in reply to my representation that pointed out how the respondent would deal with the matter in future. As I pointed out to him, I made representations to the responsible authority and I do not want consultations with anyone else. I do not want to write to MABS, the credit union or the bank. I responded in the correct way.</P>
      <P>In the past few days I had occasion to send a reminder. The Minister will say that the community welfare section of her Department made an attempt to contact the lady in question in the last few days. Of course it did and I know why. My first acknowledgement from the relevant health authority was on 23 December 1999. With no disrespect to the officials concerned, and this does not reflect on the Minister, there was only one way to deal with such nonsense.</P>
      <P>It is time we recognised that assistance for a good household manager, like this lady, who is on a tight fixed income, is the responsibility of the community welfare officer and, in saying that, I mean no disrespect to MABS.</P>
      <P>This is a landmark issue and similar cases will arise but I hope I will not have to bring them to the attention of the House. I am sure the Minister would not want me to, but that will not deter me if I have to.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the <Col N="550" />issue. In the context of what the Deputy has raised, he is aware that under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a health board may make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of weekly income. These payments are known as exceptional needs payments. Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment. These are made at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of each individual case and neither I, as Minister, nor the Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>The board was contacted and has advised that the Deputy contact the superintendent community welfare officer on behalf of the person concerned to inquire if assistance could be provided under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme with regard to the outstanding arrears to which he has averted. The Deputy was advised that the board has an action plan which is used to provide assistance in cases such as the one in question where a person finds themselves in debt due to outstanding mortgage arrears.</P>
      <P>In the first instance &ndash; I hope the Deputy does not fly off the handle &ndash; the person is advised to contact the local money advice and budgeting service. It is an excellent service and I ask that the person involved at least make an approach to it. The service would facilitate progress in the context of working with the county council, and perhaps Deputy Durkan, to deal with the difficulties, and perhaps arrange a mutually acceptable revised repayment schedule which takes account of the individual's financial circumstances.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties was between the Deputy and the health board as opposed to the action plan. I re-emphasise the necessity of going to the money advice and budgeting service. I have been advised by the community welfare officer that he &ndash; I think it is a he&mdash;</P>

      <P>All member states of the European Union are required to operate an agri-environment programme as provided for in Council Regulation 1257/1999 on support for rural development from the European agricultural guidance and guarantee fund. However, participation by individual farmers is voluntary.</P>
      <P>The rural environment protection scheme is Ireland's agri-environment programme and the European Commission approved it in September 2000 as a measure in the Rural Development Plan 2000-2006. Farmers who give voluntary undertakings under the REP scheme are entitled to an annual payment for a period of five years subject to continued compliance with the undertakings given. I have recently announced a consultative process on the REP scheme. Following this consultative process, which will include all stakeholders, it is my intention to put forward proposals for changes to the scheme to the European Commission during 2003.</P>
      <P>Any successor to the REP scheme, after the current programming period ends in 2006, will be subject to future negotiations at EU level and whatever regulations may be in force. While it is too early to speculate on the outcome of those negotiations, I see no reason the voluntary nature of the current scheme should change.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 47 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>Later today, the Oireachtas Joint Committee for Agriculture and Food will deal with the motion requesting Oireachtas approval for draft regulations under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Acts 1979 to 1996, the purpose of which is to fix the rates of diseases levies from 1 January 2003 at 1 cent per gallon of milk delivered for processing and at &euro;5.08 per animal slaughtered or exported live. This is in line with the recently published Estimates provision for my Department indicating a doubling of the bovine diseases levies from 2003.</P>
      <P>These levies have to be viewed in the context of a total provision in the 2003 Estimates for animal disease including BSE and so on of &euro;216 million, of which &euro;67 million relates to TB and brucellosis. The increases also have to be viewed against the background of the current overall budgetary situation, the Exchequer costs of the schemes and the fact that a major part of the expenditure relates to compensation, where the cost of reactors has increased under the on-farm valuation system. The higher rates of levies will bring in a total of approximately &euro;20 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>Revised arrangements for the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes were introduced with effect from April 1996 following agreement with the farming bodies. Under these arrangements, responsibility for arranging and paying for the first clear herd test each year was devolved to farmers. In recognition of this, the disease levies payable were reduced from £7.30 to £2.50 per animal and from 1.3 pence to 0.5 pence per gallon of milk. It was agreed that the levies would contribute some £10 million a year or 50% of compensation costs over the 1996 to 1999 period. For a variety of reasons, the levies contribution fell short of the 50% target. Compensation payments totalled some £120 million over the four years while levy receipts reached only £45 million for the same period.</P>

    <P>*It is not possible to break down the cost of each scheme between TB and brucellosis due to the fact that the majority of TB tests and the brucellosis tests are undertaken simultaneously.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>While the bovine tuberculosis eradication programme operated by my Department is extremely comprehensive, progress towards final eradication has been disappointing. However as the statistics indicate there has been a reduction of more than 5,000 in the number of reactors each year since 1999 and I anticipate a further reduction in 2002. In assessing the level of expenditure on the TB eradication scheme I refer the Deputy to the results of a cost-benefit study undertaken in 1991 that covered the period from 1954 until the establishment of ERAD in 1988. According to the study the total quantified benefits, not including human health benefits, were estimated to amount to 7% of total cattle and milk output in 1988. It also found that the minimum benefits of the scheme were estimated to have exceeded costs by 86% and the rate of return was calculated at 15.5%. Overall, the study suggested that the scheme was highly beneficial for the national economy.</P>
    <P>As regards brucellosis I am pleased that as a result of a number of initiatives I introduced in the course of 1999 positive factors are emerging, as the table indicates, to indicate that the incidence of the disease is declining.</P>

      <P>Under Agenda 2000, apart from the increase in quota levels for Ireland, I negotiated also changes to the EU milk quota regulations which allowed for greater flexibility in how member states apply the system. Based on this I introduced major changes to the regime in Ireland in the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations, 2000. I am satisfied these have had very positive effects and are achieving the objective of placing quota in the hands of active committed dairy producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the changes we made have worked well, we need to consider how to operate the quota system in a way which makes even more quota available to those who need it to expand their <Col N="556" />operation in the coming years and to earn a decent living. There is not enough quota coming into the restructuring pool to meet such needs. We need to look at ways of attracting increased quantities of quota into the restructuring scheme. With the help of the milk quota review group, I have been considering mechanisms which would achieve this. The group met on 11 November and made certain recommendations to me. I asked the organisations represented on the group to make further submissions to me with suggestions as to how more quota can be brought into the pool, particularly in parts of the country where there is a serious deficit of quota relative to the demand from active producers.</P>
    <P>I will consider those submissions as soon as they become available as well as the recommendations already made to me by the review group.</P>

      <P>Both European, national and local environmental legislation can have financial implications for farmers. Such implications would arise normally where farmers were required to provide additional waste storage capacity on their farms, or where there was a restrictive effect on the farming activities of some of the more intensive operators who might be required to reduce their stocking rates or get access to additional spreadlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department already provides grant aid to farmers who undertake works of an environmental nature on their farms. The farm waste management scheme enables grants to be paid up to a maximum level of 55% for, <i>inter alia</i>, the construction of silage and waste storage facilities up to a maximum level of investment of &euro;50,790. Farmers who participate in the rural environment protection scheme receive payments for meeting environmental standards that go beyond normal good farming practice. Basic annual REPS pay<Col N="557" />ments are &euro;165 a hectare for farms of less than 20 hectares, and &euro;151 a hectare for farms above 20 hectares subject to a maximum area eligible for payment of 40 hectares. Farmers with land in REPS which is subject to additional environmental specifications, such as natural heritage areas, special areas of conservation, special protection areas or commonage, receive very substantial annual payments of up to &euro;242 per hectare.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, therefore, that there are already substantial measures in place to help farmers to meet their obligations. In so far as REPS is concerned I have recently announced a consultation process open to all stakeholders with a view to formulating proposals for changes in the scheme which will be put to the European Commission in 2003. I expect that this valuable exercise will result in further improvement to a very important scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department has participated actively in a liaison group to consider implementation of the Nitrates Directive which was convened by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and also includes Teagasc, the Geological Survey of Ireland and the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
      <P>Successful implementation of the directive is important for the many farmers who are beneficiaries of the measures in the CAP rural development plan, under which funding was secured for compensatory allowances, REPS, early retirement scheme and forestry for the period 2000-06. The plan includes commitments in respect of the implementation of the Nitrates Directive, and to ensure continued EU funding of these measures it is necessary for Ireland to deliver on those commitments.</P>

      <P>I am aware of recent reports in <i>The Sunday Times</i> of a statement referred to that all meat intended for human consumption should be screened for BSE. This report comes in the wake of work by a team at the University of California which indicated that certain skeletal muscles of mice experimentally infected with scrapie may contain infectivity and may reproduce prions. The EU's Scientific Steering Committee has concluded that the parameters of this research do not justify its extrapolation into BSE in cattle, and that there is no reason to revise its opinions with regard to the safety of bovine and sheep muscles. In addition, the results of other experiments in relation to possible infectivity in the muscle tissues of cattle and sheep, including work reported by the French Food Safety Authority on 27 March 2002, have been consistently negative.</P>
      <P>Consumers and others can be assured that a comprehensive range of measures remains in place in Ireland for the control and eradication of BSE. These controls include, <i>inter alia,</i> a requirement to test all cattle over 30 months of age intended for the human food chain, ante and post mortem tests at meat factories and the removal of all specified risk materials from the human food and animal feed chains. If any adjustments to these controls are deemed necessary in the light of operational experience, or in the light of scientific work, they will be made. It is not considered, however, that the work referred to at this stage warrants any changes to the comprehensive control system already operating in Ireland.</P>

The Commissioner indicated that he would proceed with the mid-term review with the possible exception of the proposal for modulation of direct payments and that detailed proposals would be presented by the Commission early in 2003. He believed such proposals were necessary, particularly in view of the WTO negotiations on the new round.

      <P>Four animals born in 1997 have been confirmed as BSE positive. An animal born in 1999 has also been confirmed with the disease. This animal was discovered when the herd cohorts of a 1993-born infected animal were depopulated and tested.</P>
      <P>The general trend of the disease is encouraging in that the age profile of animals confirmed with the disease is increasing. In 2002 less than 2% of cases have been identified in animals less than six years old at the time of diagnosis, compared to 16% in 2001 and 40% in 2000. In addition in the period August-November 2002, inclusive, the number of BSE cases identified, 102 is down by more than one third on the corresponding period of 2001, 157. Therefore, while isolated cases in animals born after 1996 are disappointing, the important factor is the overall trend.</P>
      <P>This trend illustrates the effect the controls introduced in 1996 and 1997 are having on the rate of infectivity. The increasing age profile of animals in which the disease is confirmed is a positive indication that these additional controls are having the desired effect and that the incidence of BSE will decline as older animals leave the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime consumers and others can be assured that a comprehensive range of measures remains in place for the control and eradication of BSE. If any adjustments are deemed necessary in light of operational experience, they will be made. Current controls include, <i>inter alia</i>, compulsory notification of the disease, whole herd depopulation, tracing and culling of birth cohorts and progeny of BSE-infected animals, a ban on feeding meat and bonemeal to all farmed animals intended for human consumption, ante and post mortem inspections at all meat plants, the removal of specified risk material from the <Col N="561" />human food and animal feed chains, and a comprehensive active surveillance programme among all cattle over 30 months of age and all casualty cattle over 24 months of age in meat plants, and all fallen cattle over 24 months of age in knackeries.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to rigorously enforce these controls in a manner which, in first instance, provides assurance to consumers in relation to the quality and safety of Irish beef, which protects animal health and which safeguards the future of the very important Irish beef sector.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 82 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 2001, I secured Government approval for my proposals to draft legislation to replace the existing legislation governing regulation of the veterinary profession. It is generally accepted that the Veterinary Surgeons Acts 1931 &ndash; 1960 are outdated and now fall short of meeting the current and prospective needs of the profession itself and the expectations of the wider community. I know that the veterinary council also shares this view. Accordingly, the Government has approved the heads of a new Veterinary Sur<Col N="562" />geons Bill, which will consolidate, update and address the perceived deficiencies of the present legislation. The Parliamentary Counsel's office has begun drafting work, which is now ongoing in association with my Department.</P>
    <P>In broad terms, my intention is that the draft legislation, which I wish to have published and brought before the Oireachtas at the earliest possible date, will bring the regulation of the veterinary profession and ancillary activities fully up to date. This would be done by broadening the membership of the veterinary council itself and by expanding its role in the areas of education and training, standards of veterinary premises, food safety and public health. In terms of the council's regulatory functions, I would intend to provide a basis for imposition of a graduated and more comprehensive range of sanctions and in this regard seek to improve and bring greater transparency to the process by which the council would reach an appropriate determination in any case.</P>
    <P>In relation to registration, I would intend to provide a legislative basis enabling the council, where appropriate and subject to the necessary controls, and in addition to meeting obligations arising from membership of the EU, to register appropriately qualified persons from third countries.</P>

      <P>Grant aid towards investment in the organic sector is provided through the scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic sector, which was approved under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The scheme provides grant assistance for both on-farm and off-farm investment in equipment and facilities for preparation, grading, packing, storage and distribution of organic produce. Grant aid is payable at 40% of the eligible cost. The maximum grant payable over the duration of the scheme for on-farm investment is &euro;50,790 while the maximum for off-farm investment is &euro;253,948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Organic farmers are also eligible for financial support through the rural environment protection scheme. REPS includes a supplementary measure for organic farming whose objective is to encourage producers to respond to the market demand for organically produced food. An organic farmer with 40 hectares in REPS can receive up to &euro;13,280 a year, which includes payment of the basic measure, while a holding is in conversion to full organic status. When full organic status is obtained, such a farmer may receive an annual <Col N="563" />payment of up to &euro;9,680 which also includes payment of the basic measure.</P>
    <P>The organic development committee, established on foot of a recommendation of the AgriFood 2010 committee, concluded that a number of additional structures are required to assist the development of the organic sector. The report also made other recommendations for action by various stakeholders in the organic sector. The first meeting of the national steering group for the organic sector, one of the new structures recommended by the committee, will take place this week and will be followed in due course by the establishment of a partnership expert working group and an organic market development group. The partnership expert working group will co-ordinate, facilitate and monitor the provision of training, education, research and advice.</P>
    <P>I hope that these additional structures will assist in identifying any shortcomings in the areas of financial supports and training needs for the organic sector.</P>

      <P>The factors determining producer returns and retail prices are complex. As such a large proportion of Irish agricultural production is destined for export, improving the marketability of what we produce is the way to improve producer prices. It is with that end in mind I met producer and industry interests in the beef sector this week and that I have established a group to examine and report back to me on the future for the dairy industry. I have also met Commissioner Fischler and made the case together with the farming bodies for specific actions to deal with the immediate problems in this sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Markets are becoming more sophisticated. It is essential that Irish production is positioned to supply the quality end of the European markets if there is to be real benefit to producers from the improved standards of assurance and traceability achieved in recent years. It is essential that the processing industries operate efficiently and focus on reducing costs. In the Single Market, products are sold freely and Governments do not have the power to set the levels of mark-up at different stages of processing and sale. The Competition Authority has a statutory role in ensuring that markets operate freely and this includes the retail sector. In the case of commodity sectors supported by the Common Agricultural Policy, the Deputy will be aware that the return to the producer is only partly made up by the price &ndash; direct <Col N="564" />aids financed by the European Union constitute a significant proportion of producer income in the beef and sheepmeat sectors in particular.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the controls on animal feed that are operated by my Department fulfil all the obligations under the EU regulations on animal feeds and in certain areas go beyond what is required. The EU controls in this area are continually monitored and reviewed by the European Commission and have been intensified on a number of occasions. The controls in operation here cover both home produced and imported feed from the EU and third countries. The use of processed animal proteins in ruminant animal feed is totally prohibited. The prohibition, therefore, applies where traces of bones of any species are found in animal feed material. In these circumstances, there is no need to determine the exact nature of any bone material found.</P>

      <P>The freezing of ewe quota on some commonages is the outcome of an agreement between my Department and the European Commission in 1998, which secured generous REPS payments of up to &euro;242 per hectare to farmers with commonage. This agreement was reached at a time when overgrazing by sheep, particularly on commonages in the west, had reached a point where the Commission had threatened to stop all REPS payments on those areas. My Department had to suspend the processing of REPS involving commonage applications in the six western counties that included large areas of commonage. As a result of the 1998 agreement with the Commission, however, an additional &euro;7 million per year is now being paid on top of the basic REPS payments to the 3,700 farmers with commonage land who are in REPS. This represents an average additional payment of &euro;1,800 per farmer and it brings the total average annual payment for REPS farmers with commonage land to &euro;7,100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1998 agreement with the Commission, my Department together with Dúchas was required to have individual framework plans prepared for each commonage. Most of the framework plans have now been completed and my Department has written to farmers holding <Col N="566" />ewe quota to advise them of the recalculation of their quota allocations for 2003. Individual stocking levels have been calculated with reference to the destocking requirement of the relevant plans together with the data already held in the Department in respect of the farmers concerned. While ewe premium in 2003 will be payable only on the quota now notified to them, farmers will have a year to bring their actual stocking levels into line with these calculations and can therefore choose the most advantageous time to sell or acquire stock.</P>
    <P>The destocking arrangements are required to implement measures to protect and rejuvenate commonage areas that may be at a risk of overgrazing. They are an integral part of the agreement with the EU Commission secured in 1998. Any failure to implement them would put in question the generous REPS payments based on that agreement. Farmers who are subject to these measures, if they are not already participating in REPS, must apply during 2003 to join REPS or a complementary national scheme to be operated by Dúchas.</P>
    <P>I have also recently announced arrangements under which farmers with commonage can appeal the destocking percentages recommended in the commonage framework plans. An appeal will be dealt with by way of a reassessment of the scientific basis on which the original destocking arrangements were made by the framework planning teams.</P>

      <P>There are currently more than 37,000 farmers in REPS. During the FEOGA year that ended on 15 October 2002 my Department received 12,383 applications for REPS. This is one of the highest rates of application in any year since the scheme was first introduced in 1994. Under the new REPS, the average payment is &euro;4,900 as compared to an average payment of &euro;4,400 in the previous scheme.</P>
      <P>With a view to maximising participation in REPS, I have recently announced a consultative process involving a wide range of stakeholders, out of which I hope to formulate proposals for revisions to the scheme that will be submitted to the European Commission during 2003. Full consultation and detailed preparation are necessary to ensure that any proposals that may be put to the Commission are robust and fully justifiable within the terms of the relevant EU regulations. The consultative process will cover all aspects of the scheme including payment rates.</P>
      <P>I have also recently announced certain administrative changes to REPS, including a simplified plan format for more extensive farmers, access for planners to my Department's computerised mapping system, in respect of their clients land parcel information, and amendments to the rules on proof of title to land. These changes were designed to simplify aspects of the scheme and encourage take-up.</P>

      <P>I am familiar with reports in relation to experimental work with mice carried out by Professor John Collinge and colleagues from the Medical Research Council's Prion Unit in London that BSE may be linked to a &ldquo;type two&rdquo; pattern of CJD consistent with sporadic CJD. I am aware that there is already a measure of debate as to how the results to date of such work might be interpreted and applied in practice. Experts in my Department and elsewhere in the EU continue to take a close interest in this and all work which can assist in improving our understanding of how the BSE prion works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the primary focus remains the practical implementation of public and animal health controls which are intended to protect public health, provide the necessary assurances to in <Col N="568" />relation to the safety of Irish beef to consumers at home and abroad, and to control and eradicate BSE in the bovine population. While I am willing to make adjustments to controls where new validated scientific evidence, or operational experience, so requires, there has been no suggestion from the EU's Scientific Steering Committee that the work carried out by Professor Collinge in this field warrants any change to the controls currently operating in the EU. It is unlikely that such work would have any implications for a system designed to prevent in the first instance infective material entering either the human food or animal feed chains.</P>
    <P>Current controls in Ireland go beyond the minimum required by EU law. These controls include, <i>inter alia,</i> whole herd depopulation, tracing and culling of birth cohorts and progeny of BSE-infected animals, a ban on feeding meat and bonemeal to all farmed animals intended for human consumption, compulsory notification of the disease, ante and post mortem inspections at all meat plants, the removal of SRM from the human food and animal feed chains, and a comprehensive active surveillance programme among all cattle over 30 months of age and all casualty cattle over 24 months of age in meat plants, and all fallen cattle over 24 months of age in knackeries. My Department will continue to rigorously enforce these controls.</P>

      <P>Under EU beef labelling regulations operators involved in the production and marketing of beef are required, since January 2002, to include on their labelling an indication of the country of origin of the animal from which the beef was derived. I am aware that some meat factories in Northern Ireland may now be reluctant to accept for slaughter cattle born in the Republic of Ireland, but which were reared or finished in Northern Ireland, because an indication of Irish origin will not permit them to apply a British Beef label to their product as required by some of their UK customers.</P>
      <P>While the purchasing decisions by both traders and retailers are commercial and a matter for themselves, I am, nevertheless, concerned if EU labelling rules were to lead to a distortion of the traditionally strong trade in live cattle to Northern Ireland and, for that reason, I have asked that the matter be kept under review. I have brought my concern on this matter to the attention of the Northern Ireland authorities.</P>

      <P>The production of sugar in all member <Col N="570" />states of the European Union is regulated by the EU sugar regime under which a sugar quota is specified for each member state. The quota is a national quota for manufactured sugar. There is no quota for sugar beet nor is there a quota at farm level in the sugar sector. Under the EU Regulation the sugar quota for each member state is allocated to the sugar manufacturers on the member state's territory. Accordingly, in Ireland's case the quota is allocated to Irish Sugar Limited, the only manufacturer of sugar in the country. It is a matter for the company to place contracts with farmers to deliver sufficient sugar beet to manufacture the national sugar quota. I have no function in that particular matter.</P>
      <P>As regards the sugar quota for 2003, this will be decided in September 2003 when full details of sugar exports against the Community's obligations under the WTO agreement have been established.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties being experienced by farmers in view of the bad weather and the prospect that yields might be lower than normal, but that fact would not cause quota reductions in 2003.</P>
      <P>The sugar quota for the 2002-03 marketing year was reduced across the Community by 862,475 tonnes in total of A and B quota, because exports exceeded WTO limits. In Ireland's case this reduction amounted to 6,410 tonnes of A quota and 640 tonnes of B quota.</P>

      <P>The national farm survey results produced by Teagasc show that medium and small farms are mainly found in the drystock systems. The results show for farms less than 20 hectares on the cattle rearing systems 47% of holders or spouses had an off-farm job and 35% on the other cattle systems.</P>
      <P>The 1999-2000 household budget survey produced by the CSO also presents detailed results by farm size. This shows less variation than might be expected, particularly when household size is taken into account.

To date, my Department has tested more than 1.3 million cattle, more than 1.2 million of which have been cattle over 30 months of age intended for human consumption.</P>
      <P>It has been a characteristic of Ireland's approach to BSE that measures were more rigorous and were, in many instances, put in place earlier than required by EU legislation.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the control programme is to protect human health by maintaining high standards of food safety and animal health and welfare, to safeguard the economically important beef industry and in due course to eradicate the disease from the national herd.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that some 345,000 tonnes of beef will be exported to other member states of the EU in 2002. The principal destination for these exports is the United Kingdom, which will take 240,000 tonnes. The remaining 105,000 tonnes will be exported to Holland, 29,000 tonnes, Italy, 22,000 tonnes, Scandinavia, 30,000 <Col N="573" />tonnes and France, 16,000 tonnes, the balance being destined for other smaller markets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of concerns expressed in relation to attracting young persons into farming. However, these issues are not unique to Ireland. A number of policy initiatives have been undertaken to address these concerns.</P>
      <P>I am particularly encouraged by the recent announcement by Teagasc that the number of students participating in third level vocational courses in agricultural and horticultural colleges has increased by almost 10% this year.</P>
      <P>The upgrading of courses to third level status is clearly proving attractive to young people interested in careers in agriculture and horticulture. Also, the fact that participants can progress from these certificate and diploma courses right up to university degree level is a significant factor in the big increase in student numbers.</P>
      <P>My Department operates a number of specific measures to promote agriculture as a career. The principal mechanisms are the installation aid scheme, which was established pursuant to the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and the early retirement scheme. Under the installation scheme, a grant of &euro;9,523 is available to young farmers under the age of 35 years, who have become established in farming for the first time, on or after 1 January 2000. In addition, top-up grants are also available to young farmers under both the dairy hygiene scheme and the farm waste management scheme. Under the early retirement scheme, older farmers are encouraged to retire early from farming in order to qualify for a pension which is jointly funded by the EU and by the national Exchequer, thereby encouraging their replacement by younger farmers able to improve, where necessary, the economic viability of agricultural holdings.</P>
      <P>In the case of young producers in the dairy sector, since the introduction of the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations 2000, the milk quota restructuring schemes have become the principal means by which producers can increase their milk quotas. Accordingly, I have been able to prioritise the distribution of available quota and young producers, especially those with small quotas, have been a high priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These schemes include a number of special concessions to the younger farmer. The first is the priority allocation to new entrants of a minimum <Col N="574" />allocation of 50,000 litres. The second is the continuing priority of recent entrants up to the age of 35 to acquire quota up to the limit of the first category, 180,000 litres. Priority to purchase available quota has also been afforded to successors of producers who had to sell their quotas in recent years into restructuring schemes.</P>
    <P>To give further assistance to the younger producers in the Milk Quota Restructuring Scheme, 2002 the share of the pool to be allocated to the new and recent entrants priority category was increased. It rose from 20% to 25% of the pool available after the allocation to the two highest priority groups, i.e. successors to producers who had to sell into restructuring in the past and those who lost quota due to changes in the milk quota regime.</P>
    <P>In addition to the ongoing priority in the restructuring schemes, I also afforded particular importance to young producers in deciding on the allocation of the additional quota that I secured for Ireland as part of the Agenda 2000 agreement. During 2000 and 2001, I allocated 45 million litres of free quota, that is almost one-third of the total additional quota available, to approximately 3,500 young trained dairy producers.</P>
    <P>In March of this year, I introduced regulations allowing for the registration of milk production partnerships. Milk production partnerships will provide opportunities for improving the efficiency of dairy operations and allow for a better mix between work and family life, thereby increasing the attractiveness of dairying to younger farmers.</P>
    <P>I will shortly finalise details of a pilot scheme to allocate milk quotas to farm managers, the objective being to enhance the attractiveness of a career in farm management for those with appropriate skills and experience.</P>

      <P>The sixth Community environment action programme provides for the development of a thematic strategy on the sustainable use of <Col N="575" />pesticides with the aim of reducing the impacts of pesticides on human health and the environment.</P>
      <P>In the context of that strategy, the Commission submitted its communication, Towards a Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable use of Pesticides to Council and Parliament in July 2002. That document called for the development of a strategy on the sustainable use of plant protection products that <i>inter alia</i> would minimise the hazards and risks to health and environment from use of pesticides. The Council of Ministers accepted the strategy and invited the Commission to submit proposals for additional controls on the use and distribution of pesticides, linked directly to support payments and the penalty system operating under the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
      <P>The additional measures to be proposed by the Commission are intended to complement the regulatory framework already in place for plant protection products, Directive 91/414/EC, which has as its objective the maintenance of a very high level of protection for humans, animals and the environment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs has responsibility for the implementation of EU Directive 2000/13/EC relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs. Under that directive, any label must be such as would not mislead the purchaser to a material degree, for example, in relation to variety, quantity and origin.</P>
      <P>However, in order to ensure proper traceability for plant disease purposes, the Registration of Potato Growers and Packers Act, 1984 and 2001 requires that any person who grows or packs ware potatoes must be registered with my Department and the registration number of the packer and-or grower must appear on the bag-label. In addition, all packers of potatoes are required to keep records which will enable my Department to trace back the origin of the potatoes to the grower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purpose of maintaining and improving the quality of potatoes sold, my Department introduced the Food Standards (Potatoes) Regulations 1977 to 1996. These regulations prescribe the minimum quality and grading standards for ware potatoes sold for human consumption. Under these regulations, the size of potatoes <Col N="577" />being marketed is regulated and the bag-label must show the size range of the potatoes and the variety. However, these regulations do not apply to new potatoes.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the existing controls on the traceability and labelling of potatoes are satisfactory. However, I am open to examining all means of improving those controls. To this end I have asked that the request from the IFA National Potato Committee be considered in the context of a review which will commence shortly, of all support and control measures operated by my Department in the potato sector.</P>

      <P>Together with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I recently announced the arrangements under which farmers with commonage could appeal the destocking percentages recommended in the commonage framework plans.</P>
      <P>The commonage framework plans are expert assessments of the environmental status of commonages and include recommendations, where necessary, for reductions in sheep numbers to allow vegetation to recover from the effects of overgrazing. Each plan was drawn up by an approved team consisting of an agriculturalist and an environmentalist, under the joint supervision of the Department of Agriculture and Food and Dúchas, the Heritage Service of the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>The appeals mechanism will offer farmers an opportunity to have a second assessment of commonages by other experts. The results of this reassessment will be considered by my Department and Dúchas, who will either accept them or refer them to an appeals committee made up of two representatives of the farming bodies and two from environmental organisations under the chairmanship of Mr. Gerry Scully, chief sheep adviser with Teagasc. The appeals committee will then make a recommendation to the Ministers.</P>
      <P>Each re-assessment will be carried out by an approved framework planning team other than the team that did the initial assessment, and Dúchas will contribute up to &euro;1,300 towards the cost. One appeal may be made against each framework plan and will require the support of at least 20% of the commonage shareholders covered by that plan who have claimed area aid. For framework plans already published, appeals must be lodged before 28 February 2003. In all other cases an appeal must be submitted within three months of the publication of the framework plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The beef market within the EU has made a strong recovery since the most recent BSE crisis with consumption levels regaining most of the ground lost at that time. During 2003, it is anticipated that EU consumption levels will increase to within 2% to 3% of pre-2000 levels. When this is combined with lower EU production, which is also predicted, the overall forecast for the 2003 beef market is more positive than it has been for <Col N="579" />some time. While an increase in EU imports is predicted, it is also expected that there will be a further recovery in exports from the EU. From an Irish point of view, further moves towards overall EU balance in the beef market can only be positive and this should have beneficial effects on the Irish beef sector as a whole.</P>
      <P>As regards volume of exports, the UK will continue to be the principal market for Irish beef in 2003. Import requirements for that market are expected to increase from 35% of total consumption to 40%. I expect that Ireland will maintain and possibly increase its share of this market.</P>
      <P>Efforts at diplomatic, political and technical levels to regain access for Irish beef exports to third country markets will continue in 2003 involving this Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia.</P>
      <P>The decision by Egypt, which had been our largest market for beef, in October of last year to lift the ban on Irish beef imports was a welcome development for Irish cattle and beef sectors. All the technical-veterinary issues to permit trade resume have been agreed with the Egyptian authorities. The resumption of beef exports to Egypt is now a commercial matter for the industry. The recent introduction of a special EU export refund rate for Egypt which is 30% above the normal level should be of major help in allowing Irish exporters regain a strong presence in this important market. This refund was introduced following strong representations to the EU Commission. I have made it clear to the industry here that I believe a longer term perspective should be taken in this market in view of its importance as a major importer and that the opportunity now presented by the reopening of the market and the introduction of an exceptionally high refund level should not be lost. I hope trade with the Egyptian market will resume early in 2003.</P>
      <P>The Russian veterinary authorities lifted the remaining restrictions they had on beef from counties Cavan, Cork, Limerick, Meath, Monaghan and Wexford. This was particularly welcome on two fronts. First, it represented a major and much needed boost to Ireland by having such an important market as Russia lift all BSE related restrictions and give a full endorsement to our controls systems. Second, from a commercial-trading point of view, it gave hugely increased flexibility to exporters in supplying this growing market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, with the assistance of Bord Bia and our ambassador in Saudi Arabia, hosted a conference on food safety and consumer protection in the beef sector last October in Dublin aimed specifically at important markets in the gulf region. The conference, which was attended by experts from the Gulf Cooperation Council's food safety committee representing Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, afforded the visiting experts from those gulf states the opportunity to assess the level and effectiveness of Ireland's BSE controls and reac<Col N="580" />tion to the conference was very positive. The GCC's food safety committee will consider the report on the conference over the Christmas period.</P>
    <P>We are also in ongoing contact with the South African, Philippines and Indonesian authorities at technical and diplomatic level with a view to having those markets reopened to Irish beef. Earlier this year, my Department hosted visits by delegations from South Africa and the Philippines and is following up on these markets. We have been in contact with the Indonesian authorities at political and technical level with a view to having an Indonesian delegation visit Ireland at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>I fully support the introduction of a mechanical classification system. The decision to allow grading by means of mechanical classification is one which will be taken at EU level. I have pressed, and will continue to press for such decision to be taken within the shortest possible time.</P>
      <P>Mechanical grading trials were carried out in Ireland in August 1999 and March 2000. Similar trials were also carried out in Germany, Denmark and France. The consensus of opinion was that the trials in Ireland had been carried out in a highly professional manner. While the three machines involved achieved high accuracy results in relation to conformation and meat content of the carcases, they were less accurate in relation to fatness and, in general, they failed to attain the standards set down by the EU Commission in a draft regulation setting standards to be met by these machines prior to their approval for classification purposes.</P>
      <P>Following discussion in the Beef Management Committee, the Commission agreed to carry out a pilot test to examine whether the standards and procedures set out in the draft regulation were practicable. Germany was selected as the venue for the pilot test and a trial was carried out in September last year in which my Department was involved. Based on the results of this trial, a draft regulation is now being formulated by the EU Commission which will set down the standards to be met by the machines and the procedures for approving them. Publication of such a regulation will clear the way for the development of a machine capable of meeting the required standards in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Commissioner Fischler accepted that there have been some problems in the market and that these have been particularly felt in Ireland. He pointed to the fact that the market had to be managed on an EU-wide basis and referred also to budgetary and WTO constraints.</P>

    <P>Out of that, a total of 155,713 tonnes have been produced under the Exchequer-funded rendering subsidy scheme and this gives rise to an annual storage charge of &euro;2.07 million. A further 39,384 tonnes relates to the EU purchase for destruction and special purchase schemes which gives rise to an annual storage charge of &euro;0.93 million. The balance of the MBM stock is privately owned and is the responsibility of the rendering industry.</P>
    <P>Under a new arrangement, the rendering industry is now responsible for the complete process, from rendering right through to destruction of the MBM. A build up of MBM stock under the ownership of the state has been arrested and storage charges arise only in relation to existing stocks, which will decline over time. Contracts are ongoing to dispose of 72,000 tonnes of this material over the next four months.</P>

      <P>My Department is examining in detail the final report of the Three Rivers Project for the establishment of water quality monitoring and management systems for the rivers Boyne, Liffey and Suir, which was published on November 29.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I give high priority to the protection and enhancement of the environment through the promotion of environmentally friendly and sustainable systems of agriculture and food production. Environmental requirements are now applicable to various schemes operated under EU Council Regulations 1257/99 and 1259/99 and the obligations on farmers participating in these schemes are set out in the booklet, Good Farming Practice, which was distributed to all farmers in August 2001. In effect, the great majority of farmers are now covered by the provisions of Good Farming Practice which is mandatory for all farmers in receipt of aid under compensatory allowances, on-farm investment schemes, livestock premia schemes, arable aid and the rural environment protection scheme. It also applies to <Col N="583" />farming transferees under the early retirement scheme.</P>
    <P>The farm waste management scheme provides grant aid for the provision of on-farm pollution control facilities. The rural environment protection scheme, REPS, requires participants to implement nutrient management plans and has led to more effective use of fertilisers on participating farms. The widespread use of nutrient management planning, which requires a soil testing programme to determine the actual nutrient status of the soil, has helped to raise awareness amongst farmers of the importance of matching nutrient supply to crop demand.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am encouraged by the findings of the recently published Environmental Protection Agency report, Water Quality in Ireland 1998-2000, which showed that for the first time since national surveys commenced the length of unpolluted river channel in Ireland had increased.</P>
    <P>I recently announced a consultative process on the REPS which will include inputs from the various stakeholders. I expect that the Three Rivers Project report will be an important contribution to this work.</P>

      <P>Under the Musk Rats Act, 1933 (Application to Mink) Order, 1965 the keeping of mink is prohibited except under licence from my Department. The issue or annual renewal of a licence to operate a mink farm is contingent on the enterprise complying with a number of key <Col N="584" />conditions. An annual compliance inspection of each of the mink farms currently licensed in Ireland is carried out to ensure that relevant standards are maintained.</P>
      <P>Foxes are humanely killed by electrocution or lethal injection prior to pelt removal. Mink are humanely killed by inhalation of carbon monoxide gas prior to pelt removal. Both procedures are allowed under Schedule 6 of the EC (Protection of Animals at time of Slaughter) Regulations, 1965, S.I. No. 114 of 1995, and under the Council of Europe recommendation concerning fur animals. My Department will continue to closely monitor the operation of the licensed mink farms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The only EU-approved means of disposal of BSE infected carcases are burial or incineration. My Department discontinued the practice of burial of BSE carcases in late 2000 and in the absence of any suitable incineration facility within the State, it was necessary to make interim storage arrangements, pending a solution to the ultimate disposal of this material.</P>
      <P>In so far as the rendering industry is concerned, I understand that the current position is that the integrated pollution control, IPC, licences granted by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to those plants currently approved for rendering specified risk materials do not permit them to render BSE positive material. In the event that the EPA agrees to a modification of the IPC licences of any of these plants, permitting them to render BSE positive material, my Department will take full cognisance of this in determining a strategy for the ultimate disposal of the material currently held in cold storage. As for incineration, the Deputy is no doubt aware that no suitable facilities are available within the State for the disposal of BSE positive carcases.</P>
      <P>In the continued absence of appropriate alternatives, it will continue to be necessary that BSE infected carcases be frozen and stored in a secure, dedicated cold store, owned by my Department. In this regard I am satisfied that appropriate precautions have been taken in relation to the operation of this cold store and that it is complying with current national and EU animal health, public health, planning and environmental legislation in relation to this matter.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which he proposes to deal with the crisis in Irish horticulture where the lack of Irish research in integrated pest control and organic methodologies now leaves growers facing ruin due to stricter controls on the use of pesticides, particularly those used for the control of aphids on brassicas, such as Brussels sprouts.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware of the difficulties currently being experienced within the horticulture industry as a result of the unavailability of certain plant protection products which were, heretofore, available to the industry. The removal of these products from the commercial marketplace is as a consequence of the implementation of the EU review programme whereby all such products must undergo reassessment to ensure their safe use in the environment. The reassessment process involves an application for re-authorisation by the manufacturer. However, current indications are that many of the manufacturers will not apply for re-authorisation of their products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable amount of research and development work has been carried out and is still ongoing in Ireland into means of pest control aimed at reducing the use of chemicals. Much of this research, such as that into novel delivery systems and environmental monitoring, has wide application. In addition, there are research projects into integrated pest management aimed at specific pests of mushrooms, fruit, potato and vegetables. Research into vine weevils which should be of major benefit in reducing insecticides in the ornamental sector is ongoing. Biological control of pests of crops produced in glass houses has been widely adopted. The mushroom sector is developing alternative methods based on research conducted here. The adoption of low input systems and biological control by producers <Col N="588" />and marketing organisations is encouraged under a scheme of aid for producer organisations in the fruit and vegetable sector.</P>
    <P>My Department has been actively engaged in trying to identify solutions to the problem facing the industry. To this end, the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and officials have met Bord Glas and members of the industry on a number of occasions to discuss options which can be pursued within the current legal framework. While some success has been achieved through the extension of the life of products for essential uses, other options being considered include extending the approval of plant protection products authorised for commercial crops for use on minor horticulture crops. However, the overall objective is to maintain a very high level of safety for man, animals and the environment.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that local advisers are being less than positive when consulted regarding the possibility of going into organic production. Teagasc advisers are mandated to provide advice that is in the best interest of the individual farmer who asks for it. In the case of advice on organic farming, as with other possible enterprises, this advice will include an evaluation of the likely economic impact of a move to organic production. The nature of this advice will vary from farm to farm and will be heavily influenced by the availability of market outlets that produce an economic return from organic farming.</P>

      <P>In July 2001, I secured Government approval for my proposals to draft legislation to replace the existing legislation governing regulation of the veterinary profession. It is generally accepted that the Veterinary Surgeons Acts, 1931 to 1960, fall short of meeting the current and prospective needs of the profession and the expectations of the wider community. The parliamentary counsel's office has now begun drafting work <Col N="589" />on this item, and this work is ongoing in association with my Department.</P>
      <P>In broad terms, my intention is that the draft legislation, which I wish to have published and brought before the Oireachtas at the earliest possible date, will bring regulation of the veterinary profession and ancillary activities fully up to date. This would be done by broadening the membership of the Veterinary Council itself and by expanding its role in the areas of education and training, standards of veterinary premises, food safety and public health. In terms of the council's regulatory functions, I intend to provide a basis for imposition of a graduated and comprehensive range of sanctions and in this regard to improve and bring greater transparency to the process by which the council would reach an appropriate determination in any particular case.</P>
      <P>The Bill will provide a sound foundation for the development and practice of veterinary medicine in Ireland into the future, in a manner consistent with the best interests of the profession itself and the wider community.</P>

In recent years, however, I have made <i>ex gratia</i> funding available to a number of appropriate bodies involved in the delivery of animal care and welfare services throughout the country, having regard to resources available to me from within the Department's Vote at end-year. In December 2001, grants totalling &euro;650,741, £512,500, were awarded to 52 organisations to assist them in their activities.

    <P>An asterisk denotes those that deal specifically with cats, while many of the other bodies listed deal with welfare issues involving cats as part of their general activities. The grants given to animal welfare bodies in 2001 bring to &euro;2.415 million the assistance given by my Department to animal welfare bodies throughout the country since 1995.</P>
    <P>As indicated, a grant of &euro;10,792 was paid to The Cat Protection Association of Ireland in December 2001. As the payment of such aid is invariably an end-of-year exercise dependent on the resources available out of my Department's Vote, any disbursements are entirely contingent on funds being available at year-end for this purpose. I will consider requests for aid in respect of this year from cat protection organisations in the light of any resources that may become available and having regard to any competing claims for grant assistance which may be submitted by other welfare bodies, many of whom deal with various categories of animals, including cats.</P>
    <P>A formal statutory framework for cat control is already provided for under the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, which is administered by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. That Act provides for the introduction of regulations in relation to cats.</P>

      <P>Since the launch of the TB eradication scheme in 1954, and the brucellosis eradication scheme in 1966, the combined expenditure, at current cost, for both schemes up to the end of 2001 has totalled &euro;1,275 million. The expected cost for 2002 is approximately &euro;72 million. It is not readily possible to break down the cost of each scheme due to the fact that the majority of TB tests and the brucellosis tests are undertaken simultaneously.</P>
      <P>In assessing the level of expenditure on the TB eradication scheme I would refer the Deputy to the results of a cost-benefit study undertaken in 1991 which covered the period from 1954 until the establishment of ERAD in 1988. According to the study, the total quantified benefits, not including human health benefits, were estimated to amount to 7% of total cattle and milk output in 1988. It also found that the minimum benefits of the scheme were estimated to have exceeded costs by 86% and the rate of return was calculated at 15.5%. Overall the study suggested that the scheme was highly beneficial for the national economy.</P>
      <P>The initial policy when the TB scheme was introduced in 1954 was to eradicate bovine TB from cattle herds and this still remains the objective. Significant progress was made in the earlier stages of the scheme but the progress has stalled, albeit at a relatively low level of the disease, and more than 99.5% of the national herd remains free of TB. Important short-term objectives are to ensure that the incidence of the disease is reduced to the minimum level attainable so that markets, in particular export markets, are not jeopardised and so that there is no serious threat to human health. Efforts are also continuing to develop new technological tools which would address obstacles to further progress.</P>

      <P>The EU regulation governing the early retirement scheme requires that the pension be paid as a supplement to any national retirement pension that the participant, or his or her spouse or partner in a joint management arrangement, receives. The Department has an obligation, therefore, to ensure that a participant does not receive full payment of early retirement pension if he or she is also entitled to a national retirement pension.</P>
      <P>On 23 May 2002, four months in advance of her 66th birthday, my Department informed the person named that she must apply for both the old age contributory and non-contributory pensions and provide documentary evidence of the outcome of her applications. However, she had still not provided this information by the time she reached the age of 66 on 22 September 2002, and my Department was forced to suspend the payment of her early retirement pension.</P>
      <P>In mid-November, my Department learned from the Department of Social and Family Affairs that the person named was not entitled to the normal old age contributory pension but that her eligibility for a pre-1953 contributory pension or an old age non-contributory pension was now being examined. As soon as the Department of Social and Family Affairs confirms the position to my Department, the question of her further entitlement to early retirement pension will be re-examined.</P>
      <P>I have asked my officials to pursue the case with the Department of Social and Family Affairs as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>The importation of animal food products into the State is governed by a framework of legislation which has been devised at both national and EU level. Control measures set down by the European Commission are implemented in all member states; thus a uniform set of requirements must be met by all imports into the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" />All animal product imports must come from EU approved establishments and countries and bear an EU health mark except in certain instances when a product may be imported under licence. Inspections and reports carried out by the EU's Food and Veterinary Office are designed to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU will be approved. In cases where the Food and Veterinary Office is not satisfied that public health requirements are being met, countries and premises may be removed from the EU approved list by Commission decision.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, consignments coming from third countries must be imported through an approved border inspection post upon first entry into the EU. An official health certificate conforming to model certificates set down in EU legislation must be presented. Goods failing to comply with the veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination and if necessary they may be destroyed. Once these products have met with all required conditions, they are released for free circulation within the European Community.</P>
    <P>In response to growing concern relating to food labelling including labelling of imported food, I established a group to examine the current labelling framework in the context of consumers' expectations and, in particular, to identify whatever gaps there are either in existing legislation or the manner in which it is implemented. The group has now reported and has made a series of recommendations and I will be making a response early in the new year.</P>

      <P>Bord Bia, which has primary responsibility for the promotion of lamb, continues to assist the industry and to underpin its efforts to seek new markets and maximise returns from existing markets. About two-thirds of Irish lamb is exported with by far the largest proportion going to the French market. Spain, Italy and Portugal are the principal markets for light lamb from Ireland. Irish lamb is also exported to Germany, Belgium and the United Kingdom and small quantities go to the Scandinavian countries. Because the EU is deficit in lamb production, export refunds are not payable for trade to third countries, which makes such exports uneconomic under current market conditions.</P>

      <P>The cattle animal identification and tracing system, CMMS, has been fully operational since the beginning of 2000. The system is used, inter alia, to verify the origin, life history and identity of cattle before they enter the food chain and thus provide assurances to customers and consumers about the safety of Irish beef.

    <P>The National Beef Assurance Scheme Act, 2000 also provides for common high standards of production and processing across the beef industry. Under the scheme, all participants are <Col N="597" />required to undergo a registration, inspection and approval process. This element of the scheme, in particular the inspection and approval of farms, was to be undertaken in conjunction with the annual round of testing. Detailed discussions have taken place over a long period with the veterinary and farming organisations and a protocol for the conduct of the inspections was agreed. However, only a small number of inspections have taken place to date because of resistance to implementation of the scheme mainly by veterinarians whose union is seeking a centralised payment system for the costs involved.</P>

      <P>Botulism is caused by a bacterium called clostridium botulinum that causes harmful effects by producing a toxin. There are five types of the botulism toxin, A, B, C, D and E. Types C and D are common to cattle. Botulism can be contracted from poultry litter contaminated with decomposing organic material from the carcasses of dead chicks when spread on land grazed by cattle. A number of cases in the Cork and Waterford areas have recently come to the attention and are currently being investigated. Botulism in cattle is not <Col N="598" />a notifiable disease under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966.</P>
      <P>My Department has also, by way of a press release drawn attention of farmers to the botulism problem and has urged them to take precautionary measures when handling poultry litter material.</P>

      <P>The overwhelming evidence is that the BSE agent infects cattle through the feeding of infected meat and bonemeal or feeding compound feed contaminated with infected meat and bonemeal. There is also a theoretical risk of maternal transmission from dam to offspring, although this has not been proven in practice.</P>
      <P>There is an increasingly positive underlying trend in relation to BSE. In 2002 less than 2% of cases, have been identified in animals less than six years old at the time of diagnosis, compared to 16% in 2001 and 40% in 2000. In the period August to November 2002, inclusive, the number of BSE cases identified, at 102, is down by more than one-third on the corresponding period of 2001 &ndash; 157.</P>
      <P>Four animals born in 1997 have been confirmed as BSE positive. An animal born in 1999 has also been confirmed with the disease. This animal was discovered when the herd cohorts of a 1993-born infected animal were depopulated and tested. My Department is conducting an in-depth investigation of all possible sources of infectivity and it is as yet too early to draw any conclusions in relation to the source of the infection of this animal.</P>
      <P>Considerable time and attention has been devoted to the control regime for BSE. All of the relevant controls are fully operational and are kept under review. If ongoing operational experience indicates that controls should be adjusted, this will be done as necessary. Current controls include, inter alia, whole herd depopulation, tracing and culling of birth cohorts and progeny of BSE-infected animals, a ban on feeding meat and bonemeal to all farmed animals intended for human consumption, compulsory notification of the disease, ante and post mortem inspections at all meat plants, the removal of SRM from the human food and animal feed chains, and a comprehensive active surveillance programme among all cattle over 30 months of age and all casualty cattle over 24 months of age in meat plants, and all fallen cattle over 24 months of age in knackeries. To date, more than 1.3 million cattle have been tested, more than 1.2 million of which have been cattle over 30 months of age intended for human consumption.</P>

      <P>The EU market is open to Irish beef and has never been restricted. Following the BSE crisis in late 2000 there was a fall off in consumption levels and a consequent reduction in our level of exports to other member states. However, EU consumption has now recovered to within 2% to 3% of pre-2000 levels. This allows Irish exporters the opportunity to regain their presence on these important markets and I am pleased to say this is happening. Similarly, in the UK, exports this year will approach 250,000 tonnes which represents a huge improvement of our traditional sales to that market.</P>
      <P>It is my policy and that of the Government that Irish beef should be free to enter any export market where exporters consider there are commercial outlets available. Where there are restrictions due to BSE, every effort has and will continue to be made at political, diplomatic and technical levels to have them removed. This effort not only involves my Department but also the Department of Foreign Affairs through its embassies as well as Bord Bia. Obviously, the primary commercial task of finding and exploiting markets is a matter for the industry. Equally, where markets have been reopened, it is for the industry to avail of the reopening and I have made this clear on numerous occasions.</P>
      <P>As regards third country markets, the position is that following the BSE crisis late in 2000, many such markets imposed bans on imports of European beef. While it is clear that these restrictions were imposed Europe-wide against the background of a crisis in mainland Europe and did not adequately reflect the many levels of BSE controls in place in Ireland at the time, the net effect for Irish exporters was that almost all of our significant non-EU markets for beef, with the exception of Russia, were closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision by Egypt, which had been our largest market for beef, in October of last year to lift the ban on Irish beef imports was a welcome development for Irish cattle and beef sectors. All the technical/veterinary issues to permit trade resume have been agreed with the Egyptian authorities. The resumption of beef exports to Egypt is now a commercial matter for the industry. The recent introduction of a special EU export refund rate for Egypt, which is 30% above the normal level, should be of major help in allowing Irish exporters regain a strong presence on this important market. This refund was introduced following strong representations to the EU Commission. I have made it clear to the industry here that I believe a longer term perspective should be taken in relation to this particular market in view of its importance as a major importer and that <Col N="600" />the opportunity now presented by the reopening of the market and the introduction of an exceptionally high refund level should not be lost. I am hopeful that trade with the Egyptian market will resume early in 2003.</P>
    <P>My Department, with the assistance of Bord Bia and our ambassador in Saudi Arabia, hosted a conference on food safety and consumer protection in the beef sector last October in Dublin aimed specifically at important markets in the Gulf region. The conference, which was attended by experts from the Gulf Co-operation Council's Food Safety Committee representing Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, afforded the visiting experts from those Gulf states the opportunity to assess the level and effectiveness of Ireland's BSE controls, and reaction to the conference was very positive. The GCC's Food Safety Committee will consider the report on the conference over the Christmas period.</P>
    <P>We are also in ongoing contact with the South African, Philippines and Indonesian authorities at technical and diplomatic level with a view to having those markets reopened to Irish beef. Earlier this year, my Department hosted visits by delegations from South Africa and the Philippines and is following up on these markets. We have been in contact with the Indonesian authorities at political and technical level with a view to having an Indonesian delegation visit Ireland at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>Hill sheep farming is important to the economy of hill and upland communities as it is frequently the only viable system of farming possible on these holdings. In recognition of that, the report of the Sheep Forum recommended changes in production systems to enable closer matching of produce to consumer specifications. In particular, the forum identified issues of quality, timing and selection of product. These areas need to be addressed by producers on an ongoing basis to ensure the production of better quality hill lamb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At EU level the sheepmeat regime recognises the disadvantage of the hill sheep sector through the payment of a supplementary premium of &euro;7 per head, on top of the ewe premium. In addition, these producers also receive payments under the disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance scheme, which provides payment in respect of mountain type and lowland grazing in more severely and less severely handicapped areas. The scheme originally agreed in July 2000 was subsequently modified during 2002 to increase the <Col N="601" />rate payable on mountain type land, which resulted in an additional payment of over &euro;16 million to approximately 29,000 farmers this year.</P>
    <P>The rural environment protection scheme provides considerable financial incentive to flock owners to destock in order to regenerate designated degraded commonage areas, while farmers who are not in REPS can claim compensation for destocking commonages under an alternative scheme to be operated by Dúchas.</P>
    <P>Spain, Italy and Portugal are our principal markets for light mountain lamb. This market has been mixed for the past couple of years and, as this situation is likely to continue, Bord Bia will continue to focus its activities on maintaining our existing markets and building new ones where possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133, 134 and 142 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" />As the Deputy may be aware, the McDowell Group recommended that the existing functions of the Registrar of Friendly Societies, in relation to credit unions, should be brought into the Single Regulatory Authority, SRA, proposed by the group and that a statutory position of registrar of credit unions should be established within the SRA. Finally, the group recommended that the supervision of the credit unions by the SRA should be done in a way that would recognise and be supportive of &ldquo;the uniqueness of credit unions and would give comfort that their voluntary character would not be threatened by the establishment of the SRA while still addressing the appropriate regulatory and consumer protection requirements that arise&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In October 2000, my officials informed me that the legislative committee of the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, had asked if we would open consultations with them concerning how we would envisage credit unions being regulated within a single regulatory authority. My officials indicated to me that they intended to respond to the request by outlining to the ILCU how we would envisage the McDowell proposal for a statutory registrar of credit unions might operate. I was happy for my officials to talk to the league on this basis and there were three meetings between then and May 2001.</P>
    <P>In the course of those meetings, my officials outlined proposals on how the registrar would be dealt with in the proposed legislation. I should point out that no agreement was drawn up with the league regarding the provisions to be included in the Central Bank and the Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill, 2002. However, I do accept that the league had an expectation as to the provisions that would be in the Bill, based on these meetings. The Bill, as published, reflected what they had been told.</P>
    <P>I should say that credit unions have been regulated under separate legislation from the financial institutions, that is, the Credit Union Act, 1997. The Bill provides that this will continue to be the case. The functions of the Registrar of Friendly Societies under the Credit Union Act will be carried out by a registrar of credit unions within the overall framework of the regulatory authority, but the basis of that regulation will continue to be the Credit Union Act, 1997. I have no intention of changing this basic position.</P>
    <P>However, both the interim Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, which I established in April 2002 to manage the transition to the new regulatory arrangements, and the Governor of the Central Bank, expressed reservations regarding the reporting arrangements for the Registrar of Credit Unions within the proposed regulatory authority. Separately, the European Central Bank had expressed reservations about the autonomous position of the registrar within the overall structure. In the context of these concerns, I felt obliged to look again at the provisions in relation to the registrar.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="603" />I have, therefore, signalled my intention to propose amendments on Committee Stage of the Bill, which would alter the reporting relationship of the Registrar of Credit Unions, to bring the position more fully within the framework of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. The reporting relationship of the registrar would be similar to that proposed for the consumer director; as the Bill is published, the registrar is not subject to the control or direction of the regulatory authority in carrying out or exercising the registrar's responsibilities or powers with respect to the registration of credit unions or the supervision of their affairs or activities and the proposed amendments are designed to correct this.</P>
    <P>The changes I am proposing allow for the credit unions continuing to be regulated separately and distinctly under the Credit Union Act, 1997. Indeed, correspondence between the interim IFSRA and the ILCU has confirmed that this is the case.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I understand that the new chief executive-designate and the acting secretary to the interim Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, have written recently to the Irish League of Credit Unions in relation to the manner in which they intend that credit unions should be regulated: the members of the interim IFSRA recognise and understand the important role that the credit union movement plays in this country; they recognise both the size and reach of the movement, its not-for-profit and voluntary nature and its broad support among the communities, which it serves; they recognise that credit unions have different functions and objectives to commercial financial institutions, such as banks and building societies, and that the regulation of the credit union movement must be appropriate to those functions and objectives; they highlight that, for this reason, the Government, in making clear its acceptance of all these principles, is proposing a separate statutory post of registrar of credit unions who will work under the requirements and protections of the Credit Union Act; the IFSRA wants to work positively with the ILCU. In this regard, it has stated that it is open to discussing the valuable role that the ILCU's field officers play in assisting league members; and the IFSRA's only concern with the legislation as currently drafted is the accountability of the registrar of credit unions.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that the supervision of credit unions by the new regulatory authority should not be viewed as a threat to the movement, but rather as a development that will work to the advantage of the credit union movement and member-customers of credit unions.</P>

      <Quest>if tax relief is available towards the cost of student maintenance for third level education; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that County Monaghan has one of the lowest levels of participation in third level education; his views on whether this is basically due to the fact that it has no third level institution; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides relief from income tax, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved third level courses in approved colleges. The maximum level of qualifying fee for tax relief purposes is &euro;3,175. Further details and conditions in relation to this relief are available from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the recent report by Professor Pat Clancy on participation in higher education in Ireland, which found variability in the rates of admission to higher education in its examination of admission rates by county and, in the case of Dublin, by postal district. In relation to County Monaghan, Professor Clancy's findings were that, when data on third level colleges in Northern Ireland were taken into account, Monaghan was one of the counties with a medium rather than a low rate of admission to third level education.</P>
      <P>Professor Clancy's findings are based on a national survey of all those who enrolled as new entrants to full-time third level education in autumn 1998. This was before the impact of the present Government's significant extra investment in further and higher education.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general issue of participation rates at higher education, there is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling &euro;120 million, over the period 2000 to 2006, to tackle disadvantage at third level. In line with a commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, my predecessor, Deputy Michael Woods, established the action group on access to third level education to advise on the development of a co-ordinated strategy to increase participation of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability at third level. The action group's report was published in July 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date a number of measures have been taken in response to some of the main recommendations in the report aimed at increasing participation in third level education by students from disadvantaged backgrounds: &ndash; special rates of maintenance grant, usually referred to as &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grants, payable to disadvantaged grant holders, were introduced with effect from the 2000-01 academic year. Following a recent review, I increased the annual income thresholds for the special rates by 32%, a significant increase. For 2002-03, I also increased the special rate of grant to &euro;4,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and &euro;1,600 for students resident within 15 miles of college. This is equivalent to a &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; of &euro;1,490 and &euro;596 respectively, for eligible students, on the ordinary maintenance grant. As a result of the review, it is expected that <Col N="609" />the number of students qualifying for the &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grant in 2002-03 will double to 7,000 students.</P>
    <P>A new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was introduced with effect from 2001. The fund provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families. Area Development Management (ADM) Limited under whose aegis the partnerships operate, accepted my Department's request that it would administer the fund for the 2001-02 academic year. The total allocation for the 2001-2002 academic year was &euro;1.2 million, with 37 partnerships and community groups receiving allocations from the fund. For 2002-03, I have increased the provision for the fund to &euro;2 million. ADM Limited, which is continuing to administer the fund, has notified 50 area partnerships, including Monaghan Partnership, and community groups of their allocations in respect of the 2002-03 academic year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the International Energy Agency (IEA), Ireland is required to maintain oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net imports in the previous year. The EU imposes a similar requirement based on consumption.</P>
      <P>On 1 October 2002, the latest date for which comprehensive figures are available, Ireland held 2,164,000 tonnes of oil which is equivalent to 118 days of net imports using the IEA methodology. These stocks are made up of (a) stocks held in Ireland by oil companies, major consumers and the Whitegate refinery amounting to 134,000 tonnes of crude oil and 606,000 tonnes of products, a total of 740,000 tonnes &ndash; equivalent to 39 days of net imports; (b) stocks wholly owned by the National Oil Reserves Agency &ndash; NORA &ndash; at the main import locations in Ireland amounting to 560,000 tonnes &ndash; 31 days &ndash; of oil products. NORA also holds 141,000 tonnes &ndash; eight days &ndash; of products as stock tickets at the Whiddy Island terminal. These are rented stocks that NORA is entitled to buy in the event of an emergency; (c) wholly owned stocks held by NORA in other EU member states amounting to 140,000 tonnes &ndash; eight days &ndash; of oil products; and (d) stock tickets held on behalf of NORA in a number of other EU member states amounting to 583,000 tonnes &ndash; 32 days &ndash; of products.</P>
      <P>In the event of a significant global oil supply disruption, the release of these stocks and the activation of other response measures would take place within the framework of the formal emergency regime developed and maintained by the International Energy Agency (IEA), an autonomous OECD body of which Ireland is a member. Under that regime, member states would be entitled to a share of available oil in the event of a reduction of at least 7% in normal supply levels. There are also provisions for a co-ordinated international response to an emerging crisis, without the oil sharing component, in advance of the 7% trigger.</P>
      <P>The theory underlying the IEA approach is that the emergency reserves would be eked out over an extended period to supplement supplies which would be available in the normal course. In that regard I am satisfied that Ireland's emergency stock levels are sufficient to minimise the adverse local impact of any global oil supply disruptions that might result from an outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East. </P>

      <Quest>the reason Ireland does not hold stores of gas to ensure security of supply in the event of emergency or war; his views on whether this is not very prudent by comparison with some other EU states, such as Austria, which stores the equivalent of more than 100 days demand; and his proposals in this regard.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Various gas storage options in Ireland have been examined over the years and have been rejected either on technical or cost grounds. The most recent examination was in the context of the Gas 2025 study initiated in November 1997 by Bord Gáis Éireann and the former Department of Public Enterprise. This concluded that a second interconnector was a better option than storage.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a high standard of security of gas supply following construction of the second interconnector with Scotland. This duplication of infrastructure is a prudent means of providing security of supply and is employed by other countries. It results in Ireland having two main supply points, the two interconnectors, as well as the Kinsale Field. This ensures a robust gas supply for Ireland.</P>
      <P>The capacity of the Kinsale Field to deliver gas during periods of high demand is boosted by means of a re-profiling of the field's supply by the operator, Marathon Oil. In addition, the anticipated new indigenous supplies from the Seven Heads and Corrib fields will increase diversity of supply.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that Ireland's demand for natural gas is growing, particularly for new power generation. My Department will keep this under review, including the question of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) storage, in the context of ensuring that we continue to have a prudent mix of fuels and supply sources that will enable the needs of the economy to be met without compromising energy competitiveness or security of supply.</P>

      <P>The Government welcomes the joint request to the European Commission from the European Parliament and European Council to consolidate and simplify the directives dealing with the recognition of professional qualifications in order to facilitate the freedom of movement of professionals within the Union. The European Commission launched its proposal for a consolidated directive in March of this year.</P>
      <P>As the proposal deals with the recognition of qualifications across a wide range of professions the Department of Education and Science is the lead Department in these negotiations and the Government is represented by the Tánaiste at council level regarding the matter. Since the launch of the Commission's proposal, officials of my Department have been in close contact with the regulatory bodies in the health sector in relation to this directive.</P>
      <P>My Department has raised a number of concerns regarding the proposal, both through the Department of Education and Science and directly with the Commission. The Deputy should be aware that other member states have expressed concerns similar to our own. My officials arranged a bilateral meeting with the Commission, at which the Medical Council was represented, in order to discuss concerns regarding the regulation of health professionals, mainly arising from questions of registration, and the implications of the Commission's proposed directive on such regulation. My Department was also represented at the European Parliament's hearing on the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main concern regarding the proposal is that the proposed directive does not make any reference to consumer protection. As the Deputy will be aware, the health and safety of patients and their protection in dealings with the health professions, is the primary aim of the regulation of the health professions in Ireland. The Deputy may rest assured that, in co-operation with the Department of Education and Science and the office of the Tánaiste, I will continue to closely monitor progress with regard to the proposed directive and will continue to ensure that patient <Col N="614" />safety and quality of standards are given due consideration in the drafting of the directive.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for administration of the health services in the Dublin area rests, in the first instance, with the ERHA. The authority informs me that not all of the beds available in private nursing homes are suitable for patients being discharged from acute hospitals because of their location or because of their inability to meet the nursing and care needs of such patients.</P>
      <P>At present the three area health boards in the eastern region are fully or partially subventing a total of 3,001 beds in private nursing homes. Of these there are 1,589 beds partially subvented and 1,412 beds fully subvented.</P>
      <P>For example, this year the Eastern Regional Health Authority is spending approximately &euro;45 million on subvented private nursing homes beds. This is an increase of &euro;8 million on what was spent last year.</P>
      <P>Extended care is provided in long-stay units and welfare homes throughout the eastern region. There are over 2,200 beds in public and voluntary hospitals and homes across the region.</P>
      <P>The ERHA, in conjunction with their three area health boards and the voluntary hospitals in the region, has introduced a scheme whereby 24 hour packages of care are put in place to enable people who would otherwise have to go to nursing homes to return home.</P>
      <P>All the authority's research shows that older people wish to continue to live at home where this is at all possible and this new initiative together with a scheme which the authority is piloting in assistive technology is aimed at meeting this need. Assistive technology uses the latest technology to enable older people at home to open and close curtains, answer the door and do various other household tasks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 2001, I launched the national health strategy which is a comprehensive strategic plan for the health system. The strategy is a seven to ten year plan and several key actions will take the full ten years to implement &ndash; for example, the primary care strategy. The action plan and target dates enable systematic monitoring of progress in the achievement of the type of world class health system envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the reconvened National Consultative Forum held on 11 November last I outlined &ndash; with the help of Department officials and senior health board staff, a detailed inventory of invest<Col N="617" />ment and the associated service developments and changes in practice which have emerged in the last year in line with the new strategic direction. I will be reporting to the Cabinet Committee on the Health Strategy shortly.</P>
    <P>Many of the actions which are front-loaded in the action plan in the strategy are concerned with detailed policy development or review for specific care areas as well as showing a strong early start on the investment programme necessary to reconfigure our capacity around primary care and community services while ensuring that there is greater equity in the provision of acute hospital services. A strong showing has already been made in this regard in 2002 with additional funding for the acute and primary care sectors as well as significant investment in services for older people, mental health and disability services in particular. It must be remembered that this was on top of the biggest increases in health expenditure in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>An additional &euro;694 million has been allocated for 2003 bringing the total health spend for next year to &euro;8.9 billion, including capital. In relation to the health strategy, this provision will enable further advancement in a range of specific areas:</P>
    <P>Action 78 relates to the provision of additional acute hospital beds for public patients. An extra &euro;53 million in 2003 has been provided for the completion of the programme of 709 additional beds in acute hospitals. The overall investment in bed capacity over 2002 and 2003 is therefore &euro;118 million, including capital.</P>
    <P>Action 55 relates to a programme of investment to provide the necessary capacity in primary care, acute hospital and other services. Additional funding of &euro;514 million is being made available to further improve health infrastructure and allow for progress on projects.</P>
    <P>Action 81 relates to the reduction of waiting times for public patients. Some &euro;31 million is available in 2003 for the treatment purchase fund, in addition to substantial base funding of &euro;43 million for the waiting list initiative.</P>
    <P>Action 61 relates to the further development of organ transplant services. In 2003, an additional &euro;4.5 million is available for the lung transplant programme at the Mater Hospital, Dublin.</P>
    <P>Actions 76 and 77 relate to the development of primary care. An additional &euro;10 million has been provided for the development of primary care including GP co-ops and primary care units in 2003.</P>
    <P>In relation to homelessness (Action 21), a total &euro;4.2 million in additional funding was provided &ndash;&euro;2.7 million targeted at adult homelessness and &euro;1.5 million targeted at youth homelessness. A further &euro;6 million was provided for the development of child care services, including family support services (Action 27).</P>
    <P>An additional &euro;7.6 million will be invested in mental health services in 2003 (Action 25).</P>
    <P>An additional &euro;28.4 million is provided for 2003 to improve services for people with disabilities and to further develop the availability of <Col N="618" />appropriate care in an appropriate setting (Actions 54 and 55).</P>
    <P>An additional sum of &euro;29 million is being allocated for cancer services in 2003. This investment will ensure that next year we will continue to address increasing demands in cancer services in such areas as oncology/haematology services, oncology drug treatments and symptomatic breast disease services (Action 12).</P>
    <P>Additional funding (&euro;7 million) has been provided for the further implementation of the cardiovascular strategy (Action 5).</P>
    <P>Further funding of &euro;12.6 million will be available in 2003 for services for older people (Actions 26 and 55).</P>
    <P>Additional funding of &euro;2.4 million has been provided for palliative care (Action 31).</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may already be aware, the economic situation, regrettably, does not allow for the extension of medical card eligibility at this time. Nevertheless, this remains an objective of the health strategy.</P>
    <P>The strategy also acknowledges the need to change, improve and develop certain aspects of the way the system operates. Almost 50 actions in the action plan for the strategy are concerned with the reform agenda. Achievements of a great many of these reforms do not require funding &ndash; they require a re-engineering of existing processes (i) to focus on the new priorities and (ii) to focus more on the patient and client as being at the centre of the care process. I expect these targets to be met. Never has the need for maximum efficiency, value for money and accountability been more acute, and these concepts are well embedded into the philosophy and practical actions of the strategy.</P>
    <P>Work is under way to ensure that strategic and service planning is in place at regional and organisation levels. This means that service plans have the strategy's goals and objectives fully embedded as part of the everyday routine of health service delivery. The implementation of the strategy is not a parallel stream of activity &ndash; it is the way business will be conducted in the system from now on. The development of processes to fully capture, monitor and evaluate system improvement and change through the planning process are also under way. Other organisational reform such as the establishment of the health boards executive also provide renewed focus on the efficiencies and improved consistency across the system to be gained from conjoint working.</P>
    <P>A key initiative which will inform and advance the reform agenda includes the ongoing work of the audit of structures and functions of the health system. The audit was commissioned in order to establish the organisational improvements needed to strengthen the capacity of the health system to meet the challenges of implementing the programme of development and growth, modernisation and reform set out in the Quality and Fairness Strategy document. A report is expected early in the new year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="619" />Work has begun on over 70 of the 121 actions in the strategy action plan. While the pace of the introduction of some elements of the strategy which require significant investment may vary, this is not the case for many other elements. In addition, it should be noted that the estimates for 2003 show that the Government have provided for 74% of the net total increase in public expenditure in the Estimates to be set aside for the health service. This demonstrates the Government's determination to continue to prioritise health. While we will, of course, take stock of progress over the medium term, it is not my intention to revise dates for the delivery of the health strategy at this time.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that implementation of the strategy involves challenges for everyone in the health system. Its implementation must be underpinned by strong management of our economy. That is our best guarantee that the health strategy will be delivered on.</P>

      <P>Persons suffering from any of the following conditions, who are not already medical card holders, may obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness (for persons under 16 years only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, Parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
      <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. There are no plans to extend medical card eligibility automatically to include children with Down's syndrome.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;65 per calendar month &ndash; rising towards &euro;70 per month from 1 January 2003 &ndash; towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>
      <P>The domiciliary care allowance is paid by health boards in respect of eligible children up to the age of 16 years who are so severely disabled or mentally handicapped that they require care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age.</P>

      <P>The home help scheme was introduced in 1972 under a provision of the 1970 Health Act. At that time, the chief executive officers of the health boards took a collective decision not to engage family members and relatives as paid home helps. This was in recognition of the fact that the initiative was not intended to replace the existing informal arrangements whereby family members and relatives provided assistance in the tasks of daily living to many old people living at home. Legally, family <Col N="621" />members are not debarred from acting as home helps but the practice has been that they provided support to older relatives, without payment. There have, I understand, been some instances where a distant relative, e.g., a cousin, has been employed as a home help but these have been in exceptional circumstances. I again emphasise that the operation of the home help scheme is a matter for the chief executive officers of the health boards. I can understand why they have misgivings about paying relatives and family members to act as home helps but I will bring the Deputy's interest and concern to the attention of the chief executive officer's to ascertain if they feel that any relaxation of the guidelines is warranted.</P>

      <P>The general medical services scheme presently makes provision for the payment of a rural practice allowance for qualifying participating doctors. The amount of the allowance is currently &euro;14,295.87 per annum. I have no plans to provide additional incentives.</P>
      <P>I would also mention the significant investment that this Government has made in the development of general practice out of hours co-operatives. The advent of these co-operatives has allowed participating general practitioners, particularly those in rural areas, to regularise and in most cases greatly reduce their out of hours commitment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government road safety strategy 1998-2002 recommended that a system of penalty points should be introduced. It was envisaged in the strategy that the system would support road safety by tracking a range of motoring offences that have a direct impact on road safety.</P>
      <P>The Road Traffic Act, 2002, which provides the legislative basis for the penalty points system, reflects that approach. The Act identifies 69 offences to which the system applies. All of these are directly related to road safety. The system has already been introduced in respect of speeding offences with effect from 31 October. I expect that the full implementation of the system will be achieved by the end of 2003.</P>
      <P>The penalty points system will be kept under review as it becomes fully operational and having regard to the forthcoming road safety strategy. The question of extending the system to cover parking offences such as illegal parking in disabled persons parking spaces would have to be justified on grounds of road safety.</P>

    <P>In accordance with the approach to the introduction of car testing that my predecessor put in <Col N="625" />place in January 2000 the reasons for refusal of a test certificate are being implemented on a phased basis. Initially, failure on a minimum range of safety critical items gave rise to a refusal of test certificate. From 1 January the range of reasons for refusal was considerably expanded. In consultation with the NCTS and the motor industry my Department is preparing to complete the phased arrangements so that all reasons for failure will constitute reasons for refusal of a test certificate from mid-2003 onwards.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to alter any of the requirements specified in the national car test manual 1999 in relation to the items to be tested in the course of a car test, the method of testing and the testing standards including those requirements concerning headlights.</P>

      <P>The national water pricing policy framework requires local authorities to recover the cost of providing water services from the users of these services, with the exception of households using the services for domestic purposes. In this regard the policy framework provides for the metering of all non-domestic users by 2006. This is in accordance with an appropriate application of the polluter pays principle and the requirements of Article 9 of the EU Water Framework Directive. It builds on the already widespread practice of charging for water services. The framework does not provide for the exemption of non-domestic users, including those engaged in the provision of educational services, from the charging policy.</P>
      <P>My Department is working closely with local authorities on the implementation of the policy by 2006 but does not collect detailed information on the number and type of water services customers at any given time.</P>

      <Quest>the role of the implementation and advisory group in view of the fact that the Government is breaching the spirit of the White Paper on supporting voluntary activity, in terms of its slashing funds for the sector, for example, the community development programme, the community employment cuts, social economy cuts, and also cuts in campaigns such as Know Racism; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 195 to 201, inclusive, together because they relate to issues associated with the implementation of the White Paper on supporting voluntary activity.</P>
      <P>The White Paper was published in September 2000. It contains a range of recommendations relating to the relationship between the State and the community and voluntary sector and also provides for a number of funding schemes. A unique feature of the White Paper is the establishment of an implementation and advisory group comprising representatives of the statutory and community and voluntary sectors which is tasked with advising on the implementation of the recommendations contained in it. The first meeting of the IAG was held in July 2001 and to date it has met on 15 occasions. The group has devised a work plan to progress the implementation of the White Paper recommendations and will review its progress after a three year period.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the IAG are: advise on a programme of research which will include quantifying the full extent of community and voluntary activity in Ireland; agree standard protocols for financial accountability in respect of the State funding the sector; monitor administrative mechanisms to underpin the effective functioning of the working relationship and discuss and agree proposals that promote integrated approaches at national level; monitor developments in accreditation of training for the sector; formulate practical proposals to further enhance support and training capacity within the sector and within other sectors; advise on the development of a regulatory framework for the sector; examine areas of overlap or gaps in statutory responsibility with regard to support for the community and voluntary sector at policy and programme level and make recommendations to resolve such situations; advise on the distribution of the &euro;2.539 million allocation for other federations and networks across the eligible areas/Votes; advise on issues relating to allocations from the national lottery surplus; oversee the publication of a comprehensive manual of funding and regular updated versions; and undertake a formal review of the workings of the group after a three year period.</P>
      <P>Matters considered by the group to date include the multiplicity of funding sources through which the sector must operate; specific funding schemes provided for in the White Paper including the development of training and supports in the sector; and accreditation of training in the sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper includes a commitment to reform the law on charities and charitable fundraising. The work of reviewing the legislation is currently under way in my Department. The community and voluntary sector will be consulted <Col N="633" />through the IAG in the process of considering this legislative reform. The Government remains fully committed to implementing the recommendations of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>As regards funding matters, provision has been made for over &euro;100 million for community affairs in my Department's Estimates. This includes funding for the community development support programme. This will enable existing commitments to be met and allow for some additional projects.</P>
    <P>In relation to the White Paper schemes for federations and networks and training and supports in the community and voluntary sector, funding will be available for these schemes over an extended timeframe. Funding for theses schemes is available for 2003.</P>
    <P>With regard to the federations and networks scheme, the funding scheme to support the role of federations and networks in the community and voluntary sector is one of a number of measures introduced by the White Paper on supporting voluntary activity with the objective of supporting and developing the sector.</P>
    <P>The scheme attracted 152 applications which required detailed examination and assessment which was carried out with the assistance of the White Paper's implementation and advisory group. The group, which consists of both statutory and voluntary representatives, advises on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>A number of issues arose in the course of processing the applications under this scheme which if considered could give rise to legal challenge. In order to ensure that eventual funding decisions command full public confidence it has been necessary to re-advertise the scheme and to seek fresh applications. Therefore, the scheme will be re-advertised at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>At this juncture I envisage that criteria for the scheme will be established by my Department following consultation with the IAG. I sincerely regret the delay in arriving at this decision and the difficulties which this has caused for applicants.</P>
    <P>With regard to the training and supports scheme, there was a strong response to the advertisement for it with 540 applications received. It has now been decided that in order to expedite the assessment of this large number of applications, and in the interests of equity, independent consultants will be recruited to make an assessment of all applications received and to make recommendations at the earliest date possible. The necessary arrangements for selection of a suitable consultant for this task are being made by my Department.</P>
    <P>The White Paper provided for a programme of research but its funding has been deferred.</P>
    <P>With regard to the community employment, social economy and Know Racism programmes, other Departments are responsible for them.</P>

      <P>According to the records of my Department the person concerned started paying social insurance contributions in the tax year commenced 6 April 1999 at which time she had reached age 63 years. She would not qualify for a standard rate or reduced rate <i>pro rata</i> old age contributory pension as she did not enter insurable employment or insurable self-employment before reaching age 56. Her application for pension was refused and she was notified accordingly.</P>
      <P>In the light of further information received, inquiries are being made to establish if contributions should have been paid on her behalf in respect of earlier periods. When these inquiries are completed her entitlement will be reviewed and she will be advised of the outcome.</P>
      <P>She has been awarded the old age non-contributory pension from 27 September, the Friday following her 66th birthday, at the weekly rate of &euro;106.50 plus a living alone of &euro;7.70 and a fuel allowance of &euro;9 per week. A payable order book has now issued to the nominated post office payable from 1 November. The arrears due will be issued shortly.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims are made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>
