      <P>I seek the suspension of the business of the House under Standing Order 31 to discuss an issue of urgent public importance; namely, the report of the national cancer registry, which shows that many patients suffering from cancer do not receive adequate treatment and that the treatment regime compares unfavourably with other countries. There is an urgent need to address the issues in the report, entitled Cancer in Ireland 1994 to 1998: Incidence, Mortality, Treatment and Survival.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach about reports this morning of fraud in Allfirst, a subsidiary of Allied Irish Banks in the United States. I do not wish to say anything that could undermine confidence in the banking system as I am conscious of its importance to the people and the economy. There are questions to be answered, however, arising from this catastrophic news. What steps does the Taoiseach intend to take to protect Irish interests at home and abroad? I note that neither the AIB press release nor the interview with the chief executive of the bank this morning referred to reporting of the fraud to the Irish Central Bank. There is a legal requirement that such a report be made.</P>
      <P>Has the Central Bank received a report of the fraud and, if so, when? Given that AIB has 31,000 staff and 98,000 shareholders worldwide, does the Taoiseach agree that confidence, both at home and abroad, in our regulatory regime should be the primary concern? Banking is a rapidly changing sector that is becoming increasingly internationalised. A row between the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance has prevented legislation, necessary for the establishment of an appropriate regulatory regime for modern international banking, from coming into this House in the past three years. Will the Taoiseach assure the House that legislation in this area will be brought forward as a matter of urgency in this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Noonan, I do not want to fuel a difficult and worrying situation for many thousands of Irish people who have invested with AIB. To amplify a question put by the Deputy, when was the Central Bank informed of the fraud? Did the Central Bank subsequently inform the Minister for Finance? Will the Minister for Finance make time available later today to make a statement to the House in relation to these matters so that the information available to him can be put into the public domain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputies Noonan and Howlin, the AIB authorities informed the Central Bank of the fraud. The Governor of the Central Bank told the Minister for Finance last evening and AIB management informed the Secretary General of my Department as a matter of courtesy. The Minister for Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank discussed the situation at a meeting last evening. AIB's statement says that it is undertaking a full investigation into foreign exchange trading operations at the Baltimore headquarters of its US subsidiary Allfirst <Col N="1395" /> and that the investigation will be carried out in the United States. The AIB will co-operate fully with that investigation.</P>
      <P>In reply to the more general questions, the bank has informed the Minister for Finance that it is still profitable to the tune of &euro;400 million. Its capital base remains strong and there is no danger to AIB account holders of any loss of funds or to the bank's solvency. Even after this event the AIB's capital adequacy ratio remains comfortably above established limits.</P>
      <P>The US Federal Reserve is the immediate regulator with which the Central Bank of Ireland will keep in close contact on this matter. The investigations will be carried out by the Federal Reserve with which the Central Bank will keep in contact on any matters which arise. The Minister for Finance will be kept informed of developments during the day as matters unfold and the exact nature of what is involved is examined. I have no more information on what the AIB included in its statement. The Central Bank is the consolidated regulator for the AIB group. In this regard the AIB's capital adequacy ratio is the key consideration for the Central Bank. The AIB's capital adequacy ratio remains comfortably above established limits.</P>
      <P>The Bill, which is complex in terms of drafting, is at the final draft stage. There is a final proof. The Central Bank's regulatory role is expanding all the time as it deals with many banks. The view in the banking world is that the Central Bank is an excellent regulator with its existing powers. This issue, therefore, does not arise. The new Bill will be brought forward shortly.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister for Finance be making a statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Ceann Comhairle. I had a meeting with the Minister today. At this stage he has no more details other than those I have given to the House. Many things are going on at bank level. Unless something happened in the past 30 minutes, I do not think the Minister can report on those matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation may change later in the day, but, as of now, the Minister has no additional information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will allow a supplementary question from Deputy Noonan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach does not need me to remind him that in the past the State was called in to rescue the AIB for which taxpayers are still paying. He will also agree that in circumstances such as this rumour is the rust which corrodes the system and that it is important that every piece of information is made public at the first available <Col N="1396" /> opportunity. When the Governor of the Central Bank consulted with the Minister for Finance last night, did he give assurances that $750 million is the extent of the fraud and that the full story is now in the public domain?</P>
      <P>It is important that the Taoiseach accedes to Deputy Howlin's request and arranges for the Minister for Finance to come into the House this afternoon to confirm, if that is all the information he has, that the full story is in the public domain. A fraud of $750 million is enormous, but it is sustainable against the background of the AIB's strong balance sheet. However, the public needs the assurance that this is the full extent of the problem, that it has been fully investigated and that everyone knows with security what the future holds. Even if no additional information is available later today, for the sake of accountability and transparency, the Minister for Finance should come into the House to stamp his authority on the information which is now in the public domain and add any new information which comes to light in the course of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Howlin has indicated that a private notice question will be tabled. I am well aware of what happened with the AIB in the mid-1980s and remember the lengths to which I had to go as Minister for Finance to sort it out years later. However, the AIB will remain profitable. That is what its customers wish to know. Its capital base remains strong and there is no danger of any loss of funds by the AIB's account holders or to the solvency of the bank. That is important to account holders and the considerable number of staff in the bank.</P>
      <P>Neither I nor the Minister for Finance can give an assurance as to the final amount of the fraud. The AIB's statement refers to the figure indicated by preliminary investigations which will have to continue. At this stage it is a case of fraud. I do not know how many are involved, but the individual referred to by the bank has mysteriously gone missing. The investigation, therefore, is taking place without the co-operation of the person, or perhaps persons, involved. This is a case of fraud and it is unlikely that all of the facts will be known that quickly. This matter will unfold and I am sure the AIB will continue to keep its customers and branches informed.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank is the consolidated regulator for the AIB group and will keep in touch with the US Federal Reserve regarding the matter. If the Minister for Finance has any additional information, I am sure he will be only too glad to make it available.</P>

      <P>The Women's Health Council was established in 1997 as a statutory body with the legal obligation and duty to advise the Minister for Health and Children on all matters relating to <Col N="1397" /> women's health. Why was it not asked for its advice in advance of the decision to publish the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill? Does the Taoiseach accept the expressed opinion of the council and its chair, Professor Cecily Kelleher, that the published legislation in the Bill is inconsistent with the national health strategy as published?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that we are sliding into a moral morass when the Minister responsible for the implementation of the legislation if the referendum is passed will talk in terms of 12 year prison sentences for anyone who transgresses the provisions of the legislation, yet he is quoted yesterday as affirming that he will give funds to health boards to ensure children in care who are pregnant as a consequence of rape or incest will be funded by the State to have abortions in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. What kind of moral morass is the Taoiseach organising for the people when the same Minister will be acting in such a contradictory fashion with the same principle issue?</P>

      <P>The status of the statutory body charged under law by this House to advise the Minister for Health and Children on women's health matters, as perceived by the Taoiseach, is now clear. Does the Taoiseach now accept, considering the views expressed by the Women's Health Council, the National Women's Council of Ireland and the Adelaide Hospital Society, that the Government's proposals are ill-conceived and flawed and should now be withdrawn in order that a proper debate on these issues may take place, with the safeguarding of women's health, which should be paramount in our considerations, at its core?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In page 4, line 37, to delete &ldquo;relating to an asset&rdquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We had a discussion on Committee Stage regarding these two amendments, which I am sure the Minister of State will recall. The case that we are putting forward is that PPP arrangements should not be specifically asset-based. One could have a situation whereby PPP arrangements could be put in place in regard to services as well.</P>
      <P>An example of that was the NCT, where the national car testing service is provided in a PPP type relationship and that is the provision of a service rather than goods. In that regard we were anxious that an amendment be made to this Bill to facilitate the broadening of the PPP theory that more arrangements could be entered into that might involve the provision of services as distinct from necessarily just assets. The Minister of State agreed on Committee Stage that he would have a look at this and come back to us on Report Stage so I am anxious to hear what he might have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke on amendment No. 1 during the Committee Stage debate, I explained that its effect, if accepted, would be to involve PPPs in the provision of a wider range of services than currently envisaged. This would run contrary to the thrust of this section of the Bill by widening the definition of services to be provided under a PPP. This would create future difficulties for stakeholders and take us into new territory to a wider range of service provision not related to this legislation or to PPPs at all.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that the example of the NCT and of services in general which are not physically attached to an asset, given by Deputies McGrath and McDowell on Committee Stage, is not excluded by the legislation. This has been looked at in some detail. As I said on Committee stage, the definition of 'asset' contained in this section of the Bill is sufficiently wide to encompass the provision of services. Combined with the current wording of section 3 (1)(<i>a</i>)(iv) this ensures the widest feasible use for PPPs, while at the same time ensuring an identifiable limit.</P>
      <P>I am again opposing the amendment. With regard to amendment No. 2, I am advised it would have the same effect as the previous proposed amendment. I am quite happy that the point being raised is more than catered for in the Bill.</P>

      <P>We had a very lengthy discussion of this on Committee Stage and I do not <Col N="1404" /> want to go over it again. I have some difficulty understanding the explanation of the Minister of State because the definition of &lsquo;asset' given in the Bill is unclear. It says it includes an existing asset or an asset to be provided under a public private partnership arrangement. That is not a definition at all. It certainly does not define the word asset as I normally understand it; a good or a chattel &ndash; something tangible. I do not see how it can be said to include a service as there is no clear definition. The point is not a fundamental one in terms of the Bill so I will not push it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) The Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act 1980 does not apply to leases entered into under <i>section 3</i> (<i>1</i>)(<i>d</i>).&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 was raised on Committee Stage. The Minister of State's response at that time indicated that there were some concerns about PPP arrangements and how the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980, might impinge on those. The rights that might be granted in a PPP arrangement might well be able to be superseded by the provisions of that Act.</P>
      <P>The Minister agreed that he would seek legal advice, indicate to us on Report Stage what that advice was and give us assurances that there would not be any difficulty arising. Based on his response we will decide on how to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage we raised concerns that somebody who had a 20 or 30 year concession which involved the lease or a licence to use land could develop rights under existing landlord and tenant legislation where it was clearly not intended that they should. We had a detailed discussion on this on Committee Stage, some of it in private session, and the Minister of State accepted that there was a net point here which would have to be dealt with in landlord and tenant legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1405" />I appreciate that the Minster of State cannot do that now but perhaps he could indicate to us that both he and the Department are satisfied that it will be possible in drawing up individual contracts to ensure that this sort of unintended legislative right will not actually arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>We had some lengthy discussion of this and since we met on Committee Stage and following on from that. As I stated then, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is currently in the process of reviewing elements of landlord and tenant legislation. Accordingly, it would be premature, as well as inappropriate, to try and deal with this issue in this Bill. However, to reiterate a reply I gave to a question from Deputy McDowell, it is not possible to exclude the provisions of existing landlord and tenant legislation by way of specific contract. It should also be noted that this issue may not arise in all PPP situations and in any event it may also be possible when drawing up a contract to establish a relationship that would not be of the landlord and tenant variety. That is a key part of what I am saying.</P>
      <P>I am advised, however, that careful conveyancing practice can be used to meet the needs of a PPP arrangement. An example of where this has been done is the contract recently signed by the Department of Education and Science for the provision of a bundle of five schools and the Deputy will be aware of this. The relationship established for the purpose of this contract was that of a licensee and licensor, rather than that of lessee and lessor. This is an issue to which some thought has been given within the central PPP unit of the Department of Finance. Relevant guidance material is in course of preparation by the unit to address this and other issues in relation to provision of PPP contracts. This guidance will issue to all State authorities in the near future. This is a complex legal question and I am advised that, while it needs to be dealt with &ndash; that is, I think, the net point on which we agree &ndash; once again, this Bill is not the appropriate vehicle for doing so. The question is wider than PPP and, consequently, needs to be dealt with in that context, that is, within the scope of the landlord and tenant legislation. It is possible, through careful conveyancing, to ensure the landlord and tenant relationship is not created. That is the net position I have taken on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat concerned by what the Minister of State has said. He has indicated very clearly that it will be a difficult legal point to address in relation to PPP and that there could well be difficulties unless it is done extremely carefully. I think he is also saying that one is stepping into uncharted waters and, because of that, he feels it will ultimately end up in the courts for decision. Perhaps my amendment may be a simplistic way of addressing the issue and the Minister of State has made the point that one cannot necessarily eliminate the rights <Col N="1406" /> under existing legislation in a subsequent Bill. Is there any other way it can be addressed in this Bill? Huge contracts will be entered into in future and one which is imminent is the Kilcock to Kinnegad bypass, for which the estimates are running close to &euro;200 million. If legal difficulties are going to arise on such contracts, threshing it out in court will be a small proportion of the cost but it could have severe consequences for Government. In that context, I am disappointed by what the Minister of State has said. I would like to see something more definite coming forward. Perhaps he will respond further with a more definite statement on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very fundamental issue, though I accept we are unlikely to resolve it here today. In essence, it is part of a PPP arrangement that we are not looking to confer tenants' rights in almost all cases on operators. We are looking to have operators maintain a road, the management of a school or a water facility. We are not looking to make them tenants of the State. I know from my relatively limited experience in these matters that it is open to the courts to construe what one would like to think of as a licence arrangement as, in fact, creating a tenancy. Even very careful conveyancing can easily fall short of the mark. I do think it will be necessary to explicitly address this issue in the context of landlord and tenant legislation, to exclude arrangements that are defined as PPP arrangements in this Bill from existing landlord and tenant rights. I appreciate the Minister of State is not going to do that now but it is important that we flag it up and that the matter is dealt with before we learn, by hard experience that it is a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the Deputies and I have spent some time, with my Department officials, looking at the issue. An important point has been raised and if it was possible to deal with it through this Bill, I would have done so. However, I cannot supersede the landlord and tenant legislation and the Deputy, as a lawyer, would understand that better than I. For that reason, I have been in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is a complex issue and I fully agree it needs to be addressed with some urgency. It has implications wider than the PPP process and of course the proper forum to deal with it is through the landlord and tenant legislation. I want this matter dealt with as quickly as possible but, given the complexity of the issue and the fundamental points that have been made, I cannot deal with it outside the framework of the landlord and tenant legislation. In the meantime, as I have outlined, where projects are going ahead, we have been as careful as we possibly can in terms of those arrangements. I have given one example of the licence arrangement by the Department of Education and Science in relation to the project involving five schools. I take Deputy McDowell's <Col N="1407" /> point that the matter could be eventually in the hands of the courts, where a judge might decide that was not strong enough and that, in his view, it was a lessor-lessee arrangement. The fundamental point made by the Deputies has to be dealt with, it does have implications and we are trying to deal with it through the landlord and tenant legislation.</P>

Noting that concern, does the Minister of State not agree he should ask Government to bring forward the promised landlord and tenant Bill as quickly as possible to address those issues within this session so that the contracts currently being drawn up can be covered by this? The tendering procedure for the new N4 will close next week and that implies moving very quickly into a contract situation. Unless the Bill to amend the Landlord and Tenant Act is brought forward, it will be too late as the contracts will already have been drawn up and signed. Is it possible for Government to bring forward that other Bill very quickly to address this issue? </P>

      <P>I do not wish to create any doubt in the House about the veracity of what we are doing with regard to contracts that are in place. There is an issue which the Deputies have rightly raised and which, as I have stated, will be dealt with in the landlord and tenant legislation. I am urging the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to bring forward that legislation to deal with this matter as quickly as possible. To date, we have good experience with the contracts that are in place and it is clear that all parties to them are satisfied. However, as the Deputies have said, we need to have certainty in the context of the landlord and tenant legislation and I urge the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to bring forward that Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5: </P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) A Ministerial Certificate will be issued if an appropriate Minister has not objected to a public private partnership arrangement of <Col N="1408" /> direct agreement within 3 months of being formally notified.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This matter also arose on Committee Stage and at that time the Minister of State indicated that this provision was not necessary &ndash; that it was a &ldquo;belt and braces&rdquo; arrangement to copperfasten what was already contained in the Bill. He said he would look at it again. Has he had an opportunity to do so? Perhaps he would give the House the benefit of that wisdom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered the matter and I have to repeat what I said on Committee Stage &ndash; that this provision is not necessary. A ministerial certificate is not required to establish a PPP. An arrangement or indirect agreement is either a PPP or it is not. The proposed amendment would introduce uncertainty which would be difficult to remove by this legislation. The purpose of this Bill is to give certainty as to what legally constitutes PPP. The possibility is that, in certain cases, there would be a waiting period and a necessity for a certificate could undermine the actual purpose of the Bill. I am happy to assure the Deputy on this point. I understand where he is coming from but, in practice, the amendment would have the opposite effect to what he is trying to achieve.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) A person seconded or transferred to a company established under this section or as a result of an arrangement entered into under section 3, shall not receive less remuneration or be subject to less beneficial conditions of service than the remuneration to which that person was entitled and the conditions of service to which that person was subject prior to the secondment or transfer.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an important amendment and it reflects in some ways the concerns of individual trade unionists and workers within the public service about the PPP process. As the Minister of State is aware, there has been a high level debate in the past few years with the social partners involving Members of this House, the Government, the relevant unit in his Department and, more recently, units in other Departments. As a result of that debate, a code of practice has been agreed with the social partners which deals, among other things, with this issue.</P>
      <P>This is a critical issue for workers employed by local authorities, health boards or the State. They want to ensure that if they end up working for a private company, a consortium or a joint venture company, their conditions of employment and pension rights will be no worse than they would have been had they remained directly in the employ of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1409" />Much of this debate is informed by what happened in the United Kingdom where the PFI initiative in the 1980s was deliberately used by the Tory Government then in power to casualise labour and substitute private investment for direct public investment. The trade union movement in the UK feels its members were greatly disadvantaged as a result of the operation of the PFI initiative. That has slowly but surely changed over time, but it was certainly the initial experience in the 1980s.</P>
    <P>It is important, in terms of trying to build a strong as opposed to a superficial consensus on this issue, that we should offer the reassurances required by individual union representatives and, to some extent, congress. I am aware the Minister of State &ndash; his senior colleague may also have done so &ndash; has met representatives of congress in recent times and discussed this issue with them. He has indicated, at least privately, that he is willing to consider a legislative response if he deems such action necessary. I assume he will not accept the amendment and I invite him to give an assurance on the record of the House that, if necessary, he will proceed to put in place a legislative response. I also invite him to give whatever vocal assurances he can to workers, trade union members and people who work within the public service that they will not be transferred, against their will, into the employ of joint venture or private companies on conditions that will be less favourable than those which currently apply to them.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will also address the point raised on Committee Stage, namely, the transfer of the undertakings directive from Brussels which was agreed approximately six months ago. Will he indicate whether it is his understanding that pensions, for example, will be covered by that directive? When is it intended the directive will become law in Ireland?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have spent an enormous amount of time dealing with this issue, even since Committee Stage, and further high level discussions have taken place with the different parties involved. The debate was quite lengthy and an absolute understanding of where we are going was reached. In my opinion, we have arrived at that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already spoken on this issue on several occasions, most recently on Committee Stage. I repeat that the Government fully accepts that employees who transfer to a company established under PPP arrangements should have no less beneficial remuneration and terms and conditions of service than those to which they were previously entitled. The inclusion of a provision to this effect in the framework for public private partnerships, which was agreed with the social partners and launched by the Minister for Finance last November, is a measure of the Government's commitment to addressing this issue. Furthermore, the Government is also fully committed to giving legislative effect, wherever it considers this is <Col N="1410" /> necessary, to its commitment to the employees in question. The statutory framework for the treatment of these employees is in the course of being developed and in the interim it would be premature, as well as inappropriate, to attempt to deal with it in the type of enabling legislation represented by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Having discussed this matter at length with the social partners, I am of the opinion that they want the bigger issue resolved and not merely the specific issue with which the amendment deals. A commitment to resolve the larger issue, which covers a range of areas, is important to them.</P>
    <P>I explained on Committee Stage that I simply cannot accept the proposal, as resubmitted here by Deputy McDowell, to amend the Bill. I assure the House that very careful consideration has been given to this matter. Since the debate on Committee Stage I have taken further legal advice and have consulted with a number of parties who are centrally involved in this issue, including representatives of the trade union movement. It is not possible to accept this amendment for reasons I will now outline.</P>
    <P>The current Bill is not the appropriate instrument in which to deal with this issue. This point was well made by Deputy McDowell on Committee Stage when he acknowledged that this concern of the trade union movement is not dealt with in the Bill. I welcome his appreciation of the difficulty posed by trying to deal with this issue in enabling legislation of such narrow scope. I am not in disagreement with the aim of his amendment, it is simply that this is not the correct vehicle for dealing with it.</P>
    <P>With regard to terms and conditions of employment and remuneration, there is already an extensive body of law and regulation in place which is currently in the course of supplementation. These issues fall properly to be dealt with within that legislation, in the context of our existing industrial relations machinery and in the context of EU development.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may also be aware, my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is currently in discussion with the social partners on the implementation in law in this area and it would be prudent to await the outcome of same. We have had discussions with her Department with regard to the overall issue on foot of the important points raised on Committee Stage. The social partners are aware of this and are also involved in direct discussions on the wider issue.</P>
    <P>I wish in particular to stress, and take this opportunity to formally put on the record of the House, that S.I. 306/1980 and S.I. 487/2000, which give effect to the EU's acquired rights directives, will apply to PPPs. Furthermore, any subsequent primary or secondary legislation on this issue will also be applicable to PPPs.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the Government's commitment to delivering an appropriate framework for dealing with the issues of transferred employees. In the meantime, the central policy unit of my Depart<Col N="1411" /> ment will address this and other key issues in the interim guidance which will issue to State authorities on the overall operation of PPPs. It is vital for the success of the PPP process that best practice is applied across a range of issues, including human resources.</P>
    <P>In proposing this amendment on Committee Stage, Deputy McDowell quoted the experience of employees involved in PFI projects in the UK. As the Deputy knows, the PPP process in Ireland is substantially different in many respects from the PFI process in the UK and particularly so in the case of transferring staff. The experience of PFI in the UK has led many public authorities and bodies in that country to adopt a dramatic change in approach and move towards the model being operated in Ireland. A major factor in the success to date of PPP in this country, as is widely acknowledged, is the partnership approach we have adopted which ensures the interest of all those involved in PPP projects are catered for by consensus.</P>
    <P>I hope the detailed points I have placed on record outline the precise current position in respect of this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for placing so much information on record. He went some distance towards meeting people's concerns. However, I invite him to be more specific on one point. In the guidelines his Department will issue to the various bodies under its aegis, will it ensure &ndash; pending the introduction of any legislative framework that will be put in place &ndash; that no workers are transferred, contrary to their will, to employment where levels of remuneration and conditions are less favourable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important issue and our experience to date in respect of it has been extremely positive. It would clearly not be in the interests of any of the parties involved, particularly the State, to end up in a situation such as that about which the Deputy is concerned because it would become impossible to deliver individual projects. The social partners and the Government are fully aware of that. As already stated, discussions are taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the directive to which the Deputy referred to be implemented, but a decision on that matter is not my responsibility. Discussions are also taking place on that matter. As the Deputy stated on Committee Stage, one would have thought the directive might have been implemented last year. The delay has been caused by the complexity of the discussions between the partners involved and the difficulty in reaching a conclusion. I am satisfied there is an intent on all sides to resolve this fundamental issue, but it is not for me to resolve it in the context of this legislation. I reiterate that the legislation, when introduced, will apply directly to PPPs. I do not believe I made it clear to the Deputy that, in the <Col N="1412" /> interim, we will deal with this issue in the guidance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State did not give me the assurance the trade union movement seeks, that no workers will be transferred into less remunerative employment in the interim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be set down in the guidance in agreement with the social partners, who are fully aware of this. It is not for me to speak on behalf of anybody else, but my sense is that the real thrust of the social partners in their discussions, particularly the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, was to have the broad issue dealt with. They accept that I cannot deal with it specifically here and to do so might undermine it. The aim was to emphasise across the spectrum that this is needed, and I have no disagreement with that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.&ndash;The Minister for Finance will report to the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service on a six-monthly basis on the operation of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We discussed this amendment on Committee Stage. It deals with accountability, the need for the Minister to be accountable to the House for what happens in the context of public private partnership arrangements and for a mechanism whereby they can be reviewed and commented upon by Members of this House on a regular basis. The committee procedure in this House is ideal for undertaking such work. In that regard we felt it important that the Minister should be compelled to report to the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service on a six-monthly basis. Public private partnership arrangements are relatively new in Ireland. They will involve new procedures and arrangements for many public services. It is important, therefore, that the House is kept abreast of how they are developing and what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister, perhaps today, give us a brief description of how PPP arrangements will work and what procedures will be in place for reviewing and reporting on what is happening in relation to them. Let us take the example of the proposed N4 from Kilcock to Kinnegad, which I mentioned earlier. It is assumed that the price of that will be in the region of &euro;200 million. Will the Minister give us a rough idea of the proportion of capital that will come from State funds for projects such as that and the basis on which such capital investment will be made by the State? Will it be based on a guaranteed return for the private company that enters into the agreement? For example, if it is decided to charge a toll of £1.60 or &euro;1.60 and that is based on a certain number of cars using the road, what happens if that target is <Col N="1413" /> not met and the returns expected on the tolls are not achieved? Will the State have to pay the additional funds?</P>
    <P>The proposed bypass of Fermoy is a case in point. We have all received literature about it. It is now expected that a toll will be charged for using that bypass. The calculations were based on a throughput of 20,000 vehicles per day travelling from Fermoy to Cork on that road. Now the number of cars expected to use the road has diminished considerably because of resistance around Fermoy to paying a toll. In that case, will it be the private end of the partnership that will have to pick up the tab for the reduced number of vehicles or will the contract be so tight that the State will have to pick up the tab? If that is the case, is there any risk for the private investors?</P>
    <P>The toll bridge on the M50 has made enormous profits. The company involved there entered into an agreement to build a bridge and operate it for a certain length of time, which comes to an end fairly soon. It made enormous profits and is now building a second bridge to enhance the situation there and, it is hoped, improve the flow of traffic. Again it will have a contract for several years. It is interesting to note that in the run-up to Christmas it cost 80p to cross the toll bridge. Shortly before Christmas that was increased to £1 and now it is &euro;1.30. The company cannot be accused of increasing the fare because of the euro. I would say it got in just before the euro was introduced and imposed a very substantial increase in the toll in anticipation of a review in the context of the euro. That also begs the question in relation to a point made by Deputy McDowell in the course of debate on the Finance Bill last year about whether a reduction in VAT from 21% to 20% would be passed on. In the event, the reduction was not passed on at places such as toll bridges and car parks at Dublin Airport, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in his wisdom perhaps, put the VAT charge back up to 21% this year.</P>
    <P>People are concerned about how well these matters will be policed in the future. How can we be assured that a toll that starts out at &euro;1.60 on the road from Kinnegad to Dublin will be kept within reasonable limits and will not escalate at a tremendous rate? People in that area, in Kinnegad, Rochfortbridge and Mullingar, are commuting on a regular basis. If toll roads are in place it will become very expensive to work in Dublin and that will have a hugely detrimental effect on those hinterlands. I wonder what the Minister has to say about that.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with accountability and the ability of the select committee to hear from the Minister on a regular basis on how this Act is working, how it is affecting the Exchequer and the taxpayer and the possibility of input from Members on how it is working. We are anxious that such a procedure be formally in place and that it not be just an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement.</P>
    <Col N="1414" />
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several different levels of accountability that we need to address. One relates to the process as it is rolled out over the next two or three years. It seems clear that public private partnership arrangements will take up a greater part of the infrastructural projects rolled out in recent years. If the recent Exchequer returns for the month of January are anything to go by, the days of large Exchequer surpluses which could directly fund many capital projects are, at least for the moment, no longer with us. Clearly we will see more PPP arrangements in the next few years than we might otherwise have done. The Minister has acknowledged that to do this &ndash; this strain has been running through our entire debate at various stages here &ndash; will require a framework and guidelines at different levels both within line Departments and in other public authorities, between the social partners and so on. There will be a need for some supervision there, which I am sure the Minister acknowledges and which can easily be achieved by virtue of the Minister or other line Ministers attending various committees of the House.</P>
      <P>A greater difficulty arises in relation to individual projects. There is obviously a danger that once a project is in place it will effectively disappear off the radarscope altogether and we will not hear of it again. Whenever a question is raised we will be told that it is a PPP arrangement and, therefore, there is no direct accountability on the part of the Minister to the House. That means that individual Members of the House are not in a position to query anything. Clearly, these are projects that will involve a stream of income into the State and, doubtless, money going from the State to pay the concessionaire over a period of years. The Minister indicated during Committee Stage that the Comptroller and Auditor General would still have functions in relation to that. I invite him to repeat that because I was not totally clear about what was said on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>However, beyond the competence of the Comptroller and Auditor General to look at those payments, is there accountability to the House or to individual committees on the part of the Minister in relation to those payments? If there is accountability in relation to the payments, there can be some sort of supervisory role in relation to the contract and to the workings of a given road project. There is a need to ensure that we still have some focus on accountability for particular projects and that we do not lose all control over them once a licence agreement is signed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. In my constituency at Fermoy there is a welcome proposal to bypass the town. However, there is also a proposal to establish a toll plaza at Rathcormack. This is causing many problems for people in the area and is a form of double taxation. The issue of accountability has to be taken into account. Who will account for the money that will be taken in? Is it an open-ended situation with <Col N="1415" /> regard to time? The practicality of the situation means that people may avoid the toll and drive through the town, which will defeat the purpose of the bypass. It is important that we have accountability and this is a good amendment.</P>
      <P>Members often talk about the democratic process. The citizens, who are sovereign after all, are concerned that bureaucracy is getting further and further away. Many Members on all sides have voiced the concern that we do not seem able to interact with many of the agencies involved. On writing to them, they do not write back; on telephoning them, they will not return calls; and if one puts down a question in the House to a Minister, one is told the Minister does not have responsibility in that area. It is no surprise that people are apathetic, annoyed and are not voting. They are voting for fringe candidates, as is their right. It is up to the Government to rein this situation in. There is a small opportunity to do something about the situation with this amendment.</P>
      <P>State agencies should be accountable, at least for information purposes, to Members of this House and to the citizens. That is not happening and it is causing annoyance and anger. Members on all sides have voiced opinions on this but I have seen no action taken. The Minister should tell us whether the Government plans to do something about this so that at least this House will be treated with an amount of respect when Members contact such bodies. The Minister should let us know his plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate has gone way beyond the scope of the amendment but I will try to deal with all issues raised. As I said on Committee Stage, I cannot accept the proposed amendment. While I have no disagreement with the principle of accountability, I cannot with good reason accept this proposal. This Bill is simply enabling legislation to ensure that the listed State authorities have the power to enter into PPP arrangements. It is not intended to deal with reporting arrangements for public private partnerships. These issues will be dealt with under existing provisions for Government accounting and financial procedures. Furthermore, the central PPP policy unit of my Department is preparing policy guidelines for the conduct of PPP arrangements which will make provision for reporting and accountability of public private partnerships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have taken on board the comments made by Deputies McGrath, McDowell and others with whom I had no disagreement on Committee Stage on this matter. I agree there should be a mechanism to allow the Dáil and its committees to receive updates on what is happening. In the guidance documents, which as a result of discussions are being prepared by the central PPP unit of my Department, I have arranged to introduce relevant reporting and accounting procedures. As Deputies know, all Ministers can be called to committees at any stage with regard to any issue. That is becoming much more common. <Col N="1416" /> I confirm to Deputy McDowell the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General in this. There is no question about that.</P>
    <P>The Deputies addressed wider issues and I understand the concerns about road projects such as those at Kilcock, Kinnegad, Fermoy and elsewhere. While the Deputies will appreciate that I cannot go into the details of individual contracts at this stage, it is the policy of the Government that road tolls be part of PPPs but that an alternative non-tolled route would be available in every case. Also, it is not intended to toll existing routes. I have a similar problem to other Deputies in my constituency at Waterford where there is a substantial bypass. That is not specifically for people living close to the city and I do not see them using the toll road on every occasion. There are obvious occasions when they will use it but it will not be convenient on other occasions.</P>
    <P>Toll charges are an integral part of the toll scheme determined by the National Roads Authority. The benefits of congestion-free, high class roads and shorter journey times must offset the cost of toll charges. Many who have travelled on the continent come home merrily saying how great it was to be able to get from A to B. They believe it was the best way to travel despite having to pay for the service. It is the same in Ireland. The notion that it is compulsory to travel on the bypass and pay the toll is wrong. It will clearly be cost-beneficial for those using the toll roads in terms of time saved and transport costs lowered.</P>
    <P>In an overall sense, the pilot schemes in the PPP process are part of a learning process for us. I am not saying everything is absolutely perfect. We will learn as we develop the system. However, I am confident that the basis on which we are starting in the PPP process, and the way that we have approached it with the social partners and others involved, give us the best possible opportunity and is the approach we should take. We have learned from the wrong direction taken in the UK with PFIs, something we would not touch at all. The UK is now coming much closer to our legislation. On balance, there is now real accountability and I am putting that into the guidelines also. I have gone a long way to meeting the requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment because the key to any of these programmes and arrangements will be accountability. We must account for taxpayers money and that has to be accountable to the people that matter. Surely, the Members of the House are the people who matter in this regard in that they can then report back to their constituents. I hope the kind of arrangements the Minister will put in place will be adequate to meet those needs. Perhaps, at a later stage, he might bring before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service the proposals he has to insert into these arrangements so that we can discuss them. We <Col N="1417" /> are anxious that there be accountability in this regard.</P>
      <P>As Members of this House, we have passed away accountability over the years to all sorts of bodies. The one that jumps at us and which we all talk about is the NRA. We set up the NRA; it was supposed to be the be-all and end-all of everything. What has happened? We have given the NRA complete control and authority over what is happening with our roads. We have no input into what it is doing. If we ask a Minister what is happening regarding the NRA and the roads, we are told the Minister is neither accountable nor responsible. The NRA does not come before committees to account for what it is doing, or it does so rarely. We need to claw back many of the areas of responsibility that we have given away. It is a mistake for Members not to be in a position to review such things and make their views felt.</P>
      <P>On the basis that the Minister is prepared to come back before the committee with his proposals and the recommendations that he will build into the guidelines for these arrangements, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the accountability of specific projects. We appreciate that a contract cannot be changed unilaterally and that policy is not being made by this House when it comes to a contract for the operation of a particular road, but Members need access to information on how a contract is being operated, if a toll is changed or a bypass works in a particular way. I am not satisfied that such information will be available under the guidelines as they currently stand. I suspect that in two years we will be told that the Fermoy bypass is a PPP arrangement and outside the scope of the House and even the NRA in so far as its functions have been supplanted by the PPP and that, therefore, no information can be given. That is an undesirable situation and a mechanism must be put in place to ensure it does not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the broad thrust of what the Deputies are saying. Dáil Éireann has the ultimate responsibility in these matters. I subscribe to that view, not just in this context, but in many others. In some issues I would prefer to see accountability and control returned to Ministers; we rushed to distance ourselves from certain projects for the right reasons, but in some cases it was the wrong approach. As provision for accountability was not included, I am changing the approach to include provisions that had not been thought of before the discussion on Committee Stage. The new approach will strengthen this area and insert a reporting provision. That is a step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1418" />There are two sides to this. We cannot go through the minutiae of a contract in terms of its commercial importance, legal position and primacy between the parties involved. In the broad thrust of the operation of a scheme, however, if there are any pitfalls, Ministers should be asked to examine the situation without getting into the fine detail of the contract.</P>
    <P>The guidelines and the negotiations on any contract will work out the issues referred to by Deputy McGrath, particularly risk transfer. That is how PPPs have to be worked out &ndash; on a contract by contract basis within the framework. I envisage committees calling people before them to examine, not the fine detail of a contract, but its broad operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Bill has passed through the House, the Government has taken on board the concerns expressed by a number of commentators. That is its strength. While some concerns I have outlined could not be addressed in the context of the legislation, the Government is committed to addressing key issues in other ways.</P>
      <P>It is acknowledged that the questions of pay, pensions and terms and conditions of public sector employees transferring to PPP undertakings need to be fully addressed to which the Government is committed to doing. The Bill is enabling legislation. Its purpose is to ensure the State authorities listed in the Schedule to the Bill have the power to enter into PPP arrangements. There is already an extensive body of law and regulation concerning human resource issues which will be dealt with properly under that legislation and in the context of our existing industrial relations framework. It would not be good law to attempt to deal with them in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill can contribute to the creation of an environment that offers the private sector sufficient encouragement to avail of the many opportunities available in the State to participate in PPPs. Crucially, it also safeguards the interests of the Exchequer and, ultimately, those of the citizens. It is my firm belief that PPPs can offer a win-win situation for all concerned. I hope to see widespread support within the House for the Government's efforts to create the environment in which this new method of public procurement can flourish.</P>
      <P>I thank those Members who have given so much thought to the Bill and been so constructive and helpful. I also thank my officials, the social partners and others involved for their constructive approach to the process. It has been most helpful.</P>

      <P>There has been some scepticism in the trade union movement and my party about the PPP process and it is important that we proceed with sensitivity. The essential project is the improvement and extension of public services and infrastructure. We do not want to supplant the management of existing public services or privatise them, we want to find a way in which additional and improved public services can be made available using the respective expertise of the State and the private sector.</P>
      <P>It is important that we maintain a measure of perspective. We do not want to transfer excessive risk to the private sector, we should retain within the State sector risk appropriate to it. We should bear in mind that it is still the responsibility of Government and the House to ensure public services and infrastructure are delivered. We have the primary role and responsibility. While we should work with the private sector, where appropriate, we must not lose the run of ourselves, but remember that the primary duty is ours.</P>
      <P>The PPP unit in the Department of Finance is now up and running and there is no doubt that its expertise will filter down to individual State authorities in years to come.

The proof of this pudding will be very much in the eating and while we should proceed <Col N="1420" /> with some ambition, we must also proceed with care and sensitivity in partnership with the social partners.</P>

      <P>Despite a long and intensive debate on Committee Stage we were presented yesterday with a raft of amendments we had not seen before. Some of them are technical. This has happened with previous legislation.</P>
      <P>Given that the Bill was passed by the Seanad on 23 May 2001, I fail to understand why, at the 11th hour, the Minister of State has introduced technical amendments. Why could they not have been introduced on Committee Stage or shortly afterwards?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is aware that we have taken the Bill seriously and have tried to be as constructive as possible. We have devoted much time to it and it is unfair to treat the House in this way. The Minister of State should have introduced these amendment earlier to give us the opportunity to research them and hold a proper debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the comments of colleagues on the other side of the House. The House passed a motion earlier permitting the reversion to Committee Stage, where necessary, without debate. A number of very important matters set out in the amendments were not included in the Bill as published. If I was on the same side of the House as Deputy Stanton and Deputy Sargent I would ask the same questions. There are cogent reasons for including these important urgent technical measures in the Bill, which was deemed to be the most appropriate vehicle for their implementation. They are not politically motivated.</P>
      <P>The POS order needs to be made as soon as possible to facilitate the rapidly narrowing timeframe for the construction by the ESB of the two new peat fired stations at Shannonbridge, County Offaly, and Lanesborough, County Longford, and the orderly closure of existing peat stations. All in the House would aspire to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1421" />The amendments are also urgently required to pave the way for the issue of contracts to the successful bidders in the most recent alternative energy requirement competition, AER V. Deputies will be aware that the announcement on AER V was made by me on Monday and I am anxious to see the early development of all the successful projects. I am sure colleagues in the House will join me in that resolve. In that context, it is appropriate that the Bill should be the vehicle for the necessary amendments, especially given the time constraints. These provisions will be consolidated in the forthcoming electricity Bill, which will shortly be sent to the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting. It is due to be introduced in 2003.</P>

      <P>Recommital is necessary in connection with amendment No. 1 as it does not arise out of Committee State proceedings. Amendment No. 1 is consequential on amendment No. 43 and on amendments Nos. 44, 45 and 46, which form a composite proposal. I therefore propose to take amendments Nos. 1, 43, 44, 45 and 46 together by agreement.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 10, after &ldquo;IRELAND&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;; TO AMEND THE GAS ACT 1976, TO AMEND THE ELECTRICITY REGULATION ACT 1999,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I thank my colleagues across the floor of the House for their co-operation in the recommital of amendments to Committee Stage for the purpose of dealing with these very important issues. Amendment No. 1 proposes to amend the Long Title of the Bill to reflect the changes I propose to make in amendments Nos. 43, 44, 45 and 46.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 43 provides for an increase in Bord Gáis Éireann's current borrowing limit, from £550 million to &euro;1.7 billion. This increase is an integral component in ensuring the completion of the ongoing major infrastructure developments being progressed by the company, including the pipeline to the west and the second Scotland-Ireland interconnector. In the next two years the majority of the capital expenditure involved in <Col N="1422" /> this huge investment programme will be utilised as materials are ordered and construction begins. This increase in the statutory borrowing limit of the company is essential as it will provide BGE with the flexibility to manipulate its borrowings to obtain the best value in terms of interest rates and allow the board the resources it requires to manage and successfully complete the projects.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 44 to 46, inclusive, provide for necessary technical amendments to the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, which deals with public service obligations. The principle of public service obligations was debated in detail and accepted at the time of the passing of the Act. The Minister there proposes to introduce a public service obligation order under the Act, requiring the ESB to purchase the output of certain peat and renewable electricity generating stations in the interest of security of supply and environmental protection.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission approved PSO arrangements in respect of peat generation on 30 October last and in respect of renewable sustainable generation on 15 January. The Office of the Attorney General has deemed it necessary to amend section 39 of the 1999 Act to ensure compliance with the EU Commission requirements in so far as the PSO funding mechanism is concerned.</P>
    <P>These amendments essentially constitute a technical modification to section 39 to ensure the PSO funding mechanism relates to the maximum import capacity of various categories of electricity accounts held by final customers rather than the actual consumption of electricity by final customers as had been provided for in section 39 of the 1999 Act. In the latter case, the EU Commission would have insisted that imports of electricity be exempted from the levy and this would have an extremely distorting impact on the Irish electricity market. The revised PSO funding mechanism will not result in an unfair burden on any category of customer and will not distort the market. There are other related amendments to section 39 of the 1999 Act to facilitate the smooth operation of the PSO levy mechanism.</P>
    <P>The Sustainable Energy Bill was identified as the most appropriate vehicle to provide for such urgent technical amendments. The PSO order needs to be made as soon as possible to facilitate the rapidly narrowing time frame for the construction by the ESB of the two new fire stations at Shannonbridge and Lanesboro and the orderly closure of the existing peat stations as already stated. The amendment is also urgently needed to pave the way for the issuing of contracts to the successful bidders in the most recent Aer 5 competition. Deputies will be aware that the announcement was made on Monday. I am sure everybody joins me in the aspiration to see these projects built at the earliest possible date. In that context it is appropriate that this Bill is the vehicle for the amendments.</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to the amendment of the Electricity Act, 1999, will be consolidated in <Col N="1423" /> the forthcoming electricity Bill which will shortly be sent to the Chief Parliamentary Counsel for drafting. It is due to be introduced next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I was shocked to learn that the Sustainable Energy Bill was being used as a vehicle to put through the PSO aspect to burning peat. It is strange to regard the gas loans as part of a sustainable energy strategy in the long-term. As mentioned during the debate on the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Bill, gas has a role in a transition period to a sustainable energy economy but it cannot be depended upon. It is finite. It is also a greenhouse gas emitter. The Minister did not refer to that. It is simply a case of increasing the loan facility for Bord Gáis and thereby increasing gas consumption. That is not in line with what I would think is supposed to be the spirit of sustainable energy legislation.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Foreign Affairs mentioned in his letter to us in the committee, this is a miscellaneous amendment to the Sustainable Energy Bill. If it is miscellaneous it should be in line with the spirit and the principles of the Bill. Whatever about the gas amendment, the PSO that allows for favourable treatment for peat fired generating stations is certainly an oxymoron in terms of sustainable energy. It is not reconcilable with sustainable energy strategy, no matter how strong the case for peat fired stations is from a political rather than technical background. It does not stand up to scrutiny.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned security of supply. Security of supply is a short-term consideration when it comes to peat. We are running out of peat. I fail to see how he can argue that this is helping security of supply. It would be far preferable to focus on energy conservation and renewable energy sources if we are serious about security of supply and having our fossil fuel resources safeguarded for use in emergencies rather than burn them as quickly as possible and then wonder what we will do next. That appears to be what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister mentions environmental protection as a reason for this PSO it is even more mystifying as to where he is coming from. It is widely known, and the Minister knows it as much as anybody else, that peat fired electricity generation is not good in terms of greenhouse gases. It may be cleaner than it was in the past but there is still a low level of compliance with greenhouse gas emission targets. When all is said and done, this set of amendments turns the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle on its head and we have a new principle, the &ldquo;victim pays principle&rdquo;. Not only will there be a surcharge on the ESB bill initially from this public service obligation to burn environmentally unsound peat but in only a matter of years, 2008-2012 most likely, greenhouse emissions trading will be introduced and again taxpayers will pay on the nose, on top of the surcharge on the ESB bill, for having overshot our greenhouse gas emissions targets once <Col N="1424" /> more. It is astonishing that we have integrated into a Sustainable Energy Bill, if the Government amendments are passed, dimensions which are at variance with the principles of such a Bill. That is the view of many environmental NGOs and people who are interested in the energy question. It is important to relearn our obligations under the Kyoto Protocol and the definition of &ldquo;sustainable energy&rdquo; because these amendments are an oxymoron when set beside the principles and objectives of an energy sustainable policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfair to present us with these amendments at the eleventh hour. It raises questions as to why this is done. People will ask whether the Minister of State is trying to get something through quickly without proper scrutiny. There is always a danger when this practice takes place that mistakes will be made. I ask the Government not to do this. The least the Minister of State could have done was to let us know three or four days ago that he was about to do this and give us an opportunity to reflect on the amendments and to provide a briefing. To surprise us with these amendments at the eleventh hour is wrong and most unfair and raises all kinds of suspicions as Deputy Sargent has said. Why does the Minister of State insist on doing it this way? I accept he mentioned that certain developments occurred on 30 October. That is a long time ago. I am sure he had these amendments in mind for some time and he could have let us know about them.</P>
      <P>I recognise the importance of these amendments and the importance of a PSO but I see a contradiction in having them inserted in the Sustainable Energy Bill. However, there is a debate as to whether peat is a sustainable energy source. In Scandinavia, it is said it is a renewable energy source and it has mechanisms in place where the bogs can be renewed.</P>

How will the price of electricity affect the consumer? Will it go up or down or remain the same? If the price rises, will domestic or industrial consumers be affected? What will be its impact? I understand there has been a shift in various rates. I ask the Minister of State to clarify the impact the measure will have on the consumer for the benefit of the many thousands listening to this very important debate and the reporters taking copious notes in the Press Gallery?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the attention of the House and the roughly 60 journalists who cover its proceedings to what is going on here. The proposal in amendment No. 43 is to increase the borrowing limit under the Gas Act by in or around &euro;1 billion. Immediately after debating this Bill we will debate the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 2001, which proposes to increase the borrowing limit of the Housing Finance Agency by in excess of &euro;4 billion, not for housing purposes, but for a variety of infrastructural purposes, including water, sewerage and waste management.</P>
      <P>Like a conjurer, the Government, in the personage of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, held up a budget before Christmas and informed the House there would be no borrowing as it had balanced the books. All the Fianna Fáil Members lined up behind the Minister to applaud him for reaching the line without borrowing. It is now clear what is happening. The Government is using legislation which would not normally attract front page headlines to introduce borrowing by the back door. For example, today the House has before it two legislative proposals which will increase Government borrowing limits by &euro;5 billion. As it happens, the Labour Party agrees with the principle of borrowing for capital and infrastructural purposes. Therefore, I have no great difficulty with this.</P>
      <P>We know that all aspects of the national development plan, whether in relation to energy or physical infrastructure, are way behind schedule. The construction industry has criticised the Government because the national development plan and infrastructural projects are not proceeding apace and for effectively holding back funding for it. A person with even a minuscule appreciation of economics can see that borrowing is going to be a fact of life with regard to the funding of the national development plan. The problem, however, is that we have a Government which publicly pretends it is not borrowing and will not do so, and a Minister for Finance who, in his five years in office, has made a career of declaring he will not borrow. Because he has got himself into a hole in which borrowing for capital and infrastructural purposes cannot be avoided, the Government has found a means by which it can borrow by the back door, namely, using legislation which, as I said, would not normally attract front page headlines, to introduce borrowing at the last minute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have reached Report Stage of the Bill. However, because a Government amendment contains a new proposal to introduce borrowing, it must be recommitted. The Government, which preached a message of no borrowing and based its budgetary strategy on the fiction that there <Col N="1426" /> would be no borrowing is, in effect, introducing proposals by which borrowing will take place through State agencies rather than directly through the Exchequer. The amendment is very simple. It is a proposal by a Government which pretends publicly it is not borrowing to borrow by the back door.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise several points, particularly with regard to the PSO and the relationship between Bord na Móna and the ESB. I make no secret of the fact that my angle on the issue is different from Deputy Sargent, for whom I have great respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There are not many bogs in north Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very important bog in north Dublin, the Bog of the Ring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bring a little balance to this very serious matter. There is no reason we will not be left with a huge amount of bogland, given its immense size. Despite the tiger economy of the past five to seven years, vast areas did not benefit from a single job created by the promotion of foreign investment by the IDA. My constituency, which is peripheral to this debate, happens to be one such region, as are parts of counties Offaly and Longford. The only asset these regions have possessed since my childhood and for generations before were the boglands.</P>
      <P>About 25 years ago Bord na Móna decided to build a peat briquette factory in Ballyforan on the border between County Galway and County Mayo, a place Deputy Gilmore will know extremely well. The company went to the trouble of buying 20,000 acres of virgin bog which, to put it in the language of east Galway, a snipe could not stand on. In other words, it would cost too much to drain, had never been cut for turf and could not, therefore, be used. It was bought from the farming community and others at a knockdown price in County Galway, which I know best, County Roscommon and parts of County Offaly.</P>
      <P>While it may not have been worth much, I distinctly remember a commitment was given at the time to create jobs in the factory. Because there would be jobs where there were none and the sons and daughters of the bog owners would get them, they felt they would get their money back indirectly. Unfortunately &ndash; in this respect successive Governments share the blame &ndash; the factory was not built because there were no markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened? The half drained 20,000 acres, which could not be used for any other purpose, <Col N="1427" /> changed from a bird sanctuary to another use during the years. The power station at Shannonbridge, like the one in Lanesborough, operated using a technology that did not fit the environmental standards of this age. Believing it had an absolute right to proceed with the work, Bord na Móna went to a great deal of trouble to successfully acquire a technology compatible with today's standards. Because it is almost drained out, the area of bogland concerned, located in four counties, cannot be used for other purposes. This bogland has no connection with raised bogs which have environmental value. This is a very important point. The technology and the funding are in place. I understand there was an objection to An Bord Pleanála and that a decision will be made on it in the next couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>I refer to the several hundred families in the midlands, east Galway and in Roscommon and to the PSO about which we are talking and the amendment the Minister of State is introducing today which has to do with the electricity regulation Act, if I understand it correctly. What this means, in effect, is that the ESB and Bord na Móna via the Government have been able to do a deal on the price of the raw material. If I am wrong, the Minister of State should tell me, but that is my understanding. Furthermore, I understand that for a number of business reasons, it is important that this amendment is passed today. If it is as important as I think, I thank the Minister of State for introducing that part of it. It is important that we show everyone concerned that there are much needed jobs involved in this development and say that we are not, under any circumstances and irrespective of the lifetime of those bogs, talking about the raised bogs which many botanists and others want to preserve for generations. I want to make that clear. A specific area of the country has been earmarked for this purpose for many years.</P>
    <P>When replying the Minister of State might outline the exact connection between the amendment which will be put through via Bord na Móna and the ESB. Will he explain the significance to the ESB under that set of circumstances?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great interest and, as Deputy Connaughton will know, I did not mention the habitat issue because I appreciate there are different types of bogland and areas where peat has been extracted. They have different values in terms of habitat protection. That is something to be dealt with presumably by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera. I listened carefully to Deputy Gilmore as well and the points he made reinforced a suspicion I have in regard to the public private partnerships which are another form of borrowing given that it is the people who have to repay the investment over the years. The Government can claim it is not involved in the repayment but ultimately it is infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" />The real issue I wish to home in on is that first of all we are talking about making an amendment to a Sustainable Energy Bill and that presumes we can stand over everything in that Bill being in line with the principles of sustainable energy. We have fallen far short of that objective in pursuing these amendments from the Government because there are alternatives if we are to have a debate on peat and the economic life of populations and communities in the midlands, in particular.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that money will have to be spent on these peat stations. It is not as if they are going to grow on trees &ndash; to use the term which would be an introduction to a discussion on biomass which has potential where there is cutaway bog and where there is a need for energy generation, employment and the associated advantages and benefits. The cost of investing in peat fired stations is significant and involves major investment in those communities. I would not for one moment take away from the need for investment in those communities. This is not, however, the best way to spend the money, particularly as the rest of the consumers of electricity will pay part of the cost through a public service obligation. All of us will pay again on the double when carbon trading is forced on us because of our failure to comply with internationally agreed obligations, such as the Kyoto protocol which, as the Minister of State knows, is only the start of those obligations. That is a cost at which we are looking down the line.</P>
    <P>It is very short-sighted to say this will be an assistance to communities when those communities will benefit from only part of the money being spent. In the long-term, they will end up paying for the mistakes we are about to embark on if this Government amendment is passed. The thinking here is short-sighted and, to add insult to injury, it is being included in a Sustainable Energy Bill where it does not belong. Let it be separate and let us discuss the merits of the issue. To try to tag it on, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, would say, as a miscellaneous amendment to this Bill is wrong and it certainly does not assist us in developing a sustainable energy economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>In an ideal world, the Sustainable Energy Bill would not be the place in which to introduce measures which involve fossil fuels such as peat and gas, even though gas is the cleanest of all our fossil fuels and a fuel on which we will be dependent for the foreseeable future. In the same ideal world, if we could become fully dependent on sustainable energy production in the morning, next week or next year, we would all be very pleased but that will not happen in the real world. As a matter of principle, however, it is difficult to disagree with what Deputy Sargent said. Deputy Connaughton emphasised the social aspect which is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret these measures became necessary and that they were not incorporated in the original drafting of the Bill. However, it is not quite the <Col N="1429" /> 11th hour as Deputy Stanton said. Last week I wrote to colleagues opposite to inform them of the two sets of essential amendments to the Sustainable Energy Bill I hoped to bring forward following the passing of a necessary Dáil resolution I understood would be ordered immediately before Report Stage due to be taken on 6 February. That resolution was taken earlier today. I set out the detail of the amendments and I concluded with an invitation to Deputies. I said that if they considered it useful or necessary, I would be more than happy to arrange for relevant Department officials to discuss the proposed amendments with them in advance of Report Stage. It was all above board. I wanted to facilitate colleagues and I know some availed of that invitation while others decided not to.</P>
    <P>I will now endeavour to deal with some of the comments made by Deputies. The existing peat stations will operate under an interim PSO until their closure in 2004-05. The new peat stations will ensure a better environmental option, they will be more thermally efficient and will be benchmarked to best international practice. We are assured they are state of the art new plants which will be far more environmentally friendly and emit far fewer noxious emissions than the antiquated ones in use at present. The six older and existing peat stations will close as the new stations come on line. As I said, these will be more efficient and, from an environmental point of view, it is better than keeping old stations open.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sargent queried the surcharge on bills. The costs of peat and AER generation to be included in the PSO order are already embedded in the ESB's franchise tariff and in order to avoid any illegal cross-subsidy or over-recovery through a combination of the levy and existing tariffs, the Commission for Electricity Regulation will ensure the costs already allowed for in the franchise tariff are offset against the PSO levy when introduced. Essentially, therefore, there will be no net overall increase in electricity bills. The PSO levy element will be separately identified and explained on each electricity bill. The indicative amount to be recouped by way of levy for the PSOs is &euro;617 million up to 2019, which represents no more than the additional cost incurred by the ESB, by comparison with the cost of a best new entrant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore queried the increase in borrowings. I am sure he is sorry to be gone; he was really enjoying himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy does not take up the cudgel. In terms of its current major gas infrastructure and investment programme, it has come to light that the current borrowings limit may not be sufficient to allow Bord Gáis the freedom it requires to receive the most advantageous loan arrangements. The company's projected borrowings at the end of July this year amount to <Col N="1430" /> almost &euro;1 billion. In addition, it intends to issue a euro bond of &euro;500 million this year, which will bring its potential borrowings to &euro;1.629 billion. This euro bond is an ideal method of finance for the company as it is a long-term loan with no immediate repayments which will allow the company greater flexibility in managing the debt. That is the important aspect. This makes good commercial sense because we are talking about a company which has served the country well as a State body.</P>
      <P>Bord Gáis is required by a Government decision to obtain an equity injection from a partner for the second interconnector. The amount catered for in its forecast is &euro;165 million. There is no certainty, however, that the partner will be on board before the end of this year and this amount may have to be borrowed in the short-term pending the equity injection.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton raised a number of issues, particularly with regard to the social aspect of this matter. The price of peat in the fuel supply contract between Bord na Móna and the ESB for new peat stations is subject to the agreement of the Department of Public Enterprise in accordance with the PSO notification approved by the European Commission. That approval was given on 30 October last.</P>
      <P>On the relationship between the PSO, the ESB and Bord na Móna, the position is that the State is requiring the ESB to build these new stations for security of supply purposes. That has the European Union's blessing, as the Deputy will be aware. As he emphasised, there will also be social consequences because it will ensure some employment in both State companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for making his officials available to Members on this side of this House, which I found very useful. In fact, I felt like a Minister again when the five officials arrived in my office with a great deal of information on the whole issue of PSOs and the requirement for this amendment, which I found very useful. It surprised me that the PSO level is as much as 2% of the total cost; I thought it would have been much less than that. I did not see any improvement in the PSO level arising from the new, more efficient use of peat which I thought would have reduced it somewhat. There is a rather complicated method of applying it to separate bills, but I welcome the idea that people will now be able to see the amount being used to support wind energy, other alternative energies and peat, which is a welcome move. There will be wide public support for this transparency.</P>
      <P>As somebody who lives on the edge of the Bog of Allen in my constituency, I welcome the idea of more efficient use of peat and the closure of the old plants which were giving rise to pollution and other difficulties. That was an inefficient system of using the particular fuel. The new plant will give a better return per unit and result in better use of the energy, which is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" />I compliment the Minister of State and the Department on finding a method of convincing the European Union that imported electricity would not be exempt from the PSO. It was critical to Ireland's interest that that method was found. It is important that an acceptable method has been agreed with the European Union on the matter of state aid.</P>
    <P>This is State borrowing and the calculations are hidden from the Department of Finance, which I am not sure should be the case. We support the necessity for borrowing for infrastructure. Because the company, with the support of the State, can make the borrowing, the need for part privatising the interconnector with a partner is thereby eliminated. I urge the Minister of State not to press too hard to find that partner because I am fearful that Bord Gáis is being fattened up and prepared for the kill, as it were, in the form of privatisation. If the Labour Party finds itself in government in the future, our policy is clear. We will not support the privatisation of State enterprise, including Bord Gáis, but I welcome and support the amendment the Minister of State has tabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am completely opposed to the amendment. It is an imposition on consumers for a project that is environmentally wrong from every point of view. This country is one of the worst offenders in Europe as far as the global warming problem is concerned. Not only does our agriculture contribute to methane, but our transport and, particularly, our electricity generation sector through coal and peat burning contribute disproportionately to Ireland increasing its emissions of global warming gases such as methane and CO2 more quickly than any other country. This is a serious problem facing the country and will cost us major amounts of money.</P>
      <P>I had the privilege of attending a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs last week where representatives came before us from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to explain, which they did extremely well, the situation in regard to emissions trading. As the House is aware, CO2 emissions trading will be introduced from 2004 and from 2006 we will have emissions trading for all the others. This means that the Irish people will be paying hard cash for the privilege of polluting the world's atmosphere, but what is proposed in the amendment is a form of double taxation because the Minister of State wants the permission of the House to impose a levy on us, as electricity consumers, in order that we may have the privilege of paying a further levy when we have to buy the right to pollute when an emissions trading regime is brought forward and we exceed our quota. This is a classic case of double taxation. Many left-wing politicians complained about double taxation when water charges were introduced and on other occasions, but I have heard no such complaint from Deputies of the left today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" />I am amazed the parties that purport to be concerned about the environment have been silent about the outrageous proposal to introduce a levy on electricity consumers for the privilege of building something that will emit gases that destroy the environment. Non-polluting means of generating the same amount of electricity are available. Natural gas is available in abundance.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that generating electricity in this way secures power supply. I respectfully suggest that such a notion is arrant nonsense as, once burnt, peat is gone. I understand the argument for building a peat powered station so that it would be there when all other means of electricity generation are unavailable. To operate such a station, however, does not make sense in relation to security of supply as every bale of peat that is burned reduces Ireland security of supply. As the House knows, there is a finite amount of peat in Irish bogs. If we want energy security, it makes sense to build a station for use in times of need, but it does not make sense to operate it now. Every day that the station operates will diminish the amount of peat available.</P>
    <P>I do not know how long it is expected that peat will be available in the bogs contiguous to the proposed station, but let us say for the sake of argument that there is enough peat for 25 years. It is likely that difficulties regarding security of supply, when we are in genuine need of peat as a means of generating electricity, will arise about once every 50 years. We needed peat during the Second World War, which ended more than 55 years ago, and we should thank God that we had it. If this amendment is accepted by the House, we will destroy the peat so that it will be unavailable if there is a genuine lack of supply 25 years from now. Not only will we have burned the peat, but we will have paid for the privilege of burning it through the levy introduced by this amendment. We will pay for the privilege for a second time by entering into an emissions trading deficit when we have to pay for the right to generate electricity in this way.</P>
    <P>I know there are constituency considerations and that Deputies representing counties Laois and Offaly feel this is the best way to proceed. Since the foundation of the State, Laoighis-Offaly has probably suffered more from depopulation than any other constituency. I do not think the west has fared as badly as Laoighis-Offaly in that time. The two counties have been held back by an excessive dependence on certain natural resources. An economy, whether of a county or of a country, will not prosper if it becomes overly dependent on one resource. Economies in the Middle East are dependent on a single product and would be unable to survive if anything were to happen to the oil industry. The economic structure of these countries has been built around one industry, which is similar to what has happened in County Offaly, which has become unhealthily dependent on the peat industry. The same could have happened to County Kildare if it were not for the fact that so much effort has been put into <Col N="1433" /> bringing foreign industry there. About 68% of jobs in County Kildare are in foreign owned industries, but that is certainly not the case in County Offaly.</P>
    <P>If the Government has money to spend and wants to impose a levy on electricity consumers, it should allocate money to counties Offaly and Laois. This needs to be done in an ecologically sustainable way, however, and research is needed into the sustainability of peat. Resources can be used in ways that do not deplete them so quickly and do not pollute the atmosphere with gases that cause global warming. I do not understand the Government's political strategy, as it does not seem to be informed by long-term thinking.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stagg congratulated the Government earlier for succeeding in pulling the wool over the eyes of the European Commission on this matter, but I do not join the celebration. There is no doubt that Irish politicians and officials are the best negotiators in Europe, but it can be argued that we sometimes negotiate too well for our own good. I was guilty of doing this in the 1980s during discussions on the extension of a gas pipeline to the North, when I got too good a price. The result of this was that the project did not go ahead as there was not enough money in it for the people to whom we were trying to sell the gas. The skills displayed by the Minister and his officials during the negotiations in Brussels, for which they have been praised by Deputy Stagg, have done the country no favours as the policy being pursued is not a good one in the long-term.</P>
    <P>More needs to be done for counties Offaly and Laois than for any other counties in the BMW region, as they have suffered to a greater extent historically. Polluting the atmosphere and forcing consumers to pay levies is not the answer, however. A broad based economic strategy for the parts of Ireland that are dependent on peat is needed. The strategy should not be built on the depletion of natural resources, but on the enhancement of the substantial human resources of those areas. I have visited schools throughout counties Laois and Offaly and I have met some of the most talented young people in Ireland. The true natural resources of these counties is represented by their young people and not by the peat in their bogs. It is a grave error to ignore the under-exploited human resources of the midlands, while proceeding with the incineration of peat and the resultant pollution of the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>It is entirely wrong of the Minister to have introduced this amendment, especially given that the name of the Bill it proposes to amend is the Sustainable Energy Bill. If one is to take seriously the advice of the Attorney General, it may be argued that this amendment does not come within the terms of the short title of the Bill. Amendments may not be introduced if they do not come within the short title and it is certain that this amendment has nothing to do with sustainable energy. The Minister's proposal relates to energy develop<Col N="1434" /> ment which is not sustainable, the direct opposite of the stated subject of this Bill. It reflects badly on the Minister and his officials that an amendment has been introduced which is contrary to the short title of this Bill. I ask the Acting Chairman to ask the Ceann Comhairle to examine whether this amendment is in order, as I contend that it is not. The amendment proposes to add to our capacity to generate electricity a structure which lacks sustainability.</P>
    <P>It has become fashionable to refer to threats, opportunities and other matters with the acronym SWOTS. I do not know what the letters &ldquo;s&rdquo; and &ldquo;w&rdquo; stand for, but I am sure some of the Minister of State's management gurus will elaborate on this point. If I were to rank the threats to and opportunities for Ireland, I would suggest that the biggest threat we face is the progressive ageing of our population because the dynamism which makes this country grow depends on retaining our youth. The second biggest threat we face is the environmental snarl-up caused by the overloading of our infrastructure. The third biggest threat is the fact that Ireland is completely out of order in terms of the generation of greenhouse gases. We have no serious plan for dealing with this. We have Government White Papers comprising evasive speak which commit us to nothing. However, if one wishes to refer to them, one has something on paper which looks and reads well until one realises they contain no quantitative commitment.</P>
    <P>The truth is that we have no policy for dealing with the third most important threat to us after ageing and infrastructural deficit, namely, that Ireland is out of control regarding the problem of greenhouse gases. This amendment will only add to that problem in a manner which is out of order as far as the Bill is concerned. I hope the Chair will rule the amendment out of order, but perhaps that is not possible. This is a bad piece of work and I am surprised more Deputies are not in the House to protest. We should help Laois and Offaly, but we should do so in another form rather than imposing an obligation on this country for which everyone, including those who work in the plant, will have to pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton made a welcome intrusion into the debate. I respect the Deputy, but he is making an unsustainable argument which should be addressed in the House. I am sure the Minister of State will point out that the Bill will not give rise to an additional charge on anyone. The charge already exists and is being restructured in a manner which takes account of capacity for use, rather than the previous system which was not as fair. The new system is acceptable to the EU and includes the importation of electricity. If this was not provided for it would distort the electricity market and prevent the generation of electricity south of the Border. That would be chaotic and Deputy Bruton's argument is unsustainable from that point of view.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton suggests that we are building a new structure which will give rise to pollution. This facility will replace older structures which are far more polluting. The new structure will reduce pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>No, this is a positive course of action. I am not here to defend the Government, but I have some knowledge of this issue. It is not like suggesting that two wrongs make a right. This proposal will provide for the building of a new, modern plant which will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We are also making better use of the fossil fuel which is available, namely, peat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Peat is gone once it is burned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a finite reserve of peat, but the same is the case with all fossil fuels. We have time dates on other fossil fuels, including natural methane gas, for which Deputy Bruton has a preference, which we are using. I have argued in the House that it is dangerous for Ireland to put all its energy eggs in one basket, namely, natural gas. We should be careful as we will have to import most of our natural gas from other sources. Agreements are in place, but in emerg<Col N="1436" /> encies other states will turn off the tap. We must have other methods of generating energy such as peat, wind, wave and oil so we have a variety of sources. This will ensure a security of supply.</P>
      <P>I reject Deputy Bruton's suggestion that this provision will involve double taxation. The Labour Party previously campaigned to end double taxation on water. As Taoiseach, the Deputy supported legislation to end such double taxation and I am sure he did so with a good heart and with full support.</P>

      <P>I would suggest to Deputy Bruton's colleagues in Laois and Offaly that the arguments he is making are unsustainable and extraordinary as they take no account of the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions which this measure will bring about in their area. The Deputy's proposal would have dramatic and disastrous social and economic effects for Laois, Offaly and other areas in which this industry is thriving.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in the contributions of the two previous speakers. It is important to listen to Deputy Bruton's comments as he was taking account of the social needs of the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton would be welcome. He made his points eloquently. I applaud him for doing so because these points had to be made.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State's assertion that this measure is based on best international practice attempts to pull the wool over our eyes in that this kind of peat station would not be allowed to be built in many other countries. It is interesting that a company like Statoil had to come to Ireland to build its fossil fuel burning electricity generating station as Norway's rules and its adherence to the Kyoto Protocol, which is far more rigorous than our adherence to it, would not allow Statoil to construct such a plant in Norway. The international experience to which the Minister of State may be comparing us comprises countries which we would not claim to be in our league and which do not have the standards to which we claim to aspire. I hope we might learn from the best international practice rather than dwelling on a short-term consideration of a finite resource we need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument concerning security of supply also applies to the Corrib field. I raised this issue <Col N="1437" /> during debate on the Gas Regulation Bill. Economists suggest that the best way in which we can take advantage of our finite natural resources is to wait until the price is right. They suggest that we should not use these resources just because they have been found. This point also applies to peat. The investment which this station will require is badly needed in these areas and let it be spent there. However, it should not be drained into the pockets of those who will benefit most, namely, those who construct the plant. The benefit should go to those living in Laois, Offaly, Kildare and other areas from which Deputies present come. We are all concerned about such people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stagg is correct in stating that this is not double taxation. It is treble taxation. There is a PSO requirement, which is a form of taxation, although how it will avoid affecting the electricity bill will be worthy of a conjuror's handbook. However, it will also need to be paid for in emission trading. That has not been quantified in any serious way, despite the amount of research available to the Government and the amount of consultancy that the Department of Public Enterprise has engaged over the year. We are still waiting for some estimate of what emissions trading will cost this country, given the present inefficiencies in terms of energy and our transgressions in emissions of greenhouse gases. We are not getting that figure and I can only surmise that we are talking billions.</P>
    <P>At the moment we are definitely out of line and increasingly wide of the mark with regard to greenhouse gas emissions. Who will pay those billions? It seems to me this issue will revisit the taxpayer and that the people in the Laois-Offaly area and other areas which currently depend on peat will, in turn, have to pay. We will give them money with one hand and take it back with the other. That is the reality.</P>
    <P>In terms of treble taxation, we do not need to cast our minds too far into the past. It was only yesterday that we were talking about storm damages and flooding and the expenses involved, including the compensation that was being demanded from the Government for these appalling acts of destruction. Tonight we will deal with a motion on insurance. If ever there was a barometer of the increasing costs of climate change brought about by ignoring the growing level of greenhouse gas emissions, the insurance industry is it. The premiums associated with storm damage and weather-related claims are increasing year by year &ndash; exponentially, in fact, as time goes on. We are dealing, again, with the same people that the Minister claims to want to help with the PSO. This has to be one of the best examples of short-term, narrowly-focused thinking which probably has more to do with the next general election than with the long-term benefits of a sustainable energy policy, which this country needs to consider.</P>
    <P>Because the amendment is couched in language that needs to be very closely examined &ndash; I <Col N="1438" /> do not think the word &ldquo;turf&rdquo; is actually mentioned &ndash; it is very difficult to say for definite what the Minister was thinking in waiting until this debate before putting it down. However, it is more and more clear as the debate goes on that these amendments do not belong in the Sustainable Energy Bill and it is simply an expedient measure so that the Minister can do the bidding of people like the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who seems to be one of the strongest backers of this amendment and has been pushing it on Committee Stage. Seen in the cold light of day, this is a backwards step and I hope we can get away from the short-term thinking behind this amendment and start benefiting the people we claim to want to benefit, in a sustainable, long-term fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>This interesting debate is rendered all the more interesting by the production of the amendments at such a late stage. Did the Minister invite every Member of the House to this briefing, or was it just a few people? I certainly did not get any notification of a briefing or of any changes in the amendments. I put in a great deal of work on Committee Stage, yet I got no letter. Maybe my colleague did, but if something as important as this is being done every Member should be informed by letter that the amendments will be introduced. For that reason alone, the Minister should consider postponing taking these amendments and introducing them another day, because obviously we will run out of time today. In future every Member of the House should be informed a few days or a week in advance when new amendments will be introduced. The Department is not so short of paper that it could not do that.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that we need energy and there is no doubt that we need to become more self-reliant. We cannot remain dependent on foreign gas, foreign oil and so on. I welcome, as I think we all do, the ideal of sustainable energy such as wind and wave energy, biomass and solar power&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and energy conservation, which we raised on Committee Stage and tried to have included in a specific way in the Bill. However, we must also be realistic. Bord na Móna is a fantastic company and have done a great deal of good for the country throughout the years. Our technology has also been exported world-wide. I asked the Minister of State a question a while ago and he did not give me the information I required, so I will ask it again. Does he have any idea of how long the peat will last? When these stations are constructed, how many years do we have for electricity production through peat-burning? Is it ten, 20 or a hundred years? He might also reiterate Deputy Stagg's <Col N="1439" /> point &ndash; sometimes it feels like we are dealing with two Ministers here.</P>

      <P>He might tell us about the price structure. I understand there will not be a price increase for the consumer but I would like the Minister of State to make that very clear and to tell us how the restructuring will take place.</P>
      <P>To return to the issue of carbon dioxide, greenhouse gas emissions and so on, we need to consider the carbon sink idea. Instead of peat, we could burn timber, which is renewable, in pellet &ndash; or timber-burning stations. Does the Minister think the proposed stations could some day be converted to timber-burning ones? We can grow trees quickly and well in this country and we should explore and invest in this technology. Sustainable Energy Ireland, when it is set up, will, I hope, promote the technology.</P>
      <P>It would be useful to know that while we do need the energy and employment provided by peat-burning stations in the short-term, in the medium to longer term we could explore the possibility of converting the stations to timber-burning ones. That would keep everyone happy. We could grow our forests, growing different types of wood, providing employment in cutting the trees, processing the timber and so on and then re-plant the forests after burning, thus supporting the carbon cycle and not creating any excess carbon dioxide. Deputy John Bruton spoke of the importance of taking a long-term view and he is right. I would be interested to hear the Minister's response to those ideas and whether they are possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a wide-ranging discussion. As Deputy Stagg said, I was delighted to see Deputy John Bruton, an eminent Member of this House and former Taoiseach, entering our debate. That is not to say that I agree with the point he was making. Obviously he made a very valid point in stating the concern that is there, and should be there, with regard to emissions trading. This faces us down the line, as Deputy Sargent has said today and many times before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of our strong economy we are out of synchronisation with what we signed up to at Kyoto. We undertook to hold our increase of noxious emissions to 13% by 2010 over and above the level that obtained in 1990 but if we continue on a business as usual basis, we will be at 35% rather than 13% by then. It needs to be tackled and it is being tackled. Deputy John Bruton said that there was no plan or policy and I totally reject that assertion. There is a very strong policy and there are plans <i>in situ</i>. My Green Paper on sustainable energy was published two years ago and the Minister for the Environment and Local <Col N="1440" /> Government published his national climate change strategy. These are the plans and the policies are contained within those documents.</P>
    <P>We have already embarked on developing renewable energy resources, particularly wind energy, to the extent that we will have 12% of our total energy requirement produced in this way by 2005. The EU requires us to have 13% by 2010 and I am convinced that we will be way ahead of 12% by 2005 from the response to AER 5 which was oversubscribed by more than 40%. We were offering 255 megawatts of electricity and we were able to announce offers of 370 megawatts earlier this year. Offshore fuel is coming on stream and we have a number of concerns talking about 1,500 megawatts of offshore production off our east coast. If that is put into the context of a total energy consumption of 3,500 megawatts we see the very real potential of renewable energy sources, particularly wind. That technology has improved a great deal and is best suited to the climatic conditions of this country. There are problems regarding the grid and connection allied to the fact that the source of energy can be interrupted &ndash; when there is no wind there is no production. We cannot rely on it <i>in toto</i> but we are certainly moving rapidly to harness wind energy.</P>
    <P>Security of supply has to be paramount. There is no use talking about a strong economy as current and potential investors would soon turn away if there was not an assured energy supply now and into the future. The security of supply factor is important. I am a great advocate of using gas, the cleanest of all our fossil fuels. There is plenty of it around and we have indigenous sources <i>deo gratias</i> in terms of the recent Corrib find as our Kinsale supplies are petering out. We are dependent on imports and are putting the infrastructure in place. That is the reason for what we are doing here today in terms of the most extensive and ambitious gas infrastructural undertaking ever in this country by BGE, in terms of onshore infrastructure and, in particular, the second interconnector, again for the purpose of ensuring security of supply.</P>
    <P>All these things are happening and it is essential that we have indigenous supply. There was reference to a variety of sources such as peat, gas and as many renewable sources of energy as we can take on board in addition to wind, such as wave energy, solar energy and so on. I firmly reject the statement that there is not a plan or a policy. It is there and is being adhered to and is progressing rapidly.</P>
    <P>The national climate change strategy takes account of the new peat station. It is very important to state that. As I have said already, and as Deputy Stagg said, the new station will replace older stations with more efficient technology and best practice. Earlier, Deputy Stanton asked about the peat reserves and I neglected to address the question. The figure of 15 years is in my mind. I want to check that and I will come <Col N="1441" /> back to the Deputy as the area of peat does not come under my remit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>As has already been said, it is a finite resource &ndash; as is gas &ndash; although as Deputy John Bruton said there is plenty of it around.</P>
      <P>There have been repeated questions about the cost and double charges and treble charges. I am getting confused with those interpretations. We should remember that we are dealing here with a change to the levy recovery mechanism. The Electricity Regulation Act 1999, already provides for a public service obligation levy for the construction of peat stations and renewable energy plants. The work has already been done and we are only changing the mechanism. I am satisfied it makes no material difference to the amount to be recovered or the amount that will be recovered from individual electricity consumers. As I have already pointed out, the change is necessary arising out of European Commission deliberations on the matter and to ensure that the electricity market is not distorted.</P>
      <P>Deputy Stanton referred to the use of timber in energy production and I would like to see that coming on stream. It is being looked at in terms of its potential. We have a significant amount of forestry that did not thrive, which would be ideally suitable. I understand there may be difficulties in harvesting it in terms of extracting it from some areas, but it is there and I hope that constraint can be overcome. It is one of the renewable resources that is being seriously looked at and I share the Deputy's aspiration to get to that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has said there will not be a price increase as a result of this mechanism. May I also bring to his attention that, in Sweden and other countries, the technology exists to harvest the type of timber he has mentioned efficiently and effectively. Electricity is being generated in the countries concerned, using the type of timber to which the Minister of State has alluded. I hope the agency, when it has been established, will make it a priority to investigate these matters and support them as much as possible.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the Taoiseach is obliged to come before the House to answer questions. I know it annoys him to have to do so because he regards it as a disruption of his work. However, I wish to put to him a point made by Liam Kelleher, director general of the CIF, on 9 January in respect of the infrastructural component of the national development plan which is pertinent to the question in my name. I am in order putting a question on this matter and if the Taoiseach is still serving as chairperson of the cross-departmental committee to which the questions refer, he remains the person responsible for this matter. While he does not like the title, I must remind him that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, described him as project manager of the national development plan when it was launched some time ago.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach comment on the two points made by Mr. Kelleher on 9 January? The first was to the effect that the delivery of infrastructural programmes is already falling significantly behind schedule, that this is not the fault of the construction industry, that the delays are taking place in the pre-construction phases of development, namely, on the Government side. Mr. Kelleher also stated it is now obvious that a funding gap is beginning to emerge in the national development plan and that if the infrastructural targets in the plan are to be realised, additional funding will be required over and above the figures proposed in the plan.</P>

As stated previously, the fact that one chairs a committee does not mean that Ministers have been made redundant, as the Deputy is aware.</P>

There was a slow-down in the economy last year. The amount of resources is not as much, but there is still an enormous amount of resources for NDP projects.</P>

I again ask the chairperson of the cross-Departmental committee whether the Minister for the Environment and Local Government reported progress to the effect that there is now a serious delay in relation to infrastructural projects as reported by Liam Kelleher of the CIF? In his capacity as chairperson of that committee, did the Taoiseach note there is a delay? Did the committee make any decision as to how that delay might be remedied and the lost time regained?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of these matters were discussed at the committee. We have looked at the issues raised by Mr. Kelleher and by the Departments. We have endeavoured, in so far as we can to answer most of those points. I could spell out some of them in great detail. They are matters for other Ministers. However, I will give some of the detail since that is what the Deputy wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is Mr. Kelleher correct? That is what I want to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Kelleher correctly made the point that last year the incidence of foot and mouth disease delayed the NRA's work for four months and that construction on national routes &ndash; the Dublin-Waterford, Dublin-Cork, Dublin-Limerick, Dublin-Galway and Dublin-Belfast, but not to the same extent &ndash; had been delayed. Last year, by agreement, the NRA technical people were not on the land for four months. By <Col N="1449" /> the end of June there were difficulties in regard to the CPO process, which was not finally agreed until December. Now they cannot come back to work because most of the environmental impact studies and most of the other work on those routes can take place only during the summer when flora and fauna and other issues that need to be checked are in place. Mr. Kelleher made that point, which is a valid one. He also made the point, and I accept it, that while construction price inflation for the past few years ran at 15%, which ate into the budget along with our desire to have outside contractors, it should not be as bad this year. There was an argument about it. He said it would be 0%.</P>
      <P>The information available to our committee is that it will be 8% this year. He also said there were some other projects ready. Some of those will go to tender this year and some will not. That is a matter for the Minister and the NRA. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, made points in response. The Government has clearly prioritised the upgrading of our national road network. A sum of &euro;958 million is being put into the programme this year. The Exchequer provision for non-national roads over the period 2000-02 is &euro;2.488 billion, ahead of the national development plan forecast which was &euro;2.24 billion. The National Roads Authority also told the committee, in response to Mr. Kelleher, that it would continue detailed planning and the work involved in deciding the distribution of its budget allocation. They will not be able to do everything that is ready to be done but they will do an enormous amount of the project. I will not list all of the projects finished but there are major projects under way that will take many resources this year, including the south-eastern motorway, the Dublin port tunnel, the Kildare bypass and the Glen of the Downs project. There are some 57 projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the projects on the list. There are 57 major improvement projects involving 380 kilometres of road network that have either been completed or are in the course of construction. It is the position of the Government and the NRA that over the seven years of the programme we will try to have flexibility in implementing the roads programme. Given the extent of the accumulated deficits in the infrastructure area, it is necessary that we do that. I hope that answers Deputy Quinn's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the urgency of completing this project, and the delays, will the Taoiseach indicate whether he has raised with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the reason that the post of chairperson of the NRA was left unfilled, and why critical meetings did not proceed because the retiring chairperson was <Col N="1450" /> not available and no replacement had been put in place?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if I have the full facts on that matter but I understand the outgoing chairman retired and announced his intention to do so at Christmas last. The new chairperson is to be appointed shortly but it was only at Christmas that the outgoing person announced that he would not be available. I do not believe he gave prior notice.</P>
      <P>In reply to another question from Deputy Noonan, yesterday I gave to the House the precise factual Department of Finance figures on deficits for the next few years. It is incorrect for Deputy Noonan to say there is anything lingering anywhere unless he is accusing the Department of Finance of not providing the correct figures.

      <P>The Minister for Finance last year issued a booklet on public private partnerships which he continues to promote with Departments. Separately, there is the national pension fund where we put 1% of the wealth of the nation per annum, under legislation, and this is governed by trustees who can decide to get a commercial return on that money. That is within their power but it is not the same as a public private partnership. Since the legislation was passed, if the trustees of the fund identified a suitable project that would be successful, they could put money into it. That was made clear during the debate on the Bill, it is not news to anyone.</P>

Does the Taoiseach have a view on the article by Professor Philip Lane of Trinity College, Dublin, in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, in which he argues that this is too risky a strategy and transfers risk not to the private sector but to State agencies exposing the NPRF to political interference?</P>
      <P>Is the metro line, which will form a considerable part of the work in infrastructure, a flexible route or has it been set, given that the Japanese consultants did not look beyond Dublin Airport to reach Swords in their original draft? Has that been considered by the Cabinet?</P>

      <Col N="1455" />Does the Taoiseach agree that the public private partnership process, which requires repayment on investment that might otherwise have been made by the State, is a form of borrowing given that the consumer, rather than the Government, repays the investment farmed out to private investors? Does he agree this is a form of borrowing, although not in the sense of the borrowing announced in the budget?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask the Departments, particularly if Arthur Andersen was involved.</P>
      <P>The general government deficit outlines clear definitions of what comes within the borrowing requirements. A decade ago guidelines were set down on what constitutes State borrowing and those guidelines must be followed. In a number of European countries these issues are considered to be separate from the State balance sheet &ndash; Portugal operates such a system. In our GGD figures, we take a broad swathe of borrowing, such as local government borrowing, into account and PPPs are not normally counted within those figures. Portugal certainly used this system to a large degree in its infrastructure programme.</P>
      <P>The fund trustees, like the trustees of any pension fund, may believe it is worthwhile to invest in a good commercial project; their obligation is to get a return on the money. Normally the difficulty for the State was to find a sufficiently large project in which to invest funds. That is why in the national development plan we planned for large stretches of road. Projects of that size should be an attractive investment for the trustees but it is their commercial decision and they are not likely to be influenced by the Government. My personal view is that there are some significant projects in the national development plan that are worthy of examination by the trustees.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>his plans to seek a reversal of the EU ban on the use of driftnets for tuna fishing; if he will seek EU approval for the use of nets fitted with pingers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1998 Council decision to ban drift netting for tuna with effect from 1 January 2002 is now in force. There is no realistic prospect of the Commission proposing a reversal by Council of its decision at this point. We need to look forward rather than back.</P>
      <P>The Council decision was primarily driven by environmental concerns about the potentially fatal impact of multi kilometre drift nets on marine mammals. Ireland and France disputed the conclusive nature of the scientific evidence at the time and it is probably true to say that the jury is still out on the question. Arguments were also put forward at the time based on research into the deployment of electronic devices such as pingers to minimise the risk to marine mammals. However, bearing in mind the precautionary principle and being politically realistic, I do not believe that any attempt to reopen the EU debate will succeed. The best way forward for the Irish tuna industry is to work with the prevailing realities and maximise the undoubted returns available from alternative fishing methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the negotiations in 1998, Ireland and France successfully achieved a four year postponement of the introduction of the ban on drift netting. Ireland also secured EU support for R&amp;<Col N="1461" /> D funding for experimental fishing programmes and technology transfer. The objective was to prepare Irish tuna fishermen to convert to other fishing methods following the implementation of the ban on drift netting.</P>
    <P>Since 1998, over £2 million has been invested in assisting Irish fishermen to develop alternative tuna fishing methods. A variety of fishing gears and techniques have been the subject of trials. Last year a number of Irish vessels successfully fished for tuna by means of mid-water trawls with prices reported to be excellent. This has led to a high level of interest from fishermen planning to participate in the 2002 tuna fishery by means of mid water trawls.</P>
    <P>International negotiations in 2000 led to quotas being set for the first time for Albacore Tuna. Ireland negotiated a significant quota of 3,158 tonnes for 2001, the third highest in the European Union. A similar quota has been secured for 2002. We also won agreement at EU level to allow Ireland to double the number of vessels in the tuna fishery. This arrangement, together with our significant quota share, will enable up to 50 Irish vessels to participate in the tuna fishery in 2002 using the new fishing methods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the ban which exists, which he will not even try to have reversed, effectively means the end of tuna fishing in the two principal ports here, namely, Castletownbere and Dingle? Can the Minister say how many fishing vessels are equipped for mid-water trawling this year? How many applications have been made for licences to use mid-water trawls or any other alternative tuna gear? How many vessels does the Minister expect will be fishing tuna from Irish ports this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a mistaken view that the banning of drift nets bring to an end the tuna fishery and would have a devastating effect on Irish ports. In actual fact there were only 18 boats involved in the drift net fishing of tuna. I do not have the exact number of licences taken out for mid-water trawling this year. However, it was a hugely successful event for the people who got those licences, so much so that there will be an over subscription for the 50 licences available in 2002. A much higher quality fish is being caught by the mid-water trawling system and as a result much higher prices were achieved in the market in France this year. I am confident that the contribution of 50 fishermen this year and next year, although the full 50 licences were not taken up this year, will be much greater than that of the 18 fishermen in place as a result of the drift nets. The 18 fishermen did have significant results using drift nets and clearly there will be a loss of income. It would be foolhardy of me to try to roll back the clock on a decision made over four years ago. The specific condition was that the Irish would be given a four-year window and the Commission will not change its mind on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The purchase of the two fisheries protection CASA aircraft was co-funded by the European Community under the Fisheries Surveillance Package 1995-2000. The two aircraft cost approximately £36 million, &euro;45 million, in total, excluding VAT.</P>
      <P>In implementing the terms of the fisheries surveillance package the Commission took the general position that where capital assets were overwhelmingly dedicated to fisheries protection the full eligible expenditure would receive Community support. It was on that basis that the Commission funded 50% of the cost of the CASA aircraft. The Commission has subsequently, in 2000, seen fit to agree further funding support of over &euro;500,000 for navigation equipment upgrade and mission support facilities for the aircraft. It has been regularly confirmed by the Irish authorities to the Commission that the vast proportion of CASA time is demonstrably spent on fisheries protection. The fact that the aircraft are primarily tasked with fisheries protection has not precluded their deployment from time to time on search and rescue, air ambulance, security and transport duties.</P>
      <P>The day-to-day operation of the CASA aircraft is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Defence. I have primary policy responsibility for fisheries protection and my relevant requirements relate to efficient and effective standards of fisheries protection service delivery by the Naval Service and the Air Corps. Service delivery is based on agreed outputs and in line with overall fisheries protection priorities agreed each year. The pertinent CASA outputs for my Department and for the Commission are the numbers of fisheries patrols, flying hours and vessel sightings. These outputs are reported on annually to the Commission by my Department. In 2001 the CASA aircraft undertook 277 patrols, involving 1,392 flying hours and recorded over 5,000 sightings of fishing vessels. These represent an increase over 2000 and are broadly in line with performance in previous years.</P>

The Department of Defence and, in particular, the Air Corps deal with day-to-day operational and deployment matters concerning aircraft resources. I understand, however, from the Department of Defence that the CASA aircraft are used for a relatively small proportion of operational time for a combination of search and rescue, air ambulance and security duties and, occasionally, as back-up to the ministerial air transport service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The harbour at Clogherhead is owned by Louth County Council and responsibility for its maintenance and development lies <Col N="1465" /> with the local authority. Funding of over &euro;80,000 towards safety works and surfacing at the harbour was provided under the fisheries harbour programme, 2001. In 1998 Louth County Council commissioned consulting engineers to carry out a technical assessment of the development needs of Clogherhead Harbour. Their report, which evaluated a range of options, recommended extending the pier, the construction of a breakwater and dredging works. The cost of these capital works was estimated at the time to be in excess of &euro;3.81 million.</P>
      <P>My Department has consistently advised that any major capital investment proposed for Clogherhead should be underpinned by a comprehensive cost benefit analysis which should evaluate all relevant economic and socio-economic factors, trends in volume and value of landings, the extent to which displacement is a factor, fleet trends and regional and local considerations. My Department grant-aided a cost benefit analysis commissioned by the local authority last year. I am advised it has been completed and is being evaluated by the local authority prior to submission to my Department.</P>
      <P>Consideration of any subsequent proposal for the development of the harbour by the local authority will be informed by the findings of the cost benefit analysis. However, under the national development plan funding for major fishery harbour development work is substantially oversubscribed at this point. Future capital development options in relation to Clogherhead will be assessed in the light of the cost benefit analysis and the overall funding envelope available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. It is a pity the record will not show the grin on his face while he read it out. He has not the slightest interest in the development of Clogherhead port. He is perfectly happy for proposals to be made to the county council and to read out a load of rubbish in the House about a cost benefit analysis, which is akin to teaching his grandmother to suck eggs. He has not the slightest intention of providing money for the proposed development because he has already allocated all the funds available under the fishery harbour development programme to other ports. Is that an accurate interpretation of his reply? If it is, I will immediately communicate it to the fishermen of Clogherhead.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not understand that one of the major problems in Clogherhead is that most boats fishing from the port have to be repaired and even refuelled elsewhere because the facilities are so inadequate? Is he aware that a large part of the income generated by the boats is being spent elsewhere and that if they could fish from the port, the level of local employment would rise? Will he, therefore, change his mind and adopt a less cavalier attitude to Clogherhead port?</P>

      <P>The Deputy's interpretation is wrong. He is well aware that one of the difficulties is that priorities must be set. Some port developments will, therefore, proceed before others. I am not in a position to proceed with the work at Clogherhead, which does not mean I do not have a keen interest in progress being made. For this reason, I provided &euro;80,000 last year for improvements to the pier. I accept there is a need for an extension and have proceeded to allocate a sum of money for a cost benefit analysis. It is not possible to proceed with the project before completion of the analysis or proof that it is cost effective to spend more than &euro;4 million on it.</P>
      <P>I also accept that fishermen from Clogherhead are forced to use Howth Harbour because of the lack of facilities and that there is an urgent need for work on the pier to take place. However, even if the Deputy was in this chair, the same loaves and fishes exercise would apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission's Green Paper on the Common Fisheries Policy reflects a number of priority themes for Ireland, including sustainable fisheries development, the conservation imperative and more transparent governance. However, in line with the position of the national CFP strategy group I have underlined to the Commission and the Council the need to fully take on board the social and economic aspects of fisheries policy, reflecting the needs of coastal regions in Ireland which are highly dependent on fisheries.</P>
      <P>Better alignment of the CFP with social, regional and cohesion policies is critical for the future of coastal communities and small-scale inshore fleets. I have pressed the Commission to show real initiative in terms of safeguarding coastal zones and resources and the future of fisheries dependent areas.</P>
      <P>In the light of the Green Paper and in advance of the Commission's formal proposals on CFP reform, I have worked with like-minded EU colleagues to develop common positions on certain key priorities. A coalition of interests has emerged among member states with significant fisheries dependent regions and for whom the socio-economic dimension of fisheries is fundamental. This strategic alliance consists of Ireland, France, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece. Following a number of high level meetings last autumn I and my five ministerial colleagues agreed a set of common conclusions in Brussels last December which we presented to Commissioner Fischler. Top of the list is the need for the CFP to take fully into account the economic and social dimension of fisheries and to underpin fisheries employment through the provision of safe and acceptable working conditions as well as opportunities for diversification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" />There was a strong view among the Ministers involved that a common position should be articulated in order to counterbalance the tendency for biological concerns to predominate in the thinking of the Commission and of certain other member states. I emphasise that there are a number of other issues around the reform debate where we part company from the French and Spanish positions. Hague Preference and the preservation of the Irish Box are two such cases in point where we have more in common with the UK. However, in terms of driving the socio-economic agenda of fisheries and fleet policy, this selective strategic alliance is to our negotiating advantage.</P>
    <P>The Commission will present its formal proposals on CFP reform shortly. Substantive negotiations will begin under the current Spanish Presidency and will culminate under the Danish Presidency at the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The key objectives for Ireland in the negotiation process are to influence and shape the direction of much needed reform while maximising the national position in terms of our key priorities. I will continue, with the support of the National Strategy Review Group, to work towards those objectives. I will travel to Madrid this month to meet the Spanish president in order to get full support from the Spanish presidency for our priorities in the CFP review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I wish the Minister the best of luck in travelling to Madrid to meet his Spanish counterpart and in trying to voice his opinion as far as the policy is concerned, is he satisfied that he has taken the right steps to correct anomalies which exist in the Green Paper in establishing the importance of the fisheries sector to the coastal regions of Ireland? As he knows, it is most important that the socio-economic concerns of the fishing industry are incorporated in the revised Common Fisheries Policy. It is most important that the excluded coastal limits are extended to 24 miles to protect our Irish fisheries stock. It is also most important that the Minister takes into consideration that the commitment given to Ireland in the Hague resolution of 1976 for the continued and progressive development of the Irish fishing industry is fully honoured and incorporated into the Common Fisheries Policy post-2002. It is most important as well that the Minister fights for the protection of the Irish Box.</P>
      <P>It is no good having a common fisheries policy that will not copperfasten the fishing industry in this country. If we are to allow the foreign boats to continue to fish in the Irish Box, it will have a detrimental affect on the fishing industry here. Therefore, I ask the Minister to copperfasten the safety of the Irish fishing industry with the introduction of the new and revised Common Fisheries Policy coming up this year and which will be put into operation later in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most important that the Minister takes off the kid gloves and is seen to insist on the importance of the fishing industry to the Irish people, <Col N="1469" /> especially Irish fishermen, because we are the only island nation in Europe since Great Britain was joined to mainland Europe by the Channel tunnel. We are surrounded by water but, unfortunately, the crop in that water is being fished by foreign trawlers day in, day out. What will the Minister do to take concrete steps to ensure the continuation of the fishing industry in this country?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally acknowledged in Brussels and among our colleague member states that Ireland's case was probably the most effective one made as part of the Green Paper and the CFP review. As a result of the very good work done by the CFP review committee under the chairmanship of Padraig White, we produced a comprehensive set of documents on all the areas in which we want changes to the Common Fisheries Policy, including the Irish Box, fishing limits, which the Deputy mentioned, and so on. Not only that, but many of the proposals we have made have been reflected in the Green Paper and have been the subject of discussions with other member states. However, we have to be realistic. Anything we gain in terms of a review of the CFP most likely has to be at the expense of somebody else. In such a situation, let me assure Deputy Sheehan that one would not wear any gloves not to mention kid gloves.</P>
      <P>We have fought very hard so far in this battle. Part of that battle was fought as part of the December negotiations. From my point of view, it was the most difficult fight I have ever had in my time in politics. The Deputy can be assured that we will fight to ensure we get the best deal possible. That is not to underestimate the difficulty of what we are trying to achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not have to be in the Green Paper which was a discussion document.

We will hammer that argument home as much as we possibly can. However, I have to be realistic in saying that it will be very difficult to achieve.</P>

      <P>The regional fisheries boards are statutorily responsible for the protection of fisheries and the enforcement of the Fisheries Acts. The Central Fisheries Board has an overall co-ordinating role to ensure that resources are deployed efficiently and effectively. The measurable outputs from protection activities include the deterrence of poachers, the taking of prosecutions and the seizure of nets. I am generally satisfied the combined operations of the boards in partnership with the Garda Síochána, the Navy and the Air Corps provide an effective level of protection for salmon stocks against illegal fishing activity. There is room for improvement, however. I have requested the Central Fisheries Board to review the efficiency and effectiveness of the salmon protection programme at regional and national levels. The review will assess performance and results over the past five years and the extent to which all available resources have been efficiently deployed. It will advise on the scope for enhanced co-operation on the ground and on the development of improved performance indicators. I have asked the Central Fisheries Board to complete the review in advance of this year's peak salmon season.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency has recently published its report on Water Quality in Ireland 1998 to 2000. In the case of rivers, the report shows a reversal in the trends of slight and moderate pollution and a slight reduction in serious pollution generally. Modest improvement in the water quality status of our lakes has also been noted.</P>
      <P>I am encouraged to note the improvements reported by the EPA. However, pollution remains the most serious threat to fish stocks. Under the national development plan more than &euro;3 billion has been provided for water and waste water treatment which is providing the essential infrastructure to deliver on the water quality objective.</P>
      <P>The success of our pollution prevention strategies critically depends on all relevant Departments, agencies, farming, angling and other groups working effectively together. The environmental catchment management process has already paid dividends. I am also working with ministerial colleagues to ensure enhanced cross-departmental co-operation under the water quality directive framework.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that reply. I spoke to a number of fishermen from Donegal last week. They have formed themselves into what they would call a traditional fishing organisation for traditional fishermen along the coast. Their point was that the value added which should be there for their fishing does not exist for the reasons the Minister has outlined. They do <Col N="1471" /> not believe their stocks are being protected. There are several seasons, or parts of seasons, during which there is no protection. They make the case, and we are talking about almost 1,000 families if one takes the whole membership into account, that they could make a much better living if they received help in terms of protection. They were one of the first outfits to tag the salmon and they thought, as I did when the legislation was going through the House, that protection would be stepped up in return but that was not done. Given the number of jobs likely to be created in those remote areas, much effort should be put into this because these people are trained to fish and they should get the first chance of fishing in the river. Against that background, they believe the protection system has let them down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The anglers had the worst record in terms of using the tags provided this year and the commercial net men were the best. I have urged the anglers to co-operate fully this year with the tagging scheme. The Deputy is correct in saying there have been difficulties with regard to the illegal fishing of wild salmon and we have taken stringent action in that regard. We are faced with the problem of criminal gangs, some of whom have been convicted in the courts on more than one occasion, continually poaching wild salmon. I am conscious of that and, in addition to the other series of initiatives I have taken this year, I will shortly meet with the assistant commissioner and the Garda chief superintendents along the west coast, from Donegal to Cork, so that we can have much more effective policing of our key rivers and apprehend these gangs, some members of which have significant criminal records. The regional fisheries board managers will be invited to that meeting.</P>
      <P>I have initiated a new scheme with a number of angling clubs so that they will provide better surveillance and intelligence both to the fisheries officers in the fisheries boards and the gardaí. During the debate on the legislation, I said we all have to accept that illegal catching of wild salmon is a criminal activity of the lowest type and that until such time as local communities are prepared to provide the information and the intelligence about those who are involved, it will be very hard to stop it. I urge everybody, and I call on the Opposition to do likewise, to co-operate in this respect.</P>
      <P>On the pollution problem, a tripartite approach is now being taken by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and myself to focus on some of the areas which experience serious pollution problems. Together, we will try to allocate moneys in a more focused way, and this will include some developments in Donegal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has general responsibility for the regulation and management of the marine coastal zone including foreshore and aquaculture licensing and dumping at sea permits. These functions are currently exercised by the Department's coastal zone administration division. In addition, my Department is responsible for funding the national coastal protection programme in conjunction with the coastal local authorities.</P>
      <P>My Department also has general responsibility, in conjunction with other relevant Departments, for the development of an integrated coastal zone management strategy. The key objective of the strategy is the development of new models to address interactions between sectors, agencies and legal frameworks which will deliver a more integrated strategic approach to coastal zone management. This will be taken forward in co-operation with the relevant Departments and agencies including the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
      <P>The strategy will be informed by national and international research and experience to date. It will also take account of the EU recommendation on the implementation of ICZM agreed by the Council of Environment Ministers last October. It will be progressed in tandem with a review of public resource-coastal zone licensing planning and regulatory functions as well as developing a multi-annual strategic approach to coastal protection. The very helpful findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report are being taken fully into account in this review process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following recent appointments at assistant secretary level in my Department, the assignment of senior management responsibility for integrated <Col N="1473" /> coastal zone management strategy will be finalised shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that the Minister is considering acting on the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, with which my committee dealt on a number of occasions. Will the Minister indicate who is responsible for coastal zone management? The county councils say the Department is responsible, but the Department says the county councils are responsible. Another view is that landowners are responsible for this area. Will the Minister clarify the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulation and management of the coastal zone is a matter for the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. A key organisational priority is the devolution of the public resource-coastal zone functions and identifying the future focus of responsibility. The management and funding of the coastal zone is done in consultation with the local authorities and there is a commitment to develop an overall integrated strategy for coastal protection up to 2015.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has responsibility for the foreshore up to the high water mark. The private landowner, or the local authority in the case of public property or roads that approach the seashore, has responsibility for the land from that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to labour the point but we have experienced a number of problems in this regard in my own constituency at Annagassan, in Clogherhead, where the county council told landowners there was nothing it could do for them and that it was a matter for them to provide protection against the high tides. Is that the correct interpretation because that is not what the Minister said?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, yes. The private landowner is responsible for his own land and the policy of the Department and the local authorities is that the county council will not get involved in coastal protection work on private property or land. The Department has responsibility for the foreshore up to the high water mark and it is only in the case of, say, a road or other public facility being affected that the Department would be prepared to get involved in any coastal protection work. Unless the private property protection was necessary to prevent further serious erosion of a public road or whatever, it is the landowner's problem. That is probably not the best way forward given that there are coastal erosion problems which we would all like to tackle, but one of the difficulties is that the amount of money involved is significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>An Alouette 111 single engine helicopter is based at Waterford. Its restriction to visual contact flight conditions in daylight only and its restricted range means it is unsuitable for offshore marine emergency helicopter cover. As the Deputy is aware, the Alouette is a temporary replacement for the Dauphin helicopter which crashed on Tramore beach on 2 July 1999 with the tragic loss of four crewmen.</P>
      <P>Arising from the draft report of the joint working group of the coastguard and the Departments of the Marine and Natural Resources and Defence on dedicated marine emergency response helicopters, a tender competition was commenced for provision of an all-weather marine emergency helicopter at Waterford to replace the Alouette. The competition required that the service be in place by 1 July 2002. The tender evaluation process has been completed and I am pleased to record that a contract is on the point of signature for a forward looking infra-red and autohover equipped helicopter based at Waterford to provide marine emergency response 24 hours a day, for five years from 1 July 2002.</P>
      <P>Negotiations are also advanced for the provision of coastguard cover with an all-weather marine emergency helicopter at Waterford from May to July 2002. The helicopter will be on call for 12 hours per day until the start of the main contract. This will provide an improved capability, endurance and range over the Alouette, albeit for slightly less time each day during the long daylight hours at that time of year. The coastguard all-weather 24 hour helicopters based at Dublin and Shannon will be called on to cover any gaps during these twilight periods.</P>

      <P>Three evaluations by consultant engineers have been undertaken on behalf of Cork County Council since 1999 to assess the extent of coastal erosion at Youghal and to identify the most appropriate and cost-efficient coast protection solutions. The most recent report was completed last year and recommends a phased approach to addressing coastal erosion in the area commencing with the strengthening of the sea wall and the subsequent construction of groynes. My Department provided funding towards two of these reports and has assessed all three evaluations.</P>
      <P>I allocated £20,000, &euro;25,394.76, in 2001 to Youghal Urban District Council. I am advised that consultants have prepared the necessary tender documentation on behalf of the local authority and that planning and other statutory permissions are being progressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is bizarre that three reports have been carried out on this matter? On 24 March 1999 his predecessor told me that a detailed report was carried out by consulting engineers which concluded that coastal protection works involving the extension of groynes and beach nourishment were required at an estimated cost of £5.1 million. Nothing has happened since. We have had paralysis by analysis. Two more reports have been assessed by the <Col N="1478" /> Minister and his officials yet no real money has been made available. Nothing is happening while the beach is being washed away and terrible damage is being done. When does the Minister propose to initiate real action after four years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>My figures suggest an estimated cost of about &euro;1.2 million for the strengthening of the sea wall, incorporating an aesthetically designed retired flood wall. The subsequent groynes which are proposed are estimated to cost &euro;3.4 million on a phased basis. It is considered that priority should be given to the strengthening of the sea wall. That is the basis on which the allocation is being made and the tender documents are being prepared.</P>

      <P>A sum of £20,000 has been made available for work which has not taken place and there is some money for consultants. However, no work has occurred on the ground after four years. The Minister does not seem to know about this detailed report which his predecessor had on 24 March 1999. I do not know how long the report was lying in the Department prior to that date, but does the Minister agree this is incompetence of the highest order and that action has to be taken? After four years it is not good enough that nothing has happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary responsibility for managing a bank and preventing fraud lies with the management of that institution. No regulatory authority can put in place a supervisory regime to ensure that a financial institution can never be a victim of fraudulent activity from within. It is important to keep in mind that the bank in which the difficulty has arisen is located in the USA. As such, it is regulated by the Federal Reserve and local regulators. As part of the AIB Group, it is of course also regulated on a consolidated basis by the Central Bank of Ireland. The Central Bank has been in contact with its US counterparts and with AIB about the events in question. When the full facts of the matter have been established the Central Bank will take any necessary action. I have spoken to the governor of the Central Bank, Maurice O'Connell, about the matter and my Department has also been in contact with the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>I am also advised that AIB's capital position is strong and is comfortably within established limits. There is no threat to account holders or to the solvency of the bank. From the point of view of Irish consumers and the Irish financial system in general, this is crucial. Although AIB Group has suffered a considerable blow to its financial position, this blow must be seen in the context of the overall strength of the institution. Even taking into consideration the effects of this event, the bank concerned remains well capitalised, solvent and active in the market. This is not, therefore, a disastrous situation from the point of view of Irish financial markets, but it is a reminder to the management of the bank, of other banks and to regulators and legislators of the importance of ensuring financial institutions are well-capitalised and that their internal systems are up to the job of managing and controlling the increasingly complex nature of the financial markets and financial instruments with which they deal.</P>
      <P>There may also be lessons for legislators, and these should be digested and acted upon. I have asked the Central Bank to report to me, in the light of these events and their own investigations, on whether any changes to the legislative provisions governing banking supervision might be required. It is, of course, a matter of regret that the share price has fallen this morning and that therefore investors in AIB, both individuals and institutions, have suffered a loss. Obviously, to the extent that the bank loses, the value of the bank must be affected and some loss was inevitable under the circumstances. I hope that the market will have due regard to the fundamental soundness of the bank's capital base and reflect this in a fair view of its ongoing prospects. I understand that notwithstanding these events, the Bank will record a comfortable profitable position for the financial year 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that it is astonishing that the actions, apparently, of just one man could lead to a loss of such extraordinary proportions for a bank such as AIB and its American subsidiary? A loss of some &euro;860 million or $750 million was experienced. Does he agree, even more importantly, that this demonstrates very clearly that what he refers to in his statement as the regulatory environment is clearly not up to the job and that the fact that a fraud of this kind apparently went undetected for up to one year is an astonishing indictment, not just of the practices within AIB and its subsidiary but also of the regulatory authorities which failed to spot it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relying on information supplied to me by the governor of the Central Bank and I heard most of the press conference of the chief executive of AIB Group this morning. The Deputy asked whether I was amazed at the extent of the loss and amazed that this could have happened under the noses of the management and the regulators. The best way of dealing with this is to paraphrase what the chief executive said this morning: if there are two people in collusion, the best systems in the world will find difficulty in tracking them down. Questions are certainly raised about the effectiveness of the management systems within the group that such a loss could go undetected for some time. I understand that the Federal Reserve, which is quite diligent in its application, gave the bank an absolutely clean bill of health in the middle of last year.</P>
      <P>As I understand from the press conference, the complex nature of the fraud made it very difficult for the bank's management to get to grips with it. As I said in my statement, questions have been raised regarding the regulatory environment, but there is no system that will ever be devised or has ever been from the time of Adam and Eve to the present, that is able to guard against people deciding to collude and defraud someone else. The best system in the world will not be able to uncover it. However, the regulatory systems and internal controls should be efficient and tap into change at an early date. This fraud was quite complex. The news only came to the AIB headquarters in Dublin on Monday of this week and the appropriate action was taken then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Noting the size of the deficit now reported by Allfirst, the subsidiary of AIB in the USA, and the manner in which it has come to light, does the Minister agree that serious questions are raised about both the internal and external auditing systems within AIB Group? Certainly there are serious questions about what has happened, what has gone wrong and why it was not picked up. It is not surprising because only a short time ago their internal and external auditing system did not pick up the difficulties with DIRT. Back in the 1980s there were further problems within AIB Group that were not noticed and the State had to come to the rescue. The questions <Col N="1483" /> about the internal and external auditing systems themselves raise questions about the regulatory system and controls, operating via the Central Bank, that regulate financial institutions here. Does the Minister agree that we need to take a serious look at what is happening and probably strengthen the existing controls within the framework of the Central Bank?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the three specific points raised by the Deputy in the second part of my intervention. Over the past number of years there has been debate in this House and outside on the proper mix between what I would call prudential regulation or supervision and customer matters. There was considerable debate about this leading to the new Bill, which it is hoped I will soon be in a position to publish, regarding the Central Bank Act, 1998 and the new financial services regulatory authority. The debate really boils down to prudential supervision, including stringent safeguards, versus consumer matters. I am and have been unashamedly of the view &ndash; this will be no surprise to Deputy McDowell as he has heard this before &ndash; that the prudential supervision and regulation is of far greater importance in the overall scheme of things. A person is more concerned when he goes into a bank that his money is there for him rather than that the fellow behind the counter is dressed properly or says &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; properly on the telephone or whether he has done certain small things to the person's account. A fair way of putting it is that people are mainly concerned about the prudential regulation of financial institutions. In that regard the Central Bank of Ireland has a better record than anywhere else in Europe; I do not know about the USA.</P>
      <P>With the growth of complexity in financial products and engineered financial products, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the supervisory authorities and the management of institutions to keep ahead of the posse. It has struck me over the past number of years that some very junior people down the line are so brilliant at their jobs that the people who are paid three or four times their salary are not as <i>au fait</i> with the details of all the engineered products and complexities as the people who are dealing with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister saying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McDowell, Deputy Noonan and I have had a debate for some time about the proper way for the Central Bank legislation to proceed. As a result of the NIB matter, which was a consumer issue rather than a prudential regulatory one, more people came down on the side of consumer issues in the general debate. It is important that the framework we put in place for the new Bill does not lessen the importance of prudential supervision, because, as I explained earlier, that is more important in the scale of things. The Central Bank of Ireland financial ser<Col N="1484" /> vices regulatory authority Bill, as it has now become known, should be published in the near future. It has been striking that that debate has been ongoing for more than the past three years between me, my colleagues in Government, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance. Fine Gael took one view and the Labour Party took another as to how it should go. I am pointing that out now in the context of what has happened in AIB. The bottom line when it comes to financial regulations, is that there is no danger or risk to the institutions. In that regard the Central Bank has a great record. This incident is primarily the responsibility of the Federal Reserve of the United States and local regulators there. The Federal Reserve has an excellent record as well. At one remove the Central Bank will be looking at the overall AIB group.</P>
      <P>The overall hit to AIB is a blow to its earnings for 2001. I understand the bank decided, for accounting reasons, to take a hit in the 2001 profits thereby reducing them but it will be a one-off hit on its balance sheet. The overall reserve of the AIB group in 2002 is totally different than it was in the mid-1980s when its previous administration was faced with the problem regarding the ICI collapse. We can have different viewpoints as to how that deal was entered into and whether the State could have made a better deal. I readily appreciate the difficulties when a case like that is presented to the Government. It was to have such a severe effect on the group that immediate action had to be taken. If we were doing it again I am sure we would have worked out a better deal but at the time it was the first big hit to the Irish financial system.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for AIB in the first instance to review its internal procedures in these matters. I heard Mr. Buckley explaining this morning that the complexity of the fraud is such that it was very difficult to detect. This trader was taking positions but he was hedging them off or insuring against them by taking another position so the net effect on the balance sheet on any day would have been very small. He used false invoices to hedge off and it was only as the exposure got bigger and he had to supply cash that people began to look at him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not fair to compare the DIRT matter to this incident. The DIRT matter was one on which there was considerable difference of opinion between people in AIB and other financial institutions as to what had occurred around 1991. The Public Accounts Committee met and formed its view and we got a considerable amount of money as a result. The two things are not comparable. The most important aspect of today is as a wake-up call to the debate we have been having over the past three and a half years, which has gone in a particular direction that I would not have chosen. The view expressed by Deputy Noonan was closer to my view than to that of the Labour Party. A balance must be struck between the consumer aspects and the prudential elements. The <Col N="1485" /> most important aspect from my viewpoint is the prudential element.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that the most important task in the wake of this appalling fraud is assurance and re-assurance from the Minister. What re-assurance can he give Irish investors, particularly those people whose pensions depend upon the financial institution involved, that there will not be any adverse impact or consequences?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that it is quite an extraordinary situation that in the years after the Barings Bank-Nick Leeson fraud that financial institutions do not appear to have learned sufficient lessons. What lessons are to be learned by us in this jurisdiction? When will he bring forward the legislation that is long outstanding and long overdue? He conceded a few moments ago that today's actions serve as a wake-up call to himself and his Government. Can we have confirmation that this legislation will be before the House this session and passed before a dissolution of the current Dáil, having regard to the urgency involved?</P>
      <P>It has been reported that in the aftermath of the fraud AIB, in the words of the Minister, will take the hit. It has been suggested that it will offset this loss against its tax. If that is the case then we are dealing with a fundamental unfairness in the system, that somebody can set-off the consequences of a fraud against tax compared to the individual who can have his house burgled or who may be subjected to a fraud and cannot set-off any of his or her losses against tax. Will the Minster confirm that such a regime exists that will allow the bank to set off this huge amount of money against tax that would otherwise be paid to the Exchequer?</P>

      <P>With respect to Deputy Flanagan, I do not know what accountancy training now forms part of the solicitor's courses, but there is certainly an accountancy element to it. There certainly was in my day and I am sure there still is.

      <P>This is not to set-off against tax. It will be an expense in the profit and loss accounts of the AIB group, the same as in Deputy Flanagan's business if he is paying staff in Portlaoise that are not working for him. That becomes an expense in his profit and loss account. There is no difference in that for any business.</P>

      <P>The profits of AIB &ndash; which are expected to be in the order of £1.4 billion &ndash; will be reduced. It will take it all back against the 2001 figures the same as the bank, or any other institution, makes provision against specific bad debts. There is nothing new about that.</P>
      <P>With regard to pension funds I heard what the chief executive of the Irish Association of Investment Managers said at lunch time. He spelled out what the situation is here, that no pension fund over-exposes itself to any one stock. Pension funds' trustees strike a balance between stocks, equities, bonds and other investments. Generally with equities the bigger funds keep a proportion of their equities in different stocks in proportion to the weighting that stock would have in any market. From a count it did of the pension funds this morning, the exposure to AIB appears to be only of the order of 2% in managed funds. That is what trustees of any pension funds do and they do not take a position stronger than that. Since we joined the euro, one of the weaknesses of the Irish market has been that the pension funds have been lessening their dependence on Irish stocks because it is all euro denominated stocks. They are taking the weighting of the Irish market in the context of the euro market so there will be less independence there. The losses in some pension funds will be made up by gains in others. If one had stayed with cash last year and not taken any position with equities it would have been a reasonable year whereas most pension funds showed a negative for the past year. In that respect there is nothing to be overly concerned about.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised a question as to what lesson had been learned regarding the Nick Leeson-Barings Bank debacle of recent times. All of the financial institutions have tried to put in procedures that would not allow that type of operation to evolve but it is obvious from the AIB case that when people collude and the fraud is complex the new procedures do not work.  </P>
      <P>With regard to the new Bill, it has been with the Chief Parliamentary Counsel for some time and was returned in recent days. It runs to more than 200 pages already. There have been consultations with the European Central Bank, which has a considerable legal role in how the regulatory central banks operate within the Euro system. I hope the Bill will be published in this session. It is a major tome and in my earlier reply to Deputy McGrath I revisited some of the issues which had to be addressed and are still being addressed within this House, and outside, as to the various aspects of which the Bill should take account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given an interesting discourse about the debate within this House about the nature of regulation which, as he knows, reflects the debate within Government on the same issues. Perhaps that debate is a good <Col N="1487" /> thing but it really misses the point because what we see today is evidence of a gigantic failure of prudential regulation. It is not reassuring for people to hear the Minister say that if two people collaborate they can defy all measures of prudential regulation. We must surely be capable of devising a system to prevent one or two people virtually bringing down the biggest public company and the biggest bank in this country. If that did not happen on this occasion, it could easily happen on another occasion. We need reassurance from the Minister and the Central Bank that our regulations are up to that job and can prevent that sort of potential catastrophe happening. What is the precise role of the Irish Central Bank in regulating foreign subsidiaries of Allied Irish Banks? What role has it played over the past year or so, during the course of the development of this crisis in Allfirst in regulating Allied Irish Banks and its subsidiary in the United States? What role is it currently performing and what role does the Minister see it performing, over the coming weeks and months, in further regulating and exploring what has happened? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter will have to be addressed by the US federal authorities, as the body charged with the regulation of banks within their sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Irish Central Bank not also got a role? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. In the same way as the federal authorities in the US, the Irish Central Bank is the primary regulatory authority for the Irish subsidiaries of foreign banks, such as those of Germany, France and the United States. Our success over the past 14 years in developing the Irish Financial Services Centre is attributable to the reputation that our Central Bank has garnered in relation to its regulatory functions. There are also other reasons for the success of the IFSC but, in the view of the banks operating there, one of the key reasons has been the reputation of our Central Bank and the regulatory environment which it has operated. In all the hoo-haa of recent years about other matters, including DIRT, that key aspect has been forgotten. On the basis of the Central Bank's reputation, people are prepared to invest in subsidiaries in the IFSC because they know they are regulated to the very highest standards. I welcome this opportunity to emphasise that again.</P>
      <P>The current situation in AIB's US subsidiary is, in the first instance, a matter for the Federal Reserve in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Not exclusively so. Our Central Bank must also have a role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, just as the German central bank has a role in relation to the group business of a large German bank subsidiary in Ireland. <Col N="1488" /> The Irish Central Bank has visited the US to meet the Federal Reserve concerning this bank and other institutions there. On the last such visit, in May 2001, I understand the Federal Reserve, which also has a high reputation, examined this bank and gave a glowing report on it. It is not true to say this debacle was capable of bringing down the AIB group. Perhaps in the mid 1980s, depending on one's view of those issues, that potential may have existed but that is not the situation in 2002. This once-off hit will reduce the profits of AIB for last year, which will still be considerable, but the effect on the capital adequacy ratios of AIB is very small. Even after this, what is known as the tier one adequacy ratio is much higher than any of its competitors and well above what would be regarded as a benchmark. I wish to put it clearly on record that there is no threat at all to the AIB group and people can rest assured in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister regret that he and the Tánaiste delayed so long in establishing the regulator to oversee our financial institutions? Does he agree that he did not take adequate initiatives in this regard, especially after the DIRT inquiry? That should have been a wake-up call for any Minister for Finance and he still has not acted in that regard.</P>

      <P>As I made clear in my reply, irrespective of any new Bill, this situation occurred in a bank in the United States. It has no bearing at all on whether we had a new Bill or greater emphasis on consumers or prudential regulation or whatever. The debate which has gone on, inside this House and outside, has been divided. The Labour Party's position was totally different from its leader's position. The Central Bank had a different position to that of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I set up a nine-man implementation group, all participants very able people, and I got three separate reports from them. There were considerable differences but it boiled down to one major difference. With regard to Deputy Belton's point, the regulation of the Allfirst financial institution in the United States was a matter for the US Federal Reserve. The Irish Central Bank only has a role in relation to the AIB group and, like other central banks, it liaises constantly with other regulatory authorities in the countries concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take one more question from each of the three Deputies who submitted questions. I call Deputy McGrath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has put it clearly on record and I hope the message goes out that the bank itself is safe and the shareholders are protected. An important issue which has not been mentioned is the protection of staff jobs within the AIB group in Ireland. I welcome the assurances the Minister has given. Can he confirm that the principles which are now <Col N="1489" /> adopted by the EU in relation to ratios of capital against risk asset are absolutely secure in the case of this bank and that it complies with them? The Minister pointed very clearly to the internal auditing system within AIB in giving rise to the present problems. Does he agree that AIB seems to have fallen down badly in that regard and that it is regrettable, having regard to what happened in the past, that senior management had not seen fit to strengthen the management systems and auditing procedures within AIB?</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke of the AIB loss being written off for tax purposes against group profits within this State. He proceeded to remind us that this can be done by any business. Is it not strange that any company or business of that nature can write off losses incurred as a result of a fraud against their profits but anyone who is mugged on the street or whose house is burgled has no comeback? Is it fair that big business can write off losses at the ultimate expense of the taxpayer, while ordinary individuals who suffer losses cannot gain redress?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not thought this would become a debate on accountancy practices. There are many farmers in County Westmeath. Would the Deputy expect them to pay tax on losses? If a farmer from the county has all his stock stolen and he does not have insurance, he will have less profits &ndash; more probably a loss &ndash; in the year in which the theft occurred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>One pays tax only when one makes a profit. On that basis, people in the business of selling, buying and lending money are in the same business as farmers who sell and buy cattle and shopkeepers who buy and sell goods. There is no difference between them. People are never asked to pay tax on profits they do not make. If I was in business as a shopkeeper and my premises was raided, I would be making less profits and would, therefore, have to pay less tax.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the Basle and EU guidelines. These require that banks hold certain and minimum amounts of capital. This capital must be held in specified types of assets to ensure that in the event of difficulty, the bank will not only have sufficient assets to meet its obligations but has them in an accessible form. Even after the event under discussion, AIB's capital ratios are comfortably above the requirements laid down. In a statement this morning, AIB stated:</P>
      <P>The impact is to reduce AIB Group's tier one capital ratio at 31 December, 2001 from 7.2% to 6.4% with total capital reducing from 10.8% to 9.9%. The Allfirst tier one capital ratio reduces from 10.5% to 7.2% with total capital reducing from 13.3% to 10.0%. These capital ratios remain strong by international financial standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept this has been a particularly black week for Irish companies trading on the international stage? As Minister for Finance and an important member of the Government, what can he do to restore confidence particularly having regard to the fact that the reputation of Irish companies trading on the international stage is somewhat at stake? How can we recover from what has happened at AIB and how can we ensure the damage and adverse consequences will be minimised?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us look at this another way. I do not believe the city of London's reputation suffered to a large extent when Mr. Leeson caused difficulties for Barings. The reputation of the city of London was such that trading there continued. AIB and Elan comprise approximately 40% of the value of the Irish Stock Exchange and are two of its heavy hitters. Both of these major companies have had a particularly bad week. As companies that are associated with Ireland, it would be far better if their recent troubles had not occurred. The circumstances relating to the downward spiral in Elan's share price and the difficulties experienced by AIB are different and are not comparable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are comparable in terms of their both involving bad news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Élan's difficulties resulted from the new scrutiny of accounting practices that came about following the collapse of Enron in the United States. The latter company had a market capitalised value of $80 billion but, a mere matter of weeks later, it is now worth very little. People began to question the accountancy practices of various corporations following the Enron collapse and Élan suffered as a result. It was then obliged to issue a profit warning which further affected its share price.</P>
      <P>AIB's share price fell by approximately 10% this morning and by 1.30 p.m. it had fallen by 16%. This reflects the view the market has taken of events. I am not going to advise people to either buy or sell AIB stock. That is a matter for marketeers, who make their money by adopting particular positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>If this was an ordinary company, we could happily state that this is a management failure and is totally the business of the company. However, that is not the case because AIB is Ireland's bank. Notwithstanding that the fraud took place in one of its subsidiaries in the United States, it will still have significant consequences for Ireland. In most cases one would say that surely there must be some management process in place to ensure that one individual cannot defraud a bank or institution of the amount of money in question. Usually most banks seek to do this by dividing responsibility, by auditing and by putting in place some form of accountability procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1491" />This is a matter of public interest because the security of our banking system is crucial to the operation of our economy. In my opinion the Minister and the Central Bank must discover exactly what happened in the United States and put in place measures to ensure there is not a recurrence. A clear message must go out from the House, the Minister and the governor of the Central Bank that this will be the case.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied that we have been apprised of the full extent of the losses involved? Is he satisfied those losses have either been met or that options have been exercised or hedging has taken place to ensure they are contained? Is he further satisfied with the level of accountability and information he has received from AIB?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not communicated directly with AIB. My information on this matter came from the governor of the Central Bank, from a press conference held by AIB earlier today and from my Department. As the chief executive of AIB stated, it is believed the figure of $750 million put forward this morning will be the extent of the bank's liability. However, he was at pains to point out that this figure was AIB's best estimate of the total loss involved.</P>
      <P>The first part of the Deputy's question relates to putting in place procedures to ensure&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must realise that it is not possible for me to give the assurance he is seeking at 5 p.m. on a Wednesday. Even AIB, which is directly involved, was at pains to avoid stating explicitly that $750 million would be its total exposure. Other commentators have stated they are of the view it would be the outside limit of the bank's exposure. I am not in a position to provide any cast-iron guarantees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the Minister and I appreciate that he has come before the House, on short notice, only hours after this story first broke. However, I am seeking an assurance that he, his Department and the Central Bank will seek to obtain this information and satisfy themselves that $750 million is the limit of the liability. We cannot state that AIB is a private company and no concern of ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, AIB management is doing its best to discover the extent of the liability. Management representatives will report on that matter to the regulatory authorities both here and in the United States. AIB appears to have been working for the past two days to identify its total exposure and make it a matter of public record. The governor of the Central Bank will report to me on any changes he believes should be introduced and on the outcome of <Col N="1492" /> investigations into this matter. I am sure AIB and every other institution would love to have procedures in place which would allow them to guarantee, forever and a day, that nobody would conspire to defraud them. We would be delighted if that was the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>We were dealing with amendments Nos. 1, 43, 44, 45 and 46 together. I raised the question of the need for the new power stations and asked how long the peat might last. The Minister of State suggested 15 years but was unsure, and Deputy Stagg disputed that estimate. Perhaps he has now received full information and could clarify that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also mentioned the necessity to investigate the possibility of converting peat powered stations to timber powered stations in the not too distant future and we discussed the technology that exists in other countries. What are the Minister's views on that? The Minister suggested that taking the timber from forests here might be difficult. However, technology in Scandinavia makes <Col N="1493" /> it possible to cut trees into very small pieces, in other words chipped. It is then taken out using tractors and trailers to a nearby power point and could then be used for domestic heating systems as well as for power generation. There are all kinds of possibilities. The Minister made the point that in Ireland we have lots of forests that could not be used for commercial purposes, but they would be ideal for this purpose. Deputy Bruton was concerned about sustainability, and Deputy Sargent mentioned pollution. Converting peat &ndash; powered stations to timber would be an important compromise if it could be reached. It would also mean Bord na Móna could expand and develop in this area and give employment in Laois, Offaly and other places where there are forests and where other enterprises may not be flourishing. I would like to hear the Minister's views on that as it was so strongly debated earlier.</P>
    <P>I will deal with amendments Nos. 44, 46 and 56 in more detail later. I realise the importance of putting the PSO in place. However, we must also bear in mind the importance of the environment and the difficulties we may face if we do not get our act together soon. We welcome this legislation and will support Sustainable Energy Ireland as much as possible when it is set up. I also ask the Minister to ensure resources by way of personnel and otherwise are made available in his Department to ensure this entire area, which is very important, gets the attention it deserves.</P>
    <P>A conference is due to take place in early March in Austria on sustainable energy and I wonder whether Ireland will be represented at it. It is important that we have representation at conferences such as this so that we know what is happening and can learn from best practice in other countries.</P>
    <P>I also raised the question of whether or not the consumer will have to pay more for electricity. I do not think that is the case. Perhaps the Minister would clarify that. The Minister alluded to it but there was no clear response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Stanton asked about peat resources. I am glad I did not give a definitive answer earlier. I have now had the opportunity to check. Bord na Móna estimates that the following peat resources are available: 65 million tonnes in the five developed locations that serve the existing peat-fired power generating stations; and 25 million tonnes at the east midland bog group which serves Ireland's newest peat-fired power generating plant at Edenderry. Based on current usage, it is estimated that the available resources can service power generation for at least 30 years. Without a PSO levy the peat plants would not be economically viable. It is the ESB's view that when the period of PSO is completed, peat-fired power generation plants will be closed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Stanton also raised the possibility of using peat-firing technology to produce electricity from renewable sources such as wood trimmings and wood waste. I agree with him that this is a very exciting prospect. As far as I am aware the same technology now being contemplated for the new peat stations will also be able to burn wood to produce electricity.</P>
      <P>The issues that arise are costs in relation to harvesting, transport and disposal of waste. The latter is quite a problematic issue as I have learned from discussions with people in other countries. This is one of the new areas of possible development that the new authority will be able to examine and report on. It was my great pleasure on Monday last to draw to the attention of a roomful of renewable energy developers the fact that the Irish Energy Centre has produced a document for public consultation on research and development into renewable energy. The Renewables Research and Development Programme has funding of &euro;16.25 million up to 2006. There are, therefore, plenty of financial resources to be used for forward planning and the important area of research and development.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned Sweden. Comparing our timber resources to those of Sweden is like comparing apples and oranges because Sweden has such huge resources. Notwithstanding that, we have resources here, and should have in the future. Our land area under forest is between 7% and 9%. That was certainly the case four or five years ago when I was particularly involved and it may have increased by a couple of percentage points since then. At that time the European average was about 25%. Sweden has huge resources and harvesting timber there is tantamount to a mining operation. They just go in and extract the timber. What is positive is that the Swedish Government has taken the decision to withdraw from nuclear energy production and to major in biomass and other forms of energy production. As Deputy Sargent will know, it has 12 nuclear plants. It has just completed the decommissioning of one of those plants. The timespan for doing that was something like three years and there is a 30-year timescale for decommissioning its entire nuclear plant. That is a positive move and we can take example from countries such as Sweden in this regard.</P>
      <P>The scale of the PSO levy is the final matter to which Deputy Stanton referred. The indicative amount to be recouped by way of levy for the PSO up to 2019 is &euro;617 million. I have already mentioned that figure. It represents no more than the additional cost incurred by the ESB by comparison with the cost of a best new entrant. The PSO levy will be calculated by the CER on an annual basis in accordance with the methodology approved by the EU Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For illustrative purposes, initially the overall level of PSO is likely to average 3%. PSO levy amounts may be approximately as follows: domestic account holders, &euro;2 per two months; small non-domestic account holders, &euro;7 per two <Col N="1495" /> months; medium and large account holders, &euro;1.47 per KVA. It is estimated that industry would be likely to pay a PSO levy in the range of 2% to 3.3% on average. However, it is important to emphasise that the cost of peat and AER generation to be included in the PSO order is already embedded in the ESB's franchise tariff.</P>
    <P>The CER will ensure that the costs already allowed in the franchise tariff are offset against the PSO levy we have introduced so that, essentially, there will be no net overall increase in electricity bills. That is what the Deputy wished to be reassured about. The PSO levy element will be separately identified and explained in each electricity bill.</P>

      <P>In page 3, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;the lean economy' means an economy independent of finite and increasingly scarce imported fossil fuels and tailored to maximise energy conservation and rely primarily on renewable energy sources;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Minister of State has had time to think about this amendment, which seeks to insert a definition of &ldquo;lean economy&rdquo; given that it would be logical for a sustainable energy authority to be aware of and articulate views on the steps needed to ensure economic activity can thrive without impacting on the finite energy resources which are currently being depleted and giving rise to enormous problems with greenhouse gases. Has the Minister of State had time to reflect on the idea of a lean economy? The term has been used by economists, FEASTA, the Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability and Dr. David Fleming from London, who recently spoke at Trinity College on this topic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1497" />The Minister of State said our Kyoto Protocol obligations were suffering on account of our economic activity. Does he recognise that the achievement of other countries, such as Germany, is such that they are able to continue to have vibrant economic activity without growth in the consumption of fossil fuels? They have decoupled their growth in the consumption of fossil fuels from growth in the economy. Does the Minister of State not recognise also that this should be a central part of the Sustainable Energy Authority and that it should advise on this aspect to ensure economic growth will not always be paralleled with growth in the consumption of fossil fuels, as has been the case in this country?</P>
    <P>In view of this, the definition of a lean economy should be incorporated in the Bill. It is set out in amendment No. 5 which reads: &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;the lean economy' means an economy independent of finite and increasingly scarce imported fossil fuels and tailored to maximise energy conservation and rely primarily on renewable energy sources.&rdquo; We should work towards this ideal before we are forced to face up to the reality of no other choice in the matter. I ask the Minister of State to recognise that this aspiration should be before all of us, especially the Sustainable Energy Authority, if it is serious about bringing about sustainable energy in a sustainable economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>This was debated on Committee Stage when we strongly supported a similar amendment. It is important to have an ideal to work towards. This is one such ideal. I ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 11 provides that an additional function of the Sustainable Energy Authority should be &ldquo;to promote the concept and development of lean economies, especially in Ireland.&rdquo;  There was a criticism that this would mean us interfering in the economies of other countries. However, given that we are living in a global village, what happens in other countries impacts on us. If we can encourage other countries to use sustainable energy resources and move away from fossil fuels, it will be beneficial for us in the long-term.</P>
      <P>I see nothing but good if the concept of a lean economy is promoted in Ireland. It should be included in the Bill. The lean economy means an economy independent of finite and increasingly scarce imported fossil fuels and tailored to maximise energy conservation and rely primarily on renewable energy sources. That is an idea we should strive towards. It would strengthen the legislation and put down a marker that at the start of this century this Parliament recognises the importance of moving away from the use of fossil fuel and reducing our dependence on it. I urge the Minister of State to accept these amendments. It would be a good day's work were he to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments were moved on Committee Stage. I did not accept them then and my position has not altered. Their thrust is <Col N="1498" /> already covered by the functions of the new authority, which, among other matters, are to promote and assist energy efficiency and renewables. Inserting the concept of a lean economy would add nothing to the Bill.</P>
      <P>In the course of debate on Committee Stage mention was made of the new authority and how it should have a responsibility to outline ways for society to be truly sustainable. The concept of sustainable development is about much more than energy efficiency and renewable energy. It should also include poverty eradication, sustainable agricultural methods and so on. As it is not part of the authority's remit to cover such issues, I, therefore, consider this proposal is too broad for inclusion.</P>
      <P>It was suggested on Committee Stage that the Government was taking a minimalist approach to this issue. I again reject this, especially in view of the Government's commitment to provide &euro;222 million under the national development plan for the promotion of energy efficiency and renewable initiatives and our continual implementation of the Green Paper on sustainable energy and the national climate change strategy. Recent announcements of substantial moves forward on renewables emphasise this point. The announcements on activity in the offshore and onshore wind areas are examples. Ireland will play a lead role in the area of sustainable energy in a very short period of time and it is important that we do so. The proposed amendment to section 6 could involve the authority in promoting such concepts outside Ireland, which would take its remit beyond what is envisaged in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State is right when he says Ireland will take a leading role in renewable technology in the future. That is what I had in mind when I drafted amendment No. 11, which calls on the authority to promote the concept and development of lean economies, especially in Ireland. This would enable us to promote ourselves as a country that does not just consider the mechanics of renewable energy, but also deals with how they can be integrated into an economy which has a quality of life and is vibrant, healthy and sustainable.</P>
      <P>I do not see what harm can be done by including both amendments. Given that many others will be involved in integrating economic strategy, I am merely seeking to ensure the Sustainable Energy Authority is included in the network of agencies and would have a role, even as weak as an advisory one.</P>
      <P>It is strange for the Minister of State to say this is already covered in the legislation. It cannot be addressed by a subtle inclusion of general issues under a broad remit. The amendments would do no more or less than provide a context in which sustainable energy should be developed. I ask the Minister of State to reconsider.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but let me outline a specific case for the Minister of State to consider. The west, especially County Galway, faces a power deficit. The Government states that renewable sources of energy are required.</P>
      <P>That may be a wish but the reality is that the planning department of our local authority will not allow it despite the Department having hinted that realistic consideration be given to any proper proposal that comes before it. A major project for wind energy was proposed in County Galway. It was unusual in that landowners combined to put forward a major investment themselves. It involved alternative land use which had been encouraged by Government and local authorities but it was turned down because of the presence in the site area of two hen harriers. If major projects to facilitate the development and supply of additional electricity to the west have to be curtailed, restricted and denied because of the possible impact on two hen harriers, is the Minister of State using grandiose jargon and clichés without any serious input on it? On the issue of renewable energy there has to be a change and one arm of the State, in this instance Dúchas, because of a minimal impact not proven, cannot deny a major investment in the infrastructure in the west. This is a situation where the Minister of State needs to take stern action to ensure Government policy is adhered to and implemented to the letter of the law, taking into account the importance of wildlife, the impact on visual amenities and so on. It is time the Minister of State took a handle on these proposals. I hope, when other projects intended to eliminate the energy deficit in the west come on stream, his encouragement will be evident and that he will not allow such small incidents to stifle growth.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State in regard to the development of lean economies said other countries would be outside the remit of the Bill. That is an arguable point. However, there is a provision in the Bill at section 6(2) that the authority shall be involved with:</P>
      <P>(i) the exchange of information with organisations outside the State and participation in international activities;</P>
      <P>(j) representation of a Minister of the Government at meetings of international bodies where requested to do so by the Minister,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new authority will be involved in the international arena as it should be. When taking part in such activities, it could promote the development of lean economies. There is not anything wrong with that. It is not impossible and it is not broadening its remit too much. It is something it should do at home and abroad, where possible. <Col N="1500" /> We live in a global village. If other economies are not going down the route of this country, we will all suffer in the long-term. Global warming is a reality. This is an ideal that should be taken on board and it would not take from the Bill. I ask the Minister of State to accept these amendments and not to divide the House.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;5.&ndash;The Authority shall, subject to the provisions of the Act, be independent in the exercise of its functions.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises from the Committee Stage debate. We were anxious &ldquo;That the Authority shall, subject to the provisions of the Act, be independent in the exercise of its functions&rdquo;. This appears to be a standard provision in many Bills. We wished to give the Minister an opportunity to have a look at it and to consider it for Report Stage. I am interested to hear his response. The question was raised, independent of whom and of what. Certainly it would stand alone and other agencies, other bodies, would not interfere with it except by way of legislation, <Col N="1501" /> which is provided for. That would strengthen the hand of the authority. It would make it independent and it would be seen to be independent. There are many powerful organisations, national and international, involved in energy provision, supply, transmission and generation. Some of these organisations have huge resources and power &ndash; pardon the pun. It is probably implicit in the Bill that the authority is independent but the amendment would make it explicit by having it written into the legislation. It would not take from the Bill but would put into words what we are trying to do by setting up a statutory agency. I ask the Minister to consider it and to accept it.</P>

      <P>There is no point repeating the contribution I made on this issue during the Report Stage proceedings in the Seanad and on Committee Stage. I considered the matter very carefully in the light of those debates. In past debates I outlined my definition of &ldquo;sustainable energy&rdquo; which is a product of a range of policies and measures, which, while not exhaustive, includes energy supply, energy efficiency, renewable energy, electricity market reform, security of energy supply, sustainable transport, the Kyoto flexibility mechanisms for greenhouse gas reductions and a host of other factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my expectation that the new authority will concentrate on the implementation of policies which encompass energy efficiency and renewable energy. It will be expected to publish strategies, propose programmes and set targets in <Col N="1502" /> respect of such policies and report on progress. By concentrating on its remit to promote energy efficiency, renewables and energy research and development, the authority will meet the spirit of the amendment through the nature of its work. I remain convinced of the view I expressed on Committee Stage, namely, that sustainability does not need constant redefining, but depends instead on ensuring we constantly assist and promote the use of best available technology and best practice to achieve the sustainability goal. It is a function of the authority to ensure this occurs.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 11, to delete &ldquo;and economically&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We were anxious on Committee Stage to highlight the link between sustainable energy and the economy. We were also concerned that one of the functions of the authority will be to promote economically sustainable production, supply and use of energy. Energy could be subject to all sorts of provisions such as budgetary and taxation measures. Economic sustainability is, therefore, something of a movable feast. We want to make a distinction. While it is obvious that something is not sustainable if it is uneconomic, at the same time, attention should be drawn to the fact that success is very often the result of drive and promotion.</P>
      <P>If something is economically feasible, it will be successful. If not, it will fail. In this context, the big issue is who decides if it is economically successful. Finance Ministers could assume this role using tax measures. The price producers receive for sustainable energy, which is determined by Governments, Ministers, the European Commission and so on, is an issue. We are anxious to break any link which could lead to the promotion and development of sustainable energy becoming totally dependent on economics. It is a complex argument, but it is important to bring it to the Minister of State's attention again.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has informed me several times that biofuels such as ethanol derived from sugar beet are not economically viable and are not, therefore, promoted or developed here. Why are they not viable? The reason ethanol has not been successful is the failure to introduce tax and other measures to make it viable. As reliance on economic factors could knock or stop something, it is important we are aware of their role in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I undertook to consider this issue further. I endeavoured to explain the reasons behind my resolve to retain the word &ldquo;economically&rdquo; in this subsection and remain convinced they are valid. As I have argued, the authority must have regard to cost issues, which does not mean it must be preoccupied with penny-pinching, but rather, as Deputy <Col N="1503" /> Stagg stated on Committee Stage, a concern with value for money.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage it was also argued that the authority would not be able to assist or promote renewable electricity generating technologies such as wave or tidal energy. It is important to note that it can and must promote and assist such technologies under section 6(1)<i>(a)</i> and <i>(e)</i> on the basis that they are both renewables and research and development technologies. There is no economic consideration or constraint attached to the provisions of the section. The authority can, therefore, assist under two of its functions.</P>
      <P>Technologies which initially may not be cost effective, but have the potential to become so over time, including those to which Deputy Stanton referred, come well within the remit of the authority. Under section 6(1)<i>(a)</i> it can promote and assist the likes of combined heat and power plants, which are environmentally sustainable and economic in comparison with other thermal generating plants. The section, as drafted, meets the requirements of Deputies in all respects. I hope I have clarified the matter to their satisfaction.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's reference to the capacity of wave and tides to generate energy. In my county a debate is taking place on the issue of energy. With regard to wind, wave and tidal energy, we need to receive clearer definitions from the Department. There is considerable confusion in County Kerry regarding wind farms. One application was recently refused on the grounds that there were no clear directives from the Department. Although the county council is in the process of drafting a wind policy, I still believe it is inadequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. The local authority is drawing up a policy in which, I hope, it will decide which parts of the county will be suitable for wind energy or perhaps even energy generation from waves.</P>

      <P>The sooner, the better. Having said that, there does not seem to be a national, cohesive policy on this subject. I know it is new but there is much confusion at the moment. We are talking about the economic value of energy here and there is a conflict in Kerry between tourism and the generation of wind power or, even if to comes down to it, of wave or tidal power. In the future, there are bound to be applications for the generation or the harnessing of the mass capacity for wave and tidal power given the potential we have in a county like Kerry which has so many inlets. There seems to be a total lack of direction <Col N="1504" /> and advice available to people promoting wind energy or, in the future, wave and tidal energy.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said a national policy is being followed but I would like clearer guidelines. The conflict in Kerry is between the visual intrusion on the landscape by large turbines and selling the county for tourism purposes. At a recent county council meeting one of the councillors from Killarney, which depends so much on tourism, said a turbine should not be allowed in the county and that we should rule out wind energy completely. How can the Minister of State sustain that argument? The councillor was from his party as well. How can he reconcile that argument with reaching our national quota in the development of wind energy and harnessing the potential of the natural advantages a county like Kerry, with such high wind speeds, has?</P>
      <P>Although he has probably done so on a number of occasions, the Minister of State might give his views on the balance between the preservation of the landscape and the environment and reaching the targets for wind energy production and the generation of energy from renewal sources. That is a very important point. It is very much about the economy of the west because we are trying to balance the growth of tourism with the production of energy from renewal sources.</P>

      <P>I rise briefly to support the points made by Deputies Ulick Burke and Deenihan. It never ceases to amaze me how the Department of Public Enterprise has policies adopted by the Government which the planning authorities at local level seem to be able to ignore but that when a policy is espoused by Bacon and adopted by Government, it then becomes nearly an absolute for local authorities to impose the Bacon guidelines for instance on housing. I would like to see the same force of law or authority given to the policies adopted by Government, the Department and the Minister in the matter of renewal energy. I was frustrated no end in my previous existence in that Department by having very good policies and many proposals to be implement but having them turned down one after the other by local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be said that a modern wind turbine is quite a beautiful structure. The idea of it raising its arms to the heavens to extract energy without doing any damage whatever is such a good idea that we do not promote it well enough. One will notice that if there are photographs promoting areas and how well they look and if there are wind farms about, they will be photographed. People are attracted to them in a very strange way. Where wind farms operate in Ireland &ndash; we have a few now &ndash; the promoters had to provide accommodation at them for the visitors who come to see them. The modern wind farm is not noisy, does not pollute and does not kill birds &ndash; hen harriers and otherwise. In fact, if bogland is disturbed during the construction period, there will be 15 times more flora as a result of disturbing the top of the bog than if the bog had <Col N="1505" /> been left alone. Some disturbance is a great gain to flora.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the point made by other Deputies that the Minister of State should try to get his policies across to local authority planners in the same way as the Department of the Environment and Local Government is capable of telling local authority planners that something is Government policy and that they must abide by or have regard to it. I would say to Members who may be members of local authorities is that if that does not work, use section 4s. The authority is in the hands of members then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I plead once more with the Minister of State to use his good offices to communicate with his colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, and the officers of Dúchas. As Deputies Stagg and Deenihan have said, there is an urgent need to reconcile the two arms of Government so that we can have a cohesive policy. There is no point blaming the local authorities for rejecting a recommendation when another agency of Government tells them to reject it. While habitats and wildlife may exist in a location, it is time we got real about the impact of something which, as Deputy Stagg said, with proper design can be very acceptable. People who want to object go to another agency of State, Dúchas, where they find a ready facility and vehicle by which to torpedo something which is much needed. Will the Minister of State contact his colleague in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Island and rectify this? Inevitably, the majority of these installations will be found in sensitive areas around the country, whether in Donegal, Kerry, Connemara, Galway and elsewhere. These are sensitive areas and they are entitled to a sensitive response but there is no point in overreacting. That has happened in the past and great injustice has been done, and I have spoken of the energy deficit in County Galway.</P>

      <P>Getting back to the amendment and economically sustainable production, it is useful that the Minister of State put on record that the work of the authority would not be bound by economics. In future years when people read this debate &ndash; I am sure many of these debates are read by many people &ndash; this will be noted and the wise words of the Minister of State will be taken into account. It is a pity he would not put something in writing but he said it on record. That is good enough for me and I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to reply. I agree totally with the sentiments expressed by the Deputies who talked about the need to promote this technology &ndash; wind energy &ndash; and the constraints which have been there in terms of planning. There has already been a sea-change. Quite often planning refusals stem from public aversion, complaint or reaction to something, <Col N="1506" /> although in this case we are talking about wind farms and wind turbines. We had four competitions up to last Monday or four announcements of offers to wind energy promoters. Following those competitions we have approximately 124 megawatts of wind energy from 22 commercial wind farms.</P>
      <P>On Monday last I announced offers to 40 wind farms across a good geographical spread but predominantly along the western seaboard, all of which have planning permission and will produce approximately 350 megawatts of wind energy incorporated in large and small scale wind farms. I specifically included in the conditions for the competition that the applicants must have full planning permission before applying so that we could commence building once the announcement was made. There are still constraints, however, but I emphasise what Deputy Stagg and others said. This is clean, green, renewable energy. The downsides have been projected in the past by a major proportion of the general public who had fears about the visual and noise aspects. There is virtually no noise emanating from these wind farms. The technology has caught up with that aspect. I, too, am intrigued by them, although I know beauty is in the eye of the beholder.</P>
      <P>Environmentally speaking, the advantages of this technology greatly outweigh the disadvantages and the public's attitude to them has changed dramatically. The proof of that is the fact that 40 wind farms will be put in place immediately, all with planning permission. We will move immediately to AER VI, which is the next measure, to ensure that the target of 500 additional megawatts by 2005 is reached. We will shortly put out an offer to similar applicants with the planning permission condition obtaining. As we all know, planning is a matter for local county councils and An Bord Pleanála is available to hear appeals; one can even go beyond that if one has a large wallet.</P>
      <P>There has been a sea change in this area. Problems still exist but we are endeavouring, in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to work with planning authorities to devise a policy that will be more acceptable and which will allow this technology to be used without ruining our countryside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's problems are only beginning in that people are becoming increasingly concerned about the intrusion on the landscape caused by these turbines. I am talking from first-hand experience of them in Kerry. There are two aspects to this problem. There is the wind farm itself and where it will be sited. An application was submitted recently for a wind farm on the Tarbert-Ballylongford land bank to which there was strong local opposition because it was sited near a school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the Minister of State that there is virtually no noise from these wind farms. There is noise emanating from them depending <Col N="1507" /> on the direction of the wind. I know people who live near a wind farm and they are very concerned about that aspect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Their lives have been affected by it. Apart from the wind farm itself, the other aspect is the transmission of the electricity to the power station. People are becoming more concerned about the intrusion of the electricity lines and the proximity of pylons to their houses. The ESB is proposing to provide a new line between Tarbert power station and Tralee because of the need for power in Tralee but the local farmers are forming a group to oppose this line due to its intrusion on to their land. Future Ministers will have to be ready to meet these kinds of objections and to allay any fears that might exist rather than just dealing with them on a case by case basis.</P>
      <P>Kerry County Council is in the process of producing its draft plan which I understand will be brought forward at our next meeting. Some of the officials from the Department &ndash; there is a well-known Kerryman sitting beside him&mdash;</P>

If the Minister of State wants to kick-start the whole process in Kerry, these concerns must be addressed because the sooner these matters are clarified, the better.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the exchange, but the modern turbine is not noisy. Measurements taken by wind engineers indicate that the background noise is often much louder than the actual turbine. One can carry on a conversation beneath a wind turbine because there is no noise, and I would like to allay people's fears in that regard. That is important because from this country's point of view we have enormous potential to drive this process forward. I have heard the argument about noise used over and over again. We have to kill that myth and the way to do that is by sending out the message from this Parliament that in terms of noise, people have nothing to fear from the modern wind turbine.</P>

      <P>We debated this issue at some length on Committee Stage and got a strong reaction against my proposal from the Minister. He appeared to think I was proposing to set up a new Dáil at the energy centre and a new Department of Finance as well, but that was not the intention.

      <P>Amendment No. 14 is concerned with preparing and publishing reports &ldquo;on the relative performance of the State in terms of achieving energy efficiency and sustainable energy measures by comparison with other EU member states,&rdquo; which is an important thing to do, although it is possible that the authority will do it anyway. As we need to know how we are doing internationally, it is important that the authority's functions are extended to provide us with this information. I said earlier that the authority's functions should involve international conferences, meetings and debates, as we need to take account of best practice around the world, especially within the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 16 proposes to insert the words &ldquo;the recommendation of fiscal or other measures to Government which would assist in the achievement of the Authority's objectives.&rdquo;  This is another means of ensuring the Sustainable Energy Authority acts as an adviser to the Government. As we said earlier, fiscal measures can often dictate the success of certain energy types, as happened when various Ministers for Finance sought to tweak the provision of energy types by changing taxation requirements in past budgets. The authority will be in an ideal position to advise the Government on these matters. If it is intended that this should be part of its remit in any event, perhaps the Minister of State will <Col N="1509" /> make this clear. I look forward to hearing what he has to say about the points I have outlined in relation to these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>These are important amendments. We need to learn from the experience of the Environmental Protection Agency, which was established about ten years ago and is clearly under-resourced. I have asked the agency the reason it has not publicly stated that it is inadequately resourced. It is quite clear that if we had an objective assessment, we would know immediately the fiscal measures and assistance required. Similarly, we know from the recent visit of Margot Wallström that the EPA has been underperforming in comparison to other countries. It has not lived up to the standards that we would like to see. It would be an advance to provide for a report showing how the Sustainable Energy Authority measures up to similar authorities in other countries. The Minister of State should take this on board if the authority is not to slip backwards, as happened to the EPA. This is far too important an issue to allow that to happen.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>Amendment No. 14 seeks to facilitate assessment of how we are performing in this area, relative to other countries. We should not be afraid of self-assessment, as if we are doing well in comparison to other countries, we will applaud and if we are not, we will set goals and objectives for improvement. We need to be constructively critical about where we are on the league table. We have been slow in entering the sustainable resources marketplace. While I applaud the Minister of State in relation to the wind licence agreements and the impressive figures for the AER VI proposal, we have not achieved all our goals. We are still trying to catch up with other countries in terms of wind energy and have made no progress in relation to wave energy, apart from a little research. A few pilot projects represent the only progress made on solar energy, which does not need blistering sunshine to be harnessed. We are in the slipstream of other countries.</P>
      <P>We should be honest with ourselves in relation to producing an ongoing assessment of where we are compared to our European colleagues and the rest of the world. I do not accept that it is not feasible and cannot accept the argument advanced on Committee Stage that this cannot be done for a relatively modest cost. Modern communications should be used to explore what is happening in other countries and produce a frank assessment. The amendment does not specify an annual report and assessments may be carried out every three or four years, but there needs to be some means of examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 24 states that the authority will lay its annual report before the Oireachtas and the authority will be amenable to a committee of the House. In that context, I cannot see the reason there cannot be a regular appraisal of where we are in terms of our achievements, performance <Col N="1510" /> and success or otherwise relative to other countries. I do not accept the Minister of State's argument, advanced on Committee Stage, that this amendment would lead to an excessive cost. Equally, I do not accept the idea that the requirement we are advancing will be met when the authority liaises with bodies in other countries. I urge the Minister of State to accept amendment No. 14 which has been proposed in the most constructive spirit possible. A regular appraisal of Ireland's performance in relation to sustainable energy would make sense.</P>

I am satisfied that this is already provided for in section 6(1)<i>(f)</i>, which gives the authority the role of advising Ministers on all matters related to its functions. There may be a concern that the Government might not act on the advice of the authority, but that is the right of Ministers as representatives of the people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Stagg has stated he intends to withdraw amendment No. 10, I will address amendment No. 14, which proposes that the authority be required to prepare and publish a report on the performance of the State, relative to other EU member states, on energy efficiency matters. We had a full and frank exchange on this matter on Committee Stage. I thought I satisfied Deputies that it is about the function of the authority under section 6(1) and its power under section 6(2)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) to prepare statistics and <Col N="1511" /> report on its objectives. However, I still have a difficulty with the proposal that the authority should make comparisons with other states. From where would it obtain the figures for such a comparison? How could it ensure it was comparing like with like even if it had the figures?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also the problem of the authority being required to put resources into an activity which we cannot be sure will provide a worthwhile return. On Committee Stage I stated that the EU and the International Energy Agency publish statistical reports on programmes and measures implemented by various states in the fight to reduce noxious emissions. My Department contributes to a number of EU fora which discuss energy statistics and relative indicators and I do not see much point in duplicating the work of these organisations. I am not inclined to accept the amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister of State listens to what he said he will agree he contradicted himself. He stated that the authority would face a problem obtaining the figures, but then stated the EU publishes them and that they are available. He also referred to the issue of duplication. The figures are available or they are not available. The Minister of State said they are available and he can access them on the Internet.</P>
      <P>We are proposing that the authority should take account of what is happening in other countries and compare those measures with what we are doing. The Minister of State knows that many other countries are well ahead of Ireland in this area. Solar energy is the norm in many parts of Austria and burning wood pellets is the order of the day in Scandinavia. We have to make comparisons with other countries to see how we are doing. There is no point in putting our heads in the sand and suggesting that everything is okay in Ireland. The figures are there and we are proposing that the authority should research them and put them in an Irish context to see how we are doing in comparison with other countries. This is all about targets and trying to achieve the best possible result. The authority should be doing this anyway, but we wish to insert this provision in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State said the Minister and the Government should have the right to determine fiscal measures. I agree and we are not suggesting the authority should dictate policy to a Minister or to a Government. That would not happen. We are proposing that the authority should be able to recommend fiscal or other measures to Government which would assist in the achievement of the authority's objectives. It is the Government's prerogative to reject such suggestions if it so wishes. What does it matter if someone is able to carry out research under freedom <Col N="1512" /> of information legislation and organise a debate? Any Government which rejects this kind of advice would be prepared to defend that decision. Why is the Minister of State anxious to hide such decisions? He has not put forward a strong argument and I urge him to accept these worthwhile amendments.</P>

      <P>In page 4, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>g</i>) to prepare and publish annual reports on the performance of Government departments, agencies and local authorities in achieving energy efficient measures and targets.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is bizarre that we are prevented from discussing the previous amendment. The Minister of State can vote us down if the Government does not agree with us, but it is bizarre that we cannot debate the matter in the Chamber. I have had to withdraw amendments because of this daft rule which we should examine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the situation is daft and it is stifling debate.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 13 proposes that the authority should prepare and publish annual reports. I do not know whether this amendment is in order as the authority would spend money on such reports which might constitute a charge on the Exchequer. This highlights how bizarre the rule is, but I better shut up or I will rule myself out of order.</P>
      <P>Departments, Government agencies and local authorities use a lot of energy and it is important that a mechanism is inserted in the Bill to encourage State agencies to achieve energy efficient measures and targets. They should set such targets and work to achieve them. In the past number of years we have lost sight of such an objective. So much money has been floating around that many State agencies have become lax in the area of energy conservation and efficiency. The amendment proposes that the authority should prepare and publish annual reports on the performance of Departments. There are 15 such Departments and each would be required to produce a report regarding the energy efficiency targets it has set and how it works to achieve them. The same would apply to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State suggested that there were many Departments and local authorities, but so what? We are talking about efficiency and saving money. It will be all the better if local authorities, Departments and State agencies can be encouraged to set these targets and to work towards them. This authority would then gather all these reports together and publish an annual report, as the Ombudsman or the Comptroller and Auditor General prepares reports on various Departments. We are discussing energy efficiency and sustainable energy, so it should be part of the remit of this authority to put pressure on Depart<Col N="1514" /> ments and State agencies in this area and to bring to their attention that it is important to switch off the light in the office when there is nobody there, to turn down the heating when it is not required and to ensure that motor vehicles are running at their optimum performance, that the ones in use are the most efficient and least wasteful possible and that they are not overused &ndash; that no unnecessary trips are taken.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal in this amendment. It is not just about preparing annual reports but about what the Bill is trying to do and the purpose of an authority such as this. I hope the authority will have some kind of impact on Government and State agencies because these are huge users of energy, probably the largest in the State. To give an example, when I first came into this House one of the first things I noticed &ndash; and it is still going on &ndash; was all the paper that was used. In this House alone, the amount of paper is colossal. Envelopes are often used only once. I put down parliamentary questions about the matter and now we have a recycling system for envelopes.</P>
    <P>However, we still need to cut back on waste. A mind set has developed in our society whereby we use something once and then throw it away. This uses up energy. If paper is being used unnecessarily or perfectly good envelopes used once and dumped, somebody is paying for it. Consider the energy required to produce the paper and the trees that are cut down. By requiring Departments, agencies and local authorities to take account of their actions and inaction by preparing reports, setting targets and working to achieve them, we would achieve a great deal. I hope the Minister will accept this amendment. Perhaps he has alterations in mind, although it is now very late, or perhaps he can tell us about some other ways in which we can achieve, in other parts of the Bill, what I am trying to articulate. I do not see anything of the kind. It must be explicitly stated that Departments, State agencies and other such bodies must cut down on waste and especially waste of energy. It is vital that this happens and that some auditing takes place to show how they have set and achieved their targets.</P>
    <P>We are not just talking about the direct use of energy but about avoiding waste through such means as insulation, conservation of heat, double or triple glazing, placing buildings to gain the maximum benefit from available sunlight, heating from the sun and so on. This is crucially important. I ask the Minister to consider this amendment seriously. I hope he already has. It is important and I look forward to his response.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>In this Bill, we intend to set up an authority to establish prescriptions for all and sundry in relation to efficiency, energy economy and so on. If we are serious about this and about people taking the role of the authority seriously, surely Departments, State agencies, semi-State agencies and local authorities should be leading the way. Deputy Stanton mentioned <Col N="1515" /> the huge volumes of paper which are not recycled and the lack of vision and clear policy on the issue until relatively recently. I am sure Members of the House would agree that when we were all housed in Leinster House before the new office block was built people complained regularly about the stifling atmosphere, the inability to control the heating system, the heating being on during the spring and summer and the lack of air conditioning. That is the experience in many Departments, some of whose buildings pre-date the foundation of the State. They are old and antiquated and their systems are not very efficient. Deputy Stanton already mentioned, for example, the lack of insulation.</P>
      <P>We should apply the same rigorous standards to ourselves, in other words the Oireachtas, Departments, semi-State agencies and local authorities. The matter should be considered from the point of view of the buildings, the operation of the buildings and the equipment. One of the contentious proposals shelved temporarily by the Government is the proposed Government policy on decentralisation. It has been deferred until after the election because of the tug-of-war that went on within the Cabinet between vying Ministers and within various constituencies in relation to whether the organisation should be situated in town A or town B. It could not go ahead because there were simply too many snouts in the trough, but it will go ahead and when it does new buildings will spring up all over the place. It is important that we as legislators set the highest possible standard.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Stanton said, we are not asking for the authority to do any policing or patrolling. Instead it should make sure that each of the agencies, Departments and local authorities presents a report which will then be collated with the others. We should set the highest standards for ourselves. We should not and cannot preach from the high tower of Oireachtas Éireann about what people should do if we are not prepared to lead the way by setting a good example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is a repeat of the amendment debated on Committee Stage. I thought I had satisfied Deputies on that occasion that the resources needed to achieve this statutory requirement would be substantial and there would be no guarantee of value for money. The problem is that if we place a statutory requirement on the authority to carry out audits each year, those audits must be done regardless of whether it is worthwhile. Unfortunately, the consequence of the amendment would be the authority's needing the resources to audit each Department, agency and local authority on an annual basis. This clearly involves resources above and beyond what is currently contemplated. However, it is part of the new authority's mandate to assist such bodies in meeting targets, establishing benchmarks and providing information. Publishing annual reports is an onerous <Col N="1516" /> task, in terms of auditing and resources, which may not produce the desired results. Colleagues may also be aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General carries out value-for-money audits from time to time on areas of expenditure including energy.</P>
      <P>The concerns of the Deputies about the proposed amendment are in part, as I mentioned on Committee Stage, addressed by the reporting requirements as laid out in the Government decision of 3 July 2001. In it, the Government decided that all Departments and State bodies should be required to include in their annual reports to Government and the Oireachtas measures to reduce energy usage in the buildings they occupy. Deputy Jim Higgins referred to efficiency measures for buildings in relation to conservation, use of sunlight and so on. We recently launched the Irish Energy Centre's public sector programme. It involves design study, support and model solution support for large public sector buildings. The authority is aiming and targeting, in the first instance, public buildings. This is innovative stuff and is very effective. It has substantial resources to do so.</P>
      <P>I have considered the amendment carefully and do not see a reason for accepting it. We should remember that we are talking about a comparatively small authority. There are some 40 people there at the moment and it will probably expand to a workforce of 50. It has hugely important work laid down for it and a large budget but it cannot be all-embracing either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State appears to be contradicting himself. He tells us that it is very difficult for this authority to produce all these reports, carry out audits and so forth, but he told us on 3 July last that the Government brought in a requirement that all Departments and State agencies and so on would make a report anyway. Who is to receive this report? Are we to have any kind of objective assessment of these reports?</P>
      <P>This amendment would allow the sustainable energy authority to act as an independent examiner of these reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>These reports will be made available so would it not be logical for the authority to take them on board to analyse, assess and report on them. There could be dramatic savings achieved across the State sector if this were to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy put this huge auditing onus on this authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>If what the Minister of State says is true, the reports are required anyway from all these agencies, authorities and Departments, but perhaps I misinterpreted what he said. These reports are to be made available and we are say<Col N="1517" /> ing they would be handed over to the authority for an overview as to what could be achieved. It would be very desirable if that were to happen as it would keep these authorities on their toes. Great savings are possible and the Minister of State has admitted that there is huge waste in the State sector where energy is concerned. We should do everything possible to cut back on that waste and achieve efficiencies and savings. It is bizarre that the Minister of State is resisting this kind of activity. Surely the whole purpose of a Bill like this is to achieve savings of energy and the conservation of energy. The Minster of State is resisting a very good amendment which would go some way towards achieving these savings. The point has been made that this is a small authority but I am sure the savings would be so considerable that extra staff could be taken on and it would become even more efficient.</P>
      <P>As my colleague, Deputy Higgins of Mayo said, the State sector and the Departments would lead the way in energy efficiency and conservation and this is what we want to achieve by this amendment. I am disappointed the Minister of State has not been a little more courageous in accepting this amendment or changing it slightly to fit into his own thinking. If he does not accept it an opportunity will be lost.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 38, after &ldquo;distribution&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, conservation, efficiency&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are happy with the powers of the authority as laid down, but one of the issues we wish to highlight is that in addition to the powers of compilation, extraction and dissemination of information and projections relating to energy production and use, including implications relating to the sourcing, transmission, transformation, distribution and emissions thereof, it should also be involved in the compilation, extraction and dissemination of information and projections relating to conservation and efficiency where energy is concerned. We wanted to highlight that to add those two words into that section.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has already indicated that the efficient use of energy and its conservation is important. It would add to the Bill if this amendment is accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this amendment at length on Committee Stage. The power under section 6(2)(<i>b</i>) relates to the new authority compiling benchmarks and statistics in regard to energy production and use. The definition within the brackets, where the subsection refers to applications relating to energy production, transformation, transmission, distribution and emissions, relates to the production of electricity. In a situation where the electricity market is liberalised and there are a num<Col N="1518" /> ber of electricity generators, the new authority will need to develop and provide statistics on emissions from all of these. This role would have been carried out by the ESB in the past. In the context of measuring the implications of such activity, conservation efficiency is not readily measurable and would be impracticable. The authority will have the power under section 6 (2) to measure, compile, extract and disseminate information in relation to any of its functions as set out in subsection (1) of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe one of the projects the Irish Energy Centre is involved in at the moment is boiler efficiency. There is a national competition and they give awards throughout the country in respect of boiler efficiency. It is a very laudable project. How can the Minister of State say one cannot measure efficiency when it is being done already.</P>
      <P>The section refers to energy production and use. Use includes efficiency and conservation. It is a vitally important part of it and it is already doing the work. I cannot understand why the Minister of State appears to be resisting the area of conservation and efficient use of energy every time it is brought up. His focus appears to be on the production of energy but I stress that the other side of the coin, which is conservation and efficiency, is equally important, if not more so. Sustainable energy is not just about production it is about use as well, and use implies conservation of energy. Insulation has also been mentioned.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Enterprise, Trade and Employment,</P>
    <P Just="Center">Deputy Treacy).</P>
    <P>Mr. Flanagan: I have to be very critical of the Government in relation to insurance costs. Its approach can best be described as hands-off. Business, commerce and consumers continue to take a massive hit, with insurance premium increases of up to 100% across a wide range, including employers liability, public liability and <Col N="1521" /> motor cover. The Government and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, in particular, are long on promises, but short on action. In contrast, on behalf of Fine Gael, I wish to introduce a ten point plan to address the situation.</P>
    <P>Allegations have been made of a cartel and closed shop in the insurance industry for many years. These allegations will remain in the public domain until fully rebutted. The Tánaiste should request the Competition Authority to carry out a study under section 11 of the Competition Act, 1991, of competition issues surrounding the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>We should have a vigorous schools campaign on health and safety in the workplace and road safety. The high cost of claims is directly related to the high number of road accidents and accidents in the workplace. Appropriate education and training are essential to reduce the number of accidents giving rise to motor, employers liability and public liability claims. In terms of legislation, the new Road Traffic Bill promised on many occasions still remains to be enacted. We need a penalty points system which will deter habitual and continuous offenders from dangerous driving and speeding.</P>
    <P>The Insurance Ombudsman should be independent and equipped with proper resources to investigate thoroughly complaints of overpricing and make sure that insurance companies are not deliberately pricing themselves out of particular sections of the market. A personal injuries compensation board should be established to assess damages without the need for court actions. I compliment Deputy Rabbitte for his efforts while Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in putting together the nuts and bolts of such a board. Since he left office in 1997 nothing has emerged from the other side, despite the fact that Deputy Rabbitte had done the bulk of the work.</P>
    <P>In relation to road traffic and law enforcement, road safety is of great importance. Greater emphasis must be placed on road safety investment. Garda resources must be channelled into road safety education and training. Improved arrangements for driver training, testing and licensing should be undertaken. Action should be taken to reduce the level of uninsured driving which is adding considerably to insurance costs.</P>
    <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs should be empowered to address high interest rates charged by insurance companies on motor and liability insurance premia for small business which are paid on an instalment basis. Court procedure should be reformed and streamlined. Where cases do not go before the personal injuries assessment board, but have to go to court for reasons of liability, there should be strict guidelines in order that there is greater consistency on the part of the Judiciary in relation to awards of damages. Action must be taken to minimise lengthy court delays.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1522" />The Motor Insurance Advisory Board should be maintained on a permanent basis, with sufficient resources. A code of rights should be developed for all motor insurance policyholders as a measure to improve consumer protection and information. This would be granted to each insured person with his or her insurance policy. I ask for action along the lines I have outlined and commend the Labour Party motion which has the support of Fine Gael.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Noel Treacy, established the Motor Insurance Advisory Board back in 1998. I hope this board will address issues in relation to young drivers. It should look at the relationship between the premiums charged to each category of driver and the corresponding claims experience. It is scandalous that so few companies are quoting for young drivers, with the result that there is great discrimination. Insurance companies frequently refer to the high risk factor among young drivers, but do not reward careful young drivers. Such drivers who have not made claims should get a reduction in premiums at the end of each year.</P>
      <P>Although there is provision for payment of insurance premiums by instalments, very few drivers are told about this and very little information is provided by the insurance companies. I know of insurance companies in Scotland where young drivers can pay £40 per month in instalments, or less than £500 per year. That is a very welcome development. Due to lack of competition in this country, we are not getting the benefits of that system, nor are we getting the benefit of being a member of the European Union.</P>
      <P>Various political parties have suggested the provision of education courses on the rules of the road and driver courtesy before a person would be allowed to take a driving test. This should be promoted and has long been the policy of my party. Many schools now have a very successful transition year in which such courses could be provided. Now that there is a written examination as part of the driving test, education courses would fit in very well in that context.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, referred to the decline in the number of accidents and fatalities, against a background of an increase in the number of vehicles on the road. He posed the question, as we all do, as to the reason premiums have increased. I am sure it is possible to reduce further the number of accidents and fatalities which should lead to a reduction in the cost of motor insurance. The question has never been answered adequately by the insurance companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to another issue in relation to young drivers. I have received reports of people getting reduced premiums by telephoning the right insurance company, only to be told later <Col N="1523" /> that if they wish to add on a young driver, they cannot do so. Those issues should be spelled out clearly by the insurance companies concerned. Despite the abolition of juries and the reduction in legal representation, there is still no reduction in insurance premiums. It is ironic that, although young people are assisted in relation to housing through the first-time buyer's grant, we do not seem to have done anything for first-time drivers. I hope there will be an investigation as to the reason people with a good driving record cannot get reduced premia.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the failure of Independent Insurance Company Limited in the United Kingdom. The fact that it got into difficulties has had a big influence on the situation in Ireland and been a big blow to Irish motorists. The events of 11 September in the United States have also had an effect.</P>
    <P>I hope the establishment of the personal injuries assessment board and the workplace safety group will help to avoid a continuing increase in insurance costs and that, in fact, there will be a reduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to preface my remarks by paying compliment to the committee, which I chair, on the work it has done with regard to motor insurance. A number of those who have contributed to the debate are members of the committee, which has done an extraordinary amount of research and work. It will, I hope, be in a position to complete its work in the coming weeks or months.</P>
      <P>I wish to follow up on a comment made by Deputy Michael Kitt by highlighting, as I have done in the past, my admiration for young drivers for the responsible manner in which they go about their business and the mature way they appoint one of their number as a designated driver when they go out for the evening. There are many in the House who may in the past have gone out for the evening and driven their car home. Young people do not do this, they are very responsible individuals. I would like additional supports to be put in place for them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kitt also referred to transition year students. There is an eminent female with vast experience of driving who has made a number of proposals, one of which involves practical measures to be put in place for young people. When one turns 17 years of age one is entitled for apply for a provisional licence and take one's theory test. It would be extremely beneficial if we provided practical driving education courses for transition year students. I have initiated discussions with the insurance industry and understand funds will be made available to put such a scheme in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The high level of liability insurance costs, including motor insurance costs, has been an issue of deep concern to me for many years. It is generally recognised that these costs are higher in Ireland than in other EU countries. In recent <Col N="1524" /> years a good deal of pressure has been exerted for some radical action to be taken to address this serious matter. Successive Governments have had opportunities to take such action, but have failed to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, has given considerable attention to the initiation of policies and programmes aimed at reducing the burden of insurance costs on the economy in general and small businesses and consumers in particular. In devising effective policies and programmes to reduce the insurance cost burden it is necessary to identify the key factors contributing to the high cost of liability and motor insurance in Ireland. Research undertaken on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment indicates that the main cost factors are: a high level of claims among members of the public; high delivery costs, including legal costs, of personal injury claims; high levels of medical inflation; and high awards of general damages in smaller personal injury claims. All these costs have a bearing on the insurance premium rates ultimately charged in the marketplace. While good risks will always attract cheaper quotations, prudent insurers must set their premium levels to match compensation pay-out and other costs.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have sought to contain the rising cost of insurance premiums, while recognising that, for prudential reasons, insurers must be free to set their premium rates based on their claims experience in order to ensure the projected level of future claim costs can be met. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment's examination of these factors contributing to the relatively high level of insurance costs in Ireland has been focusing on a number of key cost elements, including the level of personal injury compensation and the costs associated with settling compensation claims. The current system of compensation for personal injury in Ireland is grounded in the law of tort which entitles the individual to seek adequate monetary compensation for losses suffered as a result of damage to person or property, caused by the acts of another, and for pain and suffering.</P>
    <P>A great deal of progress has been made following the 1996 Deloitte and Touche report and that of the Fair Trade Commission. However, the research commissioned by the special working group indicates that whereas 52% of personal injury cases in Ireland are settled in the Law Library, the same percentage of cases in England are settled through correspondence between the claims handler and the plaintiff's solicitor. It also shows that in Ireland junior counsel is appointed in 57% of cases, while senior counsel is appointed in 18% of cases. By comparison, in England junior counsel is appointed in 3% of cases and senior counsel is rarely, if ever, appointed. This has a huge bearing on legal costs and compensation pay-outs.</P>

      <P>With the advent of the European Union and the breakdown of the market within it, people in Ireland had great expectations that insurance premiums &ndash; be they motor, property, PL or EL &ndash; would be reduced and that the continued increase in the cost of premiums would be halted. However, the development of the market within the European Union has led to amalgamations and takeovers and there has been little reduction in the level of premiums. It appears there is a cartel in operation in the marketplace, in which a smaller number of players are now operating. As a result, it seems the level of premiums can generally be controlled.</P>
      <P>I accept that Ireland is not a &ldquo;nanny&rdquo; state. Fine Gael and other Members made the argument that the Government should intervene in this area. However, that cannot be done. Everyone in the House and those outside who have been obliged to take out insurance of one kind or another realise that the commercial world is a cold place in which to operate. Those who deal in stocks, shares and bonds take no prisoners.</P>
      <P>Since 1970 various political parties have highlighted the fact that young drivers are being penalised and obliged to pay excessive premiums. Every year there has been an expectation that premiums would be reduced on foot of Government intervention, but nothing of the sort has happened. In fact, the opposite has been the case. A 21 year old blocklayer from my constituency, a responsible young man, bought a car for £4,000 in order that he could drive to work and was obliged to pay £3,200 in insurance.</P>
      <P>If we are to make an impact in this area, the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business should be allowed to take up this issue and develop a model &ndash; perhaps based on one used in another European country &ndash; that would suit the needs of people in Ireland and have real effect in the marketplace in terms of reducing premiums. This year, for example, Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance, which provides insurance for local authorities, has increased its premiums by up to 50%. The result is that the number of projects being undertaken by local authorities must be reduced. These were introduced after the Estimates were adopted and, as a result, the ones we hoped would be carried out at county level will now be affected. It is, therefore, in the interests of everyone in the House &ndash; regardless of their politics &ndash; to sit down together and arrive at a position where we can begin to have an understanding with the insurance companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our interaction with insurance companies at committee level was anything but productive. We presented or found one set of figures, while the industry's representatives came forward with a different set and a different explanation. It is not good enough that they should treat a committee of the House in the way they did, particularly in the light of its efforts to try to bring about some form of understanding of what is happening in the marketplace in order that, in turn, we can perhaps <Col N="1526" /> bring about some changes that would impact on the huge insurance premiums people are obliged to pay.</P>
    <P>I could make an argument in respect of the world of commerce and the way in which insurance costs are affecting business. The collapse of Independent Insurance in England affected Irish businesses. The Government, the Opposition and everyone involved in politics are going to be obliged to engage in serious consideration of this matter, particularly if we are to make an impact in terms of reducing the cost of premiums. The only way to ensure they are reduced and that this national scandal is brought to a halt is to work, in a deliberate manner, with those involved in the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of motor and public liability insurance this year is a matter of major concern to everyone. It obviously affects the ability of some small businesses to pay premiums and at the same time remain viable.</P>
      <P>We all share concerns at the premiums being charged, particularly to young people. This year, in particular, saw dramatic increases of 18% in the motor car insurance industry. In public liability insurance it has been a whopping 40%. There are businesses which are finding it extremely difficult to actually get any cover. This week I had somebody who has a roofing business in touch with me. He told me that getting cover was very difficult and that in the end the premium he was charged was more than 50% up.</P>
      <P>The insurance business has always been cyclical to the extent that on some occasions companies were able to make a profit. Currently, however, the market for insurance is very depressed. The events of 11 September have had a dramatic effect on the overall issue of insurance and claims are of enormous proportions. We are talking about claims amounting to $115 billion. Many of the insurance companies which will have to pay out have an international standing. There will, therefore, be no great reprieve in terms of premiums for the immediate future.</P>
      <P>One must ask what the Government has done, whether it has been active or inactive. Are the criticisms being levelled at the Government solid or political? In fairness to the Government, it has been very much to the forefront. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, have tackled head on the issue of the carnage on our roads. They have introduced the points system and are looking seriously at how penalties can be introduced that are commensurate with and take into account the devastating impact it is having.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time has there been a reduction in the number killed on the roads from 478 in 1990 to something like 415 in the year 2000. The carnage is of massive proportions, but few people take into account that the number of registered vehicles on the roads has grown from over one million in 1990 to 1.68 million in the year 2000. <Col N="1527" /> Obviously, the levels are still far too high. However, there is clear evidence that these have been reduced and it is hoped that the Road Traffic Bill and the reforms, including improved enforcement, that are part and parcel of it will have a major impact.</P>
    <P>We are all concerned about the cost of claims. The insurance companies have adverted to this issue time and again. I am delighted that Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, has established an advisory board to examine this issue. I understand it must report within one month. On top of this the PIAB was established and its report is due. Instead of sitting back the Government has been very proactive. This motion is political in the extreme in that were its movers to wait for one further month at least two major reports would be available to give us a foretaste of how we might set models for insurance in the future, whether for motor vehicles or public liability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to make a short contribution to this most important debate. There are few public representatives who are not regularly contacted by constituents who are affected by the high premiums being charged for motor, public liability and employers liability insurance. The cost of fire cover has also become a problem, particularly in County Louth.</P>
      <P>I particularly wanted to hear the contribution of Deputy Pat Rabbitte on this subject. As somebody who had been a Minister of State with responsibility for the insurance industry, I felt he would have reasonable insight into the problems within the industry. While there is no doubt his analysis of the overall position was very good &ndash; this is not intended as a personal or political criticism &ndash; I hoped he would sum up his contribution by telling the House, on the basis of his experience, what measures needed to be taken to pull down the high cost of premiums and ensure businesses which are being saddled with excessive public and employers liability insurance costs can survive. There is no doubt that many businesses are under serious threat because of excessive premiums. I was somewhat disappointed that he did not deal with this aspect of the problem because I am sure he would have some very worthwhile suggestions to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My perspective is political because County Louth is one of the counties where people experience loading on most premiums. There are two national primary routes running through the county and, unfortunately, the accident and mortality rate is very high. We also have many young drivers on the road. All this is reflected in very high motor insurance premiums. When a premium of £5,000 or £6,000 is being demanded from a young driver and he or she needs a vehicle to get to work, quite clearly the whole question of whether it is worth his or her while travelling to work is debatable. The Department has spent many hours and days working on this. I hope the <Col N="1528" /> formula needed to tackle the problem will be found. We need it urgently in view of the serious and detrimental effects on the economy of high motor, public liability and employers liability insurance premiums. There are serious implications in the short and long-term and unless something is done about it, there will be serious job losses here and there.</P>
    <P>Some time ago in a debate on local radio I suggested fitting speed control units to cars, which insurance companies could take special account of and reflect in the level of premium demanded from young drivers. I was quite surprised that a Garda spokesman rejected it out of hand as a possible solution to the problem. There is no doubt that speed and drink driving are major contributory factors to the high accident rate which, in turn, affects the high cost of compensation. I am sorry I have such a limited amount of time to deal with a subject that requires at least an hour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have even this brief opportunity to speak on this most important issue. I should declare my interest, given that I am one of the very many people in the country affected by the cost of insurance, particularly motor insurance. There are few households that are not very aware of the increasing premiums inflicted on us every time we receive our policy renewal forms. No matter how much older I get, and no matter how much older my car gets, it never seems to have a positive effect on the price of my insurance cover. When I was 18 or 19, I thought it would be cheaper when I was 21. When I got to 21 that target had increased to 25 and when I reached the age of 25, it had gone up to 30. When I reach the age of 35, I hope it will be cheaper.</P>
      <P>When I lived and worked in England and in Northern Ireland, despite being younger, my premium was never as high as when I was insured here. Because my current insurance runs until September, I have considerable time to anticipate just how the 11 September attacks will hit me in the pocket as the international re-insurance market's capacity to cover its losses since then has been impaired. I know of other young drivers facing huge bills. It is important to realise that a car is not a luxury item in rural areas; it is a basic necessity for access to work, education and for life in general. Whatever about the big picture and the impact of 11 September, an event over which we have no control, I would be very disillusioned if I thought that no effort was being made to address the matter by the Government.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I welcome the measures contained in Government policy, particularly in respect of encouraging as much competition as possible in the Irish market, including from other EU insurers. The barriers that exist must be looked at and addressed. Without competition, we can only have a monopoly and that monopoly will insist on maintaining the <i>status quo</i> in favour of the insurance company and not the insured consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1529" />I welcome the establishment of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, and the implementation group that is charged with progressing the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, because it is accepted that the high cost of settling claims is a major factor in the cost of insurance. As the Minister outlined last night, it is amazing that the cost of delivery of personal injury compensation now runs at up to 40% of the cost of the claim itself. Addressing this issue must have huge implications for the consumer. I already had parliamentary questions down for written answer this week on this topic and I look forward to the imminent report of the implementation group and the advisory board. I recognise that in debates such as this it is easy to try to pre-empt what such reports will say. Surely, if a body has been given a job to do, we must await its expert opinion. While I have ideas that I would like considered in respect of, for example, ringfencing VRT moneys to assist young drivers, particularly for their first years' insurance, or some other such initiative, this is to make suggestions in a vacuum until such time as the report and its recommendations are available for us to read and react to.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, a reduction in accidents would give less credence to the arguments that are presented by the industry, which provides statistics that are regularly challenged. The Government, through the national road safety strategy, is making an impact resulting in a decline in the number of accidents and fatalities. This is in the context of a very high number of vehicles on the road.</P>
    <P>The media blitz of very stark advertisements has had a positive impact. There is a role also for educational media advertisements on the subject of showing courtesy on the roads, be it in the context of slow-moving vehicles pulling in to the slow lane where one is provided, the proper use of roundabouts etc. A very useful example that I saw in Spain was the provision of access for primary school children to a small playground where they could go about with their scooters and bicycles to learn the rules of the road. These playgrounds are very useful, with traffic lights, roundabouts, lanes and various road signs which are fun resources that could be easily supplied in most towns.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that a person who has had their car stolen is under a three to five-year penalty from the insurance industry for something they had no hand, act or part in, and it is wrong that people cannot get a quote from most companies without a three-year no claims bonus. More competition may help. The penalty points system may produce more careful drivers but there are huge issues for many, particularly young, people, the vast majority of whom have not had an accident but who cannot get any recognition for the safe manner in which they drive.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his co-operation with the group that has been set up. Cars are used in my constituency as a necessity not as a luxury. It makes more sense to have insured drivers than to <Col N="1530" /> have people driving without insurance and risking the lives of all who are legally on the road. I wish the Government success in implementing the recommendations of the pending report and I want to see them enacted as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Ryan, Upton, Gilmore and Broughan, by agreement. My colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, made an eloquent and trenchant speech to the House yesterday on the Labour Party motion on insurance costs. I congratulate him for his most decisive contribution on this issue. It is a sorry situation when the Tánaiste seems to be the last person in Ireland to appreciate the problems which ordinary people up and down the country have in relation to the increasingly prohibitive costs of insurance. I cannot believe that the Minster for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is taking a hands-off approach to an important economic activity which has a vital bearing on the daily lives of people and many small businesses in pursuit of a right-wing economic agenda. The Minister can run at the election, when it eventually comes in a few months time, but she cannot hide from the many people who have been adversely affected by the circumstances prevailing in getting insurance on cars, public liability insurance or other forms of business and personal insurance.</P>
      <P>While the Tánaiste is travelling around the country in State cars, she may lose sight of the simple facts that confront the ordinary motorist when insurance premiums fall due for renewal. My insurance recently went up from &euro;500 to &euro;700. Deputy Keaveney mentioned the age factor and that when one gets older, car insurance premiums come down. I have to disappoint her and say that such is not the case. The premium will increase as one's age increases. In my case, the increase was 40% despite having a full no claims bonus and despite my insurance broker trying everything to get a better deal.</P>
      <P>My predicament is similar to that of many other people this year. All premiums have gone up but at least I was able to get cover for my car. However, the position of people under 25 years of age, most of whom find it impossible to get affordable cover, is outrageous and totally unacceptable. Deputy Rabbitte has exposed the myths and fallacies surrounding the excessive levels of car insurance premiums that younger motorists have to pay. Responsibility for this rests squarely with the Government which has let this situation evolve without any intervention or control, and has been only effective in concocting meaningless explanations in official speak in an attempt to justify its procrastination and inaction on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in public life sometimes wonder why young people do not take more of an interest in politics. I urge the younger generation to take an interest in this issue and to analyse a situation where they find it impossible to get car insurance cover. In many cases, this coverage is needed by younger <Col N="1531" /> people to get to work, particularly in rural constituencies such as my own. I will be surprised if, after an objective analysis, young people do not come to the only logical conclusion &ndash; that politicians, and especially the Government, have proved utterly ineffective in dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>I meet people every week who are involved in local, mainly voluntary, activities in rural areas and who find it impossible to get public liability insurance cover on halls, community centres and other places of public assembly. This has major implications for the fabric of life in rural areas. In my own area, a local group had a community centre and if they were to use it for the purpose for which it was built &ndash; to accommodate a drama group &ndash; they would have to pay an extra premium. It is possible to have bingo sessions a couple of nights per week by levying a charge on the players or if the local community provides a revenue source to subsidise other activities such as drama. However, there are only so many bingo nights that can be supported by any locality. In practice, the prohibitive level of insurance cover for local centres means that the only activities that can take place in them are those that are financially self-sufficient. Functions for less well-off groups such as OAPs can be forgotten. It is a sorry day when the voluntary sector can only assist in activities that are financially viable and self-sufficient. This cuts across long-established traditions of helping the less well-off sections of our communities to participate fully in the life of their areas.</P>
    <P>A few months before the end of this Dáil there are calls for the Government to take constructive steps to address the insurance difficulties which many people have had during the lifetime of this coalition. The Government is unwilling or unable to take any action beyond pulling electoral strokes directed at marginal constituencies.</P>
    <P>Despite those considerations, I urge the House to support the Labour Party's motion calling on the Government to take the basic steps necessary to reform the framework under which the insurance industry operates and to provide some comfort and, more importantly, some justice to the long-suffering public who have had to put up with Government inertia and inaction on this issue over the past five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this important motion. I commend Deputy Rabbitte for bringing it before the House &ndash; it is not before time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major issue for young people in recent years has been their inability to obtain reasonably priced motor insurance cover. Today I spoke to a young man who depends on his car to get to work. He was quoted &euro;4,500 for comprehensive cover. He is fortunate that he has a good job and is able to afford this cost &ndash; but only at the expense of his social life. Another poor person told me that it cost him more than &euro;1,000 per annum to secure third party cover as a named <Col N="1532" /> driver of his mother's car. A young girl informed me recently that the cost of her insurance cover was infinitely greater than the value of her car. I could give example after example but it is sufficient to say that this is a scandalous situation that has been allowed to escalate over the past four and a half years.</P>
    <P>This Government has failed or has been unwilling to take on the vested interests in the insurance business. While I accept that young, male drivers have a disproportionately bad record in terms of safety, there are hundreds of thousands of responsible young drivers who face discrimination on a daily basis. The loading practice on those under 25 must be challenged and that is a task for this House but the Government has failed to do it. In this motion the Labour Party calls on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to allow the Equality Authority to conduct a statutory inquiry into allegations of discrimination on the grounds of age and gender in the motor insurance industry.</P>
    <P>Members on all sides of the House wonder why many young people do not vote. One of the main reasons is that they do not see this Parliament as relevant to their needs and think it does not listen to them. This issue should have been dealt with. It was a prime example of an opportunity to address an issue that affects young people but it appears the Government and the Taoiseach, who prides himself on being in touch with young people, have no interest in dealing with the spiralling costs of insurance for young motorists. The Government has not delivered after nearly five years in office and that is a scandal.</P>
    <P>Young people are being victimised and discriminated against by the incompetence of this Government and the unwillingness of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to take on the vested interests in the insurance industry. She has failed to open it up to competition so young motorists might have more choice. There is a more limited choice of quotations available for young drivers and those over retirement age than for those over 25 and under 70 according to a report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to state that young policy holders, who pay the highest rates, produce larger surpluses over claim costs than most of those aged 25 years and over. How does the Minister of State take on board the critical views in this report? What is he prepared to do to meet the legitimate needs of young people?</P>
    <P>Many of those young people I represent need to get to work and that is why they own a car. This Government has failed to provide public transport or to challenge the costs of insurance cover for young drivers. Young people will answer them come the election, which I hope will be sooner rather than later.</P>

      <P>I support the motion tabled by Deputy Rabbitte yesterday to bring to the attention of this House the serious problem that exists <Col N="1533" /> with regard to insurance and its implications for business, employment and young drivers.</P>
      <P>I have been contacted by many businesses in my constituency pointing out the serious problems they face. I have a letter from a retail business that reads, &ldquo;I have built up my business over the last 30 years and I employ 25 people. This situation cannot be allowed to continue and proper investigation into these exorbitant premiums will have to be carried out. I ask you as my local representative to make urgent representations to remedy the situation before it is too late and we are forced out of business.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have another letter from a firm of accountants representing a number of businesses which details the serious concerns of its clients about their ability to continue to trade. One client company has decided to cease trading. The firm says the potential loss of employment and the risk to indigenous business is a worry. A letter from another business in my constituency states that it is clear the current situation is not sustainable and that we must develop a system of employers' and public liability insurance which is efficient, effective and, above all, equitable.</P>
      <P>I talked today to the owner of a car rental business who pointed out that his premiums had increased by 60% this year alone. The insurance premium now amounts to half the cost of renting a car. He told me that two substantial car rental businesses have gone out of business in the last 18 months as a result of car insurance premium hikes, representing 10% of the car rental fleet in the State. If this situation is not addressed, the entire car rental business is at serious risk and that will have consequences for the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>I support my colleagues in what they have said about premiums for young drivers. It is scandalous that young drivers, whose taxes are contributing to the operation of the State, are being fleeced by insurance companies for premiums calculated on an unfair basis. I challenge the Minister of State to say why he has refused to provide the necessary funds for the Equality Authority to enable it undertake an investigation into the complaint brought to its attention by my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, who asked that the situation regarding insurance for young drivers be investigated also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. The problem of rising insurance costs is one which I and I am sure most Members must deal with on a daily basis. Several aspects of the Government's failure to deal with spiralling insurance costs have already been addressed, especially by Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to address the issue of the soaring cost of insurance cover for schools around the country. Yesterday on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; George O'Callaghan of the Joint Managerial Board said the cost of insurance for schools has increased by up to 25% in the past 12 months. This is an appalling financial burden to be endured by already hard <Col N="1534" /> pressed schools. In recent weeks my party leader, Deputy Quinn, and I have visited several schools in disadvantaged parts of my constituency. We saw at first hand the immense financial pressure they are already under without having to endure 25% increases in insurance costs.</P>
    <P>Does the Government have any proposals to deal with this escalating crisis? Given its casual and stand-off attitude over the past five years, I will not hold my breath. If the Government, even in its dying days, does not take action to lessen the insurance bills for schools, there will be a return to the situation where parents and pupils must raise funds. Is it happy to allow a drift towards this? The problem is that the most disadvantaged will again suffer the most.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have referred to the effect on young people of the rising cost of insurance for motor vehicles. For too long Governments have used insurance costs as a means by which to keep young drivers off our roads. We are all agreed that the number of accidents and road fatalities are highest among the 17 to 25 year age group. Sadly, my constituency has experienced this tragic phenomenon all too often in recent times. However, there are numerous other means by which young people who are speeding or found to be drinking and driving can be discouraged from doing so. To penalise them financially through high insurance costs can be a deterrent, but to penalise all young people because of the misdemeanours of a few of their peers is neither acceptable nor fair.</P>
    <P>The cost of insuring a car for a young person is now almost always greater than the value of the car. Many of my constituents work outside the public transport catchment area of Dublin and have no choice but to use a car to get to work. These responsible young people are penalised because they need a car to earn a living in an area not served by public transport.</P>
    <P>Like my colleagues, I have recently received a number of letters from small businesses which have outlined the sharp increases in the cost of insurance, especially in 2001. The outcome is the probability that a number of them will be put out of business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like every Deputy, I have in recent months received dozens of e-mails and telephone calls from companies and constituents about the crazy cost of insurance in this country and the wide suspicion that we have suffered an even bigger rip-off since 11 September. The last e-mail I received today, at approximately 5.30 p.m., states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Good afternoon. I think it is a complete disgrace the price of insurance for young drivers. Are the Government going to do anything about this? I have been looking for a quote for my 20 year old brother and the cheapest he can get is &euro;4,400. This is twice the value of his car. How can insurance companies justify this? I tried to get insurance from X, Y and Z company and the difference between male and <Col N="1535" /> female with the same details is unbelievable, almost &euro;2,500 extra for a male.</P>
    <P>What I want to know is this. Is the Government going to do anything about it? It has got to the stage that your no claims bonus does not count anymore because each year insurance costs go up at least 20%.</P>
    <P>That is typical of the kind of e-mail we have all received. It is a situation that causes great distress. The Government will be held to account for this in the forthcoming general election.</P>
    <P>Like many Deputies, I am a director of perhaps five or six community development and employment support bodies throughout the north-side communities. I was shocked at board meetings last year, especially since last September, when we had to deal with increases of between 60% and 80% in insurance premia for employers and public liability cover. There was not much shopping around because in the limited Irish market and with the experience of the collapse of the Independent Insurance Company these were the best figures we could get.</P>
    <P>One of the worst aspects of this situation is that a significant part of the vital funding these groups would have put together in what are often deprived communities for small enterprises, child care, personal development and to support the unemployed and their families has had to be diverted to ensure people can walk safely through buildings. In some instances insurance premiums amount to £20,000. It is a very significant problem. As it happens, local government, the State and the taxpayer must often pick up the tab for these increases because funding is often taken from the limited moneys provided by groups such as FÁS, the voluntary programmes run under the aegis of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and various other bodies or local authorities.</P>
    <P>While we all recognise the significance of the impact of the events of the 11 September and the collapse of the Independent Insurance Company, the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and the Minister must take a heavy responsibility for what has happened to the cost of insurance in this country. The Minister of State is a pleasant and avuncular colleague, but for five years he sat on the progress made by Deputy Rabbitte on personal injuries and other areas just before the rainbow coalition Government left office. Five years later he has made entertaining speeches, such as one I heard two years ago, but has taken no action. In a few months the next Government will have to pick up the pieces.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Ó Caoláin. The Government must legislate to solve the motor insurance situation, especially the rip-off on young drivers who are subject to a huge injustice. The current cost of their motor insurance is unjustified, intolerable and unsustainable. The vested interests main<Col N="1536" /> taining the huge premiums involved must be tackled by the Government.</P>
      <P>At a recent meeting of young drivers in my constituency a young driver told me his first motor insurance policy cost £4,017 and that after a year of safe driving it increased to £4,070. In the following year, after passing his driving test and with two full years no claims bonus, it was still at £3,500. Another driver told me that with a full licence after two years he got what he regarded as an exceptionally good quote of £1,300, but ten days later, when he went to accept it, it had increased to £2,600. Many young drivers in my constituency need transport to take up employment or attend further education. These huge insurance premiums act as a disincentive to both.</P>

      <P>I support the motion and urge the Government to drop its amendment and implement the measures proposed. Drivers, especially young people, are being fleeced by the insurance industry. Last year the National Youth Council of Ireland published a report aptly entitled, The Plunder Years, which showed the blatant profiteering that discriminates against them. For example, the council found that a 24 year old male driver with a full licence for two years and a no claims bonus was quoted £2,213 to insure a 1998 Fiat Punto. I have also received the same representation quoted by Deputy Broughan.</P>
      <P>Many young people are now forced to pay insurance premiums by instalment, thus incurring a further 18.6% interest. In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan public transport is minimal and there is almost total dependence on the car. Young people are doubly disadvantaged through lack of public transport and punitive car insurance.</P>
      <P>The reality is that young people are being forced off the roads. Only 6% of them drive compared to 14% in the European Union as a whole. This is a form of economic and social discrimination as well as acting as a break on the economy. The lack of access to a vehicle can exclude candidates from jobs where driving is required and can prevent people from taking jobs at locations not served by public transport.</P>
      <P>The Government should intervene directly now. It is time it took on the ruthless profiteering of the insurance companies and act on behalf of young drivers.</P>

      <P>I am conscious from exchanges I have witnessed here between my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and Deputy Rabbitte of how difficult it is to tackle this complex issue of insurance costs. I acknowledge that both Ministers have put a great deal of work into this area. As one who shares a Department with my colleague I appreciate this is not an easy nut to crack.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a tough one as the Deputy's colleague, sitting beside him, will acknowledge. Having said that, the Deputy has a right to raise these issues which need to be debated. I hope this debate will help to advance the cause of finding solutions.</P>
      <P>There are a number of reasons, international and domestic, for the sharp increase in insurance premiums. That is the situation we forecast. Others have stated it is a cyclical business. We are entering a phase where prices are increasing. Re-insurers, in particular, have borne the brunt of the costs of the events in New York in September last and have had to increase rates to compensate. Certain types of cover, especially terrorist cover, are no longer available because of the increased risk and the lack of capacity in the international insurance market. Re-insurers have accordingly reconsidered the cover they are prepared to underwrite and have introduced restrictions.</P>
      <P>The net effect for those purchasing insurance is that the cost of insurance cover has increased dramatically and availability of cover has contracted. In addition to the effect of the insurance cycle and the events in the US, there are domestic factors to be taken into account. Two High Court judgments on how to calculate future losses and on re-imbursement of hospital costs by insurers have the potential to increase awards in personal injury cases. Insurers will have to review reserves with a view to strengthening them in outstanding cases. In addition, in relation to property insurance a succession of three bad winters has led to increased claims experience. There is little the Government can do to influence these factors. We are well aware of the difficulties that increased insurance costs create for businesses and individuals. Insurers have agreed to discuss with their clients ways of minimising risk or moderating cover so that increases can be kept to the minimum necessary. It is worth remembering that insurance costs are high in Ireland because compared with continental EU member states we pay more compensation through the insurance system than through the health or social welfare systems. This is one of the reasons we have lower employment costs in Ireland than in most EU countries.</P>
      <P>The factor in insurance costs that the Government is addressing is the reduction in the delivery cost of compensation which can account for as much as 40% of the cost of settling a claim. The implementation group which is considering the establishment of the personal injuries assessment board is proceeding with its work on the various complex aspects of this task and the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, expects to receive the final report in the next month or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, re-appointed by the Minister, should assist us in understanding the relationship between the cost of claims for certain categories of policyho<Col N="1538" /> lders, especially young drivers, and the premiums they are charged. The transparency afforded by the work of the board will in itself be useful perhaps in encouraging new players on to the market.</P>
    <P>On the rates charged to young drivers, the Motor Insurance Advisory Board will establish the facts of the relationship between claims costs for this segment of drivers and the premium rates charged. That in itself will influence pricing on the market. I welcome the special initiative designed by some companies to offer insurance to young people prepared to accept certain constraints or conditions at favourable rates. While I acknowledge that these schemes are fairly restricted at present, if young people are a better risk than we thought up to now, such schemes may become more common throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We have made good progress in reducing the incidence of accidents both on the roads and in the work place and a number of Deputies have acknowledged this. In the area of labour affairs, for which I have responsibility, I welcome the fact that, while one accident is one too many, according to an IBEC survey published in March there has been a reduction in the number of accidents in the workplace. They have fallen by as much as 21% from 1999 to 2001. That is as a result of the strengthening of the Health and Safety Authority which has been given more resources and more personnel. We have adopted many initiatives with regard to a partnership approach to make the workplace safer. In the coming months and years there will be a focus on the small and medium sized businesses. Therefore, there have been some useful developments in those areas.</P>
    <P>The Personal Injuries Assessment Board will make a substantial contribution to reducing the cost of claims by reducing the need for legal involvement in settling personal injury claims. Since the cost of legal involvement may well account for &euro;800 million in the total cost of claims settlement at present, the savings that may be achieved by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board are considerable.</P>
    <P>I will address some of the issues raised during the course of the debate. Because the Motor Insurance Advisory Board has paid particular attention to the problems of young drivers &ndash;  an issue that has been rightly referred to by many Deputies &ndash; the board's report should make clear whether the premiums being charged to young people are justified by their claims experience. The Government will consider what action is appropriate in the light of those findings. However, I caution against the idea of subsidising motor insurance for young people. That suggestion has been put forward by Fine Gael in particular. Experience shows that where subsidies are paid, prices adjust to take account of the subsidy. Moreover, international research indicates that where the cost of insurance is uncoupled from the cost of claims, the incidence of accidents increases. Research in the US and Canada, where no fault systems have been put in place, indicate <Col N="1539" /> a rising rate of accidents related to the date of introduction of the &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; system.</P>
    <P>On the issue of discrimination or alleged discrimination a remedy is available. Young people who believe they are being discriminated against may bring a case to the Equality Authority. While individual complaints to that authority are dealt with in privacy, I understand from newspaper reports that some complaints have been brought already.</P>
    <P>The Government believes the investigation conducted by the Motor Insurance Advisory Board will be sufficient to elucidate the issues raised in this House concerning motor insurance. When that report has been published and considered further studies may be unnecessary.</P>
    <P>The Government is addressing the issue of the cost of insurance in a substantive way that addresses those underlying causes of high insurance costs that can be dealt with. The Motor Insurance Advisory Board will provide us with the underlying facts relating to motor insurance. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board will reduce a significant cost element in the price of insurance, namely the delivery costs. The Government welcomes the implicit support for the Personal Injuries Assessment Board from the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, who will close the debate on behalf of the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>I have listened with a mixture of sadness and bemusement at the measured and elegant contribution read into the record by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt. I do not honestly believe he believes a word of it. After five years I can imagine what he would have said had he stood on this side of the House. After five years I can hear the ranting of his colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, had he been here for the past five years and witnessed the disintegration of the insurance market.</P>
      <P>I am amazed but not surprised that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment &ndash; listen to those three words, Enterprise, Trade and Employment &ndash; the leader of the Progressive Democrats Party, that party that believes in the god of the market, has refused to come in here and attempt to explain why she has presided over market failure that has become intense over the past five years. I do not recall employers coming to us with the scale of complaint or with the frequency that is reported to us by individual Deputies. That is on the record of the House. I recall employers in the early 1990s complaining about the cost of public liability insurance and I recall efforts being made to try to address those problems. Much progress was made in the Department. That progress was continued by Deputy Rabbitte when he was a Minister of State, as referred to by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt. Why has not greater progress been made? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1540" />The amendment tabled by the Government is incredible. Why has there not been more progress in relation to the various working bodies?  What has the Tánaiste been doing to try to get these reports and the deliberations of the various working parties brought to a conclusion? Can one assume that the incoming president of the Progressive Democrats Party, whose return is akin to that of the jedi in &ldquo;Star Wars,&rdquo; is so bemused by the sanctity of the Law Library, the integrity of the legal profession and the absolute inviolability of legal costs that we will get no further than a reference to them in the amendment and that no attempt will be made to do anything about them? </P>
    <P>This litany of suggestions and proposals without any executive action from the Government is mind-boggling. Listening to the Minister of State one would think he was on this side of the House or, worse still, some kind of spectator commenting on the situation and regretting how bad it was. He should, instead, make concrete proposals which would deal with some of the issues before us.</P>

      <P>Life is too short for that. The extraordinary complacency of the Minister of State is unbelievable given the Government's defeats in two by-elections in Tipperary South, first by Deputy Healy and later Deputy Tom Hayes on behalf of the Fine Gael Party. I can recall having animated conversations about insurance premiums in Fethard, particularly with young people and sometimes twice with the same person in the space of 12 months. One young person, in particular, who needed his car to get to work in Clonmel, complained that his insurance premiums were twice its value, although looking at it it seemed closer to three times the value. Why has the recommendation made by Deputy Rabbitte with regard to the equality issue not been implemented?  As Deputy Broughan pointed out, there is virtually a 100% weighting <i>vis-à-vis </i>male and female drivers. On what basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A presentation was made to the relevant committee which was hotly disputed in terms of the data and figures provided by the insurance companies. The role of regulating the insurance industry lies with the Government which is responsible for inquiring into the level of exposure among many small industries. I have been informed by a number of small builders that, following the collapse of the Independent Insurance Company, a substantial number of them are effectively trading recklessly because, on the one hand, they cannot get the insurance cover they need, while, on the other, they are being beseeched by people to do work of one kind or another on their homes. Many of the people of this city who will have to have repairs carried out on their homes as a consequence of <Col N="1541" /> the floods last Friday will turn to these builders. If a problem arises or an accident occurs because of the builders, there will be a crisis because there is no proper insurance cover.</P>
    <P>Sadly, the Minister of State is defending the inexplicable inactivity of his senior Minister, whose refusal to come before the House to address this issue is a manifestation of the extraordinary contempt which she now frequently displays to the Opposition and elected Members of the House. She refuses to recognise that, ultimately, she has full responsibility for enterprise, trade and employment. Let us take the three categories for which she has responsibility. Enterprise is being stifled and businesses are closing down as we speak because of the exorbitant cost of insurance premiums. Trade will decline as a result of the inability of companies to get the necessary cover at a price which allows them to continue trading. As a result, employment will suffer. These facts are self-evident and have been cited many times as the reasons companies have gone into liquidation or stopped trading. While they may stop trading without reporting redundancies because their employees are able to find employment elsewhere, as has been the case in the north Dublin area, it does not excuse the fact that the jobs they created in the domestic indigenous sector have, in effect, disappeared. In the dying days of the Government, I ask the Minister of State, having listened to the debate, to recognise that the problem is much more severe and acute than suggested by the lack of a sense of urgency conveyed in his personal contribution or the terms of the amendment. What we are dealing with is serious market failure.</P>
    <P>At Question Time yesterday the Taoiseach stated in respect of the roll-out of broadband, an essential infrastructural requirement, there was an expectation at the time of the Eircom privatisation and the entry into the market of additional players that the private sector would provide the infrastructure necessary to enable the country to move to e-business or e-commerce, all the lovely buzzwords which Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, uses so eloquently. The private sector has failed to deliver what is required in the area of broadband.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister now accept that the private sector is failing in respect of its requirement to deliver an insurance regime which is equitable, accessible to all reasonable citizens capable of participating in it as individuals, irrespective of age, small companies and enterprises? It is failing to the point that, by comparison with other countries of the European Union, its costs are exorbitant. We need to recognise this market failure and examine mechanisms, as the Taoiseach stated yesterday, for reintroducing a State company or mechanisms which will address it to the point at which competitive costs return. If needs be, we can address the other issues tiptoed around in the amendment such as legal costs, other require<Col N="1542" /> ments and the inequality in the treatment of citizens.</P>
    <P>We also need to explore fully and comprehensively the real records of the insurance companies. In the light of the Enron collapse and other accounting deficiencies there is reason to look behind the audited figures of certain companies. Perhaps what we have been told by companies, which are not providing the level of cover required, needs to be fully and comprehensively examined. I am not so sure that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has devoted the necessary internal resources in the past five years to ensure the scrutiny of the insurance regime operating here is properly undertaken. This is not a reflection on the Civil Service. The allocation of staff and resources in Departments is, at all times, a responsibility of the Minister of the day. A group of people in a sector can only do so much.</P>
    <P>This is a complex issue to which I am not suggesting there is a simple solution. Listening to the Minister of State, however, there is no prospect of a solution and certainly no hope or prospect of any relief whatsoever for the many cases highlighted today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues on all sides for their contributions to this important and long overdue debate on the costs of insurance. I will not dwell on the absences from the House noted by Deputy Quinn. However, it is regrettable that a number of Fianna Fáil backbenchers have come into the House to identify with the motion and state how upset they are about young drivers not being able to pursue a livelihood because they cannot get insurance and express concern about small companies, particularly in their constituencies, which are finding it almost impossible to get insurance cover. On the other hand, the members of the Government who are capable of acting on the matters raised by their own backbenchers have not even come into the House. It is very regrettable if the stage has been reached whereby the relevant Minister does not even come to the House for Private Members' business.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Quinn stated, the Tánaiste is the Minister responsible for enterprise, trade and employment. She has not come near the House and to add insult to injury, the Minister of State who says he is responsible&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope he has more success up there than he has had in dealing with insurance costs. All night we have had a relay of Ministers of State, until the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, came in with not the faintest connection to this problem or its solution. That is eminently regrettable, Sir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to retrace the territory I covered last night but it seems this Minister of State is constantly one report away from taking action. <Col N="1543" /> He does not seem to understand that many companies in this country have taken a 100% hit in the last two years &ndash; that is a fact. Companies in certain high risk sectors cannot get cover at all. As Deputy Quinn has said, some of them are trading recklessly as a result. There is no mandatory cover in terms of public liability or employers' liability. I know of situations, for example, in the haulage industry where some hauliers are reduced to insuring four trucks and not insuring three others in the hope they can change the number plates if there is an unfortunate accident because they cannot get cover. It is more difficult for those in a vulnerable high risk area to get cover at a reasonable price. I do not want to labour the point about terrorist risk not being insured but I do not think the public knows that if there was a bomb in any part of this jurisdiction, it would not be covered.</P>
    <P>On the question of jobs being lost, we had that from the Government side of the House. Jobs are being lost and are threatened. Last night Deputy Gerry Reynolds told the House about three young fellows in his constituency who, because they could not get reasonably priced insurance for their motor cars to go to work, are now working in Birmingham. That is the kind of implication about which we are talking. Then, of course, there are young drivers who, as Deputy Upton said, are likely to be charged twice as much for insurance cover as they are for the vehicle in which they are going to work in the first place.</P>
    <P>I met a colleague of the Minister of State on my way into the House. He said, &ldquo;Don't forget to raise my experience&rdquo;. He took a cheque out of his pocket that a constituent sent him. As a small builder, he wanted to insure a small job for £96,000 and he had to raise a bond. He raised the bond with Allianz for £5,900. He paid the £5,900 and the company sent it back to him with a letter saying that it would proceed to provide the bond provided he could lodge security against the £96,000. That situation is ridiculous and was raised with me by a colleague of the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>I was upset last night by the distortion of the Minister of State's record as he put it in the House. I would like to look for a moment at the question of the personal injuries assessment board. I know the Minister of State said this problem has only become really serious in the last two years. He is right up to a point &ndash; it has got immensely serious in the last two years &ndash; but it has been serious for years. Let me recount the situation again. In April 1997 I took the first McCauley report that recommended the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal. In May of that year I authorised, on a pilot basis, its implementation and that it proceed on the second limb of the then Cabinet decision which was to examine alternative methods of delivery of compensation. It was not established on a pilot or any other basis and the McCauley group went out of <Col N="1544" /> existence for some reason I still do not know and was revived only after a row in this House in September 1998. That was 15 months later and nothing had happened in the interim. What happened then was that it started its work afresh and reported in March 2001 &ndash; four years after 1997.</P>
    <P>It is now February 2002 and absolutely nothing has been implemented. What did McCauley recommend in his second report? He recommended exactly what was recommended in the first McCauley report. His main recommendation, to use the Minister of State's own language, was to set up a personal injuries tribunal only this time it was to be called a personal insurance assessment board. It was the same recommendation he made in 1997 but the Department and the Minister were persuaded it was a great idea even though it was there to be implemented. After the June 1997 election, nothing happened.</P>
    <P>I am quite disturbed at the attempt to misrepresent. I took out some papers with me and I was very tempted to break a long standing convention and read it into the record of the House. Rather than read it into the record of the House, seeing as it is quite personal in terms of where it is focused, I ask the Minister of State to go back to the files and look at a memorandum I wrote to the Assistant Secretary on 17 December 1996. That may take some of the wind out of the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy's sails, although he has a lot of wind in his sails.</P>
    <P>I heard all the things the Government is doing to address this situation. I got a phone call today in respect of one thing which has been done &ndash; again after a wait of three years &ndash; and that is the penalty points system. The phone call was from someone who saw something about this debate, although I do not know how he managed to do that as it is extremely difficult to see journalists writing about anything serious these days or anything that has not to do with Liam Lawlor's breakfast arrangements. This person, concerned with the industry, told me that we cannot implement the penalty points system because the Garda requires &euro;12 million to adapt the PULSE system. After a battle, it has received &euro;1 million. That is the situation as regards the great big breakthroughs we made in that particular area.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Minister of State and the progress he is making, it was flushed out on Question Time. Deputy Flanagan asked him to name three things he had done. He could not name three things he had done but told us he cannot get the information he needs; that he cannot get the report he wants; that he cannot do anything until he gets the report; and that he cannot implement the PIAB. That is his record. On the question of the MIAB, he confuses setting up a board with action. He keeps talking about this MIAB initiative that he took in 1998. There is still no sign of action on it. The interim report has only created confusion. If it takes him as long to act on the MIAB as it has on the PIAB, 17 year olds who were in primary school when the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, took over, will be <Col N="1545" /> middle aged by the time he gets around to doing anything about it. He probably expected that he would escape to Europe and that he would not have to take any of these decisions.</P>
    <P>The fixed mantra on successive Question Times has been, &ldquo;I wandered lonely as a cloud, I'm doing me best in the face of adversity, I'm waiting for the report and didn't I set up the committee comprising really eminent people.&rdquo;  He made it sound like a forum of celebrities. He said as soon as he got the report he would vigorously pursue its implementation.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, that this is a complex issue &ndash; I never said otherwise. It is a complex issue and the industry is facing its own difficulties about which there can be no doubt. Legal costs need to be tackled. I do not know why Deputy Kirk said I did not deal with remedies. I dealt with many remedies, <Col N="1546" /> including the Equality Authority assessment of discrimination against young drivers; the need to establish the PIAB; the need to tackle legal and expert costs and the delay in settlements; the need to invoke section 46 of the Courts and Court Officers Act; the need to reform court procedure; the need to introduce mandatory employers liability; the need to establish the penalty points system and provide the Garda with the wherewithal to implement the PULSE system; the need to tackle the question of provisional driving; and the need to continue the programme of improvements in our infrastructure, drink driving, road traffic and so on.</P>
    <P>There is no urgency or recognition in Government of the reality of employers now confronting inordinately priced insurance and young drivers who cannot get the basic wherewithal to earn a living.</P>

    <P>Mr. Stanton: Before we adjourned the debate I was speaking of the importance, as I saw it, of highlighting the need for conservation and efficiency where energy was concerned. To insert these two words in line 38 would strengthen and add to the Bill. The subsection mentions the use of energy and goes on to state, as the Minister of State said, &ldquo;(including implications relating to the sourcing, transformation, transmission, distribution and emissions thereof).&rdquo;  It should also mention conservation and efficiency. It is a worthwhile amendment. The Bill should highlight the fact that we need to conserve and be efficient with energy.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 29, after &ldquo;members&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;at least one of whom shall be elected by the employees of the Authority&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We see a need to have worker directors involved. We are aware that this is a small agency with a small staff but the principle is an established one. The Minister for Public Enterprise accepted an amendment that was tabled when the Railway Procurement Agency was being established. She said she thought it was a good principle to have worker directors involved. One of the members of the authority should be elected by the employees of the authority. It gives them a sense of ownership of the authority and gives the authority an opportunity to see its operation through the eyes of its workers. It is a principle that is accepted by all sides in the House. I expected that the Minister of State would follow the example of his colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, in this regard and continue this practice. I look forward to hear what the Minister of State has to say.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>The Minister of State acknowledged today that one of the difficulties in relation to doing some of the things we were recommending was the size of the authority. He referred to a staff of 50. Now we are talking about a board of 12 to regulate an authority with a staff of 50. To put it bluntly this seems to be excessive in terms of staff numbers. I am at a loss to know <Col N="1551" /> why provision was not made for a worker director in the original draft of the Bill. We have worker directors on the boards of Iarnród Éireann, Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann, Bord na Móna, the Railway Procurement Agency, Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and so on, yet on the board of this particular body the powers that be who drafted this legislation decided there would be no worker director.</P>
      <P>The staff and unions have done everything possible to obtain a worker director or trade union representation on the board and my understanding is that negotiations with the Department have broken down and their demands were firmly rejected. We urge that this sensible amendment to give participation by workers on the board be accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I undertook to consider this matter further and having done so I am more convinced than ever that it would not be appropriate to have worker directors on this board. My views coincide with current Government policy on the appointment of worker directors to State boards. It is not policy to appoint such directors to the board of non-commercial State bodies.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, and again this evening, some colleagues referred to the fact that the recently enacted Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act, 2001, which was sponsored by my colleague the Minster for Public Enterprise, provided for one of the members of the agency to be elected by the staff. There is a big difference between that body and the one proposed here. The Railway Procurement Agency is a commercial body with a range of functions which are essentially commercial in nature and the new authority we are talking about here is a relatively small non-commercial State body with a current staff of less that 40.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the communications channels and sub-boards structures which will be put in place in the new authority will ensure the maximum flow of information relating to decisions of the board right to the staff and conversely from the staff to the board, obviating the need for a worker director.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to go some way to meet the Deputies' concerns so I have included trade union representation among the list of competencies of prospective board members. I repeat the undertaking I gave on Committee Stage that I will appoint a person from the trade union pillar of the social partnership to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is disappointing that the Minster of State is not of a mind to accept this amendment. I believe workers would have much to offer <Col N="1552" /> a board like this because this authority will require imagination, energy and flair. It is a new, young authority and it is important to tap into all the resources available to it.</P>
      <P>I agree that having somebody from the trade union pillar is important but it is not the same as having a person who is on the shop floor, as it were, represented on the board who can bring the concerns and ideas of the workers to board level. Like my colleague, Deputy Higgins, I am mystified as to why the board is so large, and we will address that issue later on. The Minister alluded to the Railway Procurement Agency which has only seven members while this has 12. There would be plenty of room on this board for a worker director. That would be a very democratic step and would add to the authority rather than take from it.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said he is of a mind to meet us some of the way. Why does he not meet us all the way and accede to this amendment? It should not make that much difference. What harm would it do? The Minister has not given us any reason for not accepting it. Would it be damaging in some way? We are all agreed it would be beneficial. Perhaps the Minister of State will reconsider even at this late stage and allow this amendment to be made.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Board shall direct the functions of the Authority in accordance with this Act and shall satisfy itself as to the adequacy of the systems in place for that purpose and shall keep under review the performance of the Authority.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>An amendment was proposed on Committee Stage in relation to the functions of the board, which I undertook to examine further and revert to on Report Stage. Arising from that examination I am proposing this amendment, which I believe meets the requirements of colleagues who raised the matter on Committee Stage. The amendment differs in a couple of respects from that tabled on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious that the responsibilities of the board and of management are clear and not in any way compromised by what we might put into the legislation. The Committee Stage amendment provided it was a duty of the board <i>inter alia</i> to manage the workings of the authority. The changes I made to the Committee Stage amendment were necessary to ensure the demarcation <Col N="1553" /> between the functions of the board and those of management. I hope the Deputies appreciate the changes I made and will accept my amendment which is geared to take on board the spirit of the Opposition amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3) Each member of the Board shall be a person who, in the opinion of the Minister, has experience and competence in relation to one or more of the following areas:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I said on Committee Stage that I was not opposed in principle to including in the Bill a list of experiences and competences that members of the board should have. With a few changes, I have adopted the text as proposed by Deputies Stanton, Higgins and Naughten on Committee Stage. The first change is to delete the word &ldquo;wide&rdquo;. The problem with this word is that it is too wide, pardon the pun. For example, would experience of wave energy count as wide experience of renewable energy methodologies, or would experience of other forms of renewable energy be <Col N="1554" /> required also? I am advised it would be better not to have the word &ldquo;wide&rdquo; included. Second, I have added some new categories to the list &ndash; trade union matters, transport, industry and commerce. Those are areas of experience and competence would be of value to the board. Basically, I have taken on what was proposed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy the Minister of State has more or less accepted the amendment we put forward on Committee Stage. The amendment was designed to ensure that members of boards would have something to offer the board and that the Minister, in selecting members of boards, would have to, in a sense, stand over the selection and be able to defend it on the basis of the experience or competence of those appointed. I am also happy the Minister of State has expanded and improved on the amendment as drafted, by adding trade union matters, transport, industry and commerce to the list of requirements. My only reservation is that the Minister of State has taken out the word &ldquo;wide&rdquo;. The amendment now reads:</P>
      <P>Each member of the Board shall be a person who, in the opinion of the Minister, has experience and competence in relation to one or more of the following areas . . .</P>
      <P>I had included the word &ldquo;wide&rdquo; to provide, in some way, that a certain amount of experience would be required but I accept the Minister of State's comment that it is somewhat vague. We could possibly debate indefinitely what constitutes experience and competence. Each of us has competence and experience in education because we have gone through the school system. I believe the thrust of the amendment is that a person would have some expertise. Perhaps &ldquo;expertise&rdquo; could be added in as well as &ldquo;experience and competence&rdquo;, if the Minister of State can take it on board at this stage. However, I am happy that he has accepted the thrust of our amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a wise amendment. It gives people who read the Bill an indication of the make-up of the board in terms of the background of members. However, there is still a certain wide aspect to it even now. With regard to economics, it would do no harm if we were to specify &ldquo;sustainable economics&rdquo;, to give an indication that we are referring to economics in the context of the work of the Sustainable Energy Authority, as opposed to simple economics as such. There are many kinds of economists, some of whom would be quite scathing about the objectives of the Sustainable Energy Authority. I presume it is implicit that we are referring to sustainable economics but it would be useful to give some indication of that. As <Col N="1555" /> the Minister of State has said, it is not advisable to have an unduly wide definition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, shall nominate people to be members of the Board and each person so nominated, on accepting the nomination, and prior to appointment to the Board by the Minister shall appear before a Committee of Dáil Eireann established under the Standing Orders of Dáil Eireann in order to answer questions regarding his or her suitability, qualifications and experience and the Minister shall not appoint a member without prior approval of the said Dáil Committee.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Establishing a board of any State agency is an important matter. We have already improved on this Bill by laying down a list of requirements that members of the board should have. It is also important that the appointments be made in an open, transparent and public manner. In other jurisdictions, members who are to be appointed to state boards and other such bodies are interviewed by select committees. That gives the public a chance to see who will be on the board and the prospective members of the board have an opportunity to say what they have to offer to the board and why they should be appointed. It also gives an opportunity to expose, for the want of a better term, any skeletons in closets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people on State boards who are doing excellent work. Unfortunately, much of it is hidden and the public is not aware of it. Occasionally, matters of an unsavoury nature come to light, resulting in a big hue and cry. This amendment seeks to put into the Bill a provision whereby &ldquo;the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, shall nominate people to be members of the board and each person so nominated, on accepting the nomination, and prior to appointment to the board by the Minister shall appear before a committee of Dáil Éireann established under the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann in order to answer questions regarding his or her suitability, qualifications and experience and the Minister shall not appoint a member without prior approval of the said Dáil Committee.&rdquo;  I know this is a ground breaking proposal. On Committee Stage, the Minister said people would be loath to come before a Dáil committee <Col N="1556" /> because they do not wish their appointments to be made public. Why should such appointments not be made public? After all, we represent the public and those people will also represent the public. The public has every right to know who is being appointed and, as representatives of the public, have we not every right to ask them questions and give them an opportunity to say what they have to bring to the board? I have no doubt the people a Minister would nominate would be excellent people and that there would not be any problem with this suggested procedure. It is a new proposal but it should be taken on. This is an opportunity for the Minister of State to show his courage and tenacity by doing something that will go down in history.</P>
    <P>I am interested to hear what other Members have to say. I know the Minister of State had two reservations on Committee Stage. One was that people would be slow to come before a committee. On the other hand, people might be happy to do so and to show what they have to offer. Everything would be open and above board and the innuendo that is sometimes attached to appointments to State boards would be dispelled. Members of Dáil committees are very respectful of people who come before them and the Chairs of committees ensure that that is the case. I ask the Minister of State to accept this amendment. Perhaps he has had time to discuss it with his colleagues since we discussed it in Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not support this amendment. We are discussing a non commercial board for which we will have to seek out people to serve on it. If they are informed they will be obliged to appear before an Oireachtas committee to be cross-examined, they will state they do not want the job because it does not pay anything. There might be a nominal sum of £50 per week paid in respect of jobs of this nature, but when tax is deducted net pay only amounts to about £25 per week. These are &ldquo;good citizen&rdquo; jobs as opposed to paid employment. I accept that political hacks occupy a number of these positions, but they would have to be qualified hacks under the amendment. If it is accepted, it will be impossible to attract people to serve on the boards.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the intention behind the amendment. I regret that I was not present to move amendments Nos. 16, 17 and 18. However, the amendment before us, because it follows the pattern of the Bill, states the consent of the Minister for Finance would be required. Although that requirement did not originate with the authors of the motion, it is a flaw because the Minister for Finance is directly opposed to many of the fiscal measures that would be important in terms of promoting sustainable energy. I refer, for example, to the type of hypothecated taxation that would need to be ring-fenced and know the <Col N="1557" /> Minister for Finance struggled when presented with this challenge by other Ministers.</P>
      <P>I am not sure whether this measure is designed to stop the board spending money or whether its members have to be friends of the Minister for Finance. As matters stand, however, this board will be hampered by the requirement that the Minister for Finance must grant approval. That is the more important point to be made in respect of the amendment. I take Deputy Stagg's point and would not like anyone to be dissuaded from serving on a State board. At the same time, however, board members should be people of conviction and I hope they would have no difficulty in declaring their membership of the authority or being strident in expressing their views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this amendment on Committee Stage. I repeat what I said then, namely, that the proposed amendment is without precedent in regard to the appointment of members to a State body. I venture to say that it would be unique in our system.</P>
      <P>Deputy Stanton stated there are many excellent individuals serving on our State boards and I endorse his comments in that regard. From his own experience of appointing directors to certain bodies, Deputy Stagg is aware that the people concerned do not grow on trees and are not overpaid for the work they do. We need qualified, capable people of integrity to serve on our State boards. It would be a deterrent to ask them to run the gauntlet in the manner outlined in the amendment.</P>
      <P>There are many people who would make eminent board members, but would not be prepared to submit to such questioning with regard to their suitability or qualifications. What we are discussing here is some kind of interview board comprised of Oireachtas Members. This amendment would make it difficult to attract enough suitable people to sit on boards and I regret that I cannot accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State indicated he does not believe it would be suitable for a board comprised of Oireachtas Members to interview people for membership of State boards. We are not concerned with the appointment of judges to the United States Supreme Court, but with the appointment of people to serve on State boards in Ireland. What Deputy Stanton is proposing is quite unique.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I usually find myself in total agreement with Deputy Stagg and favour and support many of the views and ideas he puts forward. However, there must be a certain level of openness about the people appointed to serve on semi-State bodies. It is only when one consults the relevant guide that one realises who is serving on these various committees, boards and commissions. <Col N="1558" /> The people to whom I refer attain their positions by means of Government appointment.</P>
    <P>I accept that Deputy Stanton's proposal is ground-breaking. However, not everyone would be asked to appear before a committee of the Houses. Between 95% and 99% of those appointed will be perfectly acceptable to everyone. Members of the Oireachtas are elected to protect the public good and must be able to ensure those selected for appointment are suitably qualified in every respect. The committee to which the amendment refers should, if necessary, be able to request a person or persons to appear before it. I do not believe this would lead to people being taken to task for holding a particular political viewpoint or committing a minor misdemeanour. Where it is believed that a person nominated for appointment may have an important vested interest, an Oireachtas committee should be allowed to examine him or her.</P>
    <P>The committees of the House have had their ups and downs and been proved right and wrong. Overall, however, they have gone from strength to strength and perform an important function. For this reason, it would be in everybody's best interests to allow a committee of the House to examine people's credentials and ask them to appear before it. If we do otherwise, we are stating we should not be delegating this power to committees. We should delegate such power to them because it would be a good development.</P>
    <P>If, after a long and illustrious career in the Houses as both a Deputy and Minister, Deputy Sargent decided to continue in public service and was asked to appear before a committee, I have no doubt that he would be happy to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Stagg would also be willing to do so. There are many well-intentioned and good citizens who are open and honest and would be concerned about appearing before such a committee. Whether they would be paid £50, £500 or £5,000 for serving on a board, if they are open and honest, they would be happy to appear before a committee to have their appointment approved. Such a process would be open, transparent and good.</P>

      <P>I regularly find myself agreeing with Deputy Enright. I agree with him now also, but what he is saying is not contained in the amendment. Deputy Stanton's amendment advocates the compulsory grilling of everybody put forward for consideration and their approval by the committee before the Minister can appoint them. What Deputy Enright said is fine, but that is not what the amendment states.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">

      <P>Another advantage of accepting the amendment would be that the members of <Col N="1559" /> the Oireachtas committee would become familiar with board members because they would be in a position to meet and discuss the operations of the authority with them. This would be a learning process for everyone &ndash; members of the committee and prospective members of boards. The way the Bill is structured, there will be a rotating membership. People, therefore, will seldom be obliged to appear before the committee. It would actually be an event when somebody appeared before it. The person or persons in question would have the honour of being nominated by the Minister. They would then meet the committee for a discussion about the role of the authority and what they have to offer the authority. Grilling occurs only when there is something that requires it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>They would be required to answer questions with regard to qualifications, experience and so on, if the members so wished. There are very few positions in society nowadays that do not involve some form of interview or discussion beforehand. People are interviewed for positions no matter what the job it is, and I will not men<Col N="1560" /> tion any because all work is of value. It would be a learning process for the members of the committee and for the nominee.</P>
      <P>If there was a reason somebody should not be appointed it could be brought out into the open in public by the committee and dealt with. The Minister might then decide to withdraw a nomination. Alternatively, the committee might decide not to approve somebody for a particular reason. That could only be beneficial if something did arise. There are all kinds of reasons this is a good amendment. We should not hide and do things under cover. Most Members of this House probably do not know who serves on the boards of State bodies. The public do not know. It is time we opened it up. It is only when something hits the media that we discover that somebody is a member of a State board. This would give us the opportunity to open it up. There are excellent people on the boards of State companies. They have nothing to fear by meeting members of an Oireachtas committee to discuss what is involved. They would at least have to have some knowledge of the workings of the authority before going forward. That could only be beneficial to the authority, the members who will serve on it and the members of the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again I find myself raising an example of inadequacies in the approach to education. Tonight, I raise the need to provide additional school transport for pupils who attend Boheshill National School in Glencar, County Kerry.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State may not be aware that another national school in the area, Bunglash National School, was closed and that left a number of pupils with no option but to attend Boheshill National School, which is quite a distance from their homes. When the Bunglash school closed, however, no replacement bus service was provided to ferry the pupils to their new school. The excuse given by the Department of Education and Science for the failure to provide a replacement bus service was that because Bunglash National School was closed rather than amalgamated with Boheshill National School, pupils of Bunglash were not to be provided with transport to their new school.</P>
      <P>There is one pupil who walks a mile and a half to the school bus pick-up point every day, often in very bad weather, and then she has to travel a further seven miles on the bus. This is an unacceptable and unnecessary imposition on this young child. The road she walks is very dangerous and remote. In the winter many of the houses are unoccupied and the parents are concerned about the safety of their children. There are other five year olds due to start in September and it is unacceptable that they should have to walk this road to the bus pick-up point.</P>
      <P>The location of the pick-up point for these students is very dangerous. It is at the bottom of a hill on an extremely narrow road. The parents of these children want the Department to examine the possibility of providing a school bus from the old closed school. There is a suitable turning circle there that would facilitate the bus. From my dealings with the Department of Education and Science over the years, I understand that when an amalgamation takes place, there are negotiations with regard to the continuation of a bus service. In this case, however, because the school was closed, it did not happen.</P>
      <P>I will not labour the point but I ask the Minister of State to ask a Department official to meet the parents of these young children to see if the situation could be examined. We have until September but the parents have asked me to raise the issue tonight so there will be time for negotiations with the Department of Education and Science.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position generally is that the school transport scheme was established to cater for children in rural areas who, if living a long distance from school, might otherwise have difficulty in attending school regularly. There are approximately 131,000 primary and post-primary pupils using the school transport scheme on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>The scheme is administered by Bus Éireann on behalf of my Department. There are almost 3,000 vehicles, including spares, used to provide the service, covering 5,600 routes. All routes are examined with regard to the suitability of roads for the various types of vehicles used. Safe set-down, turning and pick-up points are carefully selected, always with safety in mind. Bus Éireann has a very good safety record in the operation of school transport and an ongoing commitment to highlight safety in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case the main difficulty relates to transport from the Bunglash school area to Boheshill National School. The Bunglash school closed with effect from September 2000 and pupils from that area now attend Boheshill National School. It has been indicated to the school transport section of my Department that some pupils have difficulty in making their way to the current pick-up point. The safety of this <Col N="1563" /> pick-up point has also been questioned in correspondence received by my Department today from the principal teacher.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I have asked the school transport section of my Department to carry out a review of school transport provision to the <Col N="1564" /> school. This review will be completed as a matter of urgency. The Deputy will be informed of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 7 February 2002.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that since the publication of the Abridged Book of Estimates, the Government provided an additional &euro;7 million to BIM for 2002 in the December budget.</P>
      <P>In the overall difficult fiscal climate, BIM has been allocated a total of just over &euro;28 million to underpin strategic development of the seafood Industry in 2002. This compares with an allocation to BIM of &euro;31.95 million in 2001. While this represents a decrease of 12% in the current year, I would remind the Deputy that over the lifetime of this Government the annual allocation funding for BIM has been increased from some &euro;10 million in 1997 to over &euro;28 million in 2002. Funding to BIM has almost tripled in that period, representing an annual average increase of 26%.</P>
      <P>The 2002 provision will enable BIM to continue to take forward targeted development programmes for the seafood industry including NDP measures for fleet renewal, fisheries innovation, aquaculture, seafood processing, training and marketing. It will also ensure continued delivery on our objectives for sustainable development of inshore fisheries around the coast.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that I have invited my ministerial colleagues in question, together with senior departmental officials, to a meeting to review water pollution strategies for fisheries catchments. The purpose of the meeting is to further enhance cross-departmental and agency co-operation in addressing the water quality challenge. The health of our fish stocks is a key barometer for water quality and fisheries interests are at the forefront in highlighting environmental threats to our river and lake catchments. The ministerial meeting will also review the potential for new joint initiatives between our Departments and agencies, working with local interest groups, to address catchment specific problems such as those in the Carra-Mask.</P>
      <P>To inform this initiative I have also requested the Western Regional Fisheries Board to convene a meeting of all relevant parties to discuss and advise on particular concerns relating to Carra-Mask catchment. The objective in bringing together the local authorities, Teagasc, Dúchas, farming representatives and angling groups is to identify practical actions to tackle specific pollution problems in the catchment which can be progressed at local level. I am committed to ensuring that the collective effort to address the pollution threats to our inland fisheries is intensified and supported at all levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As of 31 December 2000 the total area of lands under forest stood at 650,000 hectares, representing 9.4% of the national land area. The productive forest area amounts to 545,000 hectares and the balance is made up of broadleaf scrub woodlands not regularly managed and habitat areas.</P>
      <P>Broadleaves account for 21% of the forest estate. Of the total area, Coillte owns almost 400,000 hectares or 61%, with approx 250,000 hectares or 39% owned by farmers and others. Forest cover by county ranges from 2.5% in County Meath to 21% of County Wicklow. The forest area is maintained through replanting following harvesting as provided for in the Forestry Act, 1946.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to afforestation it is estimated that 15,000 hectares approximately have been grant aided in 2001. The planting targets set out in the 1996 strategic plan for forestry, Growing for the Future, envisaged annual planting of up to 25,000 hectares up to the year 2,000 and 20,000 hectares thereafter. While these ambitious targets have <Col N="1567" /> not been met in recent years, the planting levels achieved have been nonetheless significant.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of significant recent developments, which will help to bring planting in line with targets. Firstly the role of forestry as one of the motors of rural development has been recognised in the Rural Development Plan 2000-2006, which is co-funded, by the Exchequer and the European Commission. Significant funding of around &euro;686 million has been provided for afforestation under the plan, with a further &euro;127 million available for structural measures. In addition &euro;102 million is being invested by the private sector.</P>
    <P>Secondly, average increases of approx 30% in both afforestation grant and premium levels have been introduced in the past two years. Initially, these increases only applied to planting which took place from 2000 onwards. However, following European Commission agreement, I was happy to announce in December last that the Government was providing 100% funding for the extension of the premium increases to those who planted in earlier years. I also secured agreement with the commission on the inclusion, for the first time ever, of a mid-term review of premium rates under the rural development plan. This is a significant development which, together with the average 30% increases, should begin to pay off in increased afforestation from this year onwards.</P>
    <P>There have been other developments which are also relevant. The rural development plan provides for the integration of forestry and REPs. This will offer significant opportunities for forestry in the future. The national climate change strategy recognised the beneficial aspects of forestry, in particular, in countering greenhouse gases and in its role as a carbon sequestrator. The native woodland scheme provides for the planting of native species.</P>
    <P>Given the combination of these factors, I am confident that planting levels will increase to target levels on an incremental basis over the coming years.</P>

      <P>The British registered fishing vessel <Col N="1568" /><i>Arosa</i> sank off the Galway coast on 3 October 2000, with the loss of 12 lives. There was only one survivor. Under international maritime law, it is the responsibility of the flag state to carry out investigations into marine casualties involving their vessels. It was considered that, under the circumstances, there was no need for a separate investigation by the Irish authorities. The Marine Survey Office, MSO, assisted in the investigation providing all the relevant data to the UK inspector. The recently published report by the marine accident investigation branch of the United Kingdom Administration of its investigation into the loss of the <i>Arosa,</i> contained no safety recommendations. My Department is now examining the report and if any new safety measures are found to be necessary, I shall have them introduced as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that a response to the formal notice of infringement proceedings by the Commission was forwarded before the deadline of 24 December 2001. The response set out the background to the status of the fishing vessel concerned in the context of the long drawn out negotiations on the proposed decision to adjust Ireland's fleet objectives to take account of new additional fishing opportunities in international waters. The response also noted the negotiations in train in relation to the excess power capacity in the pelagic segment of the Irish fleet. The Commission was of course already aware of all aspects of the issues dealt with in the response which have been the subject of ongoing discussion for over a year. The response concluded that timely delivery of actions recently agreed by the Irish authorities and the EU Commission would fully address the substantive issue in the letter of formal notice, namely the registration of the vessel concerned on the Irish and EU fishing boat registers.</P>
      <P>The Commission has recently adopted the decision crediting the Irish pelagic segment with additional fleet capacity and effort to take account of additional fishing opportunities in Mauritanian waters. This step, in conjunction with arrangements currently being finalised to address the power overcapacity in the pelagic segment, will enable the vessel concerned to be fully licensed and registered. The infringement proceedings are therefore likely to become redundant in the short-term.</P>

      <P>The outcome of the Fisheries Council in December was generally satisfactory from an Irish viewpoint. The negotiations were unusually difficult and prolonged. Close liaison was maintained with the representatives of the fishing industry throughout the Council.</P>
      <P>The Commission had proposed large-scale reductions in total allowable catches for a number of stocks. The scale of the reductions in many cases were not justified on scientific grounds. Where the scientific advice on stocks was robust, I argued for a more stepped approach involving enhanced technical conservation measures as opposed to across the board cuts. I underlined the case for a sustainable balance between the requirement to protect fish stocks and the need to sustain the livelihoods of fishermen. We succeeded in transforming the Commission proposals which would have reduced Irish whitefish quotas by more than 30% into a 5% increase over last year's quotas.</P>
      <P>Ministers also agreed to extend for six months the current EU fleet programme which will enable investment in the fleet to continue pending new Commission proposals. The Commission also proposed quotas for deep-sea fish stocks. This proposal was not a balanced one and we successfully opposed it. The Commission also made a presentation on its proposal for a multi-annual cod and hake recovery programme. These proposals are now being discussed with a view to decision at the April Council.</P>
      <P>The most difficult and prolonged part of the negotiations was the successful defence of Ireland's Hague Preference entitlement as an intrinsic part of relative stability. This was achieved in the face of extraordinary hostility by the Commission and certain other member states.</P>

      <P>The foreshore lease which I signed on 11 January last entitles the developer to site a maximum of 200 turbines with a total nominal rating of 520 megawatts, MW, on the Arklow bank and to connect them by a maximum of three subsea cables to the national grid at the ESB sub station at Arklow. The developer intends to build the project over four phases with one phase during each year's weather window, approximately between April and September. I understand that the developer hopes to have the first turbines constructed during this year with first connection to the grid in 2003.</P>
      <P>The lease is, however, subject to the developer having in place, before work commences, the necessary authorisation to construct and licence to generate from the Commission for Electricity Regulation.</P>
      <P>The first phase is for 60 MW which will be less than 20 turbines. The Arklow bank is a quite desolate place with little or no support for plant or fish life in the conditions which exist there. There is little international experience of the impacts of offshore wind turbines on fish and bird life. What experience there is suggests that we can expect that the foundations will, through the encouragement of growth of seaweeds, algae, etc., support life forms new to the area and eventually develop into a nursery for various fish species. This should assist in the development of fish stocks and sea angling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little information about birdlife around the Arklow bank, which is not a feeding area. Each bird species reacts differently to intrusion of any kind and this aspect is being and <Col N="1571" /> will be closely monitored for a period of at least five years after completion of the development. The lease conditions require the developer to continue monitoring impacts upon birdlife and to report findings to both my Department and to BirdWatch Ireland. Additionally I have insisted that the developer co-operate with BirdWatch should that organisation express interest in carrying out its own observations. To this end, subject to BirdWatch having sufficient funds for the balance of the expense involved, I have insisted that the developer contribute the sum of &euro;100,000 toward the cost of an observation tower on the Bank. Experience in Danish waters, which is limited to impacts on the eider duck and common scoter, would tend to suggest that there will not be a problem but I have sufficient powers to halt further development in the event of unanticipated and unacceptable environmental problems of any kind arising. The environmental safeguards in the lease go much further than those sought by BirdWatch Ireland in the submission it made following an invitation from my Department.</P>
    <P>The proposed development was not the subject of any objections during the public consultation process and has been welcomed by a wide selection of local groups and representative organisations.</P>
    <P>Should Deputies wish to examine a copy of the lease it can be downloaded from my Department's web site.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The public campaign launched by the Save the Swilly Group in opposition to the further development of aquaculture in the lough has raised a number of issues relating to the approach which has been taken in respect of licensing aquaculture and the sustainable level of aquaculture operations within the lough. The campaign gives the impression that Lough Swilly is overwhelmed by aquaculture.</P>
      <P>The reality is otherwise. The surface area of Lough Swilly is 15,400 hectares and the total water of Lough Swilly which, on average, exceeds two billion tonnes is changed every two days or so by tidal movements. To date, the total area licensed for intensive aquaculture such as salmon farming, rope culture mussels or the growing of oysters in bags on trestles, amounts to just over 1% of the surface area of the lough. Approximately 7.5 % of the area of the lough is licensed for the bottom culture of mussels, a traditional and unobtrusive method of cultivating shellfish which does not require any equipment in or on the water and, therefore, has no visual impact whatsoever. Most of the these licences date from the 1980s and with no evidence of adverse consequences.</P>
      <P>This means that over 91% of the area of the lough remains entirely free of aquaculture of any sort and for the forseeable future the great bulk of it will stay that way. The few remaining licence applications currently on hands, which amount to approximately 280 hectares in total, will be considered on their merits, within the legal framework governing the licensing of aquaculture and with no prior commitment to licensing any or all of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Carefully focused research can, of course, yield valuable information with regard to the interactions between aquaculture and the environment. In recognition of this it is already a mandatory requirement that a detailed environmental impact assessment be carried out in respect of all salmon farming projects, the only aquaculture which involves artificial feeding anywhere in Irish wat<Col N="1575" /> ers. Only one such project exists in Lough Swilly and has existed for decades without evidence of adverse consequence.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that under the legislation governing the licensing of aquaculture, all licence applications are subject to public consultation. In addition to canvassing the views of the public, applications are also scrutinised by specified statutory consultees including, amongst others, An Taisce, Dúchas, Bord Fáilte, the Commissioners of Irish Lights, the central and appropriate regional fisheries board and the relevant local authority and harbour authority.</P>
    <P>The broad range of responsibilities and expertise which the statutory consultees bring to this process, ensures that all aspects of proposals to engage in aquaculture are given due consideration and that possible impacts are clearly identified before a decision is reached on whether or not to grant a licence.</P>
    <P>Beyond the safeguards built into the licensing process, the aquaculture licences appeals board provides a fully independent review of licensing decisions and any party who is still unsatisfied is fully entitled to seek a judicial review of the board's decision within three months thereof.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, it would be is difficult to justify State funding of a costly and lengthy study of the kind sought by the Save the Swilly Group.</P>

      <P>Following advice from and with the agreement of both the Attorney General's Office and the Chief State Solicitor's Office, my Department reached a settlement with the Waddington Estate. The decision to enter into a settlement in this case was taken by my Department after full consideration of the ramifications for national ports policy as well as for the State's interest in the foreshore.</P>
      <P>The settlement, while recognising the property rights of the estate owners, protected the current development and allowed Drogheda Port Company to proceed with their plans to develop an area to the west of the current facility, subject to the appropriate consent under the Foreshore Acts. Moreover, this settlement removes any doubts that the foreshore in question is the property of the State.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that prior to and during the settlement talks there was contact between the legal teams of all the defendants, namely the State, Drogheda Port Company and Patrick Monaghan (Drogheda) Ltd.</P>

      <P>Some £2 million has been invested by BIM with EU support, on the tuna gear conversion programme since 1998. There has been an active involvement of south-western fishermen in the programme and a variety of fishing gears and techniques have been tested with promising results especially in relation to pair pelagic mid-water trawling. There is a resultant high level of interest from the fishermen in the south-west in the 2002 tuna fishery.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a substantial tuna quota and I am confident that the fishing industry, through the development and utilisation of new fishing techniques, can position itself to maximise the economic returns from the fishery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also secured EU agreement to double the number of vessels in the tuna fishery. This arrangement, and taking into account our significant quota share, will enable a significant number <Col N="1577" /> of vessels from the south-west to participate in the tuna fishery this year using new fishing methods with resultant dividends in terms of quality and price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 58 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>I am committed to a sustainable commercial salmon fishery based on quality and value rather than volume. I have also made clear my commitment to investing in the ongoing development of salmon angling as a valued pastime and as an important tourist product. Both economic goals are fully compatible with the overriding objective to preserve the salmon resource in its own right.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the scientific advice from the Marine Institute, based on latest stock assessment data, that reductions in overall fishing effort are required in order to sustain and rebuild salmon stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Informed by the scientific advice, and with the assistance and input of the National Salmon Commission and the fisheries boards, I recently announced a number of management measures in relation to the commercial fishing sector in 2002 and beyond. These measures include: the introduction of fishery district quotas for the taking of salmon by all commercial fishing engines to deliver a percentage reduction over catches in recent years. The quota system will be administered by the fisheries boards through the salmon tagging scheme. There will be a fixed number of tags issued per licence which will set the number of salmon allowable per licence. These will not be individual transferable quotas. Accordingly, no individual entitlement or property right will be created; a review of the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order is under way by a subgroup of the National Salmon Commission working with my Department and the fisheries boards. The review <Col N="1578" /> is examining the changes needed to deliver significant rationalisation of categories and numbers of commercial fishing licences. Subject to the emerging advice any changes will be put in place for the 2003 season; in the context of the introduction of district quotas for commercial fishing engines I am prepared to consider in principle some adjustment in the current effort limitation measures for 2002. In particular I will positively review the case for the introduction of safety days as requested by the sector itself; a review of the case for standardising the length of offshore drift nets from 732 metres and 1,372 metres to a standard 1,000 metres in all districts; I have raised with my colleague the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the concerns of fishermen regarding seal predation on salmon stocks.</P>
    <P>I have requested the National Salmon Commission to respond to me very quickly on the overall shape of the commercial fishing quota scheme and I have also mandated the chief executives of the fisheries boards to finalise the detailed practical arrangements for its operation through the licence and tagging regime as quickly as possible. The chief executives will finalise these shortly.</P>
    <P>The introduction of quotas for the taking of salmon by commercial fishing engines will not be accompanied by compensation. It is clear to me that a buy-out of fishing licences is most attractive to those who take few salmon and that it is not an effective means of achieving the objective of a restoration of salmon stocks. Accordingly, I have ruled out buy-out as the way forward. However, I will continue to support, subject to available Exchequer funding, local catchment-based setaside proposals with matching funding. I have invited all stakeholders and the regional fisheries boards to develop such proposals.</P>
    <P>I wish to see a reduction in fishing effort by both the commercial and recreational fishing sectors. The angling conservation measures already introduced for 2002 include a bag limit of one salmon per angler per day prior to 1 June and a ban on the sale of salmon caught by rod and line. In parallel with the introduction of quota for the commercial fishery, I have requested the National Salmon Commission to recommend on bag limits for the totality of the 2002 angling season and any other enhanced conservation measures which it considers appropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the International Transport Workers' Federation's concerns about the treatment of crews on vessels operating under flags of convenience. All merchant vessels of any significant size must be registered. There are over 140 ship registers in operation world-wide. Ship registers impose obligations on ship owners regarding maintenance, crewing standards and certification of those matters by the flag state or inspection bodies duly authorised by the flag state.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the practice of using flags of convenience, involving what is perceived as lenient regulatory requirements, is still permissible under international law. As Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources I have responsibilities in relation to the Irish Ship Register. However, the operation of other ship registers is governed by applicable national and international law and I am precluded from taking unilateral action.</P>
      <P>Foreign registered vessels using Irish ports are inspected regularly by the Marine Survey Office of my Department in the exercise of Ireland's port state control obligations. These inspections are aimed at ensuring that such vessels are maintained and operated in compliance with international safety standards laid down by the International Maritime Organisation, IMO, and, in relation to seafarers' social conditions, by the maritime conventions of the International Labour Organisation, ILO, together with relevant EU initiatives in the maritime area. Deficiencies identified are brought to the attention of the owner and flag state administration, and, may have to be rectified before the ship continues its journey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is currently actively addressing the strategic and operational aspects of delivery of its maritime safety regulatory services, including port state control. A detailed review of the services was commissioned in 1999 and the main recommendations of the report of the review, which was completed in October, 2000, are now being implemented. The new maritime safety directorate will be operational early this year and <Col N="1580" /> an additional ten vessel surveyors are currently being recruited to the Marine Survey Office, which will form an integral part of the new directorate.</P>
    <P>Ireland participates in IMO and ILO discussions on seafarers' welfare, supporting proposals aimed at improving their terms and conditions of employment. Maritime safety standards will be further augmented this year with the implementation of two EU Council Directives which deal respectively with the organisation of working time for seafarers and with the enforcement through inspections of provisions in respect of seafarers' hours of work on board vessels calling at Community ports.</P>
    <P>Ireland will continue to support all efforts to enhance working conditions for seafarers on board flag of convenience and indeed all vessels and will continue to enforce safety and operational standards through the port state control framework.</P>

      <P>As I have previously informed the House, there was an unexpected change of policy by Norway and Germany at a meeting last May of the International Steering Committee which manages the Loran-C radio navigation system. At that meeting, those countries formally gave qualified notice of their withdrawal from the system at the expiry of the current agreement in 2004. As a result of this unexpected development, and in the likely absence of Loran-C after the expiry of that agreement, I directed that Ireland proceed to determine its own marine radio-navigation strategy.</P>
      <P>In this regard my Department, together with the Commissioners of Irish Lights, are in the process of drawing up a document setting out an assessment of the state of radio-based aids to navigation around Ireland and the options for the future. This document, when completed, will be used as the basis for a consultation process with all stakeholders. I expect this document to be completed by Summer 2002.</P>

      <P>On 14 December 2001, I signed two statutory instruments, S.I. No. 586 of 2001, Fishing Vessel (Personal Flotation Devices) Regulations, 2001 and S.I. No. 587 of 2001, Fishing Vessel (Basic Safety Training) Regulations, 2001. The regulations will come into effect on 1 March 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fishing Vessel (Personal Flotation Devices) Regulations require all crew members of a fishing boat to wear a personal flotation device, PFD, at all times when on deck of any fishing vessel, or in the case of open decked ves<Col N="1584" /> sels, on board the vessel, whether at sea, in harbour or coming to and from moorings. Under the regulations the skipper of the vessel must take all reasonable steps to ensure that all crew members wear a PFD.</P>
    <P>The Fishing Vessel (Basic Safety Training) Regulations will require new crew members of a fishing vessel to undertake basic safety training before going to sea for the first time, and all serving crew members to undertake basic safety training on a phased basis between 2003 and 2008. A crew member who has not successfully completed basic safety training by the date specified in the regulations shall not work on board a fishing vessel.</P>
    <P>Primary responsibility for the safety of the crew of a fishing vessel lies with the owner of that vessel. Both Statutory Instruments were made under the merchant Shipping Act, 1992. Under section 19(5)(<i>a</i>) of that Act, if there is a contravention of regulations made under it, the owner and skipper of a fishing vessel shall be guilty of an offence and each shall be liable on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;1269.74, £1000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both.</P>
    <P>I believe that my Department working in consultation and partnership with the fishing industry will secure the co-operation of the fishing vessel owners, skipper and crews to comply with the new regulations. In addition, the new maritime safety directorate, will address, as one of its priorities, additional means of encouraging and monitoring compliance.</P>

      <P>My Department invited appropriately qualified consultants to tender for the conduct of a high level review of the State commercial ports operating under the Harbours Act, 1996 &ndash; 2000, late last year. The latest date for the receipt of tenders was 10 December 2001. Final selection of consultants has been deferred due to budgetary considerations. I am hopeful I can progress this important review as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Marine Institute and the international scientific bodies carry out annual assessments of the current status of EU fish stocks. On the basis of the most recent advice, there is a serious concern that many stocks appear to be outside biological limits.  In so far as the areas and species most affected are concerned, there is particular concern about a number of key whitefish stocks throughout Community waters, in particular cod and hake. Also some of the herring stocks appear to be in decline.</P>
      <P>The European Commission, with the support of Ireland, has put in place emergency stock recovery plans for Irish Sea cod, northern hake and cod on the north-west coast. The Commission has recently presented proposals for a long-term recovery plan for these stocks which are currently being examined.</P>
      <P>I am arranging to transmit to the Deputy the most recent stock assessment book, published by the Marine Institute, which outlines the current status of the fish stocks of interest to Ireland.</P>

The amount of time taken in any case will depend on the nature and extent of works, the quality of the application and whether any environmental impact statement required to accompany the application meets statutory requirements, the level and quality of public submissions made, if any, and the volume and complexity of other applications on hands under the Foreshore Acts, for leases, licences or permissions.

      <P>I am aware of the substantial increases in insurance premiums that many firms are facing and of the problems this is creating for them.</P>
      <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is, however, a matter for individual insurance companies. EU law prevents me and the Department from intervening in the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk.</P>
      <P>The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors, both domestic and international, to explain these increases. These include the high cost of settling claims, the general reduction in investment returns, recent court decisions regarding the calculation of compensation losses in personal injury cases and the affects of the 11 September attacks in the United States. The situation has not been helped by the failure of the UK authorised insurer, Independent Insurance Company Limited, who had a significant presence in the Irish market.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental implementation group is progressing the establishment of the personal injuries assessment board. I am confident that the establishment of the PIAB will achieve a reduction in the delivery costs of personal injury compensation, thus permitting a reduction in insurance costs to consumers.</P>
      <P>A workplace safety group has been established with a view to improving health and safety standards in the workplace. The objectives are to reduce workplace accidents, to encourage injured workers to return at the earliest possible date to the workplace and to improve claims handling procedures, thus reducing insurance costs. The group is developing proposals designed to bring the initiative to small and medium sized firms.</P>
      <P>I encourage consumers and insurers to consider ways of reducing the worst effects of the current circumstances, for example by better management of risks, examination of excess covers and whether the full extent of the covers included in policies is actually required.</P>

For such participants FÁS now has discretion to offer a further period on the programme on a case by case basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>Given the large number of applications under the Foreshore Acts on hands in respect of major infrastructural projects and the limited staff resources available to deal with them, I could not justify going back over the records of 70 years to establish the number of applications received from the company in question and the decision in each case.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the environmental impact statement, EIS, submitted by the company with its last application for permission to reclaim 21 hectares of its own foreshore in Dublin Port was rejected because it did not meet minimum statutory requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the application and EIS were the subject of statutory public consultation for the statutory period of one month, which ended on 1 November 1999, no further consideration can be given to the application until such time as a new EIS, meeting statutory <Col N="1592" /> requirements, is produced. A fresh period of public consultation would commence on publication of such a new EIS. I understand that the company has been in consultation with local groups since the rejection of the EIS referred to but I have not been advised of the detail or outcome.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the company to decide whether or not to proceed with its application. Until such time as the company in question submits a new environmental impact statement giving, <i>inter alia</i>, precise details of what is proposed, including details of proposed end use, construction methods and materials to be used and outlining the anticipated environmental impacts and proposed mitigation methods, I have no basis on which I can seek the advice of Dúchas. If an EIS is submitted, my Department will seek the views of Dúchas, as is its normal practice in respect of applications received under the Foreshore Acts. No new EIS has as yet been submitted to my Department in relation thereto.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 to 90, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The national climate change strategy identifies the key role to be played by forestry in terms of meeting Ireland's commitments under the Kyoto protocol. The NCCS calls for the intensification of the afforestation programme in view of the ongoing importance of enhancing sinks capacity towards reducing overall greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and assisting in meeting longer term greenhouse gas reduction.</P>
      <P>A close working relationship exists between my Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government in the context of forestry's role in the national climate change strategy. My Department is represented in the cross departmental climate change team and has also established an internal climate change team in order to facilitate early implementation of key measures identified in the strategy under the remit of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1594" />The Government's forestry policy as set out in Growing for the Future &ndash; A Strategic Plan for the Development of the Forestry Sector in Ireland was prepared prior to the Kyoto protocol. One of the targets of the forestry policy is to increase Ireland's forest cover from its present level of 9% to 17% by 2030. The planting programme to give effect to this strategy is supported by a generous grants and premium package co-financed by the European Union. This significant increase in forestry will assist in countering the increase in greenhouse gases. In fact, forestry is one of the few economic activities that can contribute to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
    <P>Conifers are particularly well suited in this regard. These species play a significant role as a carbon sequestrator. It is estimated that on average one hectare of Sitka spruce absorbs 3.3 tonnes of carbon per year. Over its rotation one hectare of conifers will remove approximately 100 tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere, making them exceptionally efficient in combating the greenhouse gas effect. COFORD, the Council for Forest Research and Development, is carrying out extensive work in the area of carbon sequestration with a view to maximising the sequestration potential of Irish forests. COFORD has negotiated an research and development contract that will refine current estimates of carbon stocks in Irish forests. The results of this research will inform future forest service policy.</P>
    <P>While final afforestation figures for 2001 are not yet available, it is estimated that 15,000 hectares approximately were grant aided that year. The total area of afforestation grant aided in 2000 was 15,695 hectares. With regard to the suitability of particular species, soil and site determine the rate of forest growth and consequently the potential for carbon storage. The five most suitable species are grand fir, western hemlock, western red cedar, Sitka spruce, and Douglas fir. Of these Sitka spruce accounted for approximately 50% of total annual afforestation for the year 2000, other diverse conifers such as Douglas fir account for approximately 30% and broadleaves account for the remaining 20%.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 to 97, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my replies to Questions 58, 60 and 65 on this subject on Thursday 11 October 2001, ref no. 23588/01, 23590/01 and 23595/01, and to Question 29311/01 on Wednesday, 21 November 2001.</P>
      <P>With regard to non-petroleum minerals no new substantial finds have been reported to me in the intervening period. The acid test of commerciality is that having made a find, the explorer is then prepared to invest in planning for mining and so makes the necessary applications for permits to me, to the relevant local authority and to the EPA. Over the past five years the results of the exploration effort for gold and ores of precious metals, while sufficient to encourage continued exploration, have not resulted in an application for a mining permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated in my replies to similar questions relating to offshore exploration and development raised by the Deputy over the last year, the only positive developments have been in relation to the Corrib gas field off the west coast. Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited declared the Corrib field commercial in January 2001 on behalf of its co-<Col N="1596" /> venturers, Statoil and Marathon. A petroleum lease demising the petroleum in the Corrib leasehold area issued to the Corrib group on 15 November 2001, and gave the conditions under which the lessees may work the petroleum, that is produce and market the gas. The granting of the lease does not in itself allow the company to commence development of the field. Under the terms of the lease, a plan of development accompanied by an environmental impact statement (EIS) had to be submitted by the group for my approval before any development could take place. A plan of development accompanied by an EIS was submitted by the group in November last and is currently being processed in my Department. I expect to be in a position to make a decision in the matter by mid-March 2002.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Energy Ireland have plans to bring the gas ashore by October 2003 and expect the field to be in production for about 15 years. This is the first large scale commercial gas discovery in Ireland since the Kinsale field some 25 years ago. Its reserves are estimated at somewhat more than half those of the Kinsale and Ballycotton fields. Well commitments under existing authorisations only amount to between three and six for the entire Irish offshore. This year an exploration well will be drilled in the Rockall trough basin and it is expected that one, possibly two appraisal/development wells will be drilled in the Seven Heads area of the North Celtic Sea basin. There is a further possibility that a sixth appraisal well will be drilled on the Corrib gas field in the Slyne basin and that one, possibly two exploration wells will be drilled in the Slyne/Erris basins.</P>
    <P>The number of offshore exploration licences has fallen to eight compared to a peak of 32 in 1997. Nine of the 11 frontier exploration licences issued under the Rockall trough licensing round in 1997 have now been relinquished. As regards the onshore, two petroleum exploration wells already drilled in the north-west carboniferous basin will be re-entered, stimulated and tested. One further exploration well may be drilled there this year.</P>
    <P>The question of Ireland's energy requirements in the future is a matter for my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke the Minister for Public Enterprise. However, as a mentioned in a previous reply, Ireland currently has no reserves of oil, so all of its oil requirements are imported. In relation to gas, 18% of the national requirement in 2001 was met by production from the Kinsale Head gas field and the remaining 82% was imported through the interconnector. These figures reflect the decline in production of Kinsale from 1995-96 when 83% of the national requirement was met from the Kinsale field. It is expected that the share of the national requirement supplied by indigenous gas will increase again when the Corrib field comes into production.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>Under Irish and international law, all vessels trading into and out of Irish ports are required to carry the appropriate certification to demonstrate compliance with the requisite conventions and regulations applicable to ships of their size and type. All vessels are subject to surveys and inspections initially by their flag states and, in addition, they are liable to inspection every six months under the port state control system if they visit any of the countries party to that system. The application of port state control ensures that at any given time a large number of ships operating within the area covered by that system have undergone an inspection by a state party to the system in the previous six months. Serious breaches of international convention requirements may result in the detention of vessels.</P>
      <P>All Irish registered passenger and cargo vessels are inspected at least annually by my Department's surveyors and, in accordance with the port state control system, are liable to inspections every six months at the ports of other states that are members of the system. There were 56 inspections carried out last year on Irish registered vessels under port state control. Of these, no vessels were detained for non-compliance with the requisite international marine safety conventions.</P>
      <P>Last year my Department's surveyors inspected 281 non-Irish registered vessels that had not been inspected in the previous six months under port State control. Of these, 17 were detained for non-compliance with the requisite international marine safety conventions. The monitoring of ships, by regular inspections under port state control, is proving to be an effective measure in encouraging full compliance with international safety standards and the majority of vessels operating into and out of Irish ports are complying with international convention requirements.</P>

      <P>The Government is strongly committed to supporting the vulnerable people of Afghanistan. This support involves the ongoing provision of emergency humanitarian assistance and support for the process of national reconstruction in that country. Ireland has played a key role in ensuring the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan has been kept to the fore alongside the political aspects, including at the UN Security Council. In its ongoing contacts at the UN, within the EU and at other <i>fora</i>, the Government is emphasising that there must be a visible and effective strategy for meeting the needs of more than 5 million people in Afghanistan who still require humanitarian assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The images we have seen of hunger in the Hindu Kush region highlight the urgency of this task. The crisis in the village of Bonawash in the Zarah district at the foot of the Hindu Kush mountains has been addressed jointly by the World Food Programme and the International Rescue Committee. The work of both these organisations is being supported by the Government. WFP carried out an assessment of the level of aid needed in the region and IRC dispatched doctors to provide medical assistance. Donkeys were used to deliver essential supplies across dangerous mountain terrain by workers employed locally. An initial distribution of food <Col N="1599" /> aid took place in the Zarah district on 6 January. Further supplies are being provided to ensure that people will have enough food to survive the harsh winter. WFP are also accessing the most remote highland areas by helicopter in response to acute food shortages.</P>
    <P>During 2001, a total of &euro;5.08 million was provided by the Government in official humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. This commitment was enhanced by an Irish ministerial attendance at the international conference on reconstruction assistance to Afghanistan in Tokyo in January of this year. At this conference I made a pledge of &euro;12 million in reconstruction assistance on behalf of the Irish people. These funds will be made available in the coming three years. This pledge is in addition to our ongoing emergency relief and recovery assistance, which combined with our reconstruction commitments, is likely to see our support to Afghanistan during 2002 exceed that provided last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has taken a strong forward position in the formation of EU policy in relation to the actions of the Government of Zimbabwe which have involved human rights violations and the undermining of democracy in that country. On 11 January 2002, the EU and Zimbabwe met in Brussels for consultations to address the following five areas of concern previously set out by the General Affairs Council on 25 June 2001 &ndash; an end to political violence, an invitation to the EU to support and observe the presidential election on 9-10 March, and the need for a free and fair election, concrete action to protect the freedom of the mass media, independence of the judiciary, and an end to the illegal occupation of properties.</P>
      <P>In particular, the EU asked for an immediate invitation to the EU to observe the presidential election, and for urgent action by Zimbabwe to permit full national and international media coverage of it. The Zimbabwean delegation, which included the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Mudenge, expressed a willingness to go some way towards meeting the EU concerns, which Mr. Mudenge subsequently confirmed in writing. However, serious violations of human rights have continued to occur in the intervening period and little progress has been made in allowing access for international observers and the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequently, the General Affairs Council on 28 January decided to close its consultations with Zimbabwe and implement targeted sanctions if the Government of Zimbabwe prevents the deployment of an EU observation mission start<Col N="1600" /> ing by 3 February 2002, or if it later prevents the mission from operating effectively. Likewise, if the Government of Zimbabwe prevents the international media from having free access to cover the election, or there is a serious deterioration in the situation on the ground, in terms of worsening of the human rights situation or attacks on the opposition, or the election is assessed as not being free and fair.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, an invitation to the EU in its own right to observe the election was not forthcoming by the deadline of 3 February. Zimbabwe has stated that the EU will receive an invitation on 5 or 6 February, but has not specified the date or the conditions under which the mission can deploy. The EU is currently considering its position. While we have a strong interest in ensuring that the presidential election campaign, and the election itself, are independently observed, we must consider whether the imposition of targeted sanctions against Zimbabwe is now necessary, in accordance with the conclusions of the GAC on 28 January.</P>
    <P>Ireland has actively supported the decision of the General Affairs Council to move to the conditional imposition of sanctions against Zimbabwe if it does not take action <i>inter alia</i> to invite the EU to observe the presidential election, to allow full media coverage, to ensure a free and fair election, to do its utmost to halt political violence, and to ensure that the human rights of all Zimbabweans are respected.</P>

[3879/02]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that following a day of talks on Monday last, the Labour Relations Commission issued proposals to resolve the pilots dispute which were accepted by both sides. These proposals involve the appointment of an arbitrator to resolve outstanding issues relating to the changes in work practices with the process to be completed by 25 February 2002 and a facilitator to examine all mechanisms for addressing pilot surplus with the process to be completed by 1 March 2002. The LRC also proposed that the notice of redundancy already issued by Aer Lingus management to pilots be withdrawn and that IMPACT-IALPA withdraw notice of industrial action for 11 February 2002 with no further notice of industrial action to be issued during the process. This was agreed by both Aer Lingus and unions.</P>
      <P>I urge all parties involved in the next few weeks to make every effort to resolve this dispute. It is essential that agreement be reached and that all the remaining changes which are fundamental to the company's survival and the retention of 4,000 jobs can be fully implemented.</P>
      <P>I am informed by Aer Lingus that there has been substantial progress on the survival plan's implementation and the company is on course to meet the financial targets set out in it. Progress has been made on the following key elements &ndash; 25% reduction in capacity which came into effect with the introduction of the winter flight schedules, reduction in staffing &ndash; over 740 staff have left the company since last September and a further 600 will leave within the next two weeks and arrangements for the departure of remaining staff are under way &ndash; extensive work practice and other changes as set out in the survival plan are being implemented, and a number of non-essential assets have been sold. Furthermore, the plan has been assisted by aggressive cost management and by a recovery in volume of sales due to fare promotion initiatives and the upgraded internet facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1602" />In relation to 2001 overall, I expect shortly the company's draft accounts. However, due to the progress on survival plan measures outlined earlier, the results for the year will show an improvement on the projected substantial loss at the operational level in the plan. On top of this, significant exceptional costs arose in 2001 with the result that a large overall loss will arise for the year. The company advises that, as set out in the plan, it does not expect any significant improvement in market conditions before the end of quarter three and at this stage does not see any change in the plan's projections for a loss in 2002.</P>
    <P>While significant progress has been made and a degree of stability has emerged, the company is still in a very vulnerable position due to its strained cash position and weak balance sheet. Considerable management action and initiative will be required in 2002 both to implement the very significant changes envisaged and to continue to meet the revenue and operating targets. External investment is necessary to support the future development of the company and the Government decision in this regard still stands. However, arrangements to give effect to this decision will not be activated pending resolution of the pilots dispute. Considerable progress has been made on the increased staff shareholding in the company and I expect talks to resume on this matter shortly.</P>
    <P>A total of &euro;6,668,770 was paid by the Irish Exchequer to Aer Lingus in December for the four day compensation measures agreed for all EU airlines in respect of the events of 11 September 2001. My Department has formally notified the Commission that we have asked Aer Lingus to provide the relevant figures to the end of December which we are now awaiting. On receipt of that information, I will submit a case to the Commission under the provision agreed at the October Transport Council.</P>

      <P>The responsibility for the free travel scheme rests with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. Under the national development plan, substantial progress is being made in improving public transport services in the main urban areas. Significant improvements have also been made in inter city, commuter and regional public transport services. While progress continues in these areas, it is acknowledged that there remain some transport shortcomings in certain parts of rural Ireland. However, initiatives to address the rural public transport problem are well advanced.</P>
      <P>On 21 January, I announced the names of 19 community transport groups selected by Area Development Management Limited for funding under the rural transport initiative. This initiative aims to promote and support the development of innovative, community based pilot public transport projects in rural areas. An interdepartmental committee on rural public transport, chaired by my Department, is currently developing recommendations for a rural public transport policy. One of the issues being considered by the committee is the operation and availability of rural public transport services in respect of older people-pensioners. I expect to receive the committee's report shortly.</P>

      <Quest>if an area aid application by a person (details supplied) in County Roscommon will be approved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The person named submitted an area aid application which included land that was also claimed by another herdowner. My Department contacted both herdowners to clarify the matter. The person named has responded indicating that he does not have a right to claim the parcels in question, which constitute 6.07 hectares. The person named claimed a total of 34.44 hectares on his 2001 area aid application. When his claim is reduced by the 6.07 hectares on which he was not entitled to claim his entitlement is 28.37 hectares. This represents a difference of 6.07 hectares or 21.40 % between the area claimed and that determined. Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, when the difference is more than 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied. Therefore in this case as the overclaim is greater than 20%, no payment under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme can issue to the person named.</P>
      <P>The person named applied for premium for ten cows under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. Following an examination of his application, it was discovered that the ten animals were sold before the retention period had expired. A formal notification issued to the applicant on 3 December 2001 advising him that, as clause 26 (a) of the terms and conditions of the scheme had been contravened, no payment would issue under suckler cow 2001 scheme. The person named was also advised that he could appeal this decision by contacting my Department within 21 days.</P>

      <P>Due to the foot and mouth alert, it was necessary to put in place additional checks and controls to ensure that applicants complied with the terms and conditions of the 2001 ewe premium scheme. As part <Col N="1607" /> of these checks, letters were issued to a number of applicants, including the person named, who disposed of sheep during the retention period for the 2001 ewe premium scheme. These letters sought details of the numbers and type of sheep in their flocks and the numbers and type disposed of in order to verify compliance with the retention requirement.</P>
      <P>Following correspondence received from the person named, an inspection of his flock was arranged for 24 August 2001. He refused to have his flock inspected and consequently he was deemed ineligible for payment under the terms and conditions of the scheme. He was informed of this decision in writing on 15 October 2001 and was advised that he could appeal the decision to the district livestock inspector at Hynes Buildings, Galway. There is no record of him having done so to date.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for premium for 22 animals under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. Following an examination of his application, it was found that four animals were sold within the retention period. The applicant did not notify the district livestock office of details of suitable replacement animals as is required under clause No. 26 of the terms and conditions of the scheme. A formal notice issued on 30th November 2001 to the person named informing him that the four animals were to be rejected with a resultant penalty to be applied in accordance with clause No. 33 of the said terms and conditions. The person named requested a review of his case on 7th December 2001. He has been in contact with my Department regarding the progress of his appeal and has been informed that his file is now being prepared for submission to the regional officer for a decision.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example in cases where personal funds are exhausted. This is on foot of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) (Amendment) Regulations, 1996, introduced in 1996 and which added Articles 22.3 and 22.4 to the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permitting health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act 1996.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. It is the intention to develop proposals in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the expenditure review, the Ombudsman's report, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I remind the Deputy that funding for the nursing home subvention scheme has increased significantly in recent years. When this Government came to office in 1997, the funding for the scheme was £27.8 million &euro;35.30 million, while £52 million &euro;66.03 million, was made available for 2001 while in 2002, the funding for the scheme has again been substantially increased, amounting to £72 million &euro;91million.</P>

      <P>The provision of community audiology services is a matter in the first instance for the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the health boards. Following the dissolution of the National Rehabilitation Board in June 2000, the responsibility for the provision of community audiology services throughout the regions was assigned initially to the Northern Area Health Board of the ERHA pending each health board taking over direct responsibility for the services within its own region.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Acts, hearing aids are supplied to pre-school and national school children in respect of defects discovered at child health or school health examinations and to adult medical card holders or their dependants who require them. These hearing aids are provided without charge to patients. The cost of hearing aids obtained under private arrangements is a matter between the patient and the supplier of the appliance.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Directive 93/42/EEC concerning general medical devices came into effect throughout the European Union. This directive and related Irish legislation &ndash; S.I. No. 252 of 1994, the European Communities (Medical Devices) Regulations, 1994 &ndash; was put in place to ensure that medical device equipment, including hearing aids and their accessories, is of the highest quality. Issues relating to advertisements of hearing aids on local and national media may be referred to the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland.</P>

      <P>The provision of drug treatment services is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. However, I have been informed that at the end of December 2001 the number of people awaiting methadone treatment in the Eastern Regional Health Authority region was 428. Currently in centres outside the eastern region there are 38 people on waiting lists for methadone treatment. At the end of December 2001 there was a total of 5,865 people on the central treatment list, an increase of more than 800 on the December 2000 figure.</P>
      <P>A new national drugs strategy was published by the Taoiseach in May of last year which contains specific targets and 100 actions. One target of the national drugs strategy is that drug misusers have immediate access to professional assessment and counselling, followed by commencement of treatment as deemed appropriate, not later than one month after assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Methadone Protocol was introduced in October 1998. Since that time 169 general practitioners and 243 pharmacists have joined the <Col N="1616" /> scheme. The participation of these professionals is crucial to the successful operation of the scheme. However, the lack of recruitment of significant additional general practitioners and pharmacists into the methadone protocol was a significant constraint last year. Health board officials are working with the Irish College of General Practitioners to explore ways of encouraging GPs to become more involved in methadone treatment.</P>
    <P>The difficulties which the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health board experience in gaining acceptance for the provision of local drug services are well known and in some instances are severely limiting the capacity to respond to actual need in the areas. Health boards will continue to work to develop effective responses to the problem and I am confident that the implementation of the stategy will have a positive impact on the health and well-being of all those affected by drug misuse.</P>

      <P>In-patient residential psychiatric facilities for persons aged 14-16 are currently provided in the Children's Centres, Court Hall, Dublin, Warrenstown House, Dublin and St. Anne's Children's Centre, Galway. In-patient treatment for persons aged 16-18 is provided in a psychiatric unit or hospital of the adult mental health services. These facilities provide treatment in a therapeutic environment and are not therefore secure in nature.</P>
      <P>The first report of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatric services, published in March 2001, recommends that a total of seven child and adolescent inpatient units for children aged from six to 16 should be developed throughout the country. Five such units are to be developed and funded under the national development plan programme.</P>
      <P>The recently published health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, includes a commitment to the development and expansion of appropriate mental health services for persons aged between 16 and 18 years. A sub-group of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatry is currently examining the provision of psychiatric services for this group.</P>

      <P>People who cannot without undue hardship arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility.</P>
      <P>However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. There are no plans to extend medical card eligibility automatically to include persons with asthma at this time.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;53.33 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Other than for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically entitled to a medical card, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of eligibility was considered in the context of the new national health strategy, Quality and Fairness, A Health System For You, launched by the Government. The strategy outlines a number of measures designed to <Col N="1620" /> improve eligibility for health services which the Government has committed itself to introducing over a number of years. Among the measures proposed is an increase in access to medical cards. In addition to the recent extension of eligibility to all persons aged 70 years and over, the strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low incomes who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability.</P>
    <P>My Department advised the health board chief executive officers in writing last year and again this year that medical card holders should not lose their cards because of increases in social welfare rates announced in the budget.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the responsibility of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Additional funding of &euro;2.971 million was provided to the Eastern Regional Health Authority in 2001 for orthodontic services of which &euro;2.044 million was for an orthodontic initiative in the authority. The chief executive officer of the ERHA has advised me that under the initiative, the Northern Area Health Board has engaged the services of specialist orthodontic practitioners from outside its own area. The board announced in October 2001 that up to 300 patients from its orthodontic treatment waiting list would be treated under these arrangements, beginning last November. The chief executive officer for the ERHA has also informed me that the 2002 budget for orthodontic services in the NAHB is currently being finalised.</P>
      <P>For 2002, my Department has provided additional funding of &euro;0.662 million to the ERHA for orthodontic services of which &euro;0.405 million was for an orthodontic training programme. Four dentists from the authority commenced their training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications last October. Furthermore, my Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Post Graduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officer of the ERHA has also informed me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter, there were 3,776 patients in orthodontic treatment in the area administered by the authority. This is an increase of 488 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the corresponding figure at the end of the September 2001 quarter. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures in the orthodontic initiative take effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national hazardous waste management plan &ndash; NHWMP &ndash; makes recommendations in respect of four main areas: the implementation of a national hazardous waste prevention programme; improved measures for the collection of hazardous wastes from households, small and medium enterprises, agriculture and other sources of &ldquo;unreported&rdquo; hazardous wastes; provision of requisite infrastructure in order to attain national self-sufficiency in relation to the recovery and disposal of hazardous wastes; and identification, risk assessment and, where necessary, remediation of sites where hazardous wastes were disposed of in the past.</P>
      <P>Under section 26 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, relevant public authorities are required to have regard to the plan and, where they consider it appropriate to do so, to take measures to implement or otherwise give effect to, recommendations contained in the plan.</P>
      <P>The NHWMP recommended the establishment of an implementation committee to co-ordinate the overall implementation of the plan and, as indicated in the replies to previous questions on this matter, the establishment of this committee is in hands. I will shortly publish a policy statement on preventing and recycling waste, which will include a major national waste prevention programme, encompassing both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes.</P>
      <P>Improved collection and reception services for hazardous waste from household and commercial sources are already being put in place by local authorities.</P>
      <P>With regard to infrastructure, the NHWMP identifies a requirement for landfill and thermal treatment capacity for hazardous waste requiring disposal, so as to achieve self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on export outlets. A private company has announced proposals to develop a hazardous waste incineration facility at Ringaskiddy, County Cork. As an exceptional measure, having regard to the polluter pays principle, it is intended that grant assistance will be available under the NDP to support the provision of landfill capacity for hazardous wastes.</P>
      <P>The NHWMP outlined a methodology for the identification and risk assessment of closed waste disposal sites. This methodology has since been developed further by the Environmental Protection Agency &ndash; EPA &ndash; and is currently being applied as a pilot project undertaken by Laois County Council. This pilot project will conclude shortly, and is expected to facilitate the development by the EPA of more detailed guidance for local authorities in this matter.</P>

      <P>There is no formal payment such as a clothing grant for adults. Expenses incurred in respect of normal clothing requirements which are of a predictable and recurring nature should be budgeted for out of regular weekly income.</P>
      <P>Legislation governing the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department allows health boards to make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. These payments are known as exceptional needs payments. There is no automatic entitlement to an exceptional needs payment. Exceptional needs payments are made at the discretion of the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>The South-Western Area Health Board was contacted on behalf of the individual in question and has advised that the application for an exceptional needs payment in respect of clothing was refused on the grounds that no exceptional need had been proven. In the opinion of the board the individual's weekly income level was sufficient to cater for normal clothing requirements.</P>
      <P>The board has further advised that when the application for an exceptional needs payment was refused the individual in question was informed of her right to appeal the community welfare officer's decision. To date no appeal has been lodged with the health board appeals officer.</P>

      <P>The income maintenance needs of asylum seekers are met for the most part by health boards who administer the supplementary welfare allowance scheme on behalf of my Department. The scheme provides entitlement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>Where a person has access to some resources either in cash or in kind this is taken into account in determining entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance. This occurs in the case of asylum seekers who are being provided with full board accommodation under the direct provision system operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Where a person in direct provision receives all meals and has access to other facilities such as laundry and leisure areas the recommended weekly allowance is &euro;19.05 per adult and &euro;9.52 per child. Furthermore, as is the case with all persons who are resident in the State where there are other reasonable expenses, exceptional needs payments will be made by the health board.</P>
      <P>At present there are a total of 9,532 supplementary welfare allowance claims in payment in respect of 19,215 asylum seekers. Some 6,386 of these claims, in respect of 14,486 people, refer to asylum seekers who are outside of direct provision. These claimants are in receipt of full rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their respective family size. In addition to the basic allowance there are currently approximately 5,100 rent supplements in payment to these people. There are currently 3,146 supplementary welfare allowance claims in payment in respect of 4,729 people who are in direct provision.</P>
      <P>In addition to the numbers outlined above there are 528 claims for unemployment payments currently in payment to asylum seekers. These claims are in respect of approximately 1,550 people. A small number of asylum seekers are in receipt of other social welfare payments such as one-parent family payments, pensions or disability allowance. Asylum seekers are also entitled to claim child benefit. Details of the numbers involved in these categories are not available.</P>

      <P>All applications for term time in the Department are processed under the centrally agreed arrangements which provide that the operation of the scheme is subject to the operating requirements of the Department not being adversely affected. It follows that, where there are a number of applications from a particular work area, it may be necessary to limit the numbers of staff who can be facilitated in any year. The Department has endeavoured to facilitate as many applicants for term time as is compatible with maintaining an adequate service to the public. Any applications refused have been for business reasons in the particular work area.</P>

As the ewe compensation scheme run by my Department is an alternative, rather than an addition, to REPS, no payment is due to the person in this instance. If the person only joined REPS during 2001 he should write into Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, confirming the date he joined REPS and my staff will examine his claim to see if he is entitled to a payment for the time he was not in REPS.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary role of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner is to investigate each application made for a declaration of refugee status in accordance with the provisions of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act provides for applicants to be interviewed and these are conducted by staff who have received formal training in interviewing for the purposes of the Act. The objective of the inter<Col N="1632" /> view is to provide applicants with the opportunity to fully explain their circumstances and fears in order to determine whether a case for a declaration of refugee status exists based on the grounds contained in section 2 of the Refugee Act 1996.</P>
    <P>At all stages of the process applicants are informed of the entitlement to consult a solicitor-legal representative and of the availability of the refugee legal service, an independent body which provides, for a nominal fee, legal assistance to those applying for a declaration as a refugee. Attendance at interview is determined by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner in advance and is usually confined to the applicant and his-her legal representative and interpreter, if required. The solicitor-legal representative at interview may make representations or comments at the end of the interview, or in writing within seven days of completion of the interview. Where issues such as trauma are considered by applicants to be relevant to their case, it is open to applicants and their legal representatives to submit medical or other evidence in support of their claim prior to or at interview, or within seven working days after the interview. In addition, applicants have access to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which has a number of important statutory rights under the Refugee Act 1996, including the right to be informed of applications and to make representations in relation to such applications.</P>
    <P>In conducting each interview, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner seeks to protect the interests and keep confidential the claim of the applicant, and protect the integrity of the asylum process. Requests from persons who wish to be present at an interview other than applicants' solicitors are considered on a case by case basis having regard to the circumstances of the individual case, the principles outlined above, and the reasons for the request.</P>
    <P>It would not be appropriate for me to comment on individual applications for refugee status having regard to the fact that applications by their nature are made in confidence with the expectation by the applicant that such confidence will be preserved. Any submission made in relation to an application, such as the submission referred to by the Deputy, will be given due consideration by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner in the case in question.</P>

      <P>Shanganagh Castle was opened as a detention centre in 1968 for young male offenders in the 16-21 year age category. The complex consists of the castle, which is mainly the administrative centre, accommodation centre and a block providing education, workshops, gym facilities, etc. Accommodation is provided in a dormitory setting for a maximum of 60 offenders. The regime is open and relaxed with offenders generally receiving 50% remission on the portion of their sentences served there. In addition, offenders are granted periodic weekend temporary release to return home.</P>
      <P>The majority of offenders who are transferred to Shanganagh Castle are initially committed to St. Patrick's Institution as this is the main committal institution for young offenders in the 16-21 year age category. Offenders in Shanganagh are generally either first-time offenders or those who are serving their first custodial sentence for a non-violent offence and are not considered aggressive, intimidatory, or to be actively taking hard drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the very considerable decline in numbers in Shanganagh Castle, the director general of the Irish Prisons Service established a <Col N="1635" /> group to examine its future role in the prison system. The director general has informed me that this group has submitted a draft report whose recommendations are currently being considered. If, after consideration of the final report, it is decided that major changes are required, a three to four month consultation period will ensue before any final decisions are made.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it would be inappropriate for me to comment regarding the future role of Shanganagh Castle in advance of the recommendations of the review group being presented to and considered by the interim prisons board.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that there are some 7,700 asylum applications awaiting final decision in that office. This figure refers to all applications received up to 6 February 2002. Of these nearly 3,400 have been scheduled for interview or have completed the interview process and are awaiting decision.</P>
      <P>The Refugee Appeals Tribunal has informed me that the estimated number of appeals on hands at end January is 2,460. This figure refers to all appeals received up to 31 January 2002.</P>
      <P>It is evident that the increase in processing capacity which has been put in place in both the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal as part of the Government's asylum strategy is making a real impact on the backlog of cases and is helping to progressively reduce processing times. For example, since July 2001 cases scheduled, processed and completed have significantly exceeded intake; over 97% of pre-2001 cases outstanding on or received since 20 November 2000 have now been offered a substantive interview. Thus, from January 2002 the ORAC is focusing on applications submitted in 2001; at 31 December 2001, only some 4,400 applications were on hands for more than six months in the ORAC and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the majority of these are in the final stages of processing; in the ORAC, the number of interviews scheduled for 2001 was more than double the figure for 2000; and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal scheduled 170% more hearings in 2001 as compared with 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made 3,359 deportation orders since the commencement of the Immigration Act, 1999, to <Col N="1636" /> 1 February 2002.

Some 43 persons are known to have left the State before the orders could be effected and 362 removals are in the process of being arranged.

      <P>In accordance with well established Government policy and in order to meet the ongoing requirements to provide accommodation for newly arriving asylum seekers, the reception and integration agency of my Department is continually assessing potential facilities in all areas of the country.

      <P>In recent months, the number of new applications for asylum has, on average, been of the order of 850 per month and the task of providing direct provision accommodation for them is both onerous and ongoing. The construction of a system built facility at the site of the former Cork Airport Hotel, Kinsale Road has already been signalled, and in accordance with Government policy, the construction of similar type facilities in other areas of the State is currently being addressed. Beyond that, I am not in a position at this stage to give further details on the location of these or other planned facilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that no formal application has been received by the advisory committee, established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate CCTV applications, in respect of Castleisland. I can, however, say that I received correspondence from a person in Castleisland in June 1999 requesting a CCTV system for the area. A response issued to this person the following month explaining the procedures that should be followed.</P>
      <P>Applications for Garda CCTV systems must be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda district and divisional officers and receive their full support. Applications may then be considered by the advisory committee who make a recommendation to me in this regard.</P>
      <P>Applications are assessed by the committee on the basis of Garda operational needs and include the following criteria; crime and public order statistics in the area; population and level of activity there; the recommendation of local Garda management and any special circumstances or needs that exist and the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system to that area. Co-funding is a feature of Garda CCTV systems and this is usually addressed when it has been decided to install a Garda CCTV system in an area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that I announced late in 2000 that the number of Garda CCTV systems was to be extended. As part of the first tranche of this expansion, CCTV systems are to be installed in the following areas; Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. It is <Col N="1639" /> intended that these ten CCTV systems will be installed and operational by the end of 2002. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course.</P>
    <P>Tenders have been sought and received in respect of the town centre CCTV systems for Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick. The evaluation process is in its final stages and I hope to announce the awarding of the contracts shortly, after which work will commence immediately to put the systems in place.</P>
    <P>The planning in respect of the town centre CCTV systems for Waterford, Athlone, Tallaght and Clondalkin is well advanced and it is expected that tenders will be invited via the EU Journal and the national newspapers within the next three months.</P>
    <P>I am also conscious that some applications for CCTV systems that have been received by the advisory committee relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided to areas which are not rated as a high level Garda priority. To this end, I plan to introduce a grant scheme soon to cater for those communities who would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. While it will be up to the local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes, grant assistance will be provided.</P>
    <P>To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards will have to be met and the gardaí will have to be allowed access to the system when and as they require it. Local authorities will have an important role to play. The details of this new scheme are currently being finalised and full details of the scheme including relevant conditions and grant levels will be announced soon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The progress in implementing the recommendations of the special review group which published a report on suicide in 1998, in so far as they relate to my Department, provides for the following recommendations in relation to the prison service: that the mentally ill in prison be given appropriate treatment; that a psychiatric service be provided to the prisons and places of detention by visiting psychiatrists and that offenders who, in the opinion of the psychiatrist and the prison medical officer, are in need of in-patient psychiatric treatment may be transferred by ministerial order to either the Central Mental Hospital or a district mental hospital. In practice, all such transfers occur to the Central Mental Hospital.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I published a report of the group to review the structure and organisation of prison health care services in September 2001. This report made 43 recommendations, including a number regarding the provision of psychiatric services to prisoners. These recommendations are currently being pursued with the health boards and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>Improved access to the Central Mental Hospital is also being discussed with the Department of Health and Children and a review has recently concluded on the future service role of the Central Mental Hospital. Particular effort and resources are to be devoted towards addressing the drug dependency problems of prisoners.</P>
      <P>I approved an action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system in 1999 which advocated a broad general approach to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders. This included the expansion of detoxification facilities, more drug free areas and the provision of methadone maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1641" />The director general of the Prison Service then established, at my instigation, a national steering group for prison based drug treatment services with a view to implementing the action plan. The group submitted its first report to me in July, 2000, which recommended the following three pronged strategy: the appointment of a drug treatment co-ordinator for the Dublin prisons; recruitment of drug treatment specialists in the counselling, psychological and medical fields; and a training programme led by an assistant governor to enhance and further professionalise prison officers involved in interpersonal work with drug treatment prisoners.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the recommendations contained in the report were approved, in principle, by Government on 18 October 2000 on the basis that the precise staffing and other expenditure related proposals would be the subject of direct negotiations between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Finance as well as the prison service and health boards. A series of meetings have been held since then and, as a result of these discussions, the recruitment process for the two key central positions identified in the steering group's report, that of the assistant governor in charge of training and the co-ordinator of drug treatment services (prisons) commenced in mid 2001.</P>
    <P>An appointment was made to the assistant governor post on 20 October 2001. While the recruitment of the co-ordinator is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority, I understand that every effort is being made to fill the position at the earliest possible opportunity. Following consultation with the Department of Finance, the Prison Service and my Department have now commenced the recruitment process for the nursing, psychologist and probation and welfare service posts recommended in the steering group's report. Discussions are continuing with the health boards in relation to the recruitment to the positions from their sector identified in the report.</P>
    <P>The provision of methadone maintenance for new committal prisoners already on an approved treatment course in the community has been a key development in the past 18 months. On 25 November 2001 there were 261 prisoners in receipt of methadone maintenance in the prison system as well as a further 57 who were receiving methadone detoxification. Another important initiative has been the opening, in November, 2000, of a designated drug-free wing in St. Patrick's Institution with a capacity for 76 inmates. Building on this successful development, I have issued a direction to the Irish Prison Service to have a designated drug-free area in all institutions under its control within a three year period. A designated drug-free unit is due to open in Wheatfield Prison in the coming months. I also announced recently that the new &ldquo;C&rdquo; wing in Limerick Prison with spaces for 78 prisoners will be designated as a drug-free facility when it is inaugurated in 2003. Medical and caring services <Col N="1642" /> within prisons are to be developed to a level equivalent to similar community services.</P>
    <P>The provision of prison health care personnel and remuneration issues will be reviewed in the context of the report of the group to review the structure and organisation of prison health care services. A process of recruiting nurses for all prisons has been ongoing since 1999. On 5 February 2002 there were a total of 62 qualified nurses employed by the Prison Service. A co-ordinator of prison nursing services was appointed in 2001.</P>
    <P>Support from a range of other services is available to prisoners. These include the probation and welfare service, the chaplaincy service and the Samaritans &ndash; portable phones with a direct line to the Samaritans are available to any prisoner on request.</P>
    <P>Prison officers receive appropriate training in the recognition of and response to suicidal behaviour. This is covered in the induction programme for prison officers. Eight hundred staff have received this training in the last two and a half years. In addition, information packs have been made available to all prisons.</P>
    <P>A number of measures have been introduced in recent years to curtail the smuggling into and use of illegal drugs in the prison system. These include video surveillance, improved visiting and searching facilities, increased vigilance by staff and urine testing. This policy has been further strengthened in Cloverhill, the new remand prison, by the extensive use of screened visits. Where visitors are found attempting to supply drugs to inmates, gardaí are called to the prison. A number of persons have been prosecuted, and some of these prosecutions have resulted in convictions.</P>
    <P>The following recommendations are being made in relation to aftermath and aftercare. Relevant professionals are to be trained in confronting and responding to traumatic situations, in particular how best to communicate bad news. The probation and welfare service has, over the years, included a grief counselling module as an integral part of in-service training for probation and welfare officers. Relevant professionals will be made aware of appropriate steps for distraught relatives should they feel they cannot cope. Senior prison management, senior probation and welfare staff attached to each prison and the chaplaincy service always make themselves available to relatives of deceased prisoners. These professionals are best placed to assist the relatives initially.</P>
    <P>Counselling is to be made available for professionals who may themselves have been traumatised. The prison psychology service is available to all relevant prison staff in the aftermath of a death in custody or similar severe trauma. In addition the Probation and Welfare Service provides appropriate counselling for staff who may have been traumatised.</P>
    <P>I can further inform the Deputy that in May 1999, my Department published the report of the national steering group on deaths in prisons. The <Col N="1643" /> group which was established under the chairmanship of a senior prison governor comprised representatives of the various disciplines involved in the care of prisoners. They had been assigned the task of reviewing and overseeing the implementation of the recommendations of the advisory group on prison deaths published in 1991. The group reported that there are sound policies in place and a high level of awareness among prison staff in relation to suicide awareness. The group also reported that many possible deaths are saved by the alertness and vigilance of staff. Following the publication of its report, I asked the group to continue its monitoring role and it meets on a regular basis. It reviews para-suicides, suicides and provides a forum for collating the reports of the local suicide awareness groups within the institutions and disseminates significant findings and lessons learned through the prison system. The group also organises an annual forum for the suicide awareness groups in each institution.</P>
    <P>The national steering group found that of the 57 recommendations contained in the original 1991 report, 34 were fully implemented and a further 15 were partially implemented. The group also made a further 12 recommendations and identified a number of priority issues.</P>
    <P>Both the director general of the Prison Service and I are fully committed to ensuring that all possible measures are in place to prevent deaths in prisons. The provision of in-cell televisions, as recommended by the national steering group on deaths in prisons, is well in hand and televisions have been installed in the majority of cells. The establishment of a pilot listening scheme in Castlerea Prison is also due to begin shortly. The recommendations from 1991 and 1998 which are not yet fully implemented are under ongoing consideration in relation to the overall development of the Prison Service.</P>
    <P>I am informed that all recommendations, in so far as they relate to the Garda Síochána, have been implemented. I will communicate shortly with the Deputy with regard to the recommendations of the task force concerning firearms.</P>
    <P>In relation to the recommendations on coroners and coroner inquests, the report of the working group on the review of the coroner service, published in December 2000, examined all aspects of the standards of service required for relatives of the deceased, including those bereaved through suicide. It recommended an integrated approach to a wide range of support services including the specific measures set out in the suicide task force report relating to coroner training, information provision for relatives, <Col N="1644" /> courtroom facilities and the need to reduce delays in holding inquests.</P>
    <P>Legislative preparation to give effect to these new support structures is already in progress in my Department and the question of how best to give effect to specific measures in advance of the new legislation is also being closely examined.</P>

      <P>The Solicitors Acts 1954 to 1994 provide for a disciplinary tribunal to deal with complaints of misconduct against solicitors. The tribunal consists of ten solicitor members and five lay members. The lay members are appointed on my nomination. A member of the public or the Law Society may apply to the tribunal for an inquiry into the conduct of a solicitor. In addition to the functions of the tribunal in relation to misconduct, the Solicitors Acts give power to the Law Society to impose sanctions on solicitors for inadequate services or for charging excessive fees.</P>
      <P>A member of the public who is dissatisfied with how the Law Society handles a complaint made to it may refer the matter to the adjudicator appointed under the Solicitors (Adjudicator) Regulations 1997. The adjudicator can require the production of documents and make conclusions of fact and recommendations. He may direct the society to re-examine or re-investigate the related complaint made to it about a solicitor where he is not satisfied that the society has investigated the complaint adequately. He may also direct the society to make an application to the disciplinary tribunal for an inquiry into the conduct of the solicitor on the ground of alleged misconduct.</P>
      <P>While I am aware that individual members of the public do feel aggrieved from time to time, the existing system for dealing with complaints against members of the legal profession appears to operate in a generally satisfactory manner. However, amendments which I have tabled to the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, 1998, which is at Committee Stage in the Dáil having been passed by the Seanad, will make the disciplinary regime for solicitors more effective in a number of respects.</P>

      <P>Students with special needs up to the age of 18 years have a constitutional entitlement to special education services to enable them to reach their potential.</P>
      <P>Students who have been assessed as having the disabilities referred to by the Deputy have access to a variety of special support services. The services range from special schools dedicated to particular disability groups, special classes/units attached to mainstream schools and placement on an integrated basis in mainstream schools with special back-up supports.</P>
      <P>A classroom teacher and two special needs assistants are allocated for each group of up to six pupils with autism or severe/profound general learning disability. Additional special needs assistant support may be provided depending on the student's assessed need. These groupings also attract special rates of capitation funding and are entitled to avail of the special school transport service and the school bus escort service. The school year also extends through the month of July for each of these disability groups.</P>
      <P>The organisation of this support within the school setting is a matter for the management of the school, having considered the needs of each individual pupil. The advice of my Department's inspectorate is available to schools when arranging these supports if required.</P>
      <P>Special needs assistants are provided specifically to assist in the care of pupils with disabilities. The allocation of special needs assistant posts is based on the assessed level of need of each pupil. These posts are allocated either on a full-or part-time basis across a range of disabilities. There are currently in excess of 3,000 special needs assistant posts, including full-time equivalents, in place at primary level. Their duties are of a non-teaching nature. Individual pupils with a general learning disability would not typically require the services of a special needs assistant. Pupils assessed as requiring additional academic input may benefit from learning support or resource teaching provision and it is open to schools to apply to my Department for such support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level insti<Col N="1655" /> tutions: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework for the higher education grants schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. It is the local authorities which, on behalf of my Department, administer the schemes, which are reviewed annually by my Department. The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered, on behalf of my Department, by the vocational education committees. All three schemes have broadly similar provisions, relating, for example, to age, residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
      <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy. If an individual applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she or he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
      <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. It is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases. Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance/access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial sup<Col N="1656" /> port to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from &euro;2.49 million (£1.964 million) in respect of the 2000/01 academic year to &euro;7.49 million (£5.9 million) in respect of the 2001/02 academic year.</P>

      <P>The allocation for post primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;182.31 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates the Government's commitment to improving the accommodation situation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997.</P>
      <P>Due to the greatly increased level of investment in the post primary buildings area since the Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
      <P>I would like to clarify the position for the Deputy. The board of management of Tullow community school did not receive any instructions regarding the appointment of a design team. As community schools are in the direct ownership of the State, my Department is the client in respect of building projects in community schools, and so appoints design teams directly for building projects in community schools.</P>
