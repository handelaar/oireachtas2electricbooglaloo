    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1 to 20, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>On 4 June I met the President of Latvia, Dr. Vike-Freiberga, during her State visit to Ireland. We noted the excellent bilateral relations which Ireland and Latvia enjoy and expressed the wish to see these develop even further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulated the President on the speed of political and economic progress in Latvia in recent years. I congratulated her, in particular, on the progress of Latvia's European Union <Col N="951" /> accession negotiations. I pointed out that the Irish Government is strongly committed to the enlargement process and the ratification of the Nice treaty before the end of 2002 to allow enlargement to take place on schedule. I offered the President our advice and any practical assistance necessary towards facilitating a smooth integration process.</P>
    <P>President Vike-Freiberga expressed her thanks for Ireland's continuing support in their accession negotiations. Latvia is facing an unprecedented rate of economic and political change while at the same time adjusting to independence. They are looking to Ireland as an example of what can be accomplished by a small country.</P>
    <P>On 18 June I met the President of Slovenia, Milan Kucan. The principal purpose of the President's visit was to address the National Forum on Europe in Dublin Castle later that day. Slovenia has recently opened a resident embassy in Dublin and the President was accompanied by Ambassador Helena Zorko who presented her credentials to President McAleese during the visit. The President and I discussed the excellent bilateral relations between Ireland and Slovenia . I welcomed the establishment of the Slovenian Embassy in Dublin which would help enhance these relations.</P>
    <P>I thanked the President for agreeing to share his views on enlargement with the National Forum on Europe. I congratulated him on Slovenia being one of the leading candidates in the accession negotiations and said we looked forward to welcoming Slovenia as a member in 2004.</P>
    <P>The President and I also discussed the participation of the candidate countries in the convention on the future of Europe. I welcomed, in particular, the recent election of Slovenian parliamentarian, Mr. Peterle as the representative of the candidate countries on the Praesidium.</P>
    <P>I met Prime Minister Aznar of Spain as part of his pre-Seville European Council tour of capitals on 7 June. I also travelled to Sweden and Finland on 12 June and to Italy and Austria on 19 June for bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Persson, Prime Minister Lipponen, Prime Minister Berlusconi and Chancellor Schuessel respectively. All of these meetings were highly productive. Not only were they excellent preparation for the Seville European Council, they were also highly positive in further developing bilateral relations in advance of Ireland's forthcoming Presidency of the European Union in 2004. As the House is aware, this afternoon there will be a question and answer session regarding all aspects of the preparations for, and attendance at, the Seville European Council. This question and answer session is a signal of the Government's intention to foster greater debate within the Dáil on EU issues.</P>
    <P>With regard to my travel plans for the rest of the year, I propose to attend the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in early September, the ASEM Summit from 22 to <Col N="952" /> 24 September in Copenhagen, the informal European Council in Brussels on 24 and 25 October and the European Council in Copenhagen on 14 and 15 December. A wider travel programme that will take account of Ireland's forthcoming Presidency of the European Union in 2004 is being considered for next year.</P>
    <P>The National Forum on Europe, which is an independent body, has taken extensive steps to promote public awareness of its work. I commend its chairman, Senator Maurice Hayes, for the role he has played in advancing the work of the forum and the thorough manner in which he has represented the views of the forum's participants in both of his reports to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply. I note he has put in considerable effort in meeting leaders of different European countries and visiting different European neutral capitals in order to promote Ireland's interest in securing a successful outcome, as he sees it, in a second referendum. Against that background, is he intent on losing the second referendum? Will he explain to the House the reason he denigrated Irish citizens who happen to have a different point of view to his own?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter does not arise on this question. As the Deputy is aware, many questions were ruled out of order because the issue of the Seville Summit will be debated later this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will repeat what I said. Is it the Taoiseach's intention to lose the referendum as a result of the comments he made in Seville? What explanation does he have for making them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter does not arise at this time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may well disagree, but the Chair has ruled on the matter. As the Deputy is aware, the Chair ruled out questions related to the Seville Summit because the matter will be the subject of discussion later this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any reason for not publishing the referendum Bill until Thursday?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. I would like to ask the Taoiseach about something that most definitely does arise. Did he tell any of the EU leaders or any of the many media people he met that, if the Irish people had not rejected Declar<Col N="953" /> ation No. 20 of the Nice treaty, setting out EU enlargement&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I again draw the Deputy's attention to the point I made to Deputy Quinn. The Seville Summit will be the subject of discussion later in the House. The Chair has ruled that questions are not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a question about the Spanish Prime Minister. May I ask it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Chair has told Members that questions on this subject were ruled out of order, I ask the Deputy to move on to some other aspect of the 20 questions tabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Question No. 9, in his meeting with the Spanish Prime Minister, did the Taoiseach mention that the Irish people had not at any time rejected enlargement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, the Deputy is&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 9 is one of the questions to which you refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, perhaps it would be more orderly to move on to the next batch of questions since you are not going to allow either Deputy Sargent or I &ndash; and I suspect other colleagues &ndash; to ask supplementary questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be an opportunity later to raise those questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a very limited opportunity later to have some Members of the House&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There will still be an opportunity and the orders with long-standing precedent&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, I object to the ruling you are making. While I respect it, I object to it. You are unnecessarily curtailing debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct. The long-standing precedent in the House is that if something will be the subject of discussion later, questions are ruled out of order. Questions were submitted on the specific points the Deputy is making and ruled out of order because they anticipated the debate later this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They may have been ruled out of order, but since when does that ruling extend to supplementary questions? On occasion we have had linked supplementary questions of a most elastic kind over which the Ceann Comhairle presided&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot ask <Col N="954" /> supplementary questions linked to questions ruled out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Ceann Comhairle well if this is the kind of debate we are to have on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure why the Chair has ruled Question No. 9 out of order. In his reply the Taoiseach talked about the World Summit on Sustainable Development. Did he raise the matter of the Kyoto Protocol coming into force this year? He has referred to this as a priority in the &ldquo;Ireland and the EU&rdquo; report which he issued in April. Did he have any further discussions on the directive on emissions trading, which is planned to begin on a pilot basis for CO2 emissions by 2005? That will have more wide-ranging effects on Ireland than any question of enlargement. Has it been to the forefront of the Taoiseach's mind given that he may be distracted by other matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's policy on the matter is outlined in the national climate strategy document which was recently published. I have had a number of brief discussions on the issue. As Deputy Sargent is aware, European countries are very anxious to make as much progress as possible at Johannesburg and adopt as unified an approach as they can. While there has been a breakdown in other areas, there is a committed effort by European leaders to make as much progress as possible. In recent months we signed up to the ratification process on the Kyoto Protocol. Between now and the Johannesburg Summit I will be lending Ireland's support to try to ensure it is a successful one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach discuss Declaration No. 20 with the Prime Minister of Spain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said our ratification process had already been passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In what way does the Taoiseach intend to promote public awareness of the recently published report on the second phase of the work of the National Forum on Europe? In referring to the second phase of the work of the forum, did the Taoiseach recently say leaders from candidate countries had come to forum to take on the opponents of the Nice treaty and, to use his words, buried the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am following the Chair's initial ruling and have been at pains to be in order. That is the reason I referred to Question No. 4, which relates to the Taoiseach's ways of promoting public awareness of the second phase of the work of the forum. I seek clarification from the Taoiseach on whether his remarks, in which he insulted the people who attended the forum and were opponents of the Nice treaty, form part <Col N="955" /> of his strategy to publicise the treaty? Did he say leaders from applicant countries had left the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side speechless other than to go on whinging about their side of the argument? I will not ask him to clarify the riddle of how somebody can be speechless while whinging. Perhaps they are using sign language. In his inaugural address to the forum he said its purpose was to inform and enlighten.</P>

      <P>I think I am in order. Will the Taoiseach say he saw the forum as a propaganda tool for the Government's side of the argument and that his words constituted an insult, not just to those arguing against the treaty but to those who voted against its ratification?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Forum for Europe is an independent body. It has taken extensive steps to promote public awareness of its work. I will do all I can to assist the chairman and all the members of the forum to ensure its work is highlighted. Deputy Higgins knows that I have said here on several occasions that I appreciate the work of everybody, including the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side in the forum. However, I do not appreciate the fact that people ignore the leaders and senior figures of other countries who come here and represent the case of their people and strongly articulate their views on why they want the Nice treaty passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that that happened because there was no one at the forum arguing to keep out any of the applicant countries and the discussion at the forum was about the substantive content of the Nice treaty which the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side argued was not necessary for enlargement? The Taoiseach's comments, therefore, were totally gratuitous and without foundation. The Taoiseach should clarify that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy says. I do not want to get into an argument about the matter. When a leader or a prominent figure of another country comes to a forum here at our invitation and articulates to the best of his or her ability the position of his or her people and answers questions in a comprehensive way and with a democratic mandate, I do not accept that someone here should try to tell him or her what his or her country should believe. That argument does not hold. I said that at the weekend and I will say it in the future. If I am abroad, <Col N="956" /> I will make the case for the Irish people to the best of my ability. I do not agree that someone here could suggest we know the case better. Deputy Higgins or others might believe they know the will of the people in other countries better than they do. He is entitled to that view, but I do not accept it.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has arisen because the Taoiseach branded everyone who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; a whinger. Given that the Taoiseach has now said he is prepared to assist the chairman and the forum with its work, will he consider withdrawing that remark in view of the fact that the many people who voted against the Nice treaty did not do so because of issues related to the treaty <i>per se</i> but because of difficulties with the interpretation and legal implementation of directives and regulations by the Government? Will the Taoiseach recognise that they voted against it because of legitimate concerns? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises from the Taoiseach's comment that he was prepared to assist the chairman and the forum in its work.</P>
      <P>The President of the European Commission recently suggested that the Commission should be divided into two tiers with the top tier controlling all the major portfolios. Does the Taoiseach agree that if such a recommendation was put on the table it would be completely contrary to the spirit of all European Union treaties? Will he give the House and the country an assurance that if that happens, he will oppose it vehemently? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I advocated from the start that the National Forum for Europe address the legitimate concerns of the people. Research and political judgment have shown that the forum is engaged in that. Deputy Kenny will appreciate that I cannot withdraw a remark I did not make. I made absolutely no comment whatsoever about the &ldquo;No&rdquo; voters. In my remarks, as Deputy Higgins has correctly pointed out, as reported on the tape played back by RTE yesterday morning rather than what I was reported as having said in the morning newspapers, I was not at all disparaging about any &ldquo;No&rdquo; voter&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I already explained to Deputy Higgins, my remarks were aimed at people who did not accept an argument made by leaders of other states and just ignored their comments. I do not withdraw that remark because that is my view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Mr. Prodi's suggestions, they were not part of the summit and were not therefore out of order. He advanced them as a personal view upon the possible future direction of <Col N="957" /> the European Union. To reiterate and agree with the point made by Deputy Kenny, the position on the make-up of the Commission or the titles of the Commission is set out in the treaties and there are none other than that. They are the ones I support.</P>

      <P>Possibly one of the major events with serious implications for peace are reports that the US Central Intelligence Agency intends to assassinate President Saddam Hussein. Given the consequences of such an action, I ask the Taoiseach if, in the context of peace and stability in Europe and beyond, this matter was raised by the Heads of State at the summit in Seville?</P>

      <P>That is on the content of Seville. I am talking about the visits to Finland and Sweden, and whether, in the course of those visits, the Taoiseach introduced to the Prime Ministers of those countries the texts of declarations that Members of this House were not afforded sight of? Is it the case, in fact, that the <Col N="958" /> leader of one of the parties in this House did have sight of them and yet other parties were completely ignored? It is absolutely shameful that that would be the case, and I would like the Taoiseach to clarify the position for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I discussed the declarations in their draft form with the neutral countries in particular because these are matters of constitutional interest to them also. It was work in progress until we had signed off fully on the declarations, and it would have been inappropriate for me to be circulating draft regulations until I had completed my discussions. My purpose was to get the other 14 countries, the legal secretariat and the Commission to agree to these which was successfully achieved. I was actually urged in this House to ensure that I spoke to as many countries as I could, which I did. When presidencies visit this country to consult with us about preparatory work for any Council of Ministers meeting, as they have done over the past 30 years, they do not circulate their documentation, either to us or to their national parliaments.</P>

What views did the president express on the position of Slovenia in the European Union? Was any request made to the Government on the Slovenian position? Did the Taoiseach give any response to Slovenia's request to join the Union? If so, was there any discussion on the best means by which the request could be accommodated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussions with the President of Slovenia centred on the work done by Slovenia over the past years, including the preparatory work on which we have helped. As with many applicant countries, Irish officials provided help. The president outlined the work done and what Slovenia has achieved. We also discussed in detail the outstanding chapters for Slovenia, of which I understand there are four, and some of the issues pertinent to them. I understand the <Col N="959" /> president made reference to some of them in his public statements.</P>
      <P>Discussions also centred on our experience of aspects on which they wish to best handle their negotiations. We offered to exchange information on this, but it will be another matter if it is taken up. The experience gained from the work done by our officials with them has proved very useful. Over the coming months a number of issues will arise where they will need our assistance, which will be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>The president outlined some concerns about progress Slovenia must make within a short time. This includes a heavy legislative agenda. While the output of the Dáil compares well to that of other national parliaments, the pressure on the applicant countries to reform their systems places extraordinary demands on their legislative programmes. I discussed that in detail with the president. His main concerns are to complete the work programme and ensuring that the legislation that has been enacted can be implemented at administrative level. We can help in that regard.</P>

That is the message from them all, without exception.</P>

      <P>I hope I will be in order this time.I have a question for the Taoiseach in respect of Questions Nos. 14 and 15 regarding the matters discussed and the conclusions reached in his meeting with political leaders on his visits to Sweden and Finland.</P>
      <P>Did he discuss the Treaty of Nice or the declaration, which he had in draft form? Was he asked by the leaders of those two countries whether other aspects of concern expressed by so-called whingers, as the Taoiseach described them, about the democratic deficit and other perceptions of weakness in our relationship with the European Union were raised by them or alternatively alluded to or referred to by him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did he explain while visiting Helsinki or Stockholm that he was there not just to get their support for the draft declaration, but also to confirm with them that he was confident that the second referendum would be successful? Was he asked by them what steps, in addition to the draft declaration with which they were being presented, he intended to take and did he have a broad discussion with them about the prospects for a suc<Col N="960" /> cessful outcome, as he sees it, to the Nice referendum?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; is the answer to the questions regarding both those meetings. In all the meetings I had broad discussions and outlined what happened last year in the referendum and what had happened since then. I think I gave a good outline of what has happened in the National Forum on Europe and indicated the procedures being taken to change our own examination of European matters. I explained what we wish to achieve in the declaration and went through some of the other arguments that have been thrown up by research and how we propose to address them.</P>
      <P>To restate what I said earlier, I have already clarified for the House on two occasions where my remarks were directed and that they were not directed at individuals in society; they were at one particular point. I went through where I thought we had a job to convince, persuade and try to win over support for the issues of enlargement and the other important issues that are set out in the declaration. I also went on to discuss other issues that are on the agenda in Europe and talked about the issues ahead for the Danish Presidency, particularly issues regarding the European convention. A number of those issues are of enormous importance to the neutral and non-aligned countries. I think I had a good exchange of views with my colleagues on those issues and got an understanding and supportive view from these countries regarding what we are trying to achieve and they outlined to me their concerns. Perhaps on another day we will talk about the convention as there are many issues in it that are important and on which we can work together, particularly the neutral countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the leaders of Finland and Sweden ask the Taoiseach if the content of the draft declaration had been tested in terms of market research to see if, subject to it being accepted in Seville, it would meet with approval from the majority of the electorate in view of the fact that both of those countries are neutral?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they did not ask me those questions. Frankly, they were both very supportive of what we had achieved. They had their own debates and arguments about these issues and, as I pointed out and as has been pointed out generally, they see this as an advantage for them as well because it clarifies the position for them as much as anything else. However, all of them made it absolutely clear that they see&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, because it clarifies that there is nothing in the treaties that in any <Col N="961" /> way affects the status of neutrality and that is of benefit to them. I subsequently heard Malta and others say that it is of benefit to them because it clarifies, beyond all doubt, that military neutrality is not affected anywhere in any of the treaties. That is of benefit to any non-aligned country and that is why they can support it.</P>

      <P>In the context of Question No. 10, given the nature of international contact about comments made by heads of state and the background of the escalating violence in the Middle East and given the announcement yesterday by President Bush that his peace initiative depends on a Palestinian change of leadership, will the Taoiseach say if advance notice of this comment or statement was given to any of the heads of government in Europe and was there any discussion or any comment among the heads of government about this matter, or is this a unilateral statement by the American President?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to this. In the conclusions of the Seville Summit there was a very strong declaration on the Middle East which spells out the concerns of Europe. The first paragraph alone states:</P>
      <P>The crisis in the Middle East has reached a dramatic turning point. Further escalation will render the situation uncontrollable. The parties on their own cannot find a solution. There is an urgent need for political action by the whole international community. The Quartet has a key role to play in starting a peace process.</P>
      <P>There was considerable discussion, both among Foreign Ministers on the European Council and the heads of states, on that strong useful declaration.</P>
      <P>On the second question, there was no warning or discussion. The matter raised by the American President was not anticipated and therefore comments were not anticipated at that stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I reiterate what I have said in the House on many occasions, that I respect the right of the Palestinian people to pick their leader. I have made many supportive comments here about President Arafat and have met him many times. Picking a leader is a matter for the Palestinian people and not for anybody else. However, it is a matter for the President to give his assessment. He has people on the ground giving his assessment, but it has not changed my position.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 to 25, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated in the Dáil previously, it is my intention to hold a referendum in the autumn to allow for the ratification of the Nice treaty. At this point there are no other referendums planned for this year.</P>
      <P>To date, a number of the recommendations made by the all-party committee on the Constitution have been acted upon. The more important recommendations in its sixth report in respect of the Referendum Commission and local government have also been implemented. The committee's recommendation in relation to the abolition of reference to the death penalty in the Constitution was put to the people on 7 June 2001 and passed, with the establishment of the International Criminal Court on the same day.</P>
      <P>Deputies will also be aware that the fourth report of the committee &ndash; the courts and the Judiciary &ndash; recommended the establishment of a judicial council. It was hoped to include this serious issue in the referendum to be held on 7 June last year. However, it was not possible to get all-party agreement on the matter.</P>
      <P>With regard to the seventh report of the committee and the recommendations regarding participation by Northern Ireland representatives in the Oireachtas, I will be asking the Government Chief Whip to initiate discussions with the parties as appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Government no longer intend to proceed with what was previously <Col N="964" /> referred to as the judicial misconduct amendment to the Constitution and is it the case that the Government has no proposals in respect of this arising from what appears to be an abuse of judges' authority and influence in relation to the O'Flaherty affair? Is that a correct interpretation of the Government's current political position?</P>

      <P>I made a point previously which I will now restate in the new Dáil. The last Government did an enormous amount of work on the matter and tried to bring it to a stage where we thought we could progress it. There it rests. If it is possible to secure agreement or find a suitable way to move forward, I will be very happy to do so. The matter stands where it stood a year ago. While much work has been done, there is no agreement. If we make progress on the issue, we can try to move it forward.</P>

      <P>In respect of Question No. 22, does the Taoiseach expect a decision to be taken soon on the expected second referendum to enshrine neutrality in the Constitution, as referred to in media reports? If so, how soon? Second, is any consideration being given to a constitutional amendment on the right to education for people with disabilities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I have three questions for the Taoiseach. First, will he clarify that there is no intention of holding a referendum on the insertion into the Constitution of a definition of neutrality? Second, following the defeat of the referendum on the Nice treaty last year, the Government carried out qualitative research on the reasons people voted against the proposal. Is it intended to make the findings of that research available to parties in the House?</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach will be aware, a number of years ago an amendment was passed to allow for changes in the composition of university representation in Seanad Éireann. Given the number of new universities and other institutions that have since grown up, is it intended that this amendment be given effect by the introduction of appropriate legislation?</P>

      <P>It is a matter that can be considered. A number of studies concerning the reasons people voted against the Nice treaty have been carried out, but the most comprehensive research was done by the European Union and the European Commission office. The eurobarometer is in the public domain. Other research has been done, but I suggest that the Deputy put down a parliamentary question on that matter to the relevant Minister. The Government's proposals on the first matter will be published shortly.</P>

      <P>In Question No. 25 I asked what action the Taoiseach's Department has taken, or will take, in implementing the recommendations of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. In his response the Taoiseach indicated that he is referring the matter to the Chief Whip in order to initiate contact with the various parties. Can the Taoiseach clarify whether he has embraced all the recommendations of the committee? If not, is it the Government's intention to press ahead with the recommendations? Will the Taoiseach clarify for the House the recommendations he is prepared to accept and those with which he has a difficulty? How soon will contact with the parties be initiated? Will the parties contacted be those represented in the Oireachtas and in the Assembly in Belfast?</P>
      <P>In earlier questions there was mention of other referenda planned during the course of the year. I hope that if the Taoiseach is considering a referendum to enshrine neutrality in the Constitution, which I urge him to do, he will consider the details of the Bill I put before the House last year. I commend this Bill to the Taoiseach if he is considering texts at this time.</P>

      <P>An excellent report was produced by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution concerning the Good Friday Agreement and the establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council and the implementation bodies. It was recommended that a mechanism be put in place to allow representatives from Northern Ireland to contribute appropriately to debates in <Col N="966" /> the Oireachtas on Northern Ireland, the Agreement and other matters. Work on the report is progressing.</P>
      <P>I made a statement supporting these recommendations and they also have the support of representatives from all sides of the House. They now need to be considered within the political system of the House and to this end I have asked the Government Chief Whip to initiate discussions with all the other parties. The report is very detailed and sets out arguments and recommendations. I have no difficulty with any of the recommendations, but it is now a matter of making progress.</P>
      <P>It is also a matter of how we can bring forward a set of proposals agreed by the Whips and leaders in the House which can be incorporated into our rules and Standing Orders in future.

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if income tax receipts in 2001 fell short of his budget estimate; if income tax receipts to date in 2002 are falling short of forecast; and the reason for the deviation.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14617/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Income tax receipts in 2001 were &euro;9.347 billion compared with a 2001 budget target of &euro;9.879 billion, a shortfall of &euro;532 million. Like all taxes, income tax is affected by the level of activity in the economy. The 2001 budget target for taxes was predicated on a forecast for economic growth of 8.8% in 2001. Preliminary results from the Central Statistics Office suggest that GDP grew by just 5.9% in 2001. Allied to the lower than expected growth in 2001, employment growth was lower at 49,000 rather than the 60,000 estimated at budget time.</P>
      <P>A number of other factors also had a negative impact on income tax receipts in 2001. The Finance Act, 2001, introduced income tax measures additional to those proposed on budget day. These measures included the special savings investment account scheme and cost approximately &euro;135 million in 2001, of which &euro;71 million was accounted for by the SSIA scheme. In addition, the income tax package included in the budget for 2001 had of necessity to be costed on the basis of the latest information then available, which was from December 2000. Subsequent revisions to that information added &euro;160 million to the cost of the tax package in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income tax in 2002 to date is down 14.7% on <Col N="967" /> last year, compared with a budget target of an increase of 1.1% for the whole year. It is relevant to note that in making this comparison we are comparing five months last year when the economy was growing strongly with five months this year when the economy has been relatively weak. Income tax receipts increased by 9.3% during the first five months of 2001 whereas they fell by 2.1% in the remaining seven months of that year. The change to a calendar year basis means that the first five months of 2002 have had to absorb the income tax changes from the budgets for 2001 and 2002. Payments into SSIAs are made from income tax. No payment was paid for SSIAs in the period January to May 2001 as the first payment was made in June 2001. In contrast, &euro;125 million has been paid out for the same period this year.</P>
    <P>From June 2002 onwards most of the distortions caused by the changes to the income tax year will be washed out of the system. On this basis and in line with the pattern in the general economy, income tax receipts should recover over the remainder of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister not know when drawing up the estimate of income tax receipts for 2002 that there was a strong first half in 2001 which should have been built into the estimate? Does he agree that average income this year rose by 8% and average employment by 1% which means he should expect an increase in taxation? Clearly, something has gone wrong with the Department's capacity to forecast income tax receipts and the Minister appears to be covering it up.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister publish his revised budget outturn for the year in order that we can see the basis on which he is planning? Does he agree that, if as he suggests income tax receipts will be on target this year, they will have to grow in the second half of the year by 20%, 20 times the level of growth he projected for the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question is in two halves. One relates to the 2001 shortfall and the other to 2002. I have pointed out that there are distorting factors in the first five months of the year compared with 2001. Tax receipts under some headings are ahead of target for this year, although it is true to say income tax receipts are below what was expected at this stage. Tax receipts will increase in some areas and decrease in others. Certain factors led to the extraordinary receipts for the early part of 2001, but the rest of the year showed a decline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expected growth in GDP for this year, which I announced in the previous budget as being of the order of 3.9%, is built into the estimate for tax receipts. The expected growth is predicated upon the first half of the year showing slow economic growth leading to a bounce in the second half, given the usual caveat of the world economy picking up. It is correct to point out that income tax <Col N="968" /> receipts are likely to be lower than the amounts budgeted for, but receipts under headings other than income tax, such as VAT, will be higher than expected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The figure required by the EU refers to the general Government balance. The expected general Government balance at budget time has been revised downwards because, as explained at that stage and in subsequent replies to parliamentary questions, questions were raised about some of the items we were carrying with regard to income <i>vis-à-vis</i> the general Government balance. I refer here, for example, to the treatment of transfers from the Central Bank. The position has been clarified by EUROSTAT in recent weeks and that means there has been a downward revision in the GGB balance, as expected at budget time. However, there will still be a surplus.</P>

      <P>During the Committee Stage debate on the Finance Bill, 2001, under which this scheme was introduced, I indicated that it was very difficult to estimate the cost, that it was new and that the size of the Exchequer contribution would depend on the take-up. In reply to a query from Deputy Jim Mitchell in that debate I stated that if all 1.7 million customers over the age of 18 saved the maximum allowable amount of money, £200, the cost to the State would be £1 billion each year. I then indicated, purely for illustration, that if everybody over 18 contributed £150 on average per annum to the scheme, the annual cost to the Exchequer would be £105 million. I indicated that, because of the variables, it was not possible to forecast with any certainty what would be the Exchequer contribution to the scheme.</P>
      <P>In discussions concerning a parliamentary question in February 2001, I noted that it would be a difficult mathematical exercise to work out what would be the tax loss to the Exchequer. I also noted that there was no great empirical evidence concerning, for example, the numbers taking up the scheme and that our best estimate of the cost involved was &euro;127 million in a full year. However, I pointed out that this would depend on the uptake. I also indicated that I would not like to be held to the figure because the more successful the scheme proved to be the more costly it would become.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I pointed out in reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Michael D. Higgins in June 2001 that, although a tentative estimate for the full year cost of the scheme was &euro;127 million, the take-up throughout might be <Col N="971" /> extremely strong and that the cost might have to be revised upwards. I again pointed out that the more successful the scheme, the more relief it would entail.</P>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question in April 2002, I indicated that there could be a potential full-year cost of approximately &euro;300 million. However, I noted that the figure for March, which formed part of that estimate, was preliminary, that the figure for April was not available and that my Department would be assessing the potential cost in light of the information available in the middle of May after the scheme closed.</P>
    <P>In replying to a plethora of parliamentary questions tabled to me on many occasions I stated that the more successful the scheme, the more it would cost. I also stated that the more attractive the scheme, the better it would prove to be. That remains my contention.</P>

      <P>Without bamboozling people with figures, is it not true that, when this scheme was being devised and proposed by the Minister, he informed the House, on 20 February 2001 and 17 May 2001, that his best estimate both of the cost of the scheme and of the likely uptake was of the order of &euro;127 million? Is it not correct that he predicated this figure as being the cost to the Exchequer? Did the Minister receive a briefing note on 2 February last year which included two tables of possible costs to the State? Is it not correct that, at that stage and in light of those tables provided by the Department of Finance, it was indicated to the Minister that the cost of the scheme, if people were to invest £200 or  &euro;254 per month, would be of the order of &euro;421 million? Why, after he had been informed in February 2001 that the likely cost of the scheme that he subsequently launched would be &euro;421 million per annum, did he twice tell the House that his best guess was that it would cost &euro;127 million?</P>

      <Quest>the procedure for re-evaluating the benefit of capital projects in instances where significant cost overruns on costings at the time of the original approval are identified; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the principles underlying the strategic management initiative, my Department has been pursuing an active policy of maximum delegation to Departments for some time. In relation to large capital programmes, therefore, responsibility for individual projects is generally delegated to the relevant Department. The role of my Department is to set out a clear framework in relation to the management of capital investment.</P>
      <P>In managing capital projects Departments are required to comply with my Department's guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure proposals in the public sector. These guidelines set out four main stages of project appraisal and management. The appraisal stage aims to provide a basis for a decision on whether to approve a project in principle. This stage includes an assessment of uncertainty and risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning stage involves the establishment of a project management structure, preparation of a design brief, detailed planning and design of the project and a review of costings. If changes are proposed to the project in the course of the planning stage, the guidelines make it clear that the cost implications should be fully appraised and the approval of the sanctioning authority sought before proceeding. On receipt of a tender price and other relevant information, the case for proceeding with the proposal is again subject to review. Where it is proposed, following such reappraisal, to go ahead with a project at a price higher than that originally proposed, a decision <Col N="973" /> will again be required by the sanctioning authority to proceed.</P>
    <P>The implementation stage begins once the final approval for the award of a contract has been secured. If adverse developments occur, including unforeseen cost increases, which call into question the desirability or viability of the project, the sponsoring agency should consider necessary measures to rectify the situation. Where, despite these measures, increased costs are likely to arise, the approval of the sanctioning authority for the extra expenditure has to be obtained before any commitment is made to accept cost increases. The viability of the project given the changed circumstances should also be reported on.</P>
    <P>Following the completion of a project, the final stage is post-project review. Such a review is recommended to evaluate both the project outturn and the effectiveness of appraisal and management procedures. I am confident the steps outlined in the guidelines provide sufficient guidance for the re-evaluation of projects at key points in the decision making process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I ask this question is that there is a widespread perception, with which I am sure the Minister will agree as he has done in the past, that the Government has not been capable of delivering results, despite spending enormous amounts of money. Has the Minister received requests for the approval of cost increases in respect of significant capital projects? For example, the Luas light rail project has run over the original cost by 250%. Have the cost overruns in any of these projects caused the Minister to reconsider whether the benefit is worth the cost? Given the huge cost increases, have any projects been dropped from the NDP as a result of the procedure he has outlined because they no longer represent value for money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Once a project commences, it continues until it is completed. The post-project review then comes into play. This is the stage at which the assessment takes place. As I pointed out, if, at any point during the appraisal stage of a project right through to implementation stage, the Department considers that the costs outweigh the benefits, the project will be abandoned. However, as I also pointed out, it has been the practice since 1994 or even before to delegate more responsibility to Departments &ndash; rightly &ndash; rather than have everything approved by the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>While the Deputy is correct that costs have risen considerably in the construction area, the amount of money the Exchequer planned to spend in the period 2000-02 will be ahead of what we had budget enveloped for those years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister, as an accountant, was advising a business about a project which had run over its original cost by two, three or four times, would he not ask it to reconsider and inform him if there was still a rate of return? Is <Col N="974" /> he saying that, as the person responsible for the stewardship of our tax resources, he does not receive information on whether it is worthwhile proceeding with projects which have hugely overrun and that he permits taxpayer's money to be expended on these projects without having such information available to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not suggesting that we leave a bridge half completed or a road running into the middle of nowhere. Once a project starts, it must be completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevant Department reconsiders projects during each stage. If one project is wildly overrunning, the Department's plans will be affected in the ensuing years because it will have to meet the cost of the overrun and its allocation may not be sufficient to do so. Once major projects have passed stages one, two and three, they will run to completion because, as I said, one cannot leave a bridge half built. Nevertheless, there are evaluation techniques applied at all stages in the relevant Departments and agencies. If a project goes wildly over budget, it will impact on plans for future capital projects because the money from the Exchequer will not be available to implement them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position on public expenditure in 2002 is set out in the budget and Revised Estimates for public services. The target increase set for total voted expenditure is 14% for the year as a whole. As regards the general question of setting targets on the level of expenditure increases over the lifetime of the Government, the Deputy will be aware that the overriding framework for fiscal policy for all European Union member states is the stability and growth pact. This pact commits Ireland to keep the finances of general government close to balance or in surplus and to take corrective action when <Col N="975" /> there is an actual or expected divergence from the objective.</P>
      <P>The new programme for Government includes an explicit commitment to uphold the terms of that pact. I have already told the House that I cannot see how such a budgetary framework could be clearer or more measurable. It is not only the Dáil that can judge our actions in this area, but also the European Commission and all the other member states at ECOFIN.</P>
      <P>During the five year period since 1997 the previous Government was in a position to make considerable progress in providing necessary resources to deliver on key infrastructural priorities and its commitment to better public services. The programme for Government set out the very important role that expenditure measures will continue to play in the development and success of the economy. The key objective of this Government is to achieve an appropriate and sustainable balance between spending and revenue and build on the success of the last five years.</P>
      <P>Public expenditure is planned within an overall three year fiscal framework. Subject to achieving and maintaining the overall stability objectives, the Government needs to have the flexibility to frame and manage its expenditure policy, consistent with the pace of economic growth and the strength of revenue receipts, in order to best meet the needs and circumstances of the economy. The terms of the EU stability and growth pact provide sufficient clarity and guidance to ensure our public finances are kept in a healthy condition.</P>

      <P>That is the overall budgetary framework but as in other years, the figures may not come in exactly on target, either on the revenue or expenditure sides. Even if one goes back 50 years one will not find figures coming in on target. In at least three of the five years that I have been Minister for Finance I have had mid-year exercises regarding expenditure because it is usually up in some areas and corrective actions must be taken &ndash; I am sure the same applied when Deputy Howlin and Deputy Bruton were in Government &ndash; and we had budgetary surpluses in all of those years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite having budget surpluses in all of my five years I still had to make mid-year adjustments of expenditure. There are some areas where there are upward pressures on expenditure. Deputy Bruton issued a press release yesterday based on an answer I gave him to a parliamentary question last week comparing the first five months of the year with expenditure in 2001 and 2002 but it would be wrong to extrapolate from this that all Vote heads would have increases of such magnitude. The projected rate of increase for capital and current expenditure is 14% this year. The expenditure pattern for the first five months is of the order of 27%. Some of that is affected by tiny differences which I can outline to the Deputy. As usual, there will be some adjustments in budgetary headings throughout the year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the joint programme has been agreed in the context of our international obligations under the stability and growth pact which provides the overriding framework for the Government's fiscal policy.

      <P>I have no doubt that the costings given for individual programmes were correct but the manner in which the document was put together by Deputy McGrath's party ignored the costings given to it and went on willy nilly. It was farcical to claim that the Department of Finance had costed his party's programme. The Department has costed individual proposals but no one in the Deputy's organisation put those costings together. That was the difficulty.</P>
      <P>The overriding principle of the Government's programme is the same as that of the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats election manifestos. I made it clear to my colleagues in Fianna Fáil before the election that we could promise anything we liked but the principle of the stability and growth pact had to be met. The Fianna Fáil election manifesto was criticised in the early days for its lack of specific commitments. The overall commitment to the principle of the stability and growth pact was there from the start. The Progressive Democrats made the same commitment in its manifesto and that is the overriding principle in the joint programme for Government.</P>
      <P>The Government can decide what will be done next year or the year after under a variety of headings. My party has given a commitment that its priorities will be health, crime, education and pensions for the elderly.</P>

      <P>The last programme for Government was criticised by the Opposition for being too specific. Almost every line of it was implemented during the five years of the last Government. The Department of Finance can give individual costings for all the commitments in the Progressive Democrat and Fianna Fáil programme, but they will not all be done on the one day or in the one year, because the overriding considerations are the terms of the stability and growth pact and the long-term sustainability of the public finances. Whatever is necessary to ensure that will be done. The Deputies can take my word on it.</P>

      <P>In 2002, the pay bill will amount to &euro;11,550 million, an increase of 13.4% over the 2001 figure of &euro;10,187 million.</P>
      <P>Of the 13.4% increase, pay rate increases account for 6.5%, or 48.5% of the overall increase. Other factors, mainly extra numbers employed but also including the &euro;150 million provision for the cost of benchmarking, account for an increase of 6.9%, or 51.5% of the overall increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect to get the benchmarking report on 30 June. The matter will then be considered by the Government. In the revised PPF, which we concluded with the trade unions and employers on Monday, 4 December 2000, the major commitment was that the benchmarking report would be brought forward from the end of December this year to 30 June 2002. It was further agreed by us that 25% of any increases recommended by the benchmarking body would be paid with effect from 1 December 2001 and that the balance would be negotiated in the context of a successor agreement to the PPF or whatever other arrangements were agreed in suc<Col N="980" /> cession to the PPF. That remains the agreement on which we signed at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister therefore confirm that the 25% will be paid in 2002 regardless? It seems likely the Minister will need to have the resources to pay more than the &euro;150 million he set aside. Has he made provision for that? What is the Minister's attitude to the payment of the balance of the benchmarking payments? Will he be bound by these recommendations or will he consider adopting a bargaining position in relation to the benchmarking report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy reads the press release which was attached to the documentation on that Monday night in December 2000, he will see quite clearly that the balance of the moneys due under benchmarking were to be negotiated in the context of a successor agreement to PPF or whatever arrangements were to be put in place if there were not to be any successor agreement to the PPF. That was the agreement into which the Government freely entered with the trades unions and employers and that remains the position. As stated in that document, negotiations will take place in that context. When the benchmarking report is completed, the Government will consider it and I am certain the trade union movement will consider it. Some time will have to elapse before everybody gives their considered position and we will proceed on that basis. The benchmarking body was set up as part of the arrangements under PPF and we will now have to wait to see what comes about from the benchmarking body. I have no idea what is in the benchmarking report.</P>

      <P>It is not agreed. This particular motion seems to be related to the Government position indicated by the Minister for Defence, <Col N="987" /><Col N="988" /> Deputy Smith, that the remit of the Freedom of Information Act should be restricted rather than extended. We cannot agree to the Government line on this, particularly given that the Ansbacher report will not be published this week. We are not going to have freedom of information on that matter until next Tuesday and are not going to have the Nice referendum bill before next Thursday. The Dáil is being deprived of basic freedom of information.</P>

      <P>No. I thank the Taoiseach for his response to the inquiry I made earlier. I want to make it very clear that this is not something I relish. In a situation like this, the Taoiseach can respond by saying that ten minutes are available. However, there is no such reference or provision and that is what is at the core of the annoyance of the two smaller parties in the House and the Independent Deputies. Our mandate is equal to any other, yet this is being offered as a gift rather than as a right. Our mandate has to be respected and it is imperative that our position is properly reflected in the configuration of the House.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the position as presented in proposal No. 5 in regard to guillotining a very important debate. I oppose this particular proposal and urge that additional time be provided to accommodate a full debate of the issues involved.</P>

      <P>The Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2002, is unnecessary from our point of view, but its necessity hopefully can be debated when the time comes. It is important to point out that we were unaware of what time would be given to us and we are still unclear, in many ways, as to when that time will be given. The point has to be made in regard to this and other business that these matters should have been dealt with earlier rather than, under duress, forcing us into being difficult on the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>We could do our business much more smoothly in the House if respect was given to the mandate which each of us has been given and if the groups that are here, including the Green Party, Sinn Féin, the Socialist Party and Independent Deputies, had the due recognition their mandate requires. Will the Ceann Comhairle and the Government take on board that we want to participate in the business of the House in accordance with Standing Orders, but that currently they are not in accordance with natural justice?</P>

It is not just a question of Sinn Féin's five Members; I have 81 here and it is a very unsatisfactory position for many of them.

      <P>When the Dáil resumed, I said to the Taoiseach that we would provide constructive opposition in so far as that was possible. We have now been voting for more than an hour and I still do not have clarification on whether the Dáil will sit next week. Given that the benchmarking report which is of interest to the entire public service and others is due to be published on Monday, and that the Ansbacher report is due to be published next week with the financial accounts, should not Dáil Éireann &ndash; the House that represents the people &ndash; meet next week to discuss both issues to some extent? Will the Taoiseach consider that and confirm that the Dáil will sit? Otherwise, difficulties will occur on this side of the House tomorrow and on Thursday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Those watching &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last night would have seen and heard the debate on the relevance of this House and noted the concern that the public has about a report that has been virtually five years in the making &ndash; originating with Mr. Justice McCracken's inquiry and recommendations. This was when we first heard the name Ansbacher in the context of tax cheats and people who had deprived this nation of vital revenue at a time when there were massive cutbacks being inflicted on it, the consequences of which are still with us in some respects.</P>
      <P>If, as Denis Bradley said last night, this House is to be perceived as being relevant to the citizens of this nation, it is essential either that the report be published as soon as possible and not next Tuesday, as has been indicated, or alternatively, that this House come back next week to discuss the report and other related matters.</P>
      <P>This is the House that raises taxes, votes on taxes and suffers the political consequences of taxes that are raised or are not collected. Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the Government intends to sit next week to facilitate a full and comprehensive debate on this issue? Otherwise, we will not be back until September, when our business will, I understand, be confined exclusively to matters relating to a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision of the High Court to publish the report in full at the earliest possible date. I certainly agree with the comments of the President of the High Court that publication in full is necessary and in the public interest and that it is necessary to restore confidence in the organs of the State. I remember when the Tánaiste said three years ago that she was setting up a process to deal with this many people were sceptical that we would ever have a final report, never mind its publication. Everything that the Tánaiste said at the time has been vindicated. Those people who did not believe the process into which she entered would prove to be so successful and fulfilling were proved wrong.</P>
      <P>The position is that the House will go into recess on Thursday. The Government intends to come back at the beginning of September. I have no doubt there will be issues every week which people will say the House should come back to deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kenny raised the issue of the benchmarking report. Its production is totally independent and we have no briefing in any form, as was agreed. The report will be published and the Government has already made the commitment that 25% of the sum indicated would be paid from 1 December last. The remainder of the discussion on that issue will be part of the process that has been laid out, a process that will commence in the autumn. We will not make any final decisions on these matters until those discussions take place. There is no need to bring the Dáil back to address this issue. We do not have any great difficulty with a confined debate on the <Col N="994" /> other issue if that is what people want, nor with putting aside a number of hours over the next week or two for it. I suggest, however, that it would be better if people saw the report first. The report, including the appendices, weighs 25 kg. In physical size, it is the length of the entire Fine Gael front bench. I do not mean that disrespectfully: it could have been any other front bench. The length is that of eight seats.</P>

      <P>I want to be constructive and Deputies Quinn and Kenny have put this in a constructive way. If, having examined the report, people believe that we should have a debate here, the Tánaiste and I, who have discussed this matter, would be quite happy to have a confined session. If we are to come back with the intention of discussing this report and end up discussing this, that and the other, the answer is no. However, if people genuinely want to discuss this important report, which, as Deputies Kenny and Quinn said, has been in preparation for several years, we can come back and have a confined debate on the issue. I would agree to that. If it is open-ended, with the House coming back for all sorts of normal business, the answer is no.</P>
      <P>I hope this is helpful. I have tried to be constructive. It is an important report and a huge amount of effort has gone into it. I have no problem discussing the benchmarking report in the autumn but we will not get anywhere with it until then.</P>

In the light of the findings of this study in relation to three to six year olds and the implications for peace and inter-community relations, has the Government any proposals for the authorities, communities or representatives of civic society in Northern Ireland, where sectarian hatreds seem to fuel tensions in both communities, to examine the ways in which we can move forward if the Good Friday Agreement, with all its potential, is to be achieved and implemented?</P>

      <P>There is a meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council this week and I have no doubt that it will come up for discussion in an informal way, if not on an official basis. Next week there is also a round of discussions between the two governments and the pro-agreement partners at which the matter will arise. A number of programmes and initiatives are being developed and are working within the system. Unfortunately, as I said here last week, in some areas there are still major difficulties and lack of progress and enormous sectarian actions are taking place. This is at its height at flashpoints and interchange points and there have been attacks, regrettably, from both sides against members of the community. This makes people aware at a very young age of what side they are on, what area they are from, who is being pushed out of an area and all the other issues. The report indicates this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education certainly has something to do with it &ndash; and I have no difficulty with exchanges about education &ndash; but all of these things are extremely difficult and complex and as long as the harassment goes on at interface areas this remains an enormous problem. There have already been many discussions about this at meetings of North-South bodies and between the Ministers and we continued this during the last Government. There were also many discussions between the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, and the Northern Ireland Minister for Education, Mr. McGuinness, and we will continue to build on that. However, the problems at the interface areas go far beyond education. It <Col N="996" /> is an enormous difficulty and creates enormous tension for the communities. That is the problem we must try to overcome.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach share my concern, and the concern of many who read this study, with the revelation that the level of sectarian awareness and prejudice rose dramatically after the three year olds had spent two years in compulsory education &ndash; in other words, from the age of five onwards &ndash; and that there seems to be some <i>prima facie</i> evidence from the study, although the sample base is less than 400, that going to school actually heightens sectarian awareness and that there may now therefore be a need for a move away from the denomination-based education system in Northern Ireland to reflect the model of community government?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach, on the basis of this study and other knowledge that we have, undertake to raise with the various religious authorities the desirability of moving away from denominational education, which seems in part to contribute to the awareness of sectarian divisions, and towards a system of integrated education for all? Only 4% of the children of Northern Ireland, as the Taoiseach will be aware, benefit from integrated education. If the lessons of the Good Friday Agreement are to be applied fully, surely it is now time for the religious leaders on all sides to agree to move towards integrated education. Will the Taoiseach give an undertaking that he will raise these matters with the relevant religious authorities so that we do not consolidate this frightening legacy?</P>

      <P>I have no difficulty with further discussions. We have already had discussions about many of these matters. However, I do not want to give the impression that they are in any way easily resolved, not only by the religious leaders but by the communities and parents themselves. In the interface areas, the parents feel that they are protecting their schools as part of a community. They feel that their schools are under attack and that an effort is being made to push them out and harass them. However, not all areas are interchange areas and much progress has been made elsewhere. Education is one part of it. Having had this discussion with many community&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the European Council in Seville on Friday and Saturday, 21 and 22 June. In the period prior to the Council I had bilateral meetings with Prime Ministers Aznar, Berlusconi, Blair, Lipponen, Persson and Schussel, all of which were of great value in preparing for the European Council. The Minister for Foreign Affairs also had an extensive round of bilateral contacts with his counterparts in the lead up to Seville.</P>
      <P>The European Council was a substantial success for Ireland and the European Union. It marked major progress on enlargement, justice and home affairs issues. It took significant decisions to reform the way the European Council and the Council of Ministers do their business. Greater transparency has been incorporated into the work of the Council of Ministers and the number of Council formations has been reduced. A specific proposal by Ireland to create a competitiveness council was also agreed. In addition, the European Council adopted the Seville declarations which confirm that the Treaty of Nice poses no threat to our traditional policy of military neutrality. These declarations bring timely clarity in an area which frequently has been the subject of considerable misunderstanding and misinformation.</P>
      <P>The conclusions of the European Council have been laid before the House. As there is to be a questions and answers session following this statement, I propose to concentrate on the national and European Council declarations adopted in Seville. The national declaration and the declaration of the European Council have been laid before the House. The Government sought these declarations to make it clear, beyond any doubt, that the Treaty of Nice poses no threat to our traditional policy of military neutrality. The declarations confirm that this understanding is fully shared by all 15 member states. The national declaration reaffirms Ireland's continued attachment to its traditional policy of military neutrality and confirms that Ireland is not party to any mutual defence commitment; that we are not party to any plans to develop a European army; and that we will take our own sovereign decision on whether Irish troops should participate in humanitarian or crisis management tasks mounted by the European Union based on the triple lock of UN endorsement, Government decision and Dáil approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The declaration also makes clear that Ireland will not adopt any decision taken by the European Council to move to a common defence arrangement, or ratify any future treaty which would involve a departure from our traditional policy of military neutrality, unless it has first <Col N="1002" /> been approved by the Irish people in a referendum. The declaration of the European Council confirms that Ireland's policy of military neutrality is in full conformity with the treaties, including the Treaty of Nice, and that there is no obligation on us arising from the treaties which would oblige us to depart from that policy.</P>
    <P>The second report of the National Forum on Europe underlined the importance of the neutrality issue and the desirability for the Government to provide the assurances now contained in the national declaration. The forum suggested that confirmation by our EU partners that Ireland's neutral status would be fully respected would also be a measure of reassurance. I am very pleased that through the Seville declarations we have been able to achieve an outcome which fully addresses the issues and concerns highlighted in the forum report. Both declarations have formal status and authority. Should the people decide in a future referendum that the State may ratify the Treaty of Nice, our national declaration will be associated with Ireland's instrument of ratification and it will also be registered at the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The Government's priority going to Seville was to secure agreement of partners to the declarations. Our success on this issue at Seville opened the way to the Government today deciding to hold a second referendum on the Treaty of Nice in the autumn of this year. In consultation with the party Whips, we have agreed to reconvene the Dáil for the first two weeks in September to enable passage of the Referendum Bill and provide for full debate on all the issues. The decision to hold another referendum on the Treaty of Nice was not taken lightly. We recognise that there are those who strongly and genuinely believe that the outcome of last year's referendum should be accepted as representing the definitive view of the people on the Treaty of Nice. However, for many reasons, we do not believe that any responsible Government could let the matter rest there. We made this clear in our party manifestos before the general election and we made this clear in An Agreed Programme for Government. Simply put, the Government cannot take risks about Ireland's future.</P>
    <P>On assuming office three weeks ago and in the light of the mandate given to us by the people, the Government made the European Union its number one priority. Since the Government was formed I have begun an intensive series of meetings with my colleagues on the European Council and in the accession countries. These meetings will underpin the Government's commitment to vigorously pursue Ireland's interests in the European Union. They will also form part of the preparations for Ireland's Presidency of the European Union in the first half of 2004.</P>
    <P>All our partners have shown a genuine willingness to help address our concerns and all appreciate the efforts we are making to try to ensure the enlargement process is kept on track, but to do so we must ratify the Treaty of Nice. Almost all <Col N="1003" /> other member states have now completed their ratification of the treaty and ratification by all by the end of the year remains our common goal. Without the Treaty of Nice the accession countries will not be able to join the European Union on schedule.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Nice is about the enlargement of the EU. It is important to our partners and it is clearly important to the accession states. As the debate in this country gathers pace, we should not allow ourselves to be distracted from the vital fact that ratification of the Treaty of Nice is also a matter of vital national interest to Ireland. The well-being of our people is inextricably bound up with the continuing success and development of the European Union and in Ireland remaining at the heart of the Union. For Ireland to block the treaty would be damaging to our own interests. It would also be a very serious blow to inflict on countries which have invested years of effort and sacrifice to make themselves ready to take on membership of the Union. We have helped to build the EU of today and we want to play no less a part in building the EU of the future.</P>
    <P>We are at a defining moment in our relations with the EU. I said at Seville that the forthcoming referendum will be the most important vote the Irish people have been asked to take since they decided to become part of Europe 30 years ago. In considering how they should vote next autumn, I ask people to reflect on all the vital dimensions of our membership of the EU. There inevitably will be points of irritation with the Union, areas where we feel the Union should be doing more and areas where we feel it should be doing less, but the people need to weigh up the totality of our relations with the EU and decide where the balance lies.</P>
    <P>I believe that, looked at and weighed up carefully, there can only be one answer: that we stay with the Union that we have helped to create. We do what makes most sense and we do what ensures that our national interests are protected. In short, we manage our concerns and issues from a position of full strength and commitment at the heart of the Union. It would be bizarre if we were to decide there was a better way of managing our economic, social and political interests. When the next generation looks back 30 years from now, I hope it will say that our generation saw where the national interest lay and took the right path on Europe. There have always been negative voices in this country and in other countries about the whole concept of the European Union. Those voices were there before our people decided to join Europe in 1972 and many of the same voices can still be heard today. They have changed tack, but their underlying aversion to the EU is still there.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that most Irish people support the EU and I hope they will express this support in the autumn referendum. If we were complacent or presumptuous the last time out, we must not make the same mistake this time or ever <Col N="1004" /> again because there is too much at stake. We must bring the people with us. There continue to be those who demand that the text of the treaty be re-opened for further negotiation, but this simply is not realistic. To have sought the amendment of a treaty which was the product of long and difficult negotiations, in which all member state governments participated in good faith and in which Ireland's concerns were fully respected, would have been fruitless, counter-productive and disproportionately harmful to our wider interests. There is, in any event, no certainty that a reopening of the treaty would work to Ireland's advantage. For instance, would the bigger member states feel bound by their agreement to accept equality of representation of all member states on the Commission in any new negotiations?</P>
    <P>At the same time, we accept that the outcome of last year's referendum revealed significant public concerns about the functioning of the European Union, about Ireland's role within it and about its future direction. I regret that we have not done a better job in communicating Europe to the people. I believe that we have not facilitated and stimulated sufficient debate on our relations with the Union. All this must now change and people on all sides of the House, who believe in the fundamental importance of Europe to Ireland, must engage on the issues at all levels.</P>
    <P>The National Forum on Europe, which I am glad to say has been joined by the Fine Gael Party, has provided a framework for an unprecedented level of debate on European issues. The Government is listening. Both within the Forum and outside it, nationally and within the Union, we are making determined efforts to address the concerns which have been expressed &ndash; the format of the debate here today reflects those efforts. This is the first in a series of measures we are taking to ensure greater Oireachtas scrutiny of European Union issues. From 1 July an enhanced system of Oireachtas scrutiny will be put in place which will have significant implications for the way we do our European Union business.</P>
    <P>Since Ireland joined the European Union in 1973, the positive impact of membership on our national life has been immense. I have no doubt that as we go forward the EU will remain a powerful plus for Ireland. As an active and committed member of the Union, Ireland has played its part in contributing to the consolidation of peace and the development of prosperity in Europe. Membership of the Union has been crucial to the modernisation and transformation of our economy. Hundreds of thousands of Irish jobs depend on it. As a country which depends on being able to compete internationally, our participation in the Single Market has created a level playing field for Irish companies and has been a key factor in attracting overseas investment. The euro has made it easier to trade and travel throughout Europe and has kept interest rates at historic lows. EU Structural Funds have been vital to the development of our infrastructure and <Col N="1005" /> the training of our workforce and the Common Agricultural Policy has helped to modernise agriculture and sustain living standards throughout rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Those opponents of the treaty, who make much of the power of the large states in the European Union, should cast their minds back to the period before our accession to the European Union. We were over-dependent on the UK economy; we lived and traded in a world where the rules were made by others; we had no place at the table where tariffs were set by our trading partners; and we had no voice when decisions affecting our key agricultural and industrial interests were being laid down. Participation in the European Union has been enormously empowering for us as a nation. However, it is a power we must use wisely. Using it carelessly or recklessly will lead to its dissipation.</P>
    <P>The European Union has also raised social standards in Ireland, for example, through insisting on equality between men and women at work and through its health and safety regulations. The Union's laws, policies and programmes make it simpler and more straightforward for Irish people to live, work or study in the other 14 member states.</P>
    <P>The European Union has also been immensely supportive of the peace process, being far and away the most generous financial contributor to programmes aimed at fostering peace, reconciliation and links between North and South.</P>
    <P>The Union is not some remote entity unconnected to Ireland, but a unique collective enterprise in which Ireland is an engaged and valued participant. Irish Ministers and Members of the European Parliament work alongside the representatives of the other member states in deciding upon the laws, policies and programmes of the Union.</P>
    <P>Working with our partners, we address issues which are critically important to our people, to our societies and economies, and which can most effectively be tackled together. I refer to issues such as international trade policy, climate change and cross-border pollution, terrorism and organised crime, migration and asylum. The Union is also, through its developing Common Foreign and Security Policy, working to promote peace, stability and human rights throughout the world.</P>
    <P>While we co-operate and share our sovereignty where it makes sense to do so, each member state retains essential control over those matters which are fundamentally for decision at national level, such as taxation, education, citizenship, health, culture, policing and justice. The nation state is and will remain the key building block of Europe for the foreseeable future, a fact recognised by all shades of opinion throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>We are now at the start of a campaign that will determine Ireland's future in Europe for a generation to come. As the Irish people come to appreciate the enormous significance of their voice in the forthcoming referendum they will <Col N="1006" /> wish to emphasise our credentials as a leading and positive voice in Europe and open the road to an expanded EU that offers enormous opportunities to this country.</P>
    <P>The Seville European Council was a very successful meeting from Ireland's point of view and from the point of view of the European Union. Now that it is clear that the Treaty of Nice poses no threat to our traditional policy of military neutrality, we can begin to debate the real implications of that treaty and our need to ratify it in order to promote and protect the interests of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>The second referendum on Nice is crucial for the future of this country. Any modest gains the Taoiseach won in securing a declaration &ndash; albeit a political one &ndash; on our neutrality, were immediately jettisoned by remarks that were perceived as being at best ill-judged and at worst intemperate, even downright insulting to those who hold diverging views to his own.</P>
      <P>As leader of Fine Gael, and in the interest of informing and persuading the people and not alienating them, I believe those remarks should be clarified. If he is at all serious about securing a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on Nice II, the Taoiseach should do so immediately and without issue.</P>
      <P>Immediately after the &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, stated that the result was a sign of our healthy democracy. Other Government Euro-sceptics may have lacked the Minister's theatrical flourish, but they gave a creditable performance all the same &ndash; Deputy Ó Cuív, in his own inimitable style &ndash; up close and personal; the then Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, who was, perhaps, a little more oblique, and the Tánaiste who has repeatedly said that she feels closer to Boston than to Berlin.</P>
      <P>I suspect the Government is in difficulty over Nice II, only this time the situation is more urgent and more pressing. There is no room for bluster and palaver. Moreover, the Taoiseach is now of the clear view that the whingers need to get it right. However, as I stated last week at the Forum on Europe, it is the Taoiseach and his Government who need to get it right on this occasion.</P>
      <P>If we are to secure a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote, we must have a referendum where facts and not fear are sovereign. If we are to secure a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote we need to engage young people, not harass and belittle them; inform people, not insult them; persuade them, not berate them; and we need to start immediately with a retraction and clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach should demonstrate that he is serious. He should establish the Committee on European Affairs, resource it properly and show people that it is capable of scrutinising EU policies on their behalf. He must recognise that many <Col N="1007" /> people voted against the Treaty of Nice because of what they saw as growing bureaucracy from Brussels and explain how he will streamline his implementation of European schemes and policies to remove that unnecessary bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>I told the Forum on Europe last week of my fear that the Government had learned nothing from its disastrous first outing on Nice. That fear was well-founded. The comments of the Taoiseach's adviser, Dr. Martin Mansergh, in a letter to <i>The Times</i> last week were quite condescending. I, and my party are pro-Nice and pro-Europe, but not to the detriment of the practice of democracy in this country. Dr. Mansergh's association of the Irish &ldquo;no&rdquo; campaign with &ldquo;paranoid and discredited Eurosceptic arguments of Mrs. Thatcher and the British right-wing Tory press&rdquo;  speak for themselves. Make no mistake, a second rejection of the Nice treaty will have serious implications for the European Union and Ireland's position within it. That is why the Government cannot afford to blow it again.</P>
    <P>It is clear that enlargement cannot proceed fairly unless the treaty is ratified. The existing arrangements under the Amsterdam treaty will allow for the admission of only five new member states. The impassioned plea by the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic to Ireland not to stand in the way of the accession of &ldquo;new children&rdquo; to the Union, reflects the widely held concern throughout Central and Eastern Europe about the political ramifications in these new democracies if the enlargement process is further delayed. These new children have staked their political and economic futures on becoming members of the enlarged European family. If the Nice treaty is not ratified, these countries will have to compete with each other to achieve their much needed goal.</P>
    <P>Another &ldquo;no&rdquo; to Nice would impact negatively on Ireland's role in and influence on the European decision-making process. Traditionally, Ireland has been recognised and respected as contributing positively to the European integration process. In return we, as a small member state, have always been respected and supported. If we refuse to ratify the Nice treaty, which has already been approved by 13 member states, and is certain to be by the 14th, it is reasonable to expect that this attitude will change. With another round of CAP reform imminent and a new intergovernmental conference just around the corner, the Taoiseach should be aware that we can ill afford to have our influence and negotiating position weakened.</P>
    <P>When we ratify this treaty, as the only country holding a referendum on the issue, we can hold out the hand of friendship to the millions of people in the applicant countries for whom EU membership is so important.</P>
    <P>The main political issue on the Seville agenda is the rise of illegal immigration into the European Union. In Ireland we are now very aware of this issue with the rise in the number of people <Col N="1008" /> seeking asylum and work here. It is a much greater problem in other European countries. The leader of the Greek Opposition indicated that there were 260,000 arrests of illegal immigrants &ndash; of which Greece has more than one million &ndash; in his country last year. Anybody who saw &ldquo;Fortress Europe&rdquo; on RTE last Sunday night would have been shocked at what these men, women and small children have to go through, to reach what they believe to be deliverance.</P>
    <P>I remind the Taoiseach that we have a short time to get our house in order. The Taoiseach must inform, he must lead and he must not drag. He must persuade and not pillory. The Seville Summit saw him bring back a declaration that, while it has no legal binding, will hopefully reassure the people that our EU partners recognise Ireland's sovereignty in relation to participation in military or peacekeeping missions. Now he has his own mission, which I hope he has not made impossible by his ill-judged remarks, namely, to secure ratification of a treaty which he and his Government negotiated and signed.</P>
    <P>There is some confusion about the Government's intention in relation to the forthcoming referendum. I will not support any proposal to include a reference to military neutrality in the Constitution. The Dáil should retain the key role in deciding on the use of Irish forces and I would be willing to consider any draft legislation to formalise this position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kenny for sharing time and allowing me to contribute to this important debate.</P>
      <P>The declarations the Taoiseach and the European Council have made are welcome. They are statements of fact which those of us who have supported the Single European Act and the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice treaties also made in the past, but in respect of which we were pilloried. However, whereas they have no judicatory nature and, indeed, are a new category of declaration, unlike previous declarations made when treaties were passed, they are still a very welcome statement of fact, to which all 15 member states have contributed alongside the separate statement by the Government. This should not be cast aside lightly.</P>
      <P>We are constantly appeasing one side of the argument and going out of our way to emphasise how neutral we are. I would prefer to have a proper and adequate debate in the House and the country on the broader issue of security and defence in Europe and what our role in it should be. We should not be afraid of the changing European security and defence architecture and anybody who thinks anything will remain the same after 11 September is burying his or her head in the sand. The whole question of European defence and security will continue to be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in the Nice treaty which challenges our neutrality. If things continue to evolve, proposals may well be put forward at some time <Col N="1009" /> in the future which would bring about, not only a closer European security and defence policy, but also a closer European security and defence. We should be asking ourselves what we want from these structures, not how we can keep our heads down and get exceptions, exemptions and declarations. We should be one of the architects. Post-Nice we should ask what it is we want of and for Europe and Ireland as this issue evolves because if Europe is secure and stable, then Ireland will also be secure and stable. These are the prerequisites for the prosperity we have come to enjoy.</P>
    <P>In many ways, this whole question is very central to the <i>raison d'être </i>of the European Union. If one goes back to the formation of the European Coal and Steel Community shortly after the end of the Second World War, one finds that it was established because a small number of very farsighted people came together to ensure there was no repeat of what happened on this continent during two world wars, when 60 million Europeans, some of them Irish, were killed in the prime of their lives. From the outset, therefore, security and stability were central to the purpose of the institutions which evolved into the European Union.</P>
    <P>If we want to continue to enjoy our current prosperity and that of the rest of Europe, a huge market of some 350 million people to which we export, it must be secure, stable and defended. Asking ourselves what we want from Europe and Ireland in those circumstances will require more than outdoing each other to see which of us can attract the section of the community that can be scared most or told the biggest lie or trying to lead simply by finding out which way the crowd is moving and getting in front of it.</P>
    <P>We need a clearer, more professional and more open approach to the whole question of security and defence. This task has not been helped by the Government departing from promises made in opposition, including the promise to hold a referendum on the Partnership for Peace. If we are to carry this referendum &ndash; incidentally, I am one of those Members who believes we will &ndash; it will only be done by being open, up-front and honest, calling a spade a spade and telling people exactly what has happened and what is happening, not by claiming the declaration is anything it is not.</P>
    <P>We should also be informing people that, at some stage in the future, we will put before them options on the future security and defence of Europe. If there is to be a progressive merger of the Western European Union and the European Union, these options could, for example, include a commitment to include Article 5 of the treaty establishing Western European Union in a future EU treaty not as a full measure, but as a protocol one could opt in or out of. This would be the best of all worlds for us.</P>
    <P>I was very much involved in the reflection group which prepared the Amsterdam treaty and right through until the end of the treaty process. I believe now, as I did then, that our interests and those of Europe would be best served by <Col N="1010" /> recruiting support within the European Union for adding a protocol to a future treaty which would allow us to opt in and out on a case by case basis. We would not be telling Europe we do not want it to defend itself or trying to stop those members which want to have some kind of formal defence, as distinct from defence policy, from pursuing it, but that we want to choose the circumstances in which we would opt in and out.</P>
    <P>I fully share Deputy Kenny's concerns about the idea of writing into the Constitution a commitment on neutrality. To do so would be to do what so many Members have been telling us for years not to do on the pro-life issue. Such amendments would mean only what the Supreme Court says they mean. Deputy Noonan has said both here and outside the House that, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, he once asked the Secretary General of the Department what inserting a text into the Constitution would mean. The advice he received was that it would mean what the Supreme Court decides. Therefore, we will not have a triple lock consisting of the Government, the Dáil and NATO, but a cripple lock in which it will not be sufficient for a Government, regardless of party, which genuinely believes it is in the interests of the State to sanction acts of war, whether that means refuelling or overflying, to seek the approval of Dáil Éireann because it will require a further sanction from the United Nations. In any event, the Defence Acts require that the Defence Forces only become involved in UN sanctioned activities. However, what would happen if, God forbid, at some future date somebody crashed an aeroplane into the UN building in New York rendering the organisation unable to take decisions in circumstances where we have inserted a text into the Constitution making it impossible for Dáil Éireann to act? I urge the Taoiseach to be very cautious about accepting proposals to insert definitions into the Constitution which would have the effect of creating a quadruple rather than triple lock.</P>
    <P>Anybody could go to the Supreme Court, which would mean that three of the five judges sitting on the day, who would not be as well informed as the Government on these matters and not properly attuned to them because of their political nature as issues of public policy, would take these kinds of decisions. I urge caution on this matter.</P>

      <P>From the domestic perspective, concentration has focused on the publication of the two declarations canvassed by the Taoiseach, which emanated from the Seville Summit. I welcome the assertion by our European partners that the Nice treaty does not mark a significant advancement in the development of foreign and security policy and does not involve us in any mutual defence obligations. As such, our policy of military neutrality is intact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That such a declaration is not a legal instrument, as some have declared, is not the point. It represents a statement of where we are at <Col N="1011" /> present. However, I fear that it is not sufficient to deal with the issues it was designed to deal with, namely, the concerns of the Irish people about neutrality which were raised during the last Nice referendum. I share the view of Senator Maurice Hayes that much of the concern of the people is as much to do with the intentions of the Government as with the intentions of other European leaders.</P>
    <P>The national declaration published by the Government at the weekend is not sufficient to address these concerns. It is, in effect, a request from the Government to &ldquo;trust us&rdquo; on this issue. For anyone genuinely interested in seeing the Nice referendum passed, this is a risky card to play. Whether the Taoiseach likes it or not, the people do not trust the Government and they have good cause for doing so. Broken promises on Partnership for Peace may well come home to roost.</P>
    <P>The ideal way to deal with this issue and address these concerns is to accept that it must be left in the hands of the people. Labour's proposed constitutional amendment does that and I do not share the arguments put forward by Deputy Mitchell or Deputy John Bruton. Our proposal is a positive one. The Irish people know that some of our European partners would like to see the evolution of a European army and that Ireland may have to face these issues down the road. They know this debate is going on and they want absolute ownership of it. If anyone believes they have a better wording for a constitutional amendment than we have I will have no difficulty in listening to it.</P>
    <P>Let us not pretend that to empower the people on this issue hands the issue over to the courts. Foreign policy is and has always been judicial. Appeals to this kind of elitism are what undermined confidence in the European process in the first place. There is no point in seeking to address the concerns about neutrality in a fashion which raises more questions than it answers and that is what the Government declaration does.</P>
    <P>With regard to accountability and transparency, I put the Government on notice that dealing with this issue by way of changes to Dáil Standing Orders will not address concerns. It is time for new laws to determine responsibilities and obligations in this area. If my party's European Union Bill is not acceptable the Government had better come up with a speedy alternative. It is no longer acceptable that laws made in this House can be changed by Ministers taking decisions in Europe and then signing regulations without reference to this House.</P>
    <P>My fear is that the Government is sleep-walking into this Nice campaign. The Taoiseach's remarks at the weekend portray a Government that refused to listen to the lessons of last year. On that occasion, had we waited and allowed time for a debate perhaps &ndash; and I only say perhaps &ndash; the result might have been different. For that reason the tone of this campaign is more <Col N="1012" /> important than ever before. The Government's duty is to indicate that it has to listen to the people, present a package of reforms that go beyond the issue of neutrality and ask the people to consider the issue again in a changed context.</P>
    <P>Defeat of the Nice treaty will not prevent the enlargement process from taking place but it will determine the pace of change and it impacts considerably on the aspirations of those countries currently awaiting membership. Their preparations and their aspirations are uniquely in our hands now and they must be taken seriously. It is not for us to best guess what their interests are and I fully support the Taoiseach's analysis of this issue. We know from the procession of party leaders, Government representatives and other politicians to the forum in Dublin Castle what the aspirations and the intentions of people in Central and Eastern Europe are, notwithstanding the difficult domestic decisions they have to make by way of adjustment. Therefore, I accept the conclusions of the Taoiseach with regard to that aspect of the enlargement process. It is precisely for that reason that the obligation on the Government to do better than it is doing is so great. Perhaps, flush with election success there is a feeling of invincibility on the Government side of the House. If so, it could well prove to be the biggest impediment to passing this treaty.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies John Gormley and Joe Higgins.</P>
      <P>When the referendum is held in the autumn the people will not vote on the declarations of Seville but on the treaty of Nice. The declarations produced at the Seville summit offer nothing new and they have no legal or constitutional standing. They did not alter one syllable of the treaty of Nice. The electorate rejected the treaty last year and the Government is now asking them to reverse that decision.</P>
      <P>We recently had a general election. I thought my party had a good result and we increased our representation by four seats. I thought Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats got too many seats. I would like to have seen them get fewer. I am sure the Taoiseach would have liked to have had more seats and I know many of his party colleagues would have wished that the Progressive Democrats had got less, because they regularly say so. So, perhaps the Taoiseach will call another general election to coincide with the referendum in the autumn. If the people can be asked to get it right the second time around on Nice why not ask them to get it right on the general election the second time out?</P>

      <P>Maybe he could speak to the meteorologists and ask them to rewind the summer back to May to see if we can get more sun the second time around.</P>
      <P>I offer these analogies because the primary issue in the replay of the Nice referendum is not neutrality, enlargement or the future integration of the EU. The primary issue is democracy. Last year the electorate was asked to alter the Constitution in order to accept the treaty of Nice. They declined to do so. The ultimate sovereignty of this State is not the Dáil, the Government or the Taoiseach but the people, and the people voted &ldquo;no&rdquo;. The people are the State and the State declined to ratify the Treaty of Nice.</P>
      <P>The law of the European Union is based on a series of treaties which were agreed unanimously by member states. We have voted on a number of them, including the Single European Act and the Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties. On each of these occasions Sinn Féin, with others, called for a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote because we were and are opposed to the creation of an EU super-state and those treaties are the building blocks of such a state. The Government makes much of our record and that of other parties and independents on these treaties, as though we had something to be ashamed of. However, we stand over our record. We fought our campaigns and accepted the results. Imagine the ridicule we would have been subjected to if we and others who campaigned against those treaties had, on each occasion, called for a replay because, in our opinion, the people had got it wrong. That is exactly what the Government is doing now.</P>
      <P>Changes to existing EU treaties and new treaties must be agreed unanimously by all member states. The Nice treaty was not so agreed because this State, by vote of the people, rejected it. Immediately after the referendum the Government was legally obliged to go to the EU Commission and the governments of the member states and formally request that they not proceed with ratification. Not only did the Government not implement the referendum result, it openly defied it. The Government encouraged the governments of the other member states to proceed with ratification and did so with the avowed purpose of pressurising the electorate and presenting them with the scenario we now face. We are being told that all other member states have ratified, that the whole of the EU and all the applicant states await us and that if we do not vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; a few thousand ungrateful Irish whingers will destroy the whole European project. Such rubbish. I do not think the people will buy it. I do not think they are so gullible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not doubt the diligence of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in securing the declarations in Seville but that diligence was <Col N="1014" /> misdirected. The declarations are a smokescreen. They do not change Nice which, like previous EU treaties, commits us to greater co-operation in foreign policy and so-called security policy and to the progressive framing of a common defence policy. It commits us to the EU rapid reaction force.</P>
    <P>This State is still a member of NATO's Partnership for Peace in violation of the promise the Taoiseach made at a previous general election. The reality of what is happening to Irish neutrality was shown at the beginning of this month when the Government granted permission to the United States air force, operating from Shannon Airport, to carry out military exercises in our air space. Two Hercules C-130 military planes were allowed by the Department of Foreign Affairs to engage in training flights low in the skies over the south west of Ireland. This took place over a four-day period. It followed the opening of Shannon to the US military last year. The US air force presence there has now become almost routine. We are seeing the transformation of Shannon into an important European base for the US air force in total violation the Government's supposed commitment to neutrality as expressed in the Seville declarations and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Government has so far refused to put neutrality in the Constitution. I urge it to do so and I published such a Bill, then called the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution Bill. I call on the Taoiseach to adopt it and on his Government to implement it. I pledge the opposition of Sinn Féin to the ratification of the Treaty of Nice and I look forward once again to seeing democracy triumph as the people reject this undemocratic treaty. We look forward to the engagement with the Government with full gusto.</P>

      <P>In the five minutes I have to speak I will concentrate on the so-called Seville declaration on neutrality. I say &ldquo;so-called&rdquo; because the declaration is worthless. Much media coverage has been given to the declaration in recent days and it has been stated as a fact that it safeguards Irish neutrality. It does no such thing. Irish neutrality has been progressively and systematically eroded by successive EU treaties and, under this Minister for Foreign Affairs, it has been given the kiss of death. Neutrality, or military neutrality as the Government prefers to call it, is defined in the narrowest terms. It simply means non-membership of a military alliance. In other words there is no mutual defence clause, no Article 5 commitment. It is rightly argued that Nice does not have a mutual defence implication <i>ergo</i> our neutrality is safeguarded, or so the Government claims. Is it any wonder that Tony Blair admitted the decision on the declaration did not take long to discuss? There was not much to discuss. It simply restates the obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the current arrangements, military activity of all sorts is permitted and this is compatible with Irish neutrality. Deputy Ó Caoláin has referred to the manoeuvres off the Kerry <Col N="1015" /> coast. We have seen military personnel in Shannon and refuelling at Shannon. It could be stretched to such an extent that we could even station nuclear weapons in this country and that would be compatible under the Government's definition of Irish military neutrality, which is absurd. The concept of mutual defence belongs to the Cold War era. The European rapid reaction force, under the Petersberg tasks, is not about defensive operations, but rather to quote the former Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs: &ldquo;It is especially directed at action outside the EU and at international crisis management, the latter in co-operation with NATO.&rdquo;  That comes from a Dutch newspaper on 19 June. I accept that the Labour Party amendment has been proposed in the best interest, but it misses the point and perhaps is entirely counter-productive. The only real way to enshrine neutrality in the Constitution is by way of protocol, about which I have spoken repeatedly. This would exempt us from the European rapid reaction force, which is why the Government and other parties have steadfastly refused to contemplate such a move.</P>
    <P>The Seville declaration is as brazen a piece of political chicanery as I have witnessed from Fianna Fáil. It is fundamentally dishonest, contemptuous of ordinary people and a gross insult to the intelligence of the electorate. We require clarity and honesty, but the Minister has sought to deliberately confuse people. The declaration is fraudulent and worthless. If it were a cheque it would bounce. I have often discussed the issue of neutrality with my constituents, some of whom have disagreed with me and suggested we should ditch neutrality and join a European army. That is a valid and honourable position that I can respect, although one with which I disagree.</P>
    <P>However, I cannot respect the Government which seeks to slither its way out of this one. Why has no independent organisation or NGO concerned with peace and neutrality welcomed this declaration? They have no political axe to grind and are only interested in peace and neutrality, but yet the Government has resorted to insulting these people. We may be whingers, but we are honest whingers and we will continue to make the case for peace and neutrality here.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, over the years, the people opposite have been involved in so many nods and winks, so many wheelings and dealings and so much spin and subterfuge, that they no longer know what the truth is. We will tell the Irish people the truth come the autumn.</P>

      <P>The supporters of the Nice treaty say there are no implications in the treaty regarding militarisation in the future of the European Union, but I strongly disagree. It is true that the Amsterdam treaty made detailed provision for the rapid reaction force and so-called crisis management &ndash; in other words military intervention. However, there is clearly a reiteration of proposals on common foreign and security policy <Col N="1016" /> and on military matters included in the text of the Nice treaty. Just as the Government wants the Irish people to revisit the Nice treaty, not being content with the first debate, it is absolutely justifiable for me to also call on the Irish people to revisit the implied militarisation provisions being reiterated within the Nice treaty and being consolidated within it from Amsterdam. Concretely Amsterdam provides for a force of 60,000 soldiers in the field along with 400 aircraft and 100 ships. Troops, fighter aircraft and a naval fleet clearly form the genesis of an EU army.</P>
      <P>Nice reiterates support for the EU armaments industry. It says that the progressive framing of a common defence policy will be supported, as member states consider appropriate, by co-operation in the field of armaments. What does this mean? It means support for the production of &euro;50 billion worth of armaments &ndash; weapons of fearsome destruction &ndash; within the states of the EU each year. This includes support for the allegedly great democracies of Germany, France and Britain manufacturing these weapons and selling them all over the world. For example, Britain sells fighter aircraft which can carry tactical nuclear weapons to India and Pakistan. Only a few weeks ago the world held its breath in case these powers engaged in a tactical nuclear war with British and other EU weapons. The common foreign and security policy and the rapid reaction force consolidate and justify this criminal wastage of arms. It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to return from Seville waving a declaration about his head saying Ireland will step aside from all this manoeuvring because implied in that is that the Government is content to give <i>carte blanche </i>to the other powerful EU states to proceed with the militarisation of the EU. A huge majority of Irish youth, and people in general, are not content to step aside. They want to see an end to the production of weapons of mass destruction and armaments in Europe and worldwide and an end to the horrific, criminal and cynical trade in this weaponry. They want to see the swords beaten into ploughshares so that we no longer have to see the criminal wastage and destruction they impose and the spiral of arms to which it gives rise across the world. The Nice treaty consolidates the drive by the powerful states within the EU towards the creation of a military wing. It also consolidates the drive to the creation of the political and security committee which, under the responsibility of the Council, is to exercise political control and strategic direction of crisis management operations. For the first time there will be a permanent command structure, based in Brussels, in charge of military affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powerful states within the EU want a massive economic bloc to rival the United States and other powerful economies like that of Japan. They also want a powerful military bloc to rival the United States in jockeying for diplomatic advantage with strategic countries around the globe. When the Irish people voted &ldquo;no&rdquo; they voted against increased militarisation, increased <Col N="1017" /> power for elite states and the multi-national controls &ndash; and the armaments merchants within them &ndash; who are increasingly dictating the affairs of the EU.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his contribution. It is very obvious that those who voted against the Treaty of Nice, or who felt they would do so if they were to vote, did so because of the way legislation giving effect to European directives and regulations has been implemented here. A person living on Inis Meán sees the land being literally washed away, yet he cannot protect it because of the Dúchas regulations which give effect to the European regulations. That has nothing to do with the Nice treaty but that person sees it as a version of Europe and votes against it. Has the Government considered this base in the qualitative research that it carried out last year? Is there to be an attempt to explain that to people? In areas where common sense should apply, will the legislation giving effect to the European directive and regulations be loosened, relaxed or more clearly implemented in order to assuage those fears and concerns?</P>

      <P>I accept what the Deputy says that the people who voted &ldquo;no&rdquo; or did not vote at all did so for many reasons. Over the past 12 months we have endeavoured to look at all of these issues and deal with them as best we can. We discussed some of those issues during Question Time today while others relate to agriculture, industry and legislation.</P>
      <P>As I said, people are irritated when they feel that Europe has too much or too little say in matters. They are also irritated when forms are too complicated. I know these are genuinely held views and I respect them. That was discussed in Nice and is one of the reasons for the decision for the Convention to examine those issues and to determine who is responsible for what. It will deal with the issue of subsidiarity, will decide on who is best to do certain jobs and re-order the treaties and their lay-out. The Convention will go on for some years. We supported that at Nice as a task that needs to be undertaken. Valérie Giscard d'Estaing, in giving his first report from the Convention to the European Council early last Saturday morning, emphasised that is the challenge. He emphasised that we must look and listen. He has indicated that the early months of the Convention have been a listening process. It is time for the Union to reflect on these issues. That is part of the Convention's work and I support it.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the matter of neutrality and the Government's intentions is now as much a matter of trust between the people on the one hand and the broken promises that Fianna Fáil made regarding the Partnership for Peace? Does he accept there is a necessity to give the people a sense of ownership and control in how they wish to determine their relationship with any future defence alignment <Col N="1018" /> that may emerge in Europe? It is not for this generation to determine what subsequent generations may or may not wish to do. It is for this generation of politicians to recognise the strength of the people's sentiment and to formally and explicitly vest control of neutrality in the Constitution, so that it can be owned by the people and be left to them to decide on retaining it or changing it.</P>

      <P>We set out to get a strong political declaration. All the legal guarantees we needed are in the treaties. It was not a question of opting out or looking for a reason to do so. We wanted to get a clear position on what our understanding was and to be able to put that clearly before the people. We also wanted to ensure that the legal secretariat, the Commission and the other member states agreed with that. We did that so people could trust what the position is. I can accept what Deputy Quinn has said. When people see what is in the declaration they will know that if there is a change it will be because it is a UN mission accompanied by a decision of both the Government and the Dáil. It is now clear what the position is. The declaration has set that out.</P>

      <P>The political declaration was signed by everybody and the applicant countries would have signed it had we asked them. They share this understanding. I agree with what Deputy Gay Mitchell said about the value of putting out the declaration. If is tied into the Constitution people will raise further questions and clarification will be sought by the courts. That is the danger of that position. Some people say a political declaration can be changed but this is as solemn a position as the treaties. I do not think there is any doubt in any quarter that there is anything in the treaties which pulls away from Irish military neutrality. That fear is not there.</P>

      <P>I understand the issue of immigration was high on the agenda in Seville and that the Spanish Presidency, in particular, had proposals to make in that regard. However, it appears from press reports that not as much progress was made as had been hoped by the Presidency. Will the Taoiseach tell the House if a review was done of the investment by the European Union in countries which are the source of traditional immigration in terms of trying to give people the opportunity to make an economic living at home and ensure the places from which immigrants are coming are secure and stable? Were those issues at the top of the agenda in the discussion on immigration? </P>

      <P>They were on the agenda. The President of France made a long and supportive statement. We said we recognised the need for a co-ordinated and coherent approach to assist the countries of origin of asylum seekers and legal immigrants. We said we supported all the efforts to adopt an integrated approach between migration policy and environment policy. We will make progress on this issue if we co-operate within Europe. If everyone does their own thing, there will be migration and asylum seekers and we will not make any progress. I quoted the submission by the UNHCR to the Council which stated primary solutions must be found in the region of origin and that they must be financially supported. Without such assistance, refugees will not move to a better future. The submission also stated it was urgent to make development aid and migration work for rather than against each other. We and many other countries said the emphasis should be on supporting the development of countries experiencing large-scale economic migration, which is ODA. We have given vast resources to ODA. We must also remember the opportunities which are necessary for the Union to work with these countries. It was emphasised that as long as people were poor, deprived and had difficulties in life, they would <Col N="1020" /> travel. The Union must vote through ODA resources and aid programmes to help to solve the problems in the countries of origin.</P>

He was at pains in his text this evening to make such an impression.

If that is the case &ndash; I remember asking him the same question last year &ndash; will he <Col N="1021" /> confirm that a referendum will be held to enshrine neutrality in the Constitution? If he does not do so, will he explain the reason? If the Treaty of Nice does not pose a threat and Fianna Fáil policy has not changed, why will he not accommodate a proposal which other Deputies and I have repeatedly presented to him in recent years?

      <P>The Irish tourism industry is facing one of its most difficult periods in recent years. It is in the interest of the tens of thousands of Irish jobs in the tourism sector that are on the line that Fine Gael is moving this Private Members' motion this evening and it is vital now that the Government tackles this crisis head on. If it does not act, it risks losing a substantial amount of money that goes to the Exchequer in direct and indirect taxes from tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, a staggering &euro;2 billion went into the State coffers from tourism, while &euro;5.1 billion was generated by the industry. Some 145,000 people <Col N="1023" /> are employed in the tourism sector, 60,000 of them working in hotels and guesthouses alone. Lest the true magnitude of the problem is lost on the Minister, as it seems to have been on the negotiating teams for the programme for Government, I propose to outline the reality of tourism in Ireland in 2002.</P>
    <P>The number of visitors from the United States is likely to be down one quarter on the numbers that came here in 2000. While Britain is spending &euro;11 million marketing itself in the US this summer, Ireland's promotional budget has already run dry. The numbers coming from Britain will only improve if there is a late surge in booking. However, Ireland does not currently have any marketing campaign in place for the British market. There is likely to be a fall-off in the level of coach tours of around 40%, threatening closure of countless businesses, including many in the county the Minister and I share.</P>
    <P>The continental European market is static, with problems being experienced in the Benelux and Scandinavian markets. The situation is particularly bad in Germany, with every sector except those visiting friends and relations, reportedly down. Visitors from overseas areas other than North America and continental Europe have slumped by 10%. There is nothing short of an emergency in Irish tourism and Fine Gael is now calling on the Government to act swiftly and decisively before it is too late.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, the case that all of this was predictable, and plans should have been put in place long before now. A global recession has been on the cards for two years. The foot and mouth outbreak in spring 2001 should have set alarm bells ringing at Cabinet and the tragic events of 11 September were bound to have a detrimental impact on tourism numbers, especially transatlantic traffic. None of these events, it seems, registered with the Government and the Minister's predecessor, and the Government of which he remains a member must take the blame for the lack of preparedness in the Government's tourism strategy that has forced us to move this motion tonight.</P>
    <P>In the past ten years, one in every three new jobs created here has resulted directly from the growth in tourism. The Exchequer benefits by 57 cent for every euro an overseas tourist spends when they arrive here. That is how vital tourism is to the survival of the Celtic tiger. It has been one of the engines behind our economic success and is now seriously threatened due to the negligence of the current Administration. The industry is sure about what needs to be done, even if the Government is not. We on this side of the House are aware of what needs to be done too.</P>
    <P>The first most glaring problem is how to communicate an image of Ireland into the living rooms of potential visitors. Marketing the country as a holiday destination is vital to the success of tourism here, yet we are bereft of a current marketing strategy in Britain and the United States. <Col N="1024" /> Following the foot and mouth outbreak, the &euro;8 million of additional marketing expenditure resulted in more than &euro;130 million in visitor expenditure, &euro;40 million of which was recouped by the Exchequer. It is vital that we convey the message to the world that Ireland is a country waiting for visitors and that there is nowhere better in the world to spend a few weeks. Unless that is done immediately, we risk losing market share to other countries with bigger budgets and more economic muscle.</P>
    <P>At a time when Martin Sheen and Rob Lowe from &ldquo;The West Wing&rdquo; are urging Americans to visit Washington, Ireland must do something to encourage Americans to go somewhat further and cross the Atlantic. Tourism Ireland used Martin Sheen this year very effectively to promote Ireland in the early part of the season. However, despite its success, the campaign has been discontinued due to lack of funding. As Britain pumps &euro;65 million into marketing itself in the wake of the double blow of foot and mouth disease and 11 September, our Government is spending less on marketing than last year. This is another example of how Ireland is being left behind.</P>
    <P>The Minister must now spell out what his Government intends to do to regain the initiative in the vital British and American markets and must make additional funding available to Tourism Ireland to do its job effectively. The hands of Tourism Ireland cannot be tied by a Government unwilling to invest the money needed to support tens of thousands of jobs. The impression is given that in the midst of its electioneering and election give-aways, the Government cared little about our biggest indigenous industry. If this is not the case, let the Minister prove it by accepting Fine Gael's proposal to allocate extra funds. It is the only way we can make progress in regaining lost tourist numbers, lost revenue and lost jobs in this vital sector.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country, the cries for help are deafening. A large Kerry hotel, with which the Minister would be very familiar, has witnessed a downturn in the coach business so great that in March of this year it catered for just three coach tours as opposed to 72 in March 2001. Even with those businesses which are doing okay, things are tough. Business currently being conducted is often at cost price or below it just to keep the visitors coming in the hope that a profit may eventually be returned at some point in the future. This is a dangerous strategy for businesses.</P>
    <P>Visitor numbers to our numerous visitors' centres and attractions throughout the country are down considerably on previous years. Statistics do not show the true level of the problem on the ground. For example, the CSO reported that at the height of the foot and mouth outbreak, visitors from Britain to the western region grew by 27.4%. This is hard to square with the surveys reported from three out of four premises showing that numbers were actually down.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" />Hotels in a number of regions, particularly in Dublin, Galway and the Shannon region, including Kerry, and right across the country are facing real difficulties. I am sure my colleagues will give example after example of hotels and other tourism-related businesses that are under severe difficulties at the moment.</P>
    <P>It cannot be overstated how important it is that Tourism Ireland launches an immediate marketing campaign targeting the vital UK and North American markets. For every &euro;1 spent on Government funded marketing programmes, there is a &euro;50 return to the State. We do not call for more spending in the motion, rather we insist on tourism being given the extra investment it deserves.</P>
    <P>It is sad that we are debating this issue. The foot and mouth disease outbreak, the events of 11 September and the United States recession were out of the hands of the Government, but the last five years of economic prosperity, a prosperity it inherited from the rainbow Government, should have put Ireland in a much better position to withstand these economic shocks.</P>
    <P>What has the Government done to alleviate the other issue holding back the tourism industry? Ireland is an island nation and for a vibrant tourism industry to thrive, access is paramount. No effort must be spared in ensuring Aer Lingus provides as many direct routes into the country as possible and that provision for low cost airlines flying directly to Dublin, Shannon, Cork, Kerry and other airports is made as quickly as possible. This Administration's record in giving support to our national airline and giving the best deal to air commuters has not been glowing. It is to be hoped that the commitment made in the programme for Government on a fast turn around facility at Dublin Airport is delivered. Over the coming years, Fine Gael will monitor the Minister every week to ensure that it is implemented.</P>
    <P>How can Ireland compete with major travel destinations when, to get here, most international visitors cannot avail of cheap flights and must endure the extra cost and inconvenience of flying via London, Amsterdam or Rome? On checking the cost of flights this evening, I discovered that it would cost $1,100 to travel directly from the United States to Ireland. By contrast, it is possible to travel to United Kingdom airports from the United States for $500. That gives the United Kingdom an immediate advantage as a holiday destination. Until tourists can take their pick of low cost airlines and seek to fly directly into the country from a major international city at reasonable cost, Ireland cannot hope to compete on a truly level playing pitch. The Minister and his colleagues in Government must turn their mind to opening up this country to tourism like never before, or else face the prospect of ever decreasing tourism numbers, revenue and industry jobs.</P>
    <P>Something must also be done about the increasing burden of cost that is being placed on those operating within the tourism sector. Insurance costs, another great area of Government failure, grew by an average of 48% last year. <Col N="1026" /> An aggressive stance must be taken to end the compensation culture, endemic in this country and unchecked by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government should also ensure that the insurance compensation fund provides assistance to Irish businesses exposed to claims after the collapse of the Independent Insurance Group in the UK, following which 30 Irish hotels, which have been exposed to claims totalling &euro;12 million, have seen the company with which they are insured put into provisional liquidation.</P>
    <P>The environment also offers a challenge to the Government to take action. The litter problem and the need to ensure Ireland's green image is a reality for tourists when they arrive are vital to attracting visitors and ensuring they return.</P>
    <P>The national convention centre is another vital plank of the Government's tourism strategy. It has been much talked about, but remains only a matter of Government rhetoric. The Minister has been called on by the ITOA and others to spell out exactly what the Government means when it states in its programme that it will ensure the construction of a state of the art national conference centre. Such a centre is long overdue and will prove pivotal to ensuring Ireland continues to attract the conference travel business it has been so good at attracting in recent years.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the programme for Government does not give any details on what shape the conference centre will take, when and where it will be built, how much it will cost, how many it will cater for and so on. If the Government is to be credible, it must spell out how it intends to proceed. If it does not do so, it will lose the confidence of the tourism sector and add to the falling morale in tourism-related businesses, which already feel ignored and neglected. The industry must be in a position to incorporate the centre into their marketing and promotional campaigns so that the word can go out that Ireland is serious about catering for its visitors and that it can boast the same world-class facilities other competing countries can offer.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister met the Kerry hotels' federation yesterday. There is a serious problem not only in County Kerry, but across the country. Tourism in Ireland is not being promoted in America. It is not visible in the media. This year, Americans are making decisions about their holidays later than usual. Now and over the coming weeks they will finalise their plans. They usually visit Ireland in October and it is very important the Minister finds the revenue to target this market. People in the United Kingdom traditionally make up their minds later. The country is only a stone's throw from Ireland and the market there is waiting to be exploited, yet there is no presence there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for introducing this motion and I congratulate the Minister on his new portfolio. I hope he will be very successful. Tourism is a very important and useful industry. It is also one of the few industries <Col N="1027" /> that is regionally based. In any regional development programme, tourism is at the centre because irrespective of how centralised the economy is, it is impossible to transpose tourism sites, such as the lakes of Killarney, to Dublin. Investment programmes should always play to that strength by ensuring that investment in the industry is dispersed around the country, including Counties Mayo, Clare and Galway.</P>
      <P>The tourism industry has had four or five great years and it cannot be denied that there has been a huge increase in the number of visitors to the country. Despite this, it appears that the impetus has gone out of the industry. It suffered many body blows last year, about which nothing could be done, and I am told by many in the industry that the signals for this year are not encouraging. In view of this, it is necessary to give advertising in the industry another kick-start.</P>
      <P>Many hoteliers tell me that the American trade does not look good for the rest of the year. According to my inquiries, some of the hotels are doing well but many others are not. For example, one hotel told me that June was well down on other years and that the outlook for the rest of the year does not look good. Another hotel in Galway told me that while the season to date was acceptable, June, a very important month, was well down on last year. Another hotel in Galway referred to a very poor take-up on bed nights until it drastically reduced the rates. It meant working for nothing to keep the hotel going. The Irish Town and Country Homes Association states that the season to date has been very poor, Farmhouse Holidays in Ireland reports its season is very bad. I am told by the Galway craft shop industry that the season to date was slightly down for the first five months but that June was very bad, which is a very worrying sign. To date, passenger numbers for sea cruising in Galway are down by 18%.</P>
      <P>The fishing sector has been very badly hit. The North West Regional Fisheries Board advises that due to the exceptionally high water levels, there is a huge decrease in the number of visitors to the north Mayo and Ballina areas. The reasons for this are weather related. I have been informed that there is a 75% reduction on last year's sea angling numbers around Achill and that many of the bookings that were made have been cancelled. That is bad news for that scenic but remote area and many people are extremely worried about what is happening there. I suggest to the Minister that now is the time to take the initiative. It need not be very costly to do so. I am aware that advertising is expensive in America but if it is targeted, it would provide the reassurance that Ireland is still the place to which they should come. I have no doubt that our natural beauty and assets are unrivalled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also have to look closely at competitive pricing and other areas that I do not have time to address. The Minister would be well advised to get extra Exchequer funding and ensure it is <Col N="1028" /> spent in the right way both in the UK and America.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Chomhairle, ba mhaith liom i dtosach mo comhghairdeas a ghabháil leatsa agus leis an Aire as ucht an phoist nua atá agaibh agus tá súil agam go mbeimid in ann oibriú le chéile insan áit seo.</P>
      <P>The tourism sector is a very serious and important industry which is a very large income earner and employer. Bord Fáilte has described the current state of the tourism industry as a wash-out. We have had a particularly bad year but we have also been affected by international events, particularly with regard to terrorism, which have affected and will continue to affect where people will take their holidays. Although it is a very popular destination for Irish tourists, the terrorist bombs in Spain last week will prompt many people to change their minds about going there. Since the Good Friday Agreement, in particular, Ireland is an ideal holiday location. The Minister and his Department must spend as much money as possible to target the people who are in the process of changing their minds.</P>
      <P>I was saddened to read an article in the <i>Evening Herald</i> last week which stated that one of the most renowned bed and breakfast's in the Gaeltacht area of Connemara, which has 14 bedrooms had just four visitors last weekend. That is a serious matter and we need a focused marketing strategy from the Government to address it.</P>
      <P>The question of America is very much in our minds. Parity between the dollar and euro presents a difficulty in that costs will rise for Americans coming here. We have an issue to address in terms of costs and making Ireland more attractive as a destination. I agree with Deputy Deenihan's point about the difference in airfares depending on which way one travels between America and Ireland. We need to have a much more aggressive marketing campaign aimed at Irish-Americans in particular. The same article in the <i>Evening Herald </i>pointed out that Americans not alone believe that foot and mouth disease still exists here, but that if they come here they may contract it. That is incredible but true.</P>
      <P>Coming from County Louth, I urge the Minister to make contact with his colleague the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, in regard to a toll which is proposed for the town of Drogheda, which will affect many thousands of tourists who will come from north of the Border to visit Drogheda and the Boyne Valley. As they come off the new motorway they will pay a toll to visit the town and a second one on leaving it to visit the Boyne Valley, Newgrange and so on. That is unacceptable and will have a serious and detrimental impact on the tourism and trade of the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Irish people, especially with young families, wish to holiday in Ireland. There have been changes especially in regard to the licensing laws and it is now possible for people with young families to get food up to 7 p.m. in pubs. There is a <Col N="1029" /> lack of adequate investment in indoor recreation and amenity throughout the country and as somebody who has spent the last 20 bliain ag dul go dtí Corca Dhuibhne, níl aon rud ansin ach an Ghaeltacht féin. Níl aon áit ann gur féidir le clann dul ann, seachas óstán nó pub. Ba chóir go mbeadh a lán áiteanna eile, mar shampla linn snámha nó áit inar féidir cluichí a imirt nó a bheadh sásúil do pháistí óga. Níl go leor acu sa tír. We need investment in indoor recreational amenity outside of pubs and hotels for young families in particular; that might encourage young families to holiday in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the motion proposed by my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, I run the risk of being called a whinger but I will take this chance as the situation is very serious. In my own county of Meath, tourists are more scarce than hair on an egg, or even Meath goals in the match on Sunday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG" hpid="Mr. English Mr. English">
      <NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not mention next Sunday. In the past few months a hotel in County Meath that caters mainly for American tourists has had one American guest. That hotel is under serious financial pressure, as are many other hotels, and it is our duty to help.</P>
      <P>We all remember the rhetoric and fine words of the Government during the foot and mouth crisis. We were told the Government would not be found wanting when this phase was behind us, but that is not case. What extra resources have been made available to see these promises through? The people of counties Donegal, Kerry, Mayo and even my own County Meath played their part during the crisis; indeed they went beyond the call of duty to ensure the plague was kept at bay. Many groups unbegrudgingly called off sporting and entertainment events. I had first-hand experience of this as I was involved in a festival committee in my home town of Navan. The Government did not direct us to call off events, but rather advised us to think hard about it. Like many other groups we acted from loyalty to this country by calling off our festival. People cancelled their plans and deserve to be rewarded for that. I know what the cancellation cost our committee, but it was only a fraction of the cost to the many families and businesses that are in the tourism sector and have invested heavily in facilities to attract and cater for tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people were encouraged to invest heavily by Government. Many of them used their houses as security and built their businesses around their homes. If these businesses were to fail, it would lead to a loss of jobs, which in itself would be a disaster, but also to the loss of family homes. To apportion blame for the foot and mouth crisis is another day's work, but it is wrong to make thousands of families involved in the tourism sector its victims, and for this I blame the Government. The Government has not done <Col N="1030" /> enough to help the tourism industry since the FMD crisis or since 11 September and no extra funding has been invested into marketing Ireland abroad to address the obvious and predicted drop in tourist numbers due to the World Cup. If the people on the street knew this, then surely to God the Department knew it. It is not too late.</P>
    <P>If we give more resources to tourism marketing, an effective campaign will make up for the lack of investment to date. It will make up for the problems I have outlined and for the bad weather conditions. The price of insurance has certainly not helped but that is another debate to which I look forward. Failure to make additional resources available will, as I have already said, spell disaster for many. We must present a positive message. We must show that we are prepared to back our tourism industry and show how important it is to our economy. We must acknowledge that visitor numbers are down on previous years and unless action is taken now, jobs, homes, etc., will be lost, both directly and indirectly. It is up to the Minister to make available the funding that the tourism sector needs and deserves. Let us stop fighting over cents because it does not make any sense to let our tourism market drop.</P>
    <P>Tourism is vital to Ireland's economy. It does not take anything from our country. It does not involve the removal of natural resources, a requirement for open cast mining or a rapid deterioration of our environment. The only requirement is that the tourist has a good time and leaves our country happy. For the tourist to have a good time, however, we must get him or her here. We must market abroad to get the tourists here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatBreen" hpid="Mr. P. Breen Mr. P. Breen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish the Minister well in his new brief and hope he is tremendously successful in it.</P>
      <P>Last year was a bad year for tourism. There was the foot and mouth disease crisis, which affected us in the prime months of April, May, June and July, and the horrifying events of 11 September, which devastated the tourism industry in the later half of 2001 and which still affects us ten months later. When one adds to this the miserable weather conditions over the past two months which have affected the domestic market, the outlook is very bleak.</P>
      <P>Most commentators compare the figures for the first six months of this year with those of 2001 and the current indications are that tourist numbers are down about 15%. It would probably be more realistic to compare these figures with 2000. In that case, that percentage would be much higher &ndash; possibly 20% or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, stated, there are 145,000 people working in the tourism business in Ireland, that is, one in every 12 jobs. Some &euro;2 billion went into the Exchequer last year in indirect and direct taxes from the sector. In County Clare, the barometer for indicating the tourist numbers in the region is the number of <Col N="1031" /> people attending the castle banquets at Bunratty, Dunguaire and Knappogue and attendance is considerably down on previous years. In addition, transatlantic business is down by 21% as a result of fewer flights on the transatlantic route and as a result of few Americans travelling into Europe because of the events of 11 September. Whereas last year there were Aer Lingus flights from New York airport and from Washington, this year these are no longer taking place because of the cutbacks in Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Over the weekend I talked to a number of prominent guesthouse owners in the area. This is the first time in many years that many of their guesthouses were empty for the June bank holiday weekend. Neither had they any walk-in business, which is normal for this time of the year. I also spoke to a prominent Ennis hotelier who told me that there are no coach tours anymore.</P>
    <P>The Government must take immediate steps to protect this important industry. In recent months the British Tourism Authority &ndash; BTA &ndash; has marketed a huge newspaper and television advertising campaign here to publicise the various regions in England and the American Government has done likewise by investing millions of dollars to protect its tourism business. As Deputy Deenihan stated, the additional expenditure of &euro;8 million in 2001 which followed the foot and mouth disease crisis generated &euro;130 million in visitor spending last year. If &euro;20 million was invested in marketing funding, it would boost visitor spending by &euro;300 million, with &euro;180 million ending up in the Government's coffers.</P>
    <P>Low-cost airlines must be encouraged into the west of Ireland as that area will always be the first to suffer from a tourism slow-down. The terminal at Shannon Airport, which cost &euro;30 million in 1997, can handle up to 5.5 million passengers but is handling only 2.2 million passengers at present. Ryanair promised that four new routes into Shannon would be opened in return for Pier D and this promise must be honoured. More competition by low-cost airlines must be developed, particularly following the merger of Go and Easy Jet. The four European routes which Ryanair currently operates from Shannon are very successful and bring many low-cost passengers into the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>The Minister must look into the rip-off which followed the introduction of the euro in 2002. We share a common currency with our European neighbours and this must be promoted with our European colleagues.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to make additional funding available to Tourism Ireland to launch an immediate marketing campaign in the US, in the UK and in the rest of Europe so as we can win back the critical market share in these countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him well. It is unfortunate that his entry into office seems to coincide with a downturn in the tourism <Col N="1032" /> industry. In that regard, we all must put our shoulders to the wheel and offer what assistance we can.</P>
      <P>The time for referring back to last year is gone. This year is a new era and what happened last year, with the foot and mouth disease crisis and other matters, is history. There is a danger that the industry might decline, using that as the excuse for the problem. There is no sense in looking for excuses. We must compete and the competition is tough. As previous speakers have said, we are competing against our next door neighbours and other holiday offering facilities all over the world, and all over Europe in particular.</P>
      <P>There are three grounds on which we can compete, that is, hospitality, price and standards, and all three grounds have a very serious impact on what happens. If there is a bad year in the business, it tends to replicate in the following year because the experiences are still fresh in people's minds. Therefore the kind of promotions to which my colleagues have been referring are needed urgently to encourage people to take up the offers and to encourage the hotel industry and the catering industry. It will be too late in a month's time. It is needed now. It is in everybody's interests to bring together the best thinking available to concentrate on the business at this stage and to see what can be salvaged from it for the rest of the year. We are only half way through the year and there is sufficient time left to recover if everybody recognises that they have a role to play and plays it.</P>
      <P>We should appeal to domestic tourists, many of whom, for want of fine weather, tend to go abroad. However, we can still compete, even in that area. In the past we were always able to compete, even when the weather was bad. Even in the rain, we had something different to offer. We need to ensure that adequate resources are made available to the industry to promote itself and to ensure that it is capable of competing with anybody.</P>
      <P>No doubt the events of 11 September had a negative impact but we must recover from such situations and there is no use in waiting for two or three years to recover. We must recover quickly. It is important that the Minister put in place whatever resources are required by the industry in general to give it an opportunity to recover early rather than late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must remember that there is another aspect to all of this. There are a number of issues which have been mentioned by my colleagues like the differential between the euro and the dollar, which has a negative impact from our point of view in attracting tourists here, and there are a number of other issues which have arisen in terms of the economy generally which have a tendency to leave a bit of a question mark over it. There is a grave danger that an industry would suffer unnecessarily as a result of talking itself into gloom. Success is still there for the taking. It is up to all those involved to put their shoulders to the wheel and do the job that has to be done in order <Col N="1033" /> that we can avail of some kind of recovery in the current year. The weather forecast should not be the only criteria to determine where people will go on holiday. The weather forecast should not determine whether a hotel has its doors open, whether its beds are full or whether there are tours arranged and operating in an area. It should not all be down to the weather forecast. It is also down to the Minister who must lead the charge and co-ordinate the efforts of everybody involved. He must assist, encourage and promote what we have going for us, which we were always able to use in the past to cope with all eventualities. We should be able to do the same now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" />I welcome the opportunity this evening to address the House on the current circumstances in the Irish tourism sector. Coming as I do from Kerry, which is arguably the home of Irish tourism, I believe I have a good appreciation of the importance of the industry to the national and local economy. In my first week in office as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, I took the initiative of meeting the chief executives of the key tourism State agencies to get an initial briefing on the most critical issues facing the sector and the current state of the tourism season. Later this week, I will meet a high level delegation from the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation &ndash; the key industry representative group &ndash; to hear at first hand its assessment of the situation and to see what the Government can usefully do to help. My intention is to be a listening Minister and to have an open door policy in respect of the industry and the main Opposition spokespersons and Members of this House, building on the partnership approach which was successfully developed by my predecessors.</P>
    <P>It is useful to reflect on the scale and success of the development of Irish tourism over the past decade. Up to last year, we had ten successive years of uninterrupted growth in which overseas visitor numbers doubled to over six million and foreign revenue earnings increased threefold to almost &euro;4 billion. International comparisons showed us to be one of the strongest growing European tourist destinations. The industry flourished and investment reached unprecedented heights with the support of Exchequer and EU funding.</P>
    <P>Today the industry supports in the region of 145,000 jobs and makes a major contribution to our economy. My objective as Minister, reflecting the Agreed Programme for Government, is to help to ensure that tourism will continue to be a vital industry and that it gets the necessary sustained support and investment in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Last year the industry faced its first setback in many years, with the double blow of the foot and mouth crisis in the spring and the aftermath of the tragic events of 11 September in the US. However, although there were varying fortunes within and between sectors and regions, the hard evidence is that we coped well. This was due to a combination of resolute actions at industry and Government levels. While official CSO figures for 2001 show that the number of overseas visitors to Ireland fell by 5% in comparison with 2000, they were still at an extremely healthy level of over six million. Even more remarkable is the fact that despite this first decline in numbers in over ten years, total foreign revenue earnings from all overseas visits in 2001 actually increased by nearly 8% to &euro;3.96 billion. In addition, domestic holiday business remained buoyant last year, with expenditure rising by 16% according to Bord Fáilte figures. Contrast this with the circumstances in Britain, where British Tourist Authority figures indicate that there was a 7% decline <Col N="1035" /> in overseas visitor numbers and a drop of 14% in revenue compared to 2000.</P>
    <P>While evidence from a CERT employment survey shows there was a marginal reduction in permanent employment in Irish tourism, recruitment of skilled staff remains a continuing challenge for the sector, with evidence of a continuing interest in recruiting labour from third countries. There was little hard evidence of major permanent job losses or closures in 2001, although margins were undoubtedly under pressure in many cases.</P>
    <P>As official CSO figures are not yet available for tourism performance in 2002, it is very difficult at this stage to predict the outcome of this year's season. While air and sea passenger movements are up on last year, the indications are that outbound business is more buoyant than inbound business. Recent qualitative industry surveys by Bord Fáilte and CERT show a mixed picture, with equal numbers of respondents indicating higher and lower levels of business than last year.</P>
    <P>Tourism Ireland believes that the first part of the year was reasonably good with a good response from the British market, which has been the major focus of its marketing activity. The German market is soft for outward travel generally, but France and the southern continental destinations have produced a good response. The US market continues to be a challenge, with the pace of recovery slower than was hoped. It is of interest that US Airlines is reporting that its peak season is generally slacker than anticipated so that Ireland will not be the only country experiencing continuing difficulties in respect of the US market. It cannot be ruled out that the recent reversal in US psychology, the drop in the value of its currency and its financial markets and the perception of its economic prospects may also impact on US visitor numbers.</P>
    <P>There are indications that the very strong performance in the domestic market towards the latter part of 2001 has continued into 2002 and this has been beneficial to many businesses, especially hotels. Tourism operators will have to continue to offer competitive prices and good value if they are to retain this market. It is a matter of concern that recent price surveys indicate a level of price inflation in the hospitality sector which is considerably above the national average.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the World Cup will have an impact on travel trends this year, especially in June. It does seem that there has been some softening in the British market in the past three to four weeks and some commentators have linked this to the World Cup. The combination of poor weather and the World Cup may also have had an adverse impact on domestic tourism. It is clear too that all major markets have witnessed a marked shortening of the booking period, which has created an ongoing and understandable sense of anxiety on the part of the industry, and has made it extremely difficult to call the season.</P>
    <P>A much shorter booking horizon combined with overall softness in the US market meant that <Col N="1036" /> the coach tour business has taken a hit and this is borne out by some general operator surveys emerging from Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development. This may impact, in particular, on destinations such as Killarney, Blarney and Connemara, which have a traditional dependence on coach business. However, it is not clear whether the decline in the escorted coach tour business reflects a short-term reaction to geopolitical uncertainty and economic softness in the US market or represents the acceleration of a fundamental long-term trend towards more independent travel, driven in particular by the Internet. If the latter is the case, then it will be a major challenge for those resorts and businesses which have been traditionally dependent on the coach tour phenomenon to re-orient themselves to deal with possible new market realities.</P>
    <P>This year has seen the largest ever budget deployed for the international marketing of the island of Ireland. Tourism Ireland Limited, which was successfully launched towards the end of last year, has a total budget of &euro;50 million this year, of which &euro;27 million represents direct programme spend. This is supplemented by substantial budgets for regional and product marketing by Bord Fáilte of the order of &euro;25 million with special incentives in the areas of sports tourism and a new budget for festivals and cultural events. Tourism Ireland, in close consultation with the tourism industry through the tourism marketing partnership structure, took a strategic decision to front load its marketing spend for 2002. While this means that our international advertising campaigns are now virtually complete, the benefits of our marketing efforts earlier this year are still flowing and general promotional work will continue up to the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the tourism industry, principally through ITIC, has been pressing for additional State funding for marketing this year. Given the high level of our existing tourism spend relative to comparable destinations and the general pressure on the public finances, my Department has not been convinced to date of the need for incremental marketing funding. However, certain expenditure within the existing tourism budget has already been redeployed. This has allowed the advertising programmes in certain key territories to be extended somewhat. I understand there may be some limited scope for further redeployment of funds to front line marketing activity and I will consider the options in consultation with the State agencies and the industry later this week. Those who argue for more funds for Tourism Ireland must be absolutely clear about how much can be usefully spent and when, where and on what they want to spend it. A clear order of priorities must be set out. There would seem, for instance, to be little sense in spending money now to try to attract additional US peak season business.</P>
    <P>While I accept that urgent decisions are required, it is equally important that the decisions taken are the right ones. It is critical to get the <Col N="1037" /> best advice from the industry and the State tourism agencies before deciding if such extra activity would be productive and cost effective. Consultation and agreement with the Northern authorities, who have joint responsibility for the operation and financing of Tourism Ireland, would also be desirable. I would also like to explore with the industry the options for its making a direct financial contribution to any additional front line marketing activity this year, as was the case with the recent British advertising campaign. While marketing is a key element of Government policy for the tourism sector, I am convinced that a much broader strategy is required to underpin the medium-term and long-term growth of the sector. As Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism I will pursue such a policy on the basis of the actions set out in the Agreed Programme for Government. I take the opportunity this evening of outlining the principal actions proposed.</P>
    <P>We will broaden our source markets so that we are not over-reliant on any one market and, in particular, seek to increase our share of the continental European market. Tourism Brand Ireland was redeveloped last year at a cost to the Exchequer of some &euro;5 million and is being successfully rolled out this year by Tourism Ireland. Brand presence will be maintained in all key markets. While a strong effort was maintained this year in the US market, bearing in mind the continuing difficulties in that market there will be a particular focus on developing business from the British and mainland European markets.</P>
    <P>The Department has been pressing Tourism Ireland and Bord Fáilte for some time about our poor relative performance in terms of attracting holiday visitors from the key continental European markets, particularly Germany and France. The German outbound market &ndash; the largest in the world &ndash; has been soft in recent years due to general economic difficulties but we must reposition ourselves there and get more business. Tourism Ireland is due to undertake a fundamental reappraisal of all overseas markets over the coming year and I will seek to accelerate this review in light of the commitment in the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>We will foster expansion and competition on air and sea routes. The maintenance of competitive access links by air and sea to Ireland is critical to future success in tourism. We are particularly well served by the levels of investment in recent years in sea access. We have seen the emergence of a high quality and competitive route network across the Irish Sea and to France. My Department will work closely with the new Department of Transport to safeguard as much of the air access route infrastructure as possible so that as traveller confidence is restored and as the recovery comes we will be best placed to avail of it. The extension by Aer Rianta of its incentive scheme for new routes to Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports is encouraging and I welcome the new air services for 2002 which will go some way to compensating for the loss of services arising <Col N="1038" /> from the shake-out of the airline sector that has occurred since the events of 11 September.</P>
    <P>I also very much support the decision for Aer Rianta to proceed immediately with the provision of a rapid turna-round facility at Dublin Airport to meet the specific needs of carriers operating at the lower-fares end of the market. My colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, will closely monitor this project to ensure that Aer Rianta provides the facility at the lowest possible cost, taking full account of the needs of the low fares carriers, and has the facility operational at the earliest possible date. I will also ask Tourism Ireland to work closely with the air carriers and with Aer Rianta to ensure greater co-ordination and co-operation in marketing activities.</P>
    <P>We will support Tourism Ireland Limited in its work of promoting the whole island of Ireland as a tourist destination. The agreement with our Northern counterparts under the Good Friday Agreement is to sustain an annual programme marketing budget in the order of &euro;27 million for Tourism Ireland. Our immediate priorities are to establish the new company in terms of personnel, operations and overseas office network and to establish its credibility with the industry at home and overseas. The company has a strong, industry-orientated board with which I hope to work closely. The new North-South arrangements have already delivered incremental funding to the marketing effort, with the largest ever all-island destination marketing campaign budget of &euro;27 million for this year financed on a South-North 2:1 basis.</P>
    <P>We will complete the task of creating a new national tourism development authority which will complement the work of Tourism Ireland Limited. Following high level consultations with Bord Fáilte and CERT, the previous Government last November approved the creation of a national tourism development authority to promote the development of sustainable tourist facilities and services, including the promotion of training, human resources and marketing skills. In January, my predecessor established an implementation group to report back to him with an implementation plan for the establishment of the new body. The group consulted widely, within the time available, with representatives of the tourism industry, staff representatives in both Bord Fáilte and CERT, the regional tourism authorities and Tourism Ireland Limited and produced its report in April.</P>
    <P>The report sets out a clear vision, mission statement and top organisational structure for the new body. It outlines a number of clear steps to be taken so that the new body will be in place for the 2003 tourism season. These include the appointment of an interim board, the early appointment of a chief executive officer-designate, liaison arrangements with staff and links with other bodies. I am making early arrangements for the appointment of an interim board and have asked my Department to move forward with the establishment of the new body as a matter of priority. The draft legislation <Col N="1039" /> to give legal effect to the new body is currently with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and I hope to bring it through this House and the Seanad at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>We will ensure the construction of a state of the art national conference centre and promote Ireland as a venue for international conference business. Much preparatory and planning work has already been carried out on the case for a dedicated national conference centre, including commissioning a major consultancy review last year on maximising Ireland's position in the international conference market. I have asked my Department to examine the options to deliver on the Government's commitment with a view to presenting the position to Government later this year.</P>
    <P>We will put the maintenance of standards and services at the top of the tourism agenda. Bord Fáilte's visitor attitude surveys show that Ireland is highly rated by visitors, surpassing the expectations of one third of visitors in 2001 when only 4% expressed disappointment with their holiday experience. However, there are growing indications that standards and service may be slipping and that the quality of the Irish welcome may be under threat.</P>
    <P>CERT has initiated a number of programmes, including the Best Practice Programme, Ireland's Best Service Excellence Programme and Award and the RETAIN initiative to assist tourism and hospitality businesses to undergo the process of moving towards best practice and achieving the highest standards of excellence. Earlier today I launched a new national awards scheme for Bord Fáilte which will recognise individual excellence in this area. My intention is to ensure that due regard is given in establishing the National Tourism Development Authority to the maintenance of standards and quality assurance as envisaged in the report of the implementation group.</P>
    <P>We will continue to support the bed and breakfast and small accommodation sector through specific marketing initiatives. Bord Fáilte already provides a programme of supports for small and medium sized enterprises, including a special initiative for bed and breakfasts, farmhouses and small hotels. Co-operative marketing opportunities through product marketing groups will be encouraged as the most effective means of accessing overseas markets in a cost effective way.</P>
    <P>We will encourage year-round activity-based and special interest tourism. This objective will be pursued principally through the new tourism product development scheme which was launched in January 2002. This includes three principal categories of projects: the development of major attractors and clusters of attractors; the development of special interest pursuits; and tourism environmental management. Independent product management boards have recently been appointed to assess projects under this scheme <Col N="1040" /> which have been submitted following an open call for applications earlier this year.</P>
    <P>We will ensure that local authorities take account of the needs of the tourism industry in the provision of infrastructure. My Department will use every opportunity available to it to press the case for ensuring that the needs of tourism are taken into account in determining the infrastructural needs and priorities of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>We will promote sensitive development of tourism areas and encourage environmental best practice among tourism providers. Projects selected for support under the tourism product development scheme will have to demonstrate that they have taken account of the best practice that emerged from the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999, pilot initiative on tourism and the environment. In addition, we will ensure that due regard is given in establishing the National Tourism Development Authority to integrating a strong environmental focus with its product development functions, as envisaged in the report of the implementation group.</P>
    <P>I have set out my initial assessment of this year's tourism season and have outlined the general policy objectives which will guide my work over the coming years in line with the Agreed Programme for Government. I intend consulting widely with the industry and the tourism State agencies to guide me further in my work.</P>
    <P>With regard to the motion, I accept that the current indications are that this is a difficult season. However, I believe from my initial soundings &ndash; and this view is shared by the tourism State agencies &ndash; that the degree of difficulty varies from region to region and from sector to sector. We will spend close to &euro;110 million in Exchequer funding this year in support of the tourism industry. I will urgently review the situation to see what further steps can be taken to help the industry to meet the unique challenges it faces this year.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the debate on this motion and the contributions by the various speakers. I commend the Government amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, on their respective appointments. This is my first opportunity to address the House and I do not wish to let it go by without saying that the last person from the Coole electoral area to address the House, the late Joe Kennedy, did so in early 1965. I am deeply honoured to be a Member of the 29th Dáil and it is only fitting that I should make my maiden speech on the subject of the tourism industry. I have been associated with it over the years and am delighted to be in a position to say a few words on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tourism industry is a wonderful one to which we as a nation have looked to generate employment and growth in the past 15 years. It is also one which is very high in the services sector. <Col N="1041" /> Anyone involved in it knows it is a seven day week industry. These days value for money is the key and those in the industry who will survive will be those who give value for money. Ireland in the main gives very good value for money and standards have improved enormously over the years. This is mainly due to the commitment of everyone in the industry and of the Government which has shown how seriously it treats the tourism industry. Those of us in tourism who must invest in major capital programmes have been encouraged and given the incentives in our budgets by having those invested capital moneys acknowledged to allow us to continue to reinvest in the industry.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by many Members that something should be done in the short-term. We plan ahead in the tourism industry as regards bookings. If investment is needed in the short-term, there are only two ways that can be done. It is widely known throughout the world that television advertising has a penetration rate of 70%. Therefore, any money invested in advertising must be television related. On the other hand, there is no point advertising in markets, be they in Europe, the United States or elsewhere, unless flights are available.</P>
    <P>Foot and mouth disease and 11 September were cited as two major difficulties which arose last year to which the industry had to respond. When another major tourist attraction, the Disney corporation in Orlando, one of the most powerful in the world, had difficulties, it turned to television advertising and looked at where flights were available. Delta Airlines came to the rescue of the Orlando based corporation and was its saviour.</P>
    <P>From my experience over the years as a hotelier and being in the industry, Bord Fáilte and all those charged with responsibility in this area have done a marvellous job with the resources available to them. I compliment Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta for the wonderful job they have done over the years as well. I also acknowledge the marvellous contribution of Ryanair and all it has done for the tourism business.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Deputy Deenihan, great Kerrymen representing their county, and Deputies Moynihan-Cronin, Lynch and O'Connor &ndash; Dublin had a wonderful win last Sunday &ndash; will be aware of the importance of sporting activities in the domestic market. These are available every weekend to anyone who wants to fly in from the United Kingdom or anywhere else and it is an important market. People in the industry will say that the backbone of their business is their Friday and Saturday business. This is where Ryanair should be acknowledged for what it is doing by making transportation affordable from the nearest large market of 60 million people, namely, the United Kingdom. We should work hand in hand.</P>
    <P>The Minister has issued the invitation and we should be working with everyone who can help the tourism industry including Ryanair which will be <Col N="1042" /> asked to play a part. The low fare airline's advertising campaign for its website, Ryanair.com, was transmitted four times an hour, 24 hours per day and seven days per week on the Sky News television channel right across Europe. It was one of the best marketing ploys I have seen since I became involved in the industry in 1963. The company has great expertise available to it and we can look forward to it making a major contribution to bringing tourists here.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister's predecessors, Deputies McCreevy and McDaid, who marketed Ireland on the European golf circuit with an invitation to audiences and competitors to come golfing in Ireland and to enjoy other sporting activities here. I could speak for an hour on this issue but I am content in joining the Minister and being associated with the Government amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Ms Lynch Ms Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Cassidy could speak on this issue for an hour and I was worried he would do so. His argument that advertising works is effectively the same as mine. He spoke about how effective it is which is essentially the point of tonight's debate. I congratulate the Minister on his new post and hope he does well and that his post is a benefit to the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>In preparing for this debate, I wondered if the Opposition motion was a fruitless exercise because the Minister has already been reported in this morning's press as having ruled out any additional funding for marketing tourism in the US. To rule this out before he met representatives of the Hotels Federation or attended this debate was a bad start to his tenure. I was shocked to read that he appears to be taking a McCreevy-ite approach to his new brief which is that, unless the value to be obtained from investment in a crucial industry far exceeds the cost to the Exchequer, the investment is not worth making. The value for money approach we have seen in the health service seems to have been adopted in relation to tourism. Perhaps the Minister has not had time to read himself into his brief but he should know that money invested by successive Governments in the tourism industry &ndash; particularly in marketing &ndash; has always generated a multiplier effect in terms of income from that investment.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation &ndash; which the Minister has said he intends to meet &ndash; has estimated that investment by the State in tourism marketing yielded an extraordinary 50 to one return to the Exchequer. This effect means that, for every &euro;1 invested in marketing tourism, there was a return of &euro;50 to the economy. I doubt the same could be said about any other industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's comments in today's edition of the <i>Irish Independent</i> could be mistaken for those of Deputy McCreevy. Indeed the Minister's comments were reminiscent of Deputy McCreevy's statement around this time last year when he declared that the Government would not even consider compensation for the tourism industry <Col N="1043" /> in the wake of the foot and mouth crisis. Again, this was before he had even met industry representatives to discuss the crisis. Last night, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism again wielded the financial hatchet before he met the Irish Hotels Federation saying that &ldquo;to go off now and have a substantial spend on the US, even if we did have the money &ndash; which we don't &ndash; would not yield the results&rdquo;. The implication in this statement is that any further investment in marketing in the US in the immediate future is worthless. How does he know this when, as Deputy Cassidy pointed out, advertising works well?</P>
    <P>At a stage when Americans are beginning to get over the events of 11 September and travel again, it is surely time to invest heavily in marketing in the United States. A substantial marketing campaign in the US for the remaining half of the year would lead to an increase in visitor numbers in the next six months if the ratio of expenditure to income was similar to recent years.</P>
    <P>One thing that can be salvaged from the Minister's comments last night is a willingness to concentrate more resources on the European market. The apparent excessive reliance placed on the American market, ignoring the huge market on our doorsteps in the UK and the rest of Europe, has always puzzled me. Although I am not suggesting we invest less in the American market, we need to examine whether we are doing enough to attract visitors from the Continent and the UK, particularly given the difficulties in North America. It is, after all, easier and cheaper to travel from Europe and the UK to Ireland than it is to do so from America. Will the Minister outline his plans for investment in marketing in the European market to the House as soon as possible?</P>
    <P>The tourism industry has been taken for granted too often. There is a common assumption that, along with agriculture, tourism has a strong base and will continue to supply the Exchequer with a stable and reliable income in the future, as it has done for many years. It is taken for granted that Ireland is always a sure destination for holiday makers, regardless of the cost of getting to or staying here and despite trends in the international tourist industry. Sadly, it has taken the setbacks of the last two years to challenge those assumptions more than ever before.</P>
    <P>Nobody can say that the setbacks of the last year could have been foreseen. However, the foot and mouth problem and the events of 11 September, which came within months of each other, were particularly severe. Now that we have evidence of how badly these events affect tourism, we must use the facts and figures at hand to prepare for short to medium term future.</P>
    <P>Valuable information which highlights the importance of the tourism industry is contained in the March 2002 briefing document of the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation. It estimates that Irish tourism is a &euro;4.8 billion industry and that the Exchequer earned over &euro;2 billion from tour<Col N="1044" /> ism last year. The industry now supports 145,000 jobs &ndash; or one in 12 &ndash; in the Irish economy and is vitally important in sustaining regional economies. Investment by the State in tourism marketing yields an extraordinary 50 to one return. The commercial sector spent an estimated &euro;134 million on overseas marketing in 2001.</P>
    <P>As a source of employment, the tourism industry is vital to this country. Tourism supported 145,000 full-time job equivalents in 2000 or 8.7% of the total number of employed people in Ireland that year. If that number of jobs were vulnerable in any other industrial sector, there would be public uproar. In the context of rising unemployment in other industries, losses in the tourism industry are often forgotten. This is another symptom of the fact that our tourism industry is taken for granted.</P>
    <P>Last year, growth in Exchequer earnings from tourism reached a peak. Over a five year period up to 2001, there was a 55% increase in earnings from tourism which reached a total of &euro;4.84 billion last year or 4.2% of GNP. This is beginning to decline and the Government must take steps to arrest such a downward trend given the importance of the sector to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Another factor often forgotten in the debate about investment in tourism is the effective role tourism plays in regional development. Tourism tends to be concentrated in areas which have little else by way of indigenous industry. For example, in many rural areas &ndash; particularly those in the west &ndash; where few factories or industries are located, tourism is the mainstay of many families. It is, therefore, an essential element in maintaining a regional distribution of wealth. According to the Tourist Industry Confederation, 40% of visitors to Dublin also visit at least one other region in Ireland. Although this figure is very good, we must ensure it is improved upon. We must also ensure that these tourists visit the west and the south, regions which suffer from a lack of tourism.</P>
    <P>As everyone is aware, the year 2001 was extremely difficult for Irish tourism. This was due primarily to three factors which have already been outlined by several Members. The foot and mouth crisis had a huge impact on visitor numbers throughout the year. This was compounded by the terrorist attacks on 11 September which had a particularly harsh impact on the number of tourists coming here from North America. The third factor was the significant slowdown in global economic activity which impacted severely on the Irish tourism industry.</P>
    <P>The first half of this year has not been much better. The decline in visitor numbers in 2001, based on figures from the Tourist Industry Confederation, resulted in a loss of 770,000 visitors against target, a real term loss of &euro;317 million in tourist expenditure against target, the loss of between 7,000 and 10,000 jobs in the tourist industry and the loss of at least &euro;180 million in Exchequer returns. Those figures are startling and I do not believe any Government could stand <Col N="1045" /> back and not take action. Only initial figures are available for the first half of the current year, with some areas reporting a drop of up to 25% in visitors. However, unless there is a dramatic reversal of fortunes in the next six months, the end of 2002 will be particularly difficult. Indeed, Tourism Ireland's forecasts suggest that any recovery will not be attained before 2003.</P>
    <P>What can be done to deal with the situation as it now stands? In the short-term, marketing is the key to arriving at a solution. I ask the Minister to review his apparent unwillingness to invest in marketing in the US as a matter of priority. He must also look at the UK market and particularly marketing of autumn and winter breaks. I fully accept that, at this stage, the Minister probably has less available to him in terms of Exchequer funding than was the case for his predecessor. If that is the case, the Minister has only his own Government to blame. We have reached this position as a result of Fianna Fáil's and the Progressive Democrats' extravagant pre-election splurge and the state of the public finances after their five years in Government. I appeal to you Minister, as someone who represents an area which benefits hugely from tourism, to prioritise funding for marketing so that our largest indigenous industry can be restored to prosperity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, on his appointment. As has been said in many quarters, I cannot think of a more appropriate ministry for a Kerryman. Indeed, the last Kerryman in the Department was my late father who served as Minister of State in the mid-1980s. I wish the Minister the very best of luck in his new role. I also wish to congratulate my colleague, Deputy Lynch, on her appointment as our party's spokesperson on tourism. I assure her of my full support in her work.</P>
      <P>As Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation in the last Dáil, I was very aware of the immense difficulties the tourism industry experienced in the wake of the foot and mouth crisis in early 2001 and the horrific events of 11 September. The crisis in the tourism industry has affected nowhere more than my hometown of Killarney and my constituency of Kerry South. The downturn in tourism has compounded recent industrial job losses in Killarney, the latest of which came about on Friday last with the announcement that Sara Lee is laying off 104 people. This was a horrendous blow coming in the wake of similar announcements from ALPS and Leibherrs in the past number of weeks. I will be raising this matter with the Tánaiste on the Adjournment later this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the crisis in the tourism industry in Killarney, Kenmare, Dingle and other towns in south Kerry. A downturn of the degree of that currently being experienced is having a number of effects. In the first instance, the drop in tourist numbers has meant hard times for accommodation providers. Hotels, guesthouses and bed and breakfast establishments have had <Col N="1046" /> to cope with many cancellations and a loss of income. The early months of the year made for slim pickings for accommodation providers. The outlook for the remainder of the year appears somewhat better, but the overall picture is still extremely bleak. Many operators are concerned about their ability to retain staff.</P>
    <P>Another consequence of the downturn has been the knock-on effect on tour bus companies, jarvey operators, those working in tourism offices, those who work at tourist attractions, etc., who have been struggling to make ends meet in recent months. In addition, local businesses, shops, restaurants and gift shops have noted a marked decline in trade in recent weeks. Despite the common perception that a decline in the number of visitors to our shores impacts only on hotels and guesthouses, that is clearly not the case.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Lynch stated, marketing is the key to restoring the high number of tourists who visit Ireland. I was surprised to read in this morning's newspaper that the Minister has completely ruled out any additional funding for marketing in the US in the coming months. In my opinion, marketing in the US is the only way we will get out of our dilemma. There is also a need to give consideration to what we are doing in terms of the season up to December. The UK must also be the target of increased investment in marketing. It is amazing that the British Tourist Board is spending five times more on marketing Britain in this country than is being spent by authorities on promoting Ireland in the UK. Given the fact that Ireland has on its doorstep a market of over 60 million people, this ratio should be reversed. The tourism industry is facing unprecedented challenges, not least of which is the most significant decrease in international tourist numbers since the Second World War.</P>
    <P>I took a walk in the national park in Kerry last Sunday evening and it was frightening to see that so few people were doing likewise. Usually on a Sunday evening in the summer months we would avoid the park because it would be so crowded. I went there again on Monday for an hour and I counted only 13 tourists during that time.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that people in the tourism industry are crying wolf. They are not seeking grants or anything of that nature. In fairness to them, they also agree that marketing appears to be the only way out of this situation. I agree with Deputy Cassidy that television is an excellent medium for tourism advertising. I recall the Spanish Tourist Board spending a huge amount of money some years ago on a television campaign aimed at marketing Spanish resorts. A small island such as Menorca spent a great deal of money on its part of that campaign and it paid off because more people watch television than read newspapers. In my opinion, that is the way we should proceed.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to preach to the Minister because I believe he fully understands the position. I merely wish to take this opportunity to <Col N="1047" /> place on the record the difficulties that are being experienced. I know the Minister has only been in the job a number of days and there is no blame attaching to him. In addition, no Minister or Government can be held responsible for 11 September or the foot and mouth crisis. However, given the constituency the Minister and I represent, we are more than aware of the difficulties involved. The tourism industry will benefit from the good fortune of having a Minister from south Kerry because there is no one better who understands what is required.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider investing in the marketing fund. He should try to find additional moneys to allow him to market our beautiful country and rescue us from the dilemma with which we are faced. When I was growing up, every student paid their university fees by working for the summer in a shop or hotel. We do not want to let the industry collapse because we have a fantastic product to offer. If there is any way some funding could be found to invest in a huge marketing drive in the US and the UK, we could save jobs in a number of industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the Nice treaty, which was rejected in the last referendum, has any implications for this country's neutrality? In regard to the current proposal involving the declaration, does it have any implications for participation in PfP or for the operations we would normally be involved in through the UN? Will the monitoring process introduced during the life of the last Dáil with the agreement of the Taoiseach and the approval and agreement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs be continued or enhanced? Will the process by which the Minister and civil servants appear before the Committee on European Affairs or an appropriate committee to hold consultations prior to attending meetings of the Council of Ministers be continued and will it also apply to COREPER meetings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Roche)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. This is the whole point of the declaration, which makes it absolutely clear that there is nothing in the Nice treaty which need cause us concern. The answer to the second question is also in the negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third question relates to a matter which has clearly caused concern, namely, what could generally be termed the issue of democratic oversight in this country. The improved arrangements agreed in this regard, a form of tracking regu<Col N="1048" /> lations as they progress, come into effect on 1 July. Ministers will provide the Committee on European Affairs with regularly updated notes for circulation to all committees. I know from discussions with Deputy Durkan and due to his personal interest in the matter as chairperson of the Committee on European Affairs in the last Dáil that he is acutely aware that regulations can change over time. This means one is trying to track what is very much a moving object. The arrangement of providing notes with regular updates should solve that difficulty.</P>
    <P>The third improvement is that the committees can invite Ministers to appear before them prior to Council meetings. Although this possibility existed in theory, it has now been set down in practice and Ministers will be available prior to Council meetings. As somebody who has spoken about the development of the committee system, I welcome this as a very progressive move.</P>
    <P>There will also be the possibility of inviting the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or even the Taoiseach, to make a presentation before meetings of the European Council. The new arrangements set in train, by which Ministers will report back to the Dáil and there will be questions after each European Council meeting, are also innovations. While I am aware that other parties want the process to go further by incorporating it in law, I am not certain about the wisdom of that proposal. The point is we should be assured.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, I am a student of comparative European institutions. Looking at other parliaments, it can be objectively stated that we have in place one of the most advanced tracking systems. We certainly have a system which produces more accountability and responsiveness to the concerns of Oireachtas committees than was the case in the past. These measures should help to resolve some of our difficulties. While there is no doubt that there remains much room for further institutional improvements, these measures go a long way and will answer the type of questions the Deputy has raised on numerous occasions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach share my deep concern about sharing common foreign and security policies with countries such as France and Britain, both of which are nuclear powers, particularly Britain with its disastrous track record on human rights, the recent examples of collusion and the Pat Finucane case? Does he not agree that many Irish people want to retain our independent foreign policy line and, hence, have reservations about the 60,000 strong rapid reaction force? Will he join me in commending the Irish soldiers who have given their lives with the United Nations in conflicts throughout the world? Contrary to the accusation levelled against us by so many of our detractors in the recent debate, they did bury their heads in the sand. Does the Taoiseach agree that the way forward in conflict resolution situations throughout <Col N="1049" /> the world is a strong, independent, positive, neutral and credible foreign policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Common foreign and security positions are precisely that &ndash; positions about which a common policy can be agreed. We do not adhere to every area of the foreign policy of France and Germany. Common foreign and security policy is intergovernmental in character. We come to common positions on the basis of agreement. They are about those areas of policy about which we agree, not those about which we disagree. Therefore, to characterise common foreign and security policy as in some way imposing a uniform foreign policy in respect of all 15 member states on every issue, is to misunderstand precisely what the position is. I emphasise that this whole area, known as the second pillar of the European Union treaties, is intergovernmental in character, which means we establish common positions only in those areas on which we agree, while we do not have common positions on those areas on which we do not agree.</P>
      <P>Of course we commend the members of the Defence Forces who have worked with the UN. That will always be the case in every respect because the legislative provisions under the Defence Acts require prior UN endorsement before any Army personnel can become involved in an international issue. There has been no change to that position as is confirmed by the declarations.</P>
      <P>In relation to conflict prevention in the European Union, the EU is the best example one could find in the recent history of an institution devised to bring about conflict prevention. It has been the best example of conflict prevention ever devised in Europe. The legal basis upon which it will apply its security and defence policy are the Petersberg Tasks relating to conflict prevention, humanitarian tasks and crisis management tasks, which are set out in the treaties. In so far as Ireland is concerned, this area of policy is the one where we can demonstrate, as the declarations do, where we have retained sovereignty because the Government decides, on a case by case basis and subject to Oireachtas approval and prior UN endorsement, whether we will participate in any crisis management or humanitarian task which the EU military capability will take on board.</P>
      <P>That is the position and any characterisation to the contrary has no treaty reference and is not correct, accurate or in conformity with the declarations we have set out. I am glad to note that the one thing we have achieved is that prominent members of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign in the past have now confirmed that the declarations are stating the obvious. If that is the case, as it is, I presume I can expect no contradictions of the obvious during the course of the forthcoming campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach for making <Col N="1050" /> themselves available for the remainder of the debate. Will the Taoiseach inform the House how the value of the declarations secured in Seville differ from the previous declaration on Irish neutrality which was attached to the Single European Act in 1997, given that it was followed by our participation in both the rapid reaction force and the Partnership for Peace arrangement or was it the case that positive Irish votes on the treaties of Amsterdam and Maastricht negated that previous declaration?</P>
      <P>On the use of declarations as a way of meeting the concerns of Irish voters, was the possibility of seeking declarations on the many other areas of concern about the Nice treaty, namely, enhanced co-operation, the diminution of Irish voting strength, the loss of an Irish Commissioner in rotation as a member of the Commission and the reduction in the number of Irish members of the European Parliament, considered and why was it not followed through?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister for Foreign Affairs said Nice is essential for the enlargement of the European Union, does the Minister say that the enhanced co-operation provisions of the Nice treaty, by which eight member states can proceed ahead of others with particular projects, are essential for enlargement and if so, why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>A statement was attributed to the Taoiseach in which he pointed out that if we vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the Nice treaty we would be in a stronger position to negotiate on any potential proposals that may come from the Agenda 2000 mid-term CAP review. Could these proposals be dealt with before the Nice treaty referendum? Would there be merit in doing this, rather than leaving them unfinished while the people decide on ratification?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Boyle raised the issue of the Commission and the arrangements for the Treaty of Nice. These arrangements represent the only compromise available between the 15 member states regarding new institutional arrangements to facilitate enlargement. That is the political reality. We do not seek any change in those arrangements since there is no prospect of renegotiating the treaty. This was set out in the Gothenberg Council conclusions when this matter first came up after the rejection of ratification in Ireland on the last occasion.</P>
      <P>The declarations which have been made available from Seville by the Taoiseach clarify the meaning of the legal texts which exist regarding this matter. It has been suggested that there are no legal texts in existence which provide a legal basis for the actions of future Irish Governments in retaining sovereignty and in determining whether or not we will participate in any European security and defence policy proposal in the future. The texts are in the treaties of Amsterdam and Maastricht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the declaration concerning the <Col N="1051" /> Single European Act, which is the treaty in which the question of policy on security co-operation was instigated, we make it clear that our participation will always be on the basis of respect for our position of military neutrality. As those provisions are included in that treaty and subsequently in Maastricht, Amsterdam and now in Nice, we have obtained a declaration which confirms that all the developments which have taken place provide for us the necessary retained discretion which is the exercise of national sovereignty by our Government, subject to the approval of the Oireachtas and prior UN endorsement before we participate in any of those arrangements.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the voluntary nature of our participation has been retained as a result of successful negotiations by successive Governments in respect of the provisions of those treaties which sought to develop the European security and defence policy. Those are the facts. The declaration has been confirmed and corroborated by all 14 member states who have confirmed that the outcome of all of those negotiations in respect of this sensitive area of policy, which successive Irish Governments have successfully negotiated, has meant that those sovereign decisions of Government are in no way fettered by the treaty provisions, up to and including ratification of the Treaty of Nice. That is a clear exposition of the legal position as negotiated by Governments and as incorporated in our constitutional arrangements through successive ratifications of all treaties up to this treaty, which has yet to be ratified by the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are putting this point again to the people because of the duty of Government to put it to them where we see our essential national interest at stake. This is no way fetters the right of the people to make the sovereign decision on this question. We are simply asking them to consider it once again.</P>
    <P>The concepts of enhanced co-operation and flexibility arrangements, which were raised by Deputy Higgins, were first brought in by the Treaty of Amsterdam which was ratified by the people of Ireland. The changes in the arrangements for enhanced co-operation in the Treaty of Nice are modest. I will provide these provisions for Deputy O'Higgins if he wishes. They confirm that there are sufficient safeguards in place. The suggestion was made by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side in a debate I had on a radio programme yesterday that enhanced co-operation provisions will in some way provide for an inner government within the EU &ndash; an EU within the EU. This is not available in the Treaty of Nice. It is not possible because the Commission, as the guardian of the treaties and often spoken of as such by the supporters of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign, must in all cases agree to any exercise of the enhanced co-operation mechanism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1052" />The suggested arrangement cannot apply to the Single Market, which provides for 80% of the total working of the European Union's institutions, it cannot affect the integrity of the Single Market, it cannot distort competition or be used in any way to provide a union within a union. We believe the flexibility provisions will provide us, in many cases in the future, with insurance of effective decision making processes so that, in an enlarged group of 27 members, a veto by one member state would not prevent Ireland from pursuing its interests. The exaggerated claims being made by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side regarding the enhanced co-operation mechanism do not stand up to scrutiny. The detail of the treaty provisions can be provided to the Deputy if he requires it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>So, enlargement could go ahead without the Nice treaty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Enlargement will go ahead on schedule only on the basis of the ratification of the Treaty of Nice. That is the position of all 15 member states. It is also the position of all ten candidate countries, whose concerns Deputy Higgins often expresses and whose Governments confirmed that position to myself and the Taoiseach last weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment my constituency colleague, Deputy Timmins, on his elevation to the front bench as spokesman on agriculture. The answer to the second part of his question is negative. It would not be possible to fast-track the mid-term review on CAP and to have that out of the way before we make a decision on the Nice treaty.</P>
      <P>Deputy Timmins raised the important issue of the impact of enlargement on any aspect of the Irish economy. Enlargement poses no threat to the Common Agricultural Policy, nor does it pose a threat to existing funding arrangements. Those arrangements were put in place at the Berlin summit in 1999 and we made sure they are protected.</P>
      <P>Ireland stands to gain considerably from enlargement because we will get new allies in the area of the Common Agricultural Policy. Eight of the ten aspirant states are very dependent on agriculture and their agriculture or agri-business is not sufficiently advanced to damage us in any way. We will have more friends with a common interest in agriculture at the table than we have had in recent years. We should have sufficient confidence in Irish agriculture, and particularly in Irish agri-business, to recognise that we are well equipped to cope with any additional competition and, more precisely, to supply into a market which will expand by 100 million additional consumers.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Foreign Affairs has said on many occasions, this is a case of more is more and not of more is less. Agriculture has nothing to fear from enlargement and has a considerable amount to gain.</P>

    <Title>Vote 35 &ndash; Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism (Supplementary).</Title>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding &euro;30,000,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31 December 2002 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies, grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P Just="Center">I thank Members for this opportunity to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to provide for a number of important interventions aimed at enhancing the level and quality of facilities and programmes in Irish sport. In introducing this Supplementary Estimate for the approval of the House it strikes me that the timing of this debate could hardly be more appropriate, given the outstanding performance of the Irish soccer squad at the World Cup in Japan and Korea. The spirit, professionalism and high quality skills of our young team, powered by a never say die, indomitable will, produced great football and great results which captured the hearts of the nation in recent weeks.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Deputies will be aware, however, that the maturing of top world class talent such as we have does not happen quickly or easily. Many of the players in the current senior squads, both rugby and soccer, have benefited from years of coaching, training and development provided first at school and local level, then progressing through the various stages to representative and international competition. The provision of high quality, appropriate and sustainable facilities to meet the training, coaching and competitive needs of sports organisations is a <i>sine qua non</i> of sports provision in a modern society with legitimate ambitions to pursue the achievements of excellence in sport.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The sports capital programme provided for under subhead C1 of the Vote &ndash; grants for sporting bodies and the provision of sports and rec<Col N="1054" /> reational facilities funded through the national lottery &ndash; is the primary vehicle for supporting the provision of sports facilities at all levels throughout the country. Since 1998 over &euro;213 million has been allocated to 2,904 projects under the programme.</P>
    <P Just="Center">My predecessor, Deputy McDaid, signalled to the Select Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation on 21 March 2002 during the debate on the 2002 Estimates that further financial assistance for projects such as the redevelopment work on Croke Park was anticipated to arise during the current year. He indicated that, depending on the rate of drawdown during the year under subhead C1, a Supplementary Estimate for the Vote of the Department would be required during 2002. Accordingly, an additional amount of &euro;19.046 million is required to provide funding for the Gaelic Athletic Association to assist it in the funding of the completion of phase 3 of the Croke Park redevelopment programme. For the information of Deputies, phase 3 incorporates the old Hogan Stand portion of the stadium. The provision of this assistance for the GAA will help it, not just to complete a magnificent stadium required by a major sport with huge attendances, but will help alleviate the demand on the association's national funds which can now be better deployed in helping local clubs, county and provincial boards to provide much needed new and enhanced facilities throughout the country.</P>
    <P Just="Center">An additional amount of &euro;11.43 million was committed to the Football Association of Ireland in 2002 to assist the association and its affiliated clubs to provide new, refurbished and enhanced indoor and outdoor facilities to assist clubs to function effectively in appropriate, well designed and hygienic conditions so important in the nurturing and development of skills and increasing participation levels and attracting young people and children to sport. As a key feature of its strategic planning, the FAI has carried out an extensive survey of soccer facilities around the country. The association has identified a list of clubs and centres for development and enhancement which will contribute significantly to the expansion of the sport as well as raising standards of performance at all levels from grassroots through to national squads. As payments in relation to this commitment are made on the basis of work completed, the additional funding required in 2002 is not significant.</P>
    <P Just="Center">An additional &euro;3 million is sought under subhead C5, Irish Sports Council &ndash; general assistance to sports organisations and other expenditure in relation to sports activities, which is also national lottery funded. The &euro;3 million is to assist the Irish Rugby Football Union in the development of the game of rugby which continues to develop as a major sport in Ireland. There are 214 clubs and 254 schools catering for a total playing population of almost 80,000.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The &euro;3 million, in respect of which I am seeking the approval of the House, is being provided for the Irish Sports Council to help implement <Col N="1055" /> the operational objectives of the IRFU. The Irish Sports Council has recently had negotiations with the union and devised a number of specific participation programmes to achieve the overall objectives, which are: to increase the levels of participation through the strengthening and expansion of the school system and in least developed areas &ndash; for example, there has been a successful project to develop the game in Tallaght; to ensure the development and sustainability of a strong, healthy and vibrant club structure &ndash; clubs of Ireland project; to operate a sub-professional elite programme incorporating both schools and clubs, to develop Irish players capable of playing professional rugby for Ireland and the provinces &ndash; for example, there will be emphasis on under 18 youth and schools teams as well as plans to prepare under 19 and under 21 World Cup squads. I know the plans and programmes developed between the IRFU and the Irish Sports Council will contribute to social inclusion and cohesion and the general health and well being of our society.</P>
    <P Just="Center">I am proposing that an additional amount of &euro;7 million be provided for the Sports Campus Ireland project under subhead C6 in 2002; &euro;5.2 million of the total amount is for capital expenditure and &euro;1.8 million for current expenditure. This additional funding is required to meet expenditure on the aquatic and leisure centre project at Abbotstown, but I must stress that it does not represent additional financing in overall terms for capital expenditure on the project. The funding is required now because the aquatic centre is on target to be completed by year end, thus ensuring the pool at Abbotstown will be ready in time for the 2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games.</P>
    <P Just="Center">In July 2000 the Government decided that an aquatic centre should be developed on the Abbotstown site and that it should be completed in time for use during the Special Olympics World Summer Games in 2003. Following a public competition, a consortium comprising Rohcon, Waterworld UK and Dublin Waterworld Limited was selected by CSID, and on 23 January 2002 the Government approved the signing of the contract with the winning consortium. The Government also agreed that the project would be subject to a maximum Exchequer capital contribution of &euro;62.1 million, with an additional &euro;4.6 million to be regarded as a contingency amount. Of the &euro;62 million capital fund, &euro;21 million was expended for building work on the project in 2001 and a further &euro;39.2 million will be required in 2002. The capital sum that I have proposed in this Supplementary Estimate represents the balance needed to facilitate completion of work corresponding to the total projected level of expenditure. A retention amount of 3% or &euro;1.8 million will be held over until 2003 in accordance with normal procedure. Work is progressing well and the pool is currently on target for completion by December 2002.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1056" />The Supplementary Estimate of &euro;30 million comprises &euro;19.046 million for the GAA, &euro;7 million towards the completion of the aquatic and leisure centre, &euro;3 million for the Irish Rugby Football Union with the balance to meet commitments made to the FAI. I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to this very important ministry. As a fellow county man, I am delighted that both of us will share responsibility for sport, tourism and the arts, which are of major significance in our county. Following what the Minister said in the Private Members' debate earlier this evening, I will be as constructive as possible, but will point out inadequacies and the problems that face the sectors for which I have responsibility.</P>
      <P>In welcoming this Supplementary Estimate I join the Minister in congratulating the Irish soccer team for its superb performance in the World Cup. Bearing in mind the subsequent performances, we can just wonder what might have been with a little luck. There was a possibility of Ireland going all the way if events had worked out right.</P>
      <P>I note that another GAA man, Deputy Tony Dempsey, is present this evening. I compliment the GAA on its superb development in Croke Park which is now one of the finest stadia in Europe, if not the world. As an amateur organisation, the GAA deserves great credit for providing such a stadium, bearing in mind there are professional organisations which cannot provide the same kind of facility. It has been put in place because of the sweat of many county and club players throughout the country who perform on an amateur basis without any remuneration or proper compensation. The contribution of those who put it in place by making money for the GAA should also be recognised.</P>
      <P>I know the GAA will do this in its own time, but it should give serious consideration to using Croke Park for other events that generate the necessary funding to provide for the maintenance of Croke Park and perhaps other developments within the Gaelic Athletic Association. I realise the GAA is an organisation that does not like to be dictated to by politicians. Nevertheless, people who were in the stadium last Sunday saw for themselves that it is a world class facility. It would be unfortunate if the GAA, and Ireland, could not display this great facility &ndash; built by an unique and amateur organisation &ndash; to the whole world. It would be a showcase for Ireland if international soccer, rugby and other sports could be played there. Hopefully we will see that happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify the sum of money that was committed to the GAA at its congress in April 2001 as it obviously influenced the decision about allowing other sports to use Croke Park. Is that money still available to the GAA? Is it contingent on the GAA participating in the new national sta<Col N="1057" /> dium? That should be clarified because the GAA was expecting that money, they need it as they are in debt and were factoring that money into their overall investment.</P>
    <P>I know from documents that were made available under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, that the FAI was promised a large amount of money if they withdrew from the Eircom Park project. No doubt this is part of the package which they need. It is the only organisation that still has teams changing in the back of cars and along the side of ditches. I have seen it happen before their matches. That is not acceptable and they certainly deserve the support to put the proper facilities in place to ensure their players can change in comfort. When the Minister is looking at the allocation of national lottery funding he could favour clubs who operate common facilities.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the allocation made to the IRFU to enhance sport in schools. The organisation has a very good schools programme. I ask the Minister to do his best to place facilities in school grounds. Those facilities can be used by local clubs at night and by the school during the day. The Minister should give preference to sports proposals such as that in future.</P>

It should prove to be a great event and I am sure everyone is looking forward to it, none more so than the participants. It is a great pity that the aquatic and leisure centre became surrounded by such controversy. However, since so much taxpayers money was involved it was inevitable that the project would ultimately be subjected to scrutiny. The report by the then Attorney General, Deputy McDowell, following investigative journalism by <i>The Irish Times</i> exposed precisely why there was so much public concern about the manner in which this project originated and was progressed. It is clear that the Taoiseach himself subverted normal Cabinet procedures when the original decision was taken. The extraordinary contract whereby a consortium was paid on a percentage basis meant that there was no incentive to control the spending of taxpayers' money. The McDowell report is clear concerning the circumstances surrounding the award of the main contract to a shelf company with no track record in the business. Nevertheless, this legacy of maladministration and waste of public money should not blind us to the merits of the Special Olympics and hopefully the belated changes introduced as a result of the hearings by the Committee of Public Accounts should bring this project back under control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the grander project of Sports Campus Ireland there is such fundamental confusion at the heart of Government that nobody knows what is now intended. We are told work will commence on a world class national stadium &ndash; or so Fianna Fáil thinks. Not so, say the Progressive <Col N="1058" /> Democrats, a more modest stadium will be built but the location is a secret. The HighPoint-Rendell report clearly showed the cost of the Taoiseach's vanity project to be twice what he told the House. Will the Minister tell me, in the context of the worsening public finances where he is going to find the &euro;1,000 million? What about the state of the hospitals, or the condition of services for people with a disability or the urgent need for increased public housing? What about the real need for real investment in local communities to provide a sports infrastructure for young people who want to participate in sport and not just watch it?</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, in particular sought to convey the impression during the election that the Progressive Democrats in Government would kill off the &ldquo;Bertie Bowl&rdquo;. Suddenly, after the votes have been counted, the Progressive Democrats have become more equivocal. Now that they are safely ensconced in ministerial Mercedes they no longer seem to give a damn about how much taxpayers' money goes into the Taoiseach's favourite monument to himself. We already have an 80,000 seater stadium in Croke Park. We saw what a splendid facility it is last Sunday. Taxpayers' money helped build it and I do not object to that. The GAA has done wonders for sporting participation for decades among the youth of Ireland. Why should Croke Park not be opened once in a blue moon when the attendance at the occasional international match, be it rugby or soccer, requires an 80,000 seater stadium? No matter how well we did in the World Cup, those occasions will be rare enough. Instead the Taoiseach's machinations swung the GAA against throwing open their doors and perversely committed them to providing 200,000 customers per annum for the &ldquo;Bertie Bowl&rdquo;. This will pauperise Croke Park and will make little impact on the operational difficulties of Abbotstown.</P>
    <P>It may be that a new modern stadium with around 50,000 seats is necessary. I would hate to see Lansdowne Road go the way of the Glenmalure Park at Milltown where Shamrock Rovers used to play. Why not redesign and develop Lansdowne Road in partnership with the rugby authorities? The &ldquo;Bertie Bowl&rdquo; was born at a time when the Government had so much taxpayers' money it did not know what to do with it. The well known tax exile J.P. McManus pledged £50 million at a time when the Taoiseach was talking about the stadium costing about twice that amount. At the rate things have been added to since, Mr. McManus's £50 million will not even pay for the corner flags or a hot dog stand at Abbotstown.</P>
    <P>Who does the Government think it is fooling? Where are we going to get the patrons to operate Abbotstown even if we are prepared to see &euro;1,000 million going into the building stage? Maybe Mr. McManus and some other of the Taoiseach's friends are planning Irish partici<Col N="1059" /> pation in a European super league for soccer, but I do not think so. It is time we learned who or what is really behind this grandiose project. What about the reality of the sports infrastructure up and down the country? Children and school kids are togging out in cold containers with no shower facilities. There are few swimming pools and many run down sports clubs that are permanently trying to raise money. Facilities for young people are pathetic and all the Taoiseach can think of is a monument to his memory at Abbotstown.</P>
    <P>We have a community swimming pool at Douglas in Cork and are desperately pleading with Government agencies to upgrade it in order to keep it open. We have a soccer academy that is about to close because it cannot get funding to pay its rates. We need to take a serious look at what we are doing with taxpayers' money.</P>

      <P>One minute and 45 seconds each. I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and on being the first Minister to bring a Supplementary Estimate to the 29th Dáil. I am sure it is the first of many we will see in this Chamber. Bearing in mind the value of the work the GAA does as an organisation at community level in providing facilities that would not otherwise be provided. There is confusion about the considerable amount of taxpayers' money which has been given to Croke Park without any understanding as to whether that fine facility will be used by other sports organisations. The Minister must clarify that point. It is a farce that the GAA has voted against using the facility in such a manner, yet it has allowed it to be included in the tender documents for the Euro 2008 tournament. Although such double-think is familiar to the Minister and his party, it cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>There is a problem with the Supplementary Estimate in that it seeks to reward organisations which have considerable sums of funding. The IRFU is a well funded organisation with considerable access to commercial funding and the FAI is being given less than &euro;1 million. That seems to indicate a pecking order which, in the aftermath of the World Cup, does not reflect the nature of sport in Ireland. Minority sports, particularly those involving women, have not been given proper attention by the Department for which the Minister is responsible.</P>
      <P>As regards the &euro;7 million for the swimming pool at Abbottstown, while that is the least contentious issue as far as the Green Party is concerned, we want to put on record our concern about the tendering process and the award of the management contract.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the State investing in sport and recreation. If it had been done on a more widespread basis in the past, particularly in working class communities which cannot support sports and recreation infrastructure, many of the destructive things which happened in those communities, such as young people being diverted into the dead end of heroin addiction, could have been avoided. I am a member of the local authority which gave planning permission for the aquatic project in Blanchardstown. I urge that authority to give that permission as quickly as possible to allow the Special Olympics to be held. I strongly support that project, but I want the Minister to assure me that after the Special Olympics it will be opened to the wider community for general use.</P>
      <P>I support the funding of organisations such as the GAA, the FAI and the IRFU, and particularly their constituent parts at club level. However, I have serious objections to how these organisations are allowing themselves to be used by powerful alcohol pushing companies in sponsorship deals. Alcohol is highly destructive in our society. These sports organisations should not push it. State funding should be made conditional on them not continuing to allow alcohol companies to push their destructive products.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his new position. We all recognise the important role sport plays in community development and enhancement. I salute the valuable work done by groups such as the GAA, the FAI, the IRFU and many other sporting organisations which have played an important role in developing sporting activities throughout the country. However, it is clear that lip service was paid to sport for many years at Government level. The appalling conditions in which many young and older people find themselves on Saturdays and Sundays are unacceptable and prehistoric. If one goes to watch people play sport at weekends, one will see them changing at the side of pitches. I am glad the Minister said that some of the funding will be used to build changing rooms. Without them, people will be left to change at the side of the road or behind ditches. We are talking about Ireland in 2002 when the Government is seeking to build a sports campus at huge cost. Surely that is putting the cart before the horse. Sport needs to be developed at local level first. We need to provide first class facilities to encourage participation at junior level.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach gave a commitment to the delegates at the GAA annual conference in April 2001 that the Government would be prepared to give approximately &euro;70 million to Croke Park. Does that commitment still stand and, if so, when will the money be paid to the GAA or is it contingent on the GAA supporting the new proposed national stadium? The programme for Government gives a commitment to provide a stadium of international standard. Will <Col N="1061" /> the Minister outline the timescale for the provision of that stadium? Will he also confirm its location? Will it be at Abbottstown or, as was reported recently by a Progressive Democrats source, at Ringsend? </P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter to the GAA of April 2001 included a commitment to &euro;15 million for the redevelopment of Croke Park to enable it to be ready for the Special Olympics. That amount has been paid. The letter also stated that there would be &euro;20 million per annum for three years to include &euro;15 million per annum for Croke Park. That grant has not been paid as it was clearly connected to the development of the national stadium, which was not proceeded with since May of last year. However, the Government has allocated £15 million, or &euro;19.05 million, to Croke Park in 2002 which is the subject matter of this Supplementary Estimate. Some &euro;63.49 million, or £50 million, has been provided to Croke Park since 1997.</P>
      <P>As regards the national stadium, we know it is a proposal which was discussed during the recent general election. The Taoiseach stated that if returned as Taoiseach it was his intention to proceed with the building of a national stadium. No one can deny there is a mandate for its construction from the people through the general election. The intention is to seek to have the national stadium constructed prior to the European Championships which take place in 2008. The timescale for the construction of the stadium is relatively fluid, but it will take up to four or five years even if it is commenced immediately.</P>
      <P>I have not yet brought proposals to Government as to how the matter will proceed. However, it is my intention to bring forward positive proposals to the Government after consulting with the various parties, namely, the relevant sporting organisations, the Campus and Stadium Ireland team and the Office of Public Works. While that range of consultations must take place within a short period of time, the Department has been in consultation with the sporting organisations and the other parties over a protracted period. However, it is my intention to have early meetings with the sporting organisations concerned with the development with a view to bringing forward a memorandum to Government at an early date seeking its approval to proceed.</P>
      <P>I cannot answer Deputy Deenihan's question about where the stadium will be built. Many people favour the Abbotstown site. I have heard other people favour a site nearer the city centre. However, in the final analysis it is a matter for the Government to make that decision. It would be inappropriate for me to specify to the House where I would propose that the stadium be located without having first obtained the approval of my colleagues in Government.</P>

      <P>It should not be taken for granted that the return of a particular Government is a mandate for a specific project; the Minister might <Col N="1062" /> be mistaken. Assuming that the project goes ahead, how many events at full capacity will it take to arrive at a break-even situation in any one year? What does the Minister envisage these events to be that could attract capacity audiences of 80,000? In relation to the aquatic centre, what exactly will the breakdown be in terms of access for clubs versus the public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked a number of questions. The first thing that has to be said is that the stadium will be filled to capacity on the number of occasions when the capacity of the stadium will allow. In other words, the number of times on which the stadium will be filled to capacity will depend on the capacity of the stadium. If, for example, the capacity of the stadium was to be 80,000, one might conclude that the number of events which might fill it would be X. On the other hand, if the capacity of the stadium was to be 60,000, 65,000, 70,000 or 75,000, obviously the number of times on which the stadium would be filled to capacity would vary&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Ms Lynch Ms Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is putting the cart before the horse. It all depends on what the capacity of the stadium is. Depending on the capacity of the stadium, one will obviously be able to deduce how many times it will be filled to capacity. Since that decision has not yet been made it is not possible for me to tell the Deputy how many times the stadium will be filled to capacity. However, when a decision is made regarding the capacity of the stadium I will be the first to let her know how many times it is anticipated it will be filled.</P>
      <P>Regarding the second part of the Deputy's question, also referred to by Deputy Higgins, it is the intention once the Special Olympics are over to ensure the general public of Dublin, and Ireland, have access to what will be one of the finest water centres in the entire world.</P>

      <P>In relation to this Supplementary Estimate of &euro;30 million, we see over &euro;26 million being spent on capital projects in the Dublin area. Some of the remaining &euro;4 million will also be spent in the Dublin area. Given that the Department's budget under this subhead is now &euro;336 million a year, will the Minister or his civil servants know the extent to which such funding is being made available outside the greater Dublin area where two thirds of the population live?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that the previous Minister was particularly generous in apportioning money to County Donegal. I am not sure if the Minister <Col N="1063" /> has any particular geographical region he wants to so reward, but it is important for those of us interested in a national sports strategy that this type of information is made available for the benefit of the House.</P>

It would be impossible to go through the entire document, otherwise we would be here all night. Last year sports capital funding provided for Dublin amounted to &euro;22,844,900. The sum spent in the entire country amounted to &euro;78,591,400. The Deputy will be pleased to learn that of this sum, &euro;7,251,000 was spent in Cork.</P>

As he may know, Blanchardstown has been designed to grow to a population of 120,000. Finglas also has a huge community. There is then the greater Dublin area. Will the Minister give me an assurance, in view of the taxpayers' money he is committing here, that there will not be prohibitive fees to prevent members of the local community or any community from using the aquatic centre, that entrance charges will not be prohibitive?</P>
      <P>The Corduff estate, a huge working class area, is located just beside the centre. Will it be open and affordable to the children of Corduff and the children of Dublin and Ireland? That is what I want to know. I would like to know that there will be very wide access in terms of the days of the week on which people can enter and that it will be an available, creative leisure centre and pastime for a whole generation of youth &ndash; for all generations.</P>

It is a proven fact that given the opportunity, it matters little what social class a family comes from or what income it has in terms of producing a world class athlete. I aim to ensure the Deputy's aspiration is fulfilled and that the general public, including the Deputy's constituents, have access to the aquatic centre. It is, after all, the property of the Irish nation, not any one person or group. Although it is an operational matter, I can tell the Deputy we will ensure young people, and the not so young, have this wonderful facility available to them after the Special Olympics.

      <P>With regard to the aquatic centre, surely it will be for the operator to decide on the entry fee. The operator will run the centre on a commercial basis and will then decide on what fee is appropriate to make a profit. Given the high labour content in the cost of running the centre, a throughput of approximately 3,000 people per day will be required. If those numbers are not realised the operator will have to increase the charges. In the event of the entry fee becoming prohibitive, is the Minister prepared to provide a subvention to ensure that those from the estate mentioned will have access to the pool?</P>

As the relevant Minister I will make the relevant proposal after all consultations have been completed. I have already indicated this will happen in the near future.</P>
      <P>With regard to the level of entry fees to the aquatic centre, the taxpayers own the centre and it is necessary that there be an extensive throughput of people. For this to happen it is necessary that the entry fees should not be prohibitive. I have already explained that I do not believe in exclusivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Deputy Allen, it was not orig<Col N="1065" /> inally decided to host the water sports of the Special Olympics in Limerick. The Limerick pool can cater for between 600 and 700 people. It is necessary for the purpose of the games that the teams will not be broken up as that is part of the spirit of the event. It is, therefore, necessary to have the pool located in Dublin. The aquatic centre will endure for future generations, although it is a crucial component of the Special Olympics infrastructure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this short Bill is to provide an extension of the period for furnishing election expenses statements to the Standards in Public Office Commission by candidates at the recent general election. The period is being extended for the recent general election only, pending the outcome of an appeal to the Supreme Court, following the High Court case concerning the constitutionality of certain exemptions from election expenditure of the services and facilities provided by the Houses of the Oireachtas to outgoing Members.</P>
      <P>In the High Court judgment, delivered on 16 May 2002, and the related High Court order, the court found that part of paragraph 2(<i>a</i>) and paragraph 2(<i>c</i>) of the Schedule to the Electoral Act, 1997, which exempt publicly funded facilities, such as postage, telephone, fax, photocopying, etc., for outgoing Members of the Dáil for the purposes of election expenditure controls are invalid, having regard to the provisions of the Constitution. The judgment stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having reviewed the evidence I am satisfied beyond doubt that the facilities which are available to outgoing Members of the Dáil are of particular relevance and value to those Members who seek re-election. No tools could be more helpful or appropriate than postage, access to communications equipment and all of <Col N="1066" /> the other services that is theirs as of right. Even if there was no cap on the expenditure which a candidate could incur, the availability itself of such facilities and services out of public funds could be said to be unfair and discriminatory, but when one adds to that a newcomer's inability to match the value of such services by increased spending, the resulting situation is unjust, unreasonable and arbitrary.</P>
    <P>The matters referred to in part of paragraph 2(<i>a</i>) are payments, services or facilities provided to a Member of the Oireachtas, a Member of the European Parliament, the holder of an elective or other public office, a political party or political group or a member or delegate to an international organisation. This exemption was included in the Act as enacted in 1997. Paragraph 2(<i>c</i>) was inserted by the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2001, and provides that any expenses in respect of any property, services or facilities, in so far as those expenses fall to be met out of public funding, would not be regarded as election expenditure.</P>
    <P>The provision of these services was also considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in the last Dáil following correspondence with the Standards in Public Office Commission. These exemptions were intended to cover the cost to outgoing Members of the Oireachtas for their duties as public representatives which, as Deputies in the last and previous Dáil will be aware, does not stop on dissolution of the Dáil. There is a duty, moral if not legal, on outgoing Deputies to finalise any outstanding business. Indeed, the representative role of the Member of the Dáil is recognised in Article 15.15 of the Constitution, which states: &ldquo;The Oireachtas may make provision by law for the payment of allowances to members of each House thereof in respect of their duties as public representatives and for the grant to them of free travelling and such other facilities (if any) in connection with their duties as the Oireachtas may determine.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The problem arises from the difficulty in distinguishing at election time parliamentary duties from electioneering. The view was expressed in the court case that such matters are so interrelated and intermingled that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to rigidly separate them. However, the arguments for and against were made in the High Court and the judgment delivered must be respected. The State has lodged an appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court in this case and in such circumstances I do not wish to re-state the arguments or other matters which could arise in the appeal.</P>
    <P>To remove any uncertainty for election agents, candidates and the Standards in Public Office Commission, the Government has decided to extend the period of 56 days for furnishing election expenses statements pending the determination of the appeal to the Supreme Court. When the Bill was drafted it was hoped that the appeal would be held at an early date so that the extent of the period for furnishing election expenses <Col N="1067" /> statements to the Standards in Public Office Commission to 90 days would have sufficed. However, the appeal cannot be heard until October and the 90 days proposed in the Bill as published is not adequate. I will move an amendment on Committee Stage to extend the 56 day period to 167 days, which is to 31 October next, or to 21 days following the pronouncement by the Supreme Court of its decision in the appeal. I hope the appeal will be determined in early October.</P>
    <P>The question of election expenditure limits was discussed extensively on a number of occasions in the last Dáil and in the 27th Dáil, when the Electoral Act, 1997, was debated. I do not consider it necessary to repeat the debate again this evening, except to say that, in a democracy, political parties and candidates should have an opportunity of presenting their policies and programmes to the electorate. An appropriate level of expenditure is required to avoid extravagant spending, as in the intensive and competitive atmosphere at an election, parties and candidates can be drawn into a spiral of competitive spending which can serve no real purpose. It is in everybody's interests that the expenditure limits be clear and set at sensible limits which permit the launching of an effective campaign, but at the same time will not push the expenditure norms out of reach of small parties and independent candidates.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the administrative requirements for implementing the Electoral Act, 1997, have become very cumbersome for candidates, political parties and the commission. I intend to review the operation of the Act later in the year with a view to simplifying the procedures and requirements imposed on candidates and political parties. I would welcome any views and suggestions from Deputies regarding this matter. Based on informal conversations there are many views within all parties and on all sides of the House and I look forward to hearing them.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill, as published, provides for the extension of the period for furnishing election expenses statements to the commission by substituting 90 days for 56 days in subsections (1) and (6) of section 36. The section also provides for a further extension to the period by ministerial regulations, if necessary, pending the determination of the State's appeal to the Supreme Court. This will be changed by the amendment which I will be moving on Committee Stage, as already signalled to Members.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides the power for the Minister to make regulations extending the 90 days. It is a standard provision providing for the power to make regulations and it also provides that every regulation made under the section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as it has been made and that it shall be subject to annulment by a resolution passed by either House within 21 days after the regulation is made. Following the amendment I will be moving on Committee Stage to section 1 this section will <Col N="1068" /> not now be required. Section 3 is a standard provision providing for the short title of the Bill, its construction and collective citation.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is simple and straightforward. It extends the time for furnishing election expenses statements to the Standards in Public Office Commission for the recent general election only. The Bill is considered necessary as overspending of the specified expenditure limits could lead to prosecution. However, this is unlikely as the High Court judgment was not delivered until late in the afternoon on the day before polling day. Up to that time candidates would have been acting in accordance with the legislation as it stood. In addition, section 43(6) of the Electoral Act, 1997, provides that it is defence to a prosecution to show that a person did not know or could not reasonably have known that he or she incurred election expenses above the specified limit. The agreement of the DPP must be obtained to proceed with a prosecution.</P>
    <P>The Government considers therefore that the period for furnishing election expenses statements to the Commission should be extended so that candidates, their election agents, national agents of political parties and, indeed, the Commission will have the relevant matters clarified following the determination of the appeal. Needless to say, any election agent or national agent can furnish their election expenses statements to the Commission at any time. It is not necessary to await until the final date, as this could delay the recoupment of a candidate's election expenditure which can amount to a maximum of &euro;6,348.69. Recoupment of election expenses cannot be made until an election expenses statement is received and examined by the Commission. In the case of unsuccessful candidates, a donation statement must also be furnished to the Commission before recoupment of election expenditure is made. No change has been made in the 56 day period for furnishing donation statements by unsuccessful candidates to the Commission. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him the best of luck in his term in office.</P>
      <P>It is appalling that we are debating a Bill such as this in the House tonight. The Deputies who went through the trials and traumas of a lengthy and difficult election campaign and successfully came through it may get up some morning to find that a result could potentially be challenged in the courts because of faulty legislation, which was deemed by the High Court to be unconstitutional. I question how legislation such as this could be passed in this House and the Seanad and be signed into law then be found to be unconstitutional. I will return to this matter at a later date. A certain level of complacency was displayed by the previous Minister in regard to contesting the challenge to the Bill by Mr. Kelly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael will not be opposing this Bill because <Col N="1069" /> it is very basic legislation extending the time for furnishing election expenses statements to the Standards in Public Office Commission for the general election. It arises from the High Court decision, which is now being appealed by the Government to the Supreme Court, concerning certain exemptions to election expenditure set out in paragraph 2 of the Schedule to the Electoral Act, 1997. Initially, the Bill as published, in section 1, sought to extend the 56 day period for furnishing election expenses to 90 days after polling day or for a longer time if the Minister introduced regulations.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to extend the period to 120 days because I did not want colleagues who may have been away on holidays in early September breaching the regulations, unintentionally, if the Minister fails to introduce the necessary regulation to extend the period further. The Minister's tabled amendment extending the period to 167 days or 21 days after the Supreme Court judgment meets my requirements.</P>
    <P>The placing of limits on election spending is a charade in some respects. In my experience some people who have unlimited resources and see themselves as handicapped in their spending by the legislation carried out expensive advertising, comprehensive leaflet drops and gave generous hospitality prior to the election. To use racing terminology, those people with unlimited financial resources were already a furlong ahead before the starting gate opened.</P>
    <P>The Standards in Public Office Commission was very helpful in its briefings to candidates prior to the election and I pay tribute to its officials who travelled the length and breadth of the country to brief general election candidates on their responsibilities. However, the whole exercise is somewhat artificial because of the manner in which the intended impact of the legislation and its requirements have been bypassed. This was an unusual election campaign, in that we knew since late last year that the election was scheduled for either April or May 2002. Because of the World Cup June was unlikely and therefore the outgoing TDs and new candidates had the opportunity to plan a six month, three month or three week campaign to suit their energy or, more important, to suit their financial resources. In my view, in many cases, personal wealth was used to raise the personal profile of wealthy candidates long before the election campaign officially commenced.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to influence the Supreme Court appeal in any way. However, I hope that the learned judges of the Supreme Court will recognise the fact &ndash; the Minister referred to it &ndash; that persons who have served a constituency for five, ten or 20 years in Dáil Éireann cannot simply cease operation on the day the election is called. The public expect business as usual. If I did not respond to constituents' problems they would not have understood. I carried out almost all of my clinics during the election campaign and the 60 or 70 people per week who came to my clinics dur<Col N="1070" /> ing the election campaign expected responses. Correspondence that I received as a result of previous representations had to be forwarded to constituents with cover letters. Meetings that had been planned and appointments that had been made had to be followed through, either by letter or by telephone. I cannot accept that necessary activity during the election campaign has to be included in the election spend.</P>
    <P>In theory I may have ceased to operate as a TD on the day that the Dáil was dissolved but in reality the public still considered me as their TD and expected the services to which they were accustomed. We are being told, quite unfairly in my view, that these services are part of the election spend. We await the judgment of the learned judges of the Supreme Court and, needless to say, we will be subject to their findings.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's assurances that he will look at the legislation again in order to simplify it. I was quite overawed by the depth of detail that, as an individual, I had to deal with at a stressful and active time. We had to be careful not to slip up in any way regarding what is very comprehensive and detailed legislation.</P>
    <P>I also find it hard to understand why the judgment could not be given sooner than on the eve of the election so that there was no comeback for any of us. People may or may not have exceeded the limit. I know only where I stand, but some people could now find themselves in difficult situations.</P>
    <P>I do not know how vigorously the Department and the former Minister decided to contest this case, but I ask that a copy of the defence that was made to the High Court would be made available to all of us so that we know how well our interests and the interests of the public were represented at that level.</P>
    <P>We are here as a constructive Opposition. This Bill is designed to protect our interests and the interests of the public and I accept the Minister's assurances that he will do everything possible, with our co-operation and with our views taken into consideration, to simplify this legislation. It is legislation which we, in all good faith, could intend to comply with, but mistakes can be made and people can find themselves in awkward situations.</P>
    <P>Because of the decision of the High Court, in constituencies where the result was a close call &ndash; in one constituency one vote separated two candidates &ndash; a simple breach of the legislation, which is now being contested, could mean that a person who has been elected could find his or her position undermined legally. We accept the constraints of the Bill and we go along with it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment. I look forward to working with him and to having constructive arguments as we did regarding his previous portfolio. I also congratulate Deputy Allen on his appointment as spokesman for the <Col N="1071" /> Fine Gael Party and congratulate all the spokespersons present.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out in his speech, this Bill was drafted to deal with the immediate accounting issues for the recent general election flowing from the case taken by Mr. Des Kelly and the Government's subsequent decision to appeal that judgment to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Mr. Kelly, a candidate in Dublin Mid-West during the last general election, took a case regarding the Electoral Act, 1997, as amended by the Electoral Act, 2001. The case centred on the inherent bias in the legislation towards sitting Deputies and Senators who could avail of State-funded facilities during an election campaign, a resource that was not available to other candidates. After argument before Mr. Justice McKenchie in the High Court, a judgment was made on Thursday, 16 May, which, as the Minister and Deputy Allen stated, was the day before the general election. The judgment upheld the arguments made on behalf of Mr. Kelly.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party welcomes the Kelly judgment. Over the past decade the Labour Party has battled long and hard to introduce radical electoral reform. We were the first party to put the case for spending limits at election time. My colleague, Deputy Howlin, introduced this innovative and much needed measure in the Electoral Act, 1997. The spending limits we then proposed were both appropriate and measured. They allowed candidates and parties to run a professional campaign and cut out much of the waste and duplication of resources that flowed from big spending at election time, particularly from the two bigger parties because we certainly did not have any resources to do likewise.</P>
    <P>Some 18 months ago the Minister's predecessor increased those limits. A document released under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, and published by <i>Magill</i> magazine, demonstrated that not one piece of research backed up the decision to unilaterally increase election spending limits. The Labour Party viewed that decision as going against the spirit of the 1997 Act and we vigorously opposed the move which effectively granted Fianna Fáil an additional election spend of close to £1 million which it certainly spent.</P>
    <P>None of us can gainsay the fact that the independence of the courts and their immunity from control by the Oireachtas is not absolute and, as is stated in John Kelly's constitutional tome, the 3rd edition of <i>The Irish Constitution,</i> it could scarcely be made so. Most of the court structures and procedures are prescribed immediately or ultimately by statutes which the Oireachtas can modify at any point in time. From a legal point of view, therefore, there is nothing to prevent the Oireachtas from acting as it is doing now and changing the law retrospectively so as to nullify the effect of a court's judgment in a particular case, or to provide for a course that does not tread or impinge on people's rights. I do not see anything being put forward in that regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1072" />It is obvious that the Minister and his officials would have taken cognisance of the Sinn Féin funds case &ndash; Buckley <i>v.</i> the Attorney General 1950 IR &ndash; in so far as there was an action pending in the High Court and a law was passed. Section 10 of that Act of 1947 provided that all further proceedings of the action should be stayed, and that the High Court, if an application was made <i>ex parte</i> by, or on behalf of, the Attorney General, should make an order dismissing the pending action without costs. Nothing of that nature is before us. However, it is clear that the effect of Articles 6 and 34 to 37, inclusive, of the Constitution is to vest in the court the exclusive right to determine a jurisdictional controversy between citizens and the State or between citizens and citizens as the case may be.</P>
    <P>In bringing these proceedings, Mr. Kelly was quite properly exercising his constitutional right as he was entitled to have the matter determined by the judicial organ of the State, but that is a side issue in so far as we must examine the case of Mr. Kelly. Des Kelly's argument centred on the fact that certain facilities and privileges enjoyed by Members of the Oireachtas, such as secretarial support and Oireachtas post and telephone allowances, availed of during an election campaign must be accounted for as an election spend. Mr. Kelly was right to take his case and the Labour Party believes that the High Court judgment is correct. Our view is based on the principal of equality, that all candidates going forward at election should be fighting on a level playing pitch as far as spending limits and resources are concerned.</P>
    <P>The State's defence in the case was weak. In his judgment Mr. Justice McKenchie welcomed the introduction of spending limits and stated that this was a healthy development for Irish democracy. He declared that legal provisions that exempted certain State-funded facilities enjoyed by Oireachtas Members were discriminatory and that there was no justification offered for this unequal treatment. He stated: &ldquo;In my view, none could exist&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have not seen Mr. Justice McKenchie's written judgment, but it appears to have been based on the principal of equality that has informed the Labour Party's approach to electoral reform from the outset. The exemptions that Mr. Kelly challenged were ruled against because they created an inequality between sitting politicians and new challengers. It was obviously unfair and it deserved to be challenged. Once the High Court made its judgment, the Labour Party argued that the State should accept this ruling and get on with the job of incorporating the judgment into electoral law. The Labour Party does not support the decision to appeal and, as such, we will, in principle, be opposing this Bill that facilitates the taking of this case.</P>
    <P>How can one appeal the decision? Deputy Allen is right. It is important to examine the strength of the arguments made in the High Court for, and on behalf of, the people through <Col N="1073" /> the medium of the Attorney General. One must also examine whether there was an acceptance that they were inherently unfair and that, in effect, it was bad law and no argument could be made. Was that the position? We are not aware if that was the case and that is important.</P>
    <P>I would like to know the grounds on which the appeal is being made to the Supreme Court. What has changed since the original hearing? Are the grounds different? I have stated that there is nothing to stop the State appealing the case. The State is obviously taking legal advice &ndash; I know all about this. However, upon what grounds is it doing so? I also know the rationale behind some of the issues; I am not altogether naive, but do question that particular aspect.</P>
    <P>Election deposits must be mentioned because this is the second time in 12 months that a challenge by a citizen to electoral law has succeeded. Last summer the High Court rightly struck down the practice of requiring financial deposits from candidates at election time. The judgment resulted from a challenge by a Mr. Thomas Redmond from Wexford. He was formerly an unemployed builder who, on two previous occasions, was prevented from running because he could not provide the financial deposit. The requirement to pay a deposit discriminated against those who may not have had the financial wherewithal. Obviously, the High Court agreed.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that the State, in this case, argued that the electoral sky would fall in if financial deposits were abolished, the opposite was the case. We recently had our first general election under the new rules and, as far as I can tell from conversations with colleagues, there was no problem with the new system. It did not open the floodgates or anything else.</P>
    <P>As I stated, the Labour Party believes the Government, on behalf of the State, should accept the McKenchie judgment, require Members and parties to amend their electoral spending limits accordingly and get on with business. However, as we now know, the State has decided to appeal, as confirmed by the Minister. I doubt if it believes it has a cogent argument to overturn the McKenchie judgment. It is more concerned with trying to limit the effect of the judgment to the date of its delivery rather than covering the entire general election campaign. We regret that decision.</P>
    <P>Let us consider some of the details of the Bill as outlined by the Minister. A list of amendments tabled in his name have altered the Bill substantially. The Bill as originally drafted was dangerous legislation. The original Bill extended the period for furnishing returns to the Public Offices Commission from 56 to 90 days. However, it was section 2 of the Bill, which allowed the Minister extend this period by regulation, to which the Labour Party objected most strongly. Clearly, it was bad law. The Minister will be aware that the Labour Party submitted amendments early on Monday which indicated the level of our disap<Col N="1074" /> proval of such measures that permitted him by regulation to have a blank cheque or a movable feast.</P>
    <P>I am always concerned about regulations which should be subject to debate in the House. I have said this on many occasions, particularly during the foot and mouth crisis. We were given assurances that a debate would take place in the House. However, it was <i>pro forma.</i> That is the reason I have always argued against any provision being made by secondary legislation, regulations or whatever. That is the reason I am particularly concerned.</P>
    <P>Perhaps due to the nature of the amendments tabled by the Labour Party, it seems the Government has had a change of heart. The Minister's amendments have changed the nature of the Bill substantially and fundamentally. The new amendments directly link the shelf life of this measure to the Supreme Court appeal in the Kelly case. Most importantly, they also propose the deletion of section 2 which I applaud as a wise and prudent move. I accept the Minister's bona fides in this regard. However, the Labour Party will not support this measure as we are opposed in principle to the appeal and, therefore, cannot stand by while a measure to facilitate it is brought before the House.</P>
    <P>I warn the Minister that he can expect principled and constructive opposition from the Labour Party in respect of future legislation emanating from his Department. We will provide vigorous and sustained opposition to the Government where we see that that is the right course to take. The Minister and especially his predecessor, Deputy Dempsey, know that when it comes to critical issues such as social housing, tenants rights, electoral reform or environmental protection, the Labour Party takes a radically different, left-wing approach to the Government.</P>
    <P>The Bill also gives Members an opportunity to comment on a number of related issues. First, since this is the Minister's first time to address the House regarding electoral reform, he might outline his attitude to a number of critical issues in this regard. The previous Minister, Deputy Dempsey, in his tenure in the Custom House, was a great man to talk about reform, but when his record is examined one will notice that precious little was achieved. The most obvious example is the abolition of the dual mandate, on which he backed down. Is it the Minister's belief that the dual mandate should be abolished? If so, does he believe it should be abolished before the next local elections, now that the sword of Damocles that Deputy Healy-Rae held over the last Government has been removed?</P>
    <P>On a broader issue, Members of the House were often treated to fine lectures by the previous Minister on the nature of the electoral system and his belief that the PR-STV system needed to be dismantled and replaced with what is known as the alternative member system. This system, a mix between single seat constituencies elected on a PR basis and a top-up list system, would create <Col N="1075" /> two classes of Member. One is the meat-and-potatoes type Member, of which I suppose I am one, who assiduously attends to constituency work as opposed to the list Member, a more philosopher king type individual who has the time and luxury to ponder and debate the great issues of the day. It is a system that never held much attraction for my good self &ndash; every philosopher king should have a good appetite for meat and potatoes also. Perhaps the Minister will offer his views on these matters.</P>
    <P>A more immediate issue &ndash; one relevant to the substance of the Bill and the Kelly case &ndash; is the matter of pre-election spending. Fianna Fáil, in particular, engaged in a pre-election spending splurge that managed to drive a coach and four through the spirit of the 1997 Act. That is an irrefutable fact. Since the clock only started to tick on election spending on the day the Dáil was dissolved, the hundreds of thousands of pounds spent by Fianna Fáil in advance of the election will not be accounted for.</P>

Is there not a strong argument to return to the original position of the 1997 Electoral Act and ensure electoral spending begins in advance of the official calling of the election in order that the abuse in which Fianna Fáil, in particular, engaged is done away with?</P>
      <P>If the Kelly judgment stands as I believe it will, will facilities provided for Ministers in their role as Ministers as distinct from Members also be accounted for?</P>

      <P>&mdash;the cars and drivers provided. That is what we could face. These perks of office for Ministers must be included if the Kelly judgment stands. The services of the Government media monitoring unit should also be included. As I understand it, Ministers who are candidates <Col N="1076" /> during an election can receive a briefing from the unit on a daily basis and get all the information they need about us. Obviously, that is an advantage. It is a vital service, one I am sure many candidates would love to have available.</P>
      <P>The Government's record on electoral reform since 1997 has been poor to say the least. It ducked the issue of the dual mandate, fought an unemployed builder in the courts who sought to do away with financial deposits, increased spending limits for no other reason than to accommodate the corporate funded Fianna Fáil war chest and has now appealed a High Court decision that is right both in terms of law and fair play. It is true the current Minister may not be directly responsible for this record, but it is one he has to accept.</P>
      <P>The decision to appeal the judgment in the Kelly case is wrong in the view of the Labour Party. We will not support a Bill that facilitates this decision and, as such, will oppose the Bill on Second Stage.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Penrose for sharing his time with my colleagues and me. I welcome the Minister to his new position and wish him well in his role. Like Deputy Penrose, I welcomed the intervention of Mr. Kelly. It demonstrated a lot of courage and was representative of the views, not only of smaller parties and independent and new candidates of all parties, but also many of the outgoing Deputies of the 28th Dáil.</P>
      <P>It is important that we recognise the central arguments in Mr. Kelly's case. There is, unquestionably, advantage involved in the various forms of access that the case addressed &ndash; access to postage, telecommunications equipment and printing facilities, which have not been mentioned heretofore. A raft of other advantages can accrue to an outgoing Deputy seeking re-election in a general election.</P>
      <P>The opening sentence of the judgment statement, to which the Minister's text refers, is as follows:</P>
      <P>Having reviewed the evidence I am satisfied beyond doubt that the facilities which are available to outgoing Members of the Dáil are of particular relevance and value to those Members who seek re-election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the statement that &ldquo;beyond doubt&rdquo; there is an advantage and find it hard to believe that any Member of the House would not acknowledge that fact. This will have to be addressed and the difficulties highlighted in Mr. Kelly's focus on this unfair advantage will need to be resolved. The one word that opens up the opportunity for address is &ldquo;available&rdquo;. The word itself, as the judgment states, does not necessarily imply use. This is where the difference lies. The services were available to all of us, but did we use them? Did we use the opportunity to our advantage while other candidates did not have the same access? These services were available to me, but <Col N="1077" /> I did not employ them. I made a conscious decision not to do so and I am sure that other Members, of all parties &ndash; including the Minister's colleagues &ndash; chose not to use the services for their electoral endeavours.</P>
    <P>In once instance I sent a substantial mailing to first-time voters whom we had identified throughout the constituency. The temptation to use the free Oireachtas envelopes had to be dealt with. Being very conscious of the difficulty of the situation, and having been three times a loser in general elections, I knew that if I chose to use these services, I was placing myself on a different level from that of my 30-plus Sinn Féin colleagues in other constituencies who had no such advantage. Therefore, I chose not to use them. We used the ordinary postal services and have the receipts to show it. It will be part of the expenditure statement I present.</P>
    <P>It is all about creating a level playing field. It is very important that this is established. I agree with the last speaker that the real winners, although there can be advantages for all candidates, have undoubtedly been those from the larger parties. I am aware from speaking to other colleagues that there were no abuses of that advantage by members of the smaller parties and the Independents. It is very important that we establish a standard that all outgoing Members of the 29th Dáil will respect if they are seeking re-election. That is part of the task before the Minister and we hope to work with him in agreeing on a workable approach.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the Government decision to appeal the High Court judgment in this case. It sends out the wrong message and is contrary to the spirit of a level playing field approach to the electoral process. It runs contrary to natural justice in terms of the rights of all citizens to compete as equals. I hope the Supreme Court decision will echo the High Court decision already referred to. I commend the spirit of Mr. Kelly's case to all parties and hope we will move forward, chastened but emboldened by the experience, to ensure every one of us plays his or her part in allowing for a level playing field for all candidates, whether outgoing or newcomers. I hope we put our trust in the arguments, the message and the delivery of the normal course of political engagement and leave aside the questionable access to which we have already referred. I will, accordingly, be opposing the proposition on a principled basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party is opposed to the Bill because we believe it to be unnecessary. It is a Bill which intends only to cover the embarrassment of a Government which failed to draft proper legislation in the first instance and alleviate the discomfort of some in the House who failed to use the election campaign in what most would consider to be an equitable manner. Furthermore, the original electoral Bill put in place election spending limits far above what was necessary and far above the norm for other European coun<Col N="1078" /> tries and because of this some spent up to that level and have subsequently spent beyond it. It should not be the business of the House to bail people out of such a situation.</P>
      <P>Much has been said in relation to election expenditure earlier in the debate. The fact that the clock only started to tick on the commencement of an election campaign meant that many individual candidates, as well as particular political parties, spent huge sums of money that were not even considered election expenditure. In my constituency some candidates, in the run up to and during the election, spent a six figure sum in seeking election and re-election. The real amendment we need in electoral legislation is one which addresses that anomaly and does not simply alleviate the discomfort of particular people and parties in the House.</P>
      <P>If reform is needed, it is in the area of how money is raised for this process. People are asked for funds which are provided for individual candidates and political parties which subsequently &ndash; as has been witnessed up to this very week &ndash; have an undue influence on how decisions are made in the House and in this country. These are the real reforms we should be implementing. The Green Party intends to oppose the Bill on Second and Final Stages and hope subsequent legislation introduced in this area will address the very real problem in our electoral law &ndash; the lack of fairness. For instance, for the upcoming local elections in 2004 there will be no election spending limits at all. Unless enabling legislation is brought before the House we will see a spend-fest which will marginalise the smaller party and independent candidates at the lowest level of government. This is the very level at which we need a new infusion in order to make our decision-making structures relevant to the people who are opting out of what they see as the circus of politics.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Penrose and the Labour Party for sharing time with us and congratulate the Minister, Deputy Cullen, on his appointment and wish him well in his tenure of office. The limits proposed on election spending for the last general election were, I presume, put in place to ensure transparency and accountability with regard to total spending by all candidates and political parties. It is quite clear that all spending for election purposes must include benefits accruing to sitting Deputies and Ministers where such benefits were used for the purpose of ensuring their re-election. A spending limit must apply to everybody equally or it has no meaning whatsoever. It cannot be a question of some being able to subtract election expenses from their total while others must add on such expenses. The Minister said political parties and candidates should have the opportunity of promoting their policies to the electorate. I agree, but it should be an equal opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to appeal the decision in the Desmond Kelly case to the Supreme Court. This appeal, in fact, flies in the <Col N="1079" /> face of natural justice because it allows certain candidates advantages over others. If the Government is in any way sincere about levelling the playing field for all candidates, it should not proceed with its appeal.</P>
    <P>The real intent of those in Government was made clear with what I consider to be a misuse of public funds prior to the three week deadline for election spending purposes, and their actions clearly illustrate that the limits proposed on election spending to ensure equity in the system were mere window dressing. Advertisements under the guise of information regarding the national development plan were to be found in all local and national newspapers for a long period before the general election. Such advertisements featuring Ministers proclaimed the success of the NDP. One advertisement for the Department of Agriculture and Food caught my eye some weeks before the general election. It was a two page colour advertisement in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> featuring one senior and two junior Ministers. I telephoned the newspaper to be informed that such an advertisement would cost approximately £17,000 per page or £34,000 for two pages, just more than &euro;43,000. Taxpayers' money was being spent by our Government to tell us that all was proceeding as planned.</P>
    <P>We will be told that such advertisements are an attempt to inform the public about Government business. When they are accompanied by photographs of Ministers and glowing accounts of the programmes concerned, they are little more than the misuse of State funds for party political purposes while masquerading as information from Departments. In the run-up to a general election, which on this occasion was a long one of approximately six months, they constitute blatant electioneering.</P>
    <P>An advertisement promoting the NDP by Iarnród Éireann plastered all over the place before the previous election carried the slogan, &ldquo;We're not there yet, but we're getting there&rdquo;. This sounds remarkably like &ldquo;A lot done, more to do&rdquo;. Is this just a coincidence or does it reveal a certain management process?</P>
    <P>In the run-up to the recent general election, the Government disregarded the spirit of the law as contained in the Electoral Act but presumably attempted to keep to the letter of the law. Following the High Court judgment, it appears it kept to neither and the purpose of this amending legislation is to let it off the hook. In this context, I oppose the Bill.</P>

I look forward to working with them for the next five years. Those who know me will know that I try to be fair and have even accepted amendments in <Col N="1080" /> the House.

It is the original Act which is at the centre of the judgment and not the Fianna Fáil amending legislation of 2001. I say that so that we understand from where we are coming. There has been a reasonable attempt by Members on all sides of the House to get to grips with this issue.</P>
      <P>I reject the contention of some Members that there is not equality. The purpose of the Act was to try to achieve equality of access and opportunity for those seeking election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows well that, in the context of the amending legislation and the operation of the Act by Members on all sides of the House, there is no doubt that there is a demand for transparency and equality.</P>
      <P>I would like to respond specifically to my colleague, Deputy Penrose, who is an eminent legal person, and with whom I would not attempt to compete, and set out the reasons the appeal is going to the Supreme Court. It may be obvious to some why we must do this but I am not in a position to explain why. Much as I might like to proceed in this regard, I am precluded from doing so because an appeal is to be stated before the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>I thank those Members who recognised that there are serious problems with the Electoral Act from the point of view of the Public Offices Commission, election agents, political parties and Members in terms of the detail and what is included. I signalled in my speech and it has been generally welcomed that I intend to review the Act. I will seek and welcome contributions from all sides of the House. It is my hope that we will emerge from the review with all-party agreement on what should be contained if changes are to be made. We have seen the Act in operation and it is clear we need to move forward.</P>
      <P>I and Deputy Allen and others made the point that there is, in effect, a moral obligation on a Member after the dissolution of the Dáil to deal with numerous constituency matters which arise during the election campaign. That is legitimate. As the High Court found, it is almost impossible to differentiate between electioneering and one's obligations as a Member. This is one of the issues which clearly arises irrespective of what happens going forward and I have no doubt it will arise when we review the Electoral Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to some Members, one would think <Col N="1081" /> that other people who fought in the election, be they independent or a member of a political party, were in ditches and had no resources or access to telephones, communications, office facilities and so on. I can think of many people with substantial businesses who used the facilities available to them in their businesses to fight the previous general election. These were much more substantial than what was available to many outgoing Members in the election campaign. The suggestion that there was inequality because outgoing Members had some incredible advantage over everyone else is untrue and does not stand up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I am not sure to what extent Members used their facilities. I cannot imagine many of us were rushing to Dublin to use them. I did not see my ministerial office from the minute the gun went off until the election was over and I did not want to know about it either. There was one objective, namely, to get out and knock on doors with my colleague, Deputy Wilkinson, with whom I competed ferociously for some of the time. There was not much advantage in my being in Dublin. Many Members would have found themselves in that position.</P>
    <P>We need to be realistic and fair to each other when we deal with these issues. It is in our interests as politicians to implement a fair system which has equal access and is transparent and accountable to the public. That is not just the preserve of Government. I recognise it is equally in the interests of the Opposition. In doing this, we should not come to debates with the narrow political perspective that, just because the Government proposes something, the Opposition should automatically oppose it. I take the point that, in some of the Opposition views expressed, there may be some principled although very narrow grounds as to why the Labour Party, for example, opposes&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Never mind that. What about the &euro;2 million the Government spent before the election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the figures the Lab<Col N="1082" /> our Party spent but I know for my part that I could not wait to get into the campaign to compete with Deputy Stagg's colleague, a good friend of mine from Waterford, who appeared to be the fastest out of the trap and was campaigning well in advance of the election, as were many others throughout the country. Clearly every political party and many independent candidates were well into the field, in some cases for months, before the election was called.</P>
      <P>To respond to a point made by Deputy Penrose, there was never a doubt about the election date. It was set in 1997 and was reiterated <i>ad nauseam</i> by the Taoiseach except that no one believed him. Talking about planning one's marketing campaigns was not of particular advantage to the Government because it was clear when the election would take place. We can leave these issues to one side.</P>
      <P>It is right that the Bill is enacted. Clarity is needed, not just from the point of view of Members or political parties, but also from that of the commission. It is not just about us but all the people who are parties to the interpretation of the legislation. Its enactment is essential and is the right course of action. I have given this some thought. I do not take legal advice just because I am given it. I like to think of the wider implications but there were clearly solid grounds for appealing this decision to the Supreme Court. I hope what I have said to Deputies about the repeal of the Electoral Acts shows my intent to move forward in that area.</P>
      <P>Deputies have raised other matters with regard to electoral reform and I assure the House that I will be examining all the issues raised in the debate. I have not come to a conclusion about all of them within the first two or three weeks of my attaining office, but, as Deputy Howlin once said, I will not be afraid to tackle them and look forward to doing so with the co-operation of the House. I commend the Bill to the House and appeal to those who are opposing it to review their position and let us get on with the real business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (2), lines 18 to 27, to delete paragraphs <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i> and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) in subsection (1)(<i>a</i>), for &lsquo;within the fifty six days next following the polling day at an election, furnish' there were substituted:</P>

      <P>furnish',</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) in subsection (6), for &lsquo;within the 56 days next following polling day at the election or as soon as practicable after the expiration of that period' there were substituted:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;within whichever of the following periods is the longer, namely&ndash;</P>
      <P>(i) the 167 days next following polling day at the election, or</P>
      <P>(ii) the 21 days next following the date of pronouncement by the Supreme Court of its decision in the relevant appeal, or as soon as practicable after the expiration of that period',</P>
      <P>and</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>) the following subsections were added to that section:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(7) In this section the &ldquo;relevant appeal&rdquo; means the appeal made on 14 June 2002 to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court made on 16 May 2002 in proceedings entitled &ldquo;Desmond Kelly, Applicant and The Minister for the Environment, Ireland and the Attorney General, Respondents&rdquo; (High Court record no. 2002/172 JR).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(8) References in this section to the date of pronouncement by the Supreme Court of its decision in the relevant appeal shall, if the issues arising on that appeal (other than the matter of costs) are the subject <Col N="1085" /> of separate decisions pronounced by that Court on different dates, be construed as references to the later or latest of the dates on which those decisions are pronounced by it.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was drafted it was hoped an early hearing by the Supreme Court might have been possible. This is not the case and it is now hoped the appeal will be heard in early October. The 90 day period in the Bill, up to 15 August, is, therefore, not realistic. The amendment instead proposes a figure of 167 days which would bring the period up to 31 October next when, I hope, the appeal will be determined. The amendment also provides that, if the appeal is not determined by 10 October, the extension period will end 21 days after the Supreme Court determination. This formula is preferred to that of extending the period by ministerial regulations, a fact acknowledged by Deputy Penrose, and provides a more definitive position for the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas. The net effect is the same as that provided for in the Bill as published, but is expressed better and avoids the making of ministerial regulations in this matter, which Deputy Allen was also anxious to see.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the point that I have an aversion to ministerial regulations which are laid before the Oireachtas without Members having an opportunity to discuss them. I recall specifically a number of regulations introduced in the context of the Diseases of Animals Act, 2001. At the time we were given an assurance by which I understood we would have an opportunity to make submissions with regard to the regulations. They would have profited somewhat had we been given such an opportunity. They were introduced regardless. Once regulations come before the House, after the expiration of 21 days they become ingrained in law and we do not get an opportunity thereafter to make observations about them.</P>
      <P>My amendment would have introduced a time limit of not more than 180 days. I took cognisance of the fact that there was not a hope, despite the presence of a former Attorney General beside the Minister and the pleas before the High Court, of receiving a hearing before October.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>As well as this reason for proposing the limit, it would also bring a degree of finality to the matter. I do not like the idea of a Minister returning and extending the period by any number of days. In theory, he or she could extend it beyond the next election, although I accept he or she would not do this in practice. The maximum period now stands at 21 days <Col N="1086" /> beyond the date of the pronouncement of the Supreme Court order, which is a fair, reasonable and sensible proposal. The very fact that the Minister has removed section 2 strengthens the Bill and makes it more amenable. However, it does not deal with some of the points raised concerning the judgment. I disagree with his view on the very reasonable points raised as to the reason we should not appeal.</P>
      <P>I would be interested in hearing the former Attorney General's views on the reasons this appeal is being taken. In order to make a real, objective judgment on the matter we would need to read the arguments made in the High Court. However, that is a matter for another day and I am sure we will see them in time.</P>
      <P>Without pre-empting what the Supreme Court will do, I maintain that it will uphold the Kelly judgment. Mr. Justice McKenchie's assessment of the situation will prove to be well founded in the Supreme Court. I acknowledge the amendment tabled by the Minister deals very adequately with the points I made and even goes beyond them. For this reason I will not pursue them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter. While I am disappointed the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is not present, I welcome the fact that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is replying to the debate.</P>
      <P>I want to raise with the Government the unemployment crisis in Killarney, County Kerry. On Friday last, Sara Lee, which manufactures women's sports underwear, announced that it was to lay off 104 employees. This represents a loss of about 55% of the total workforce at the plant and was a major shock to the men and women concerned and their families. Nobody expected losses on such a substantial scale. Friday's announcement came just two and a half years after the great news that Sara Lee was to take over the old Pretty Polly factory in Killarney in January 2000. This was a tremendous boost to the people of Killarney who had looked at the locked gates of Pretty Polly for five years. The Pretty Polly plant had employed 850 people at its peak in the early 1990s before going into decline and closing in 1995.</P>
      <P>The losses at Sara Lee last week came after a number of other redundancy announcements in the town in recent months. A couple of weeks ago the Liebberr crane manufacturing plant announced that it would lay off 60 temporary fitters, welders, electricians and general workers by the end of this month. In addition, the ALPS electronics plant, which employs 300 people in Killarney, is shutting down and moving its entire operation to Millstreet, County Cork.</P>
      <P>There has been a litany of other job losses in south Kerry in recent months and years. The list is substantial: Transmould Electronic, 25 jobs; Wilson Socks, transfer of approximately 100 jobs from Caherciveen to Tralee; Vantage Wholesale, 30 job losses; Cadburys, Rathmore, 23 job losses. The list goes on. Furthermore, Kerry County Council is threatening to lay off all temporary staff while the Tánaiste is making huge cutbacks on community employment schemes, all of which will lead to hundreds of people in Killarney and south Kerry facing the dole queues at a time of economic decline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To compound the crisis in industrial unemployment in the Killarney area in recent times, there is also a very acute unemployment problem in the tourism industry in the region. Local tourism industry representatives have said the number of visitors to County Kerry in the first six months of the year was down by 20%. This has the knock-on effect of putting many seasonal employees out of work and huge pressure on bed and breakfast establishments and guesthouses which are facing major financial pressures in the current year. Does the Government have proposals to deal with the unemployment crisis in Killarney? I call on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to visit Killarney and to meet with the trade <Col N="1087" /><Col N="1088" /> unions and local elected representatives to discuss this situation. I further call on her to establish, as an immediate priority, an unemployment task force to examine ways in which new industries can be attracted to the town. The Government has sat on the fence with regard to rising unemployment in Killarney and in south Kerry in general, for the last number of years. It is high time Ministers got off the fence and did something about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment wishes to assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities and she has impressed on the industrial development agencies &ndash; IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland &ndash; the crucial importance of making even greater efforts to provide employment throughout the country. Both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are structured on a regional basis so as to facilitate a more balanced regional distribution of jobs.</P>
      <P>On 21 June 2002, Sara Lee announced that it plans to restructure its operations in Killarney. These changes will result in a workforce reduction of 104 employees, as Deputy Moynihan-Cronin has said. The restructured Killarney operation will employ 82 people and cater to the high value-added market segment which the company believes can be supplied on a profitable basis from Ireland. The company has advised that the redundancies are necessary as part of a restructuring plan which it is hoped will return it to profitability. The lay-offs will take place immediately.</P>
      <P>The company stated that the market for seamless underwear has changed dramatically in the last 18 months whereby it has become far easier for low cost countries to compete. This shift in the market makes it increasingly difficult for the Killarney operation to remain competitive. The company's forecast for the year ahead predict that there is no foreseeable pick-up in the market for the basic low cost product which has been in decline since last year.</P>
      <P>Commencing this week the company will hold meetings with SIPTU and other groups to agree the details and timing for these changes. Sara Lee will be providing termination packages to those affected and will also assist with job placement.</P>
      <P>The Minister expressed her disappointment last Friday, 21 June, at the announcement of the job losses at the plant and said the most immediate task was to ensure the maximum personal support for those affected by the announcment. FÁS contacted the company last Friday when the announcement was made. When the timing and profile of the job losses are finalised the agency will offer its full range of services to those affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ALPS Electric (Ireland) Limited has two plants in the area, one in Killarney and the other in Millstreet, 20 miles away. The company has decided to consolidate its two plants in Ireland into one location, moving its Killarney facility to Millstreet. The consolidation of the plants is pro<Col N="1089" /> ceeding, is ahead of schedule and is expected to be complete by the end of July 2002. To date, 30 staff have transferred from the Killarney plant to Millstreet and the remaining staff will transfer at the end of July when the company returns from its summer shut-down. To date, only five staff have left the company since the consolidation announcement. The company expects to achieve significant gains in efficiency and productivity once the consolidation is complete and has indicated that it plans to grow its overall numbers once it consolidates into one location.</P>
    <P>When it becomes vacant IDA Ireland will actively market the Killarney premises to other suitable inward investment projects. The recent thrust of IDA Ireland has been towards regional and sectoral development and to consolidate the existing base of overseas companies. The agency has been encouraging new prospective investors involved in higher value industries to locate outside the major cities and, in particular, to locations that have not seen the emergence of modern industries. Many issues influence the locations chosen by new investors, but competitiveness, the quality of access and infrastructure and the availability of skilled workers will be crucial factors in achieving better regional development. The agency's strategy is currently concentrating its efforts to attract projects to the larger provincial towns and also addresses the need to increase the value and sustainability of overseas companies already established or about to establish in Ireland.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is currently actively engaged in promoting south County Kerry as a suitable location for inward investment. Employment in IDA Ireland assisted companies has risen steadily over recent years from 1,023 in 1996 to 1,771 at the end of 2001, an increase of 73% over the past five years. This includes a net increase of 166 jobs during 2001, which has been generally acknowledged as a difficult year for the Irish and global economies.</P>
    <P>Employment in Enterprise Ireland client companies in south Kerry has also risen steadily over recent years from 1,004 in 1996 to 1,989 at the end of 2001, an increase of 98% over five years. This includes a total of 108 new jobs created during 2001. These gains have been spread over a number of sectors, including international services, food and industrial products. A number of projects have been approved for the south Kerry region during the first quarter of 2002, which will result in a number of new jobs being created in the coming years. This should confirm to the Deputy that much has been happening in south Kerry in the last few years.</P>
    <P>A number of Enterprise Ireland companies are operating in the Killarney region, including the Monex Group, Killarney Milk Products Limited, Killarney Plastics Limited and a number of other smaller companies. In addition, FEXCO employs over 750 people throughout the south Kerry region. There are no major job losses anticipated in Enterprise Ireland client companies at this time in the south Kerry area.</P>
    <P>The provision of quality office and industrial premises on high quality business parks in key <Col N="1090" /> centres is being undertaken by IDA Ireland working in partnership with local authorities and the private sector. This is recognised as being essential to attracting new greenfield investment to the regions.</P>
    <P>In this regard, IDA Ireland completed an upgrading project for the landscaping in the agency's Killarney business park in late 2000. Killarney Plastics Limited has developed a 1.3 acre site and constructed a 35,000 sq. ft. factory unit and Killarney Advance Factory Limited, a company approved under the BES scheme, has begun site development work for the construction of a 20,000 sq. ft. commercial building on a site still owned by IDA Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister is confident that the measures outlined above, which are currently being adopted by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, as well as the continuing commitment of the Government to regional development, will bring further positive results to Killarney. She will continue, along with the industrial development agencies, to promote Ireland and its regions for suitable industrial development projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, and the Minister for agreeing to discuss this matter. Brannockstown is a beautiful and historic village in the catchment area of the Naas, Newbridge triangle which has been designated by the relevant Departments and State agencies as an area for development. Unfortunately, the facilities in the school in Brannockstown do not match what the Government intends for the area.</P>
      <P>I recently visited the school and it is unbelievable that we expect small children in a national school to put up with such conditions. The school secretary has no secretarial facilities and operates from the back of one of the classrooms. The remedial teacher works in a pre-fab building measuring 8 ft. by 6 ft. which is also used as the principal's office. An extra pre-fab building has been provided. The village has been affected by the Celtic tiger economy and there is local housing development. The local people have taken the initiative and are trying to improve conditions in the school. One of their priorities is the provision of a fourth teacher. At present the school is staffed by a principal and two assistant teachers. Classes are totally overcrowded.</P>
      <P>The historic value of the area is well documented in the annals of history. The school is adjacent to Pastor Dunlop's church. He is also involved in the school and is very disappointed to see that this is the best we can offer the children of the area. I cannot over-emphasise the importance of this school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would have to visit the school to appreciate the extent of overcrowding in the classrooms and the problems encountered by teachers and pupils. One could not say the teachers and the board of management are not active on behalf of their school. When one passes the school premises one can see how well the school is maintained and looked after. It is clear that the board of management want the school to progress. The sur<Col N="1091" /> roundings of the school are as neat and tidy as one could possibly expect. However, when one goes into the classrooms and sees the pressure experienced by the teachers and the numbers of students crammed in, it is impossible to imagine how a teacher can work in such circumstances. I ask the Minister to draw the Department's attention to the need for a fourth teacher to alleviate the overcrowding and to progress the application on behalf of the board of management and the teachers for a new school in this area. It is an area that would benefit from it as it has prospects for future development. People want to come to that area to live and bring children to school. The existing conditions make that impossible and the teachers want to talk to the INTO to have the school included on its list. It is sad that such an historic village has to suffer in this way. I ask the Minister to consider providing a fourth teacher and a new school in this village.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position of the Department of Education and Science regarding the application by the school management authorities for a new school building to replace Brannockstown national school, Brannockstown, Kilcullen, County Kildare.</P>
      <P>Brannockstown national school is one of three primary schools in the parish of Kilcullen. The other schools are St. Joseph's national school, Halverstown, and St. Brigid's national school, Kilcullen, which is located approximately three miles from Brannockstown national school. There is considerable spare accommodation at St. Brigid's national school. St. Joseph's national school, which is located approximately four miles from Brannockstown national school, is experiencing a decline in pupil enrolment.</P>
      <P>Enrolments at Brannockstown national school have been increasing gradually in recent years. The school had an enrolment of 74 pupils on 30 September 2001 and has a staffing of a principal and two mainstream assistant teachers plus shared resource and remedial teachers, neither of whom is based at the school.</P>
      <P>Before improvement works are approved for any school, it is necessary to carry out a long-term enrolment projection on which to base the school's future accommodation requirements. This process involves a detailed analysis of previous enrolment patterns at the school, projected intake of pupils from within the catchment area, together with the local inspector's report and the capacity of existing schools to meet demand. Account is also taken of other factors such as significant housing development, if any, which might impact on the primary school-going population in the area. In this instance, attention has been drawn to the fact that pupils from outside the catchment area are being enrolled in Brannockstown national school and this matter will have to be addressed by the boards of management of the schools concerned. A decision on the school's long-term accommodation requirements will be taken and notified to the school authorities as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" />Pending the determination of the school's permanent requirements, the Department of Education and Science is addressing the short-term accommodation needs by way of the provision of temporary accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his elevation. I have information which suggests that the National Roads Authority will have to slash its 2002 roads budget by as much as 50% and up to 75% of the figure required by some county councils to move forward on their roads programme this year.</P>
      <P>In the case of one county council, namely Galway, it was expected by the county council officials that the 2002 allocation would need to be &euro;24 million to carry out the full remit under its jurisdiction on the projects in the county and city this year. Some weeks ago it appeared that it would get &euro;12 million, but a few days ago it was informed this has been slashed to &euro;6 million.</P>
      <P>A bypass was due to be constructed at one of the biggest bottlenecks in the country at Loughrea, County Galway. However, it now appears that this will not be treated as a stand alone project. Based on a letter I received from the NRA this morning, this project is now to be treated as part of the overall N6 project from Ballinasloe to Oranmore. This is horrendous news for thousands of commuters inside and outside the county and it could be years before Loughrea is bypassed.</P>
      <P>I am making a special case to the Minister and to the National Roads Authority that the Loughrea bypass should proceed even if compulsory purchase orders are necessary. This would mean the bypass would be built years before the completion of the N6 project given what seems to have happened to the overall allocation of funds.</P>
      <P>I understand many other county councils are getting shocks at the moment. I call on the Minister to confirm to the House the commitments given by the last Government prior to the general election that expenditure on roads would be such that the programme would be completed on target by 2006.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to understand why certain roads being designed by consultants at huge expense may now be &ldquo;parked&rdquo; for this year. These include the Galway city outer relief road, and the N17 and N18 roads may also be in serious trouble.</P>
      <P>During the past two years many local committees have voiced concern that, in some cases, the size of a road being proposed by consultants was larger than necessary for the projected traffic over the next ten to 15 years and should be scaled back. I understand the National Roads Authority is considering some of those projects in light of this concern. This raises a serious question over consultancy fees. I assume the consultants entered into a deal with the councils and the NRA to design the road to the original specification and will have to be paid for any redesigning that is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the NRA should openly explain what is happening. If the Government is <Col N="1093" /> remotely interested in regional development obviously a proper roads infrastructure is vital to ensure that towns far from Dublin are given the type of infrastructure that will create a counterbalance to the growth in Dublin. I want the Minister to outline what is happening to the funding to county councils this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on this important issue.</P>
      <P>To talk about severe cutbacks in the context of the national roads programme demonstrates a complete lack of knowledge concerning the growth in investment in the programme over the past five years. The irrefutable facts are as follows. Since 1997, a total of 60 major projects, covering approximately 400 km. of national roads, have been completed or are under way. During 2001 alone, 15 major projects with a combined length of 106 km. were opened to traffic. These included the M1 Dunleer-Dundalk motorway, the M50 southern cross route, the N15 Clar-Bamesmore Gap, the N20 Blackpool bypass, the N20 Croom bypass, the N20/21 Adare-Limerick and the N56 Mountcharles bypass.</P>
      <P>Work is currently under way on 20 major projects involving over 200 km. of national roads, including nearly 130 km. of road upgrades to motorway or dual carriageway standard. These include such major projects as the Dublin port tunnel, the south eastern motorway and Kildare bypass &ndash; projects which have been in planning for some time and which we are delighted to have in construction. Work has also recently commenced on the Ashford-Rathnew bypass (N11) and Ballincollig bypass (N22).</P>
      <P>Work on schemes in planning has also progressed well. Preferred route corridors have been identified for the five main interurban routes. Some of the projects on these routes will be delivered by public private partnerships. The NRA has made good progress on its PPP programme. Bids are being examined by the NRA for the Kilcock-Kinnegad project and the bidding process is under way for the Dundalk, Fermoy and Waterford bypasses.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer provision for 2002 at &euro;958 million is more than three times the 1997 level and nearly twice the 1999 level. Over the period 2000-02 the Exchequer provision for national road improvements of &euro;2.458 billion is more than &euro;260 million in excess of that provided for in the NDP. That is the key point that everyone seems to miss.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>By any standard, there is a significant programme of work under way. When taken with all of the projects completed since 1997, it represents a major upgrading of the national road network. Deputies will be aware of many parts of the country where the national road network has been improved beyond all recognition as a result of the priority accorded to investment in the network. The reality is that high investment in recent years has enabled a <Col N="1094" /> rapid acceleration of the national roads programme. Subject to overall economic and budgetary conditions, it is envisaged that the high levels of investment of recent years in the programme will be maintained. Unfortunately, the cost of the programme has risen at a faster rate than was anticipated at the time that the national development plan was prepared. This is attributable to a variety of factors. For example, inflation in the civil engineering sector averaged over 10% per annum in the 1999 to 2001 period. However, there are indications that construction cost inflation is now easing which will assist in securing a better level of output for the high levels of investment being made in the programme.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that we are currently in the third year of a major seven year programme which is flexible enough to accommodate changing circumstances, including overall economic and fiscal considerations. In any programme of this size, it is inevitable that there will be some slippage in the progress of individual projects due to project specific or general factors, such as the dispute in 2001 relating to access to land, the foot and mouth restrictions, higher costs than originally anticipated and the funding requirements of projects in construction.</P>
      <P>The programme is progressing well and the Government is committed &ndash; as will be clear from what is a huge level of investment in the roads programme and the programme for Government &ndash; to the strong and accelerated promotion of the NDP national roads programme, including the advancement of the five major inter-urban routes. The pace and volume of the 2002 programme reflects this. The Department of Transport, with the Department of Finance and the NRA, will consider the future funding of the national roads programme and take account of its cost and the prevailing economic and budgetary conditions.</P>
      <P>In this context, the proposed National Development Finance Agency will have an important role to play. Plans are advancing for the establishment of an agency to finance major infrastructural projects such as national roads and evaluate financing options for PPP projects. The NDFA will enable the Government to apply commercial standards in evaluating financial risks, costs and options associated with projects thereby ensuring the best financing package is availed of. This will assist in achieving value for money in the financing of projects and maximising the funding available for infrastructural projects of national importance.</P>
      <P>It should also be acknowledged that increased investment in the national roads programme is just one element in the Government's approach to the achievement of more balanced regional development. In fact, the core of the NDP is to achieve this objective. Investment in national roads is being complemented by record investment in non-national roads, water services, public transport and broadband infrastructure. An Agreed Programme for Government clearly sets out what we will do in coming years. We are committed to building on the good progress already made with the implementation of the national development plan, particularly with regard to national roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that this is the first time I have addressed the Chair, other than by way of points of order, I congratulate the Ceann Comhairle on his election to that office and wish him a happy term. I also congratulate the Minister and wish him well in his term of office.</P>
      <P>In raising the scandal of planning levies I will specifically address the issue in my constituency of Louth. When a planning application is granted a levy is applied. In 1999 this levy was £150; it increased to £600 over the next three years. On 1 March 2002 it increased to &euro;1,900 overnight in respect of a road improvement levy and &euro;1,270 in respect of a community development levy. More than &euro;3,000 must be paid before a spade even reaches the site. This is a fundamental rip-off on which I ask the Minister to reign in the county manager involved.</P>
      <P>In 1997 the first-time buyer's grant was fixed at £3,000. In contrast to these levies, it has not increased by one cent. Louth County Council is claiming almost all of the first-time buyer's grant. A fundamental issue regarding the funding of local government is at stake. When rates were abolished in 1977 local authorities were to be funded by way of block grants. That is still supposed to be the case. Unfortunately, Louth County Council has seen fit to raise funds by this other method. Who are the victims of this new practice? They are mostly, but not entirely, young people. Young people are no burden on the State; they are the complete opposite as they are providing their own homes. What is the county manager doing about this? What is he doing to help them? They are being ripped off. It is not fair, equitable or just.</P>
      <P>These levies are euphemistically called road improvement and community development levies, but we know what they really are. A community centre was recently built on the Cooley Peninsula. When they received their grant of permission, a community development planning levy of &euro;3,000 was included. That speaks for itself. This funding of local government by sleight of hand is unacceptable. It is within the Minister's power to bring it to an end. A section of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, provides for the transfer of power to apply these levies from the county manager to the elected members. I ask the Minister to apply it. House and site prices are already expensive enough. It is within the Minister's power to end this scandal. I ask him to do so forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. In August 2000 the Planning and Development Act, 2000, was passed following detailed consideration of its provisions by the Oireachtas. This Act, which revises, extends and consolidates the legislative basis for the planning system, introduced many significant changes and initiatives designed to introduce a sustainable development ethos into the system, increase its <Col N="1096" /> efficiency and ensure a strategic approach to land use planning in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The development contribution system has been significantly revised in the 2000 Act. The range of infrastructure which can be funded by this mechanism has also been increased. The changes are designed to increase the transparency of the system, which had been a complaint of developers.</P>
      <P>Section 48 of the Act requires planning authorities to draft a development contributions scheme setting out the contributions that will be charged to help to pay for public infrastructure and facilities provided by the local authority to benefit development in its area. Following a public consultation procedure, the scheme and a report on any submission made to the authority on the draft scheme is submitted by the manager to the elected members for consideration and adoption. Once a scheme is adopted, it is applied, as before, by attaching a condition to a planning permission. This new system will ensure greatly increased transparency for developers who will be able to look at the scheme and know, not only how much they will have to pay in respect of their development, but also why. It should also be a useful resource for local authorities to fund infrastructure for their local communities.</P>
      <P>The Act also provides for two other types of contribution to be levied on planning applications. Special development contribution conditions may also be imposed where specific exceptional costs not covered by a scheme are incurred by a local authority which benefit a particular development.</P>
      <P>Section 49 of the Act provides for the drawing up of supplementary development contribution schemes to facilitate particular public infrastructure or projects which are provided by a local authority or private developer on behalf of a local authority by way of PPP and which will benefit the development on which the levy is imposed. The scheme under this section is adopted in the same way as a general contribution scheme, that is, by the elected members.</P>
      <P>These sections were commenced on 11 March this year. It is now a matter for individual planning authorities to draw up and make their development contributions scheme. Under the Act, they have been given two years to do so. In order to ensure there was no gap in the funding of this critical local infrastructure, the Act provides that, in the meantime, local authorities can continue to levy development contributions in accordance with the provisions of the 1963 Planning Act.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would like to take up the powers now entrusted to him since 11 March. It would be helpful to bring them to the attention of his local authority because they will meet some of the problems the Deputy raised with regard to the influence councillors could and should have. That will be welcomed by all councillors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the recommendations arising from the review by an interdepartmental group chaired by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme. Officials from the Revenue Commissioners, the Departments of Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs, and my Department are also represented on the group. The group is examining all aspects of the scheme. The Deputy will appreciate that the work of this review group is very complex. As part of its deliberations, the group has heard oral submissions over a period of five and a half days and has received over 260 written submissions from interested parties. I have not yet received the report of the group but I understand that it will be finalised in the near future.</P>
      <P>I have been informed there are up to 360,000 persons in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree or other. These include both persons with medical conditions other than those which are covered by the scheme, and those with medical conditions covered by the scheme. The substantial tax benefits of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme make for considerable interest in and desire to be admitted to the scheme. At present there are approximately 7,500 beneficiaries under the scheme. Beneficiaries, once qualified, are eligible for life.</P>
      <P>The cost of reliefs, excluding the annual road tax costs, was approximately &euro;30.5 million in 2001 as compared to &euro;5.1 million in 1994. The cost of the scheme in 2002, again excluding annual road tax costs, is estimated to be in the region of &euro;38 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many factors have to be taken into account by the review group and many interests balanced. As I have said in the past, I appreciate the difficulties which people who suffer from some form of physical disability face in coping with everyday life. Any proposals, whether to widen the scope of the scheme or otherwise, which may emanate from the review group will receive full consideration. It would be inappropriate of me to make <Col N="1098" /> any further comments pending such consideration.</P>

      <P>The statutory minimum wage is an average hourly rate of gross pay for an employee as defined under the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000. The wage currently stands at &euro;5.97 per hour. The annualised equivalent of the present minimum wage is &euro;12,107. The current position is that, following budget 2002, incomes amounting to up to 90% of the minimum wage annualised are exempt from income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The document, An Agreed Programme for Government, between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats states that &ldquo;over the next five <Col N="1099" /> years our priorities will be to achieve a position where all those on the minimum wage are removed from the tax net&rdquo;. The commitment is given in the context of a broader economic and budgetary strategy which provides, among other things, that the public finances will be kept in a healthy condition and that personal and business taxes will be kept down in order to strengthen and maintain the competitive position of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware also of the commitment contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which states that &ldquo;It is an agreed policy objective that, over time, all those earning the minimum wage will be removed from the tax net&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The question of when all those earning up to an annual amount equivalent to the statutory minimum wage annualised will be not be liable for income tax is a matter for consideration in the context of the Government's budgets over the next five years consistent with the Government's overall economic and budgetary strategy and with the Government's commitments as already outlined.</P>
    <P>In the current tax year, it is estimated by the Revenue Commissioners that there are 43,500 tax cases who have income at or below the minimum wage and who are liable for income tax.</P>

      <P>During my term of office as Minister for Finance, I have responded positively and constructively in relation to recommendations on Revenue powers, for example, from the public accounts committee sub-committee on DIRT or to proposals from the Revenue Commissioners in relation to Revenue's general powers of investigation and audit and also with regard to penalties for Revenue offences. I have provided a significant increase in manpower resources for Revenue, having sanctioned over 400 additional posts in the last two years. This has enabled, among other things, a considerably enhanced audit and investigations resource. All of these measures, taken together, have placed the Revenue Commissioners in a stronger position to address tax evasion and avoidance.</P>
      <P>I therefore cannot agree with the proposition that not enough attention was or is being paid to anti-evasion measures proposed by the Revenue Commissioners or others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" />As I indicated in response to the reports in the media on 24 May on the IMPACT conference I provided a significant package of powers in the Finance Act, 1999; among other things this enabled the DIRT look-back audit, which resulted in payments totalling &euro;219 million from the financial institutions in tax, interest and penalties; where possible, I have given a positive response to all of the recommendations relating to Revenue powers made by the public accounts committee sub-committee on DIRT, including those contained in their latest report which were acted upon in this year's Finance Act; Revenue now has greater powers to access financial information, including bank accounts; following the recent Revenue initiative to encourage voluntary disclosure in relation to bogus non-resident accounts, which yielded &euro;227 million in underlying tax, interest and penalties, Revenue has obtained High Court orders to obtain the names of bogus non-resident account holders and these cases are being processed within Revenue.</P>
    <P>Since 24 May, I have received correspondence from IMPACT seeking to clarify their position in the light of the media coverage and indicating that the motions passed at their conference were intended to express the union's view on ways to improve tax compliance and the tax take. They also stated that the relevant texts contained &ldquo;no explicit or implicit criticism of the Revenue Commissioners or the Minister for Finance&rdquo; and further, that it was not &ldquo;IMPACT's, or its Association of Inspector of Taxes branch's, intention to level such criticism&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The PPF is a 33 month programme covering the period 2000-2002. Significant progress has been made in its implementation and, to date, eight progress reports have been presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas and to the social partners.</P>
      <P>The final 4% pay rise, relating to the final nine months of the programme, is due in 2002, with the implementation date dependent on the particular employment or industry. In the public service, the increase is to be paid no earlier than 1 October 2002, subject to certain requirements in relation to performance indicators and sectoral targets. The public service pay agreement will run until end June 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Public Service Benchmarking Body was established in July 2000 under the terms of the PPF to examine public service pay and jobs by comparison with the private sector. The benchmarking process and the composition and terms of reference of the body were agreed by the Government and public service unions. The <Col N="1101" /> body's report will be finalised on schedule by 30 June 2002.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the body were wide and gave it freedom to approach its job of comparing pay rates and jobs in the public service and the private sector. It was agreed, as part of the adjustment to the PPF, that one quarter of any increase recommended will be paid retrospectively from 1 December 2001. To meet the potential costs arising from this process I provided &euro;150 million in the budget but since the report is not yet to hand it is not possible to judge whether the budget provision will be sufficient.</P>
    <P>The December 2000 adjustment to the PPF also provided that there would be talks between the public service unions and employers about the phasing of the payment of the balance.</P>
    <P>The report will need careful consideration and examination when it is received by both the Government and the unions and I expect talks between the two sides to take place shortly after the report is published. The Government will of course have to have regard in any talks to the possible budgetary impact the cost of any recommendations might have and the commitment we have made to keep the Government finances close to balance or in surplus.</P>

      <P>The total value of subscriptions made to special savings incentive accounts from commencement to December 2001 was &euro;356.6 million, with the Exchequer contribution for the same period amounting to &euro;88.8 million &ndash; it should be noted that the Exchequer contribution is made on a month behind basis, ie the contribution for April is paid in May. The value of subscriptions for the period January to April 2002 amounted to &euro;439.4 million with the Exchequer contribution amounting to &euro;109 million. The number of accounts held by all qualifying savings managers at 31 December 2001 was in the region of 390,000 and at 30 April 2002 was 1,170,208. The figure for 31 December is subject to final confirmation by the Revenue Commissioners on completion of the analysis of the 2001 annual returns, which is currently in progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme was closed to new applicants on 30 April 2002. On that basis, the estimate of the cost to the Exchequer in 2002 is &euro;429 million; in the years from 2003 to 2005 &euro;517 million; &euro;446 million in 2006; and &euro;89 million in 2007. The cost of the scheme will be reduced where participants die, withdraw from the scheme or vary their monthly contribution downwards, while the cost will rise if participants increase their monthly <Col N="1102" /> contribution. The estimates above assume that these variations will broadly cancel each other out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget day forecast for the 2002 Exchequer balance is for a surplus of &euro;170 million. This is still the target although it may be achieved by a lower revenue performance than forecast offset by savings and other receipts not available at budget time, including lower than expected EU budget contribution and the proceeds of the sale of ACC Bank. The end-May Exchequer returns showed a surplus of &euro;56 million.</P>
      <P>Budget forecasts for the public finances are predicated on the level of activity in the economy and relate to the full year, not a portion of the year. On budget day, an increase of 3.9% in gross domestic product in 2002 was forecast for the year.</P>
      <P>The increase in tax receipts in 2002 over 2001 was forecast at budget time to be 8.6%. The end-May Exchequer returns showed tax receipts in the first five months were 1% lower than the same period in 2001 &ndash; an improvement from the end-April position of 1.8% below the same period in 2001.</P>
      <P>These results must be considered in the context of the budget day changes which will boost revenue later in the year. The 2002 budget change to corporation tax payment dates will enhance receipts from June onwards. The increase in the standard rate of VAT from 20% to 21% in March of this year began to be received in May.</P>
      <P>While income tax receipts to end-May show a decrease of 14.7% on the same period last year, it should be noted that the impact of the change to a calendar year means that the first five months of 2002 have had to absorb the income tax changes from both budget 2001 and budget 2002. In addition, payments into SSIA accounts in the period January to May 2002 totalled &euro;125 million whereas there was no payment for SSIA in the period January-May 2001. It is expected that income tax receipts will recover ground over the remainder of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As with tax receipts, it is difficult to draw conclusions for the year from the first five months expenditure. Net voted spending in the first five months was &euro;11,117 million compared to &euro;8,742 million in 2001 &ndash; an increase of 27.2%. This compares to a figure of 14.4% in the Revised Estimates Volume. Year-on-year percentage increases in spending are influenced by both spending trends in the base year and in the cur<Col N="1103" /> rent year. In 2002, a number of factors including the 1% lump sum which was paid in April and the earlier payment of social welfare benefits have pushed up the year-on-year percentage increase above what it would otherwise have been. Notwithstanding these timing issues, there are pressures on expenditure in some areas such as demand-led schemes in the health area, capital expenditure on national roads and prison officer overtime, for which additional funding will be provided. Departments have been required by Government to take appropriate measures to ensure that expenditures are controlled over the remainder of the year and to make appropriate adjustments to ensure that the final overall outturn for expenditure will come in in line with the original plan for the year as whole. This is a normal procedure following a mid-year review of trends to date. I have no plans to introduce a supplementary budget in advance of budget 2003.</P>

    <P>Revenue had indicated that it commenced inquiries into 224 Ansbacher-type cases and five <Col N="1104" /> of these cases have concluded settlements with Revenue. The total consists of 121 cases named by the authorised officer and 103 similar cases discovered by Revenue. A total of 193 cases are currently under active investigation. Inquiries have not yet commenced in the remaining 26 because of insufficient identity information, apparent non-residency, or the 1993 amnesty being claimed.</P>
    <P>The investigation includes examining the tax position of disclosed entities and accumulating and assembling information on other connected entities. The number of connected entities in relation to core cases under investigation is now nearly 700.</P>
    <P>Revenue is making extensive use of its legislative powers to seek books, records, documents and information in the cases being investigated. Where appropriate, prosecutions will be considered but these will depend on the level of evidence available.</P>
    <P>To date a total of &euro;17.252 million has been received, mostly by way of payments on account, in respect of 52 cases. This is made up of:</P>

This is still the target although it may be achieved by a lower revenue performance than forecast offset by savings and other receipts not available at budget time, including lower than expected EU budget contribution and the proceeds of the sale of ACC Bank.</P>
    <P>The most recent figures for Exchequer receipts and expenditure were those for the period to 31 May 2002 published on the Department's website on 5 June, which show a surplus of &euro;56 million for the period to end-May.</P>
    <P>While the performance of individual tax and non-tax subheads will vary, receipts will improve in particular as the full impact of the budget revenue-raising measures is felt. The 2002 budget change to corporation tax payment dates will enhance receipts from June onwards. The increase in the standard rate of VAT from 20% to 21% in March of this year began to be received in May.</P>

      <P>The budget day target for income tax receipts for 2002 is for an increase of 1.1% over the 2001 outturn. The Exchequer Statement which was published on 5 June 2002, showed that income tax receipts in the year to 31 May 2002 totalled &euro;4,110 million. This represents a decrease of 14.7% on the same period in 2001.</P>
      <P>The change to a calendar year means that the first five months of 2002 have had to absorb the changes from both budget 2001 and budget 2002. In addition to this, payments into the SSIA accounts did not commence until June 2001. This means that income tax receipts in the January to May 2002 period have been reduced by the SSIA payments in those months whereas the same period in 2001 had no similar reduction.</P>
      <P>There is also a substantial effect from the performance of the economy in each period. Income tax receipts in 2001 weakened significantly in the latter half of that year due to declining economic conditions. This is demonstrated by the fact that income tax receipts in the first five months of last year were 9.3% up on the previous year while receipts in the remainder of the year recorded a reduction of 2.1%.</P>
      <P>As the year progresses, timing factors which are acting to reduce the rate of change in receipts in the early part of the year will gradually be eliminated and the rate of change over 2001 should increase.</P>

      <P>National development plan, NDP, expenditure on health capital is provided for under the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme, ESIOP, of the NDP. By the end of 2002 it is estimated that almost &euro;1.16 billion of expenditure will have been invested under the heading of NDP health capital. This investment which is fully <Col N="1107" /> funded by the Exchequer is slightly in excess of the target for the period and represents a major acceleration of spending over the pre-plan levels under this heading.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that construction industry inflation has been higher than anticipated since the launch of the NDP and this has impacted on all NDP capital investment, including the health area. Additional costs have also arisen in some areas due to respecification of projects as they move from conception to planning, design and construction. Despite these factors, good progress has been made with financial outturns well on target and significant physical output being achieved, including in the health area.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that by end 2002, the gross Exchequer spend on NDP economic and social infrastructure will be approximately &euro;8.5 billion or &euro;740 million more than planned.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that implementation of the NDP, including investment in health capital, will be a priority for Government. As was signalled in the plan as published, the yearly allocations for NDP investment will have to take account of wider budgetary priorities and accord with the requirements of economic stability. Specific yearly allocations for the various sectors covered by the NDP infrastructure programme, including health, will therefore be decided by the Government in the light of available resources and the priority which the Government has accorded to such investment.</P>

      <Quest>the resources he believes will remain for transfer to the Exchequer by the end of 2002 from the Social Insurance Fund, from Central Bank external reserves and from debt sinking funds; and his views on whether such resources should be transferred to the Exchequer.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <P>It is currently projected that the accumulated surplus in the Social Insurance Fund at the end of 2002 will be &euro;1.3 billion. Any future transfer would be a matter for consideration in the context of future budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When discussing the issue of the Central Bank's reserves, it is important to specify the reserves in question. The official external reserves are principally composed of the foreign currency assets of the Central Bank. In the Central Bank's balance sheet, the bank's total assets, including its external reserves, have a counterpart in liabilities. These liabilities include banknotes in circulation, credit institution and Government deposits and the bank's capital. However, the bank does have accounting reserves which have been accumulated by the bank over the years from income earned from its operations. As of end 2001, they stood at &euro;1,475 million. The bank also has a revaluation account, which reflects <Col N="1108" /> unrealised gains from valuation changes; this acts in effect as a contingency provision against currency and other market fluctuations.</P>
    <P>The accumulated accounting reserves of a central bank contribute to its credibility and the appropriate level of these reserves is a prudential matter. Of course, an event such as the changeover to the euro, which has had such a large effect on the financial system, naturally gives rise to some consideration of the role and purpose of the accounting reserves. I therefore took the opportunity late last year to invite the board of the Central Bank to consider whether a portion of its accounting reserves might be made available to the State. In its reply the board indicated that, when the changeover to the euro was completed, it would conduct a review of the level of accounting reserves. I will examine the results of this review when they become available.</P>
    <P>Budget 2002 also projects a transfer to the Exchequer from the Central Bank of &euro;240 million in 2002 in respect of unredeemed Irish banknotes written off by the Central Bank following the changeover to the euro. There may be scope for a smaller transfer in this regard in 2003 or later years depending on the volume of Irish bank notes still outstanding. This is a matter for consideration in the context of future budgets in conjunction with the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>There was a &euro;750 million balance in the capital services redemption account at the end of 2001, &euro;500 million is to be used for debt service purposes in 2002 and the remaining &euro;250 million for debt service in 2003 as provided for in budget 2002.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the Say No to VAT for Charities campaign currently being run by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group. The current VAT treatment of charities is based on EU VAT law, specifically the Sixth EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under this directive, a wide range of charitable and voluntary activities are exempt for VAT purposes. This means that they do not have to charge VAT on the services that they supply. However, their exempt status necessitates that these organisations are unable to recover the VAT paid by them in the course of their activities.</P>
      <P>In general, companies and persons who are registered for VAT are required to charge VAT on the goods and services they provide. As VAT is charged on the total final price, companies are allowed recover VAT on their inputs. Otherwise VAT would effectively be collected twice on some of the value of the goods or services. This does not arise for exempt activities. This is the essential difference between taxable and exempt entitles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unlikely that the cost could be limited to the &euro;63 million claimed by that group. Given that <Col N="1110" /> there is no provision for refund orders under EU law, as well as the cost involved, I have no plans to introduce any measures to allow charities to reclaim VAT.</P>

      <P>The main focus of my role in the financial sector is the delivery of an appropriate legislative framework for prudential supervision. The quality of our system of financial supervision is recognised abroad. This is one of the reasons that Ireland is seen as a location to establish financial enterprises.</P>
      <P>I am also mindful of the need to promote the delivery of competitive financial services. The strategic review of banking undertaken by officials of my Department and of the Central Bank, and which was published in August 2000, considered, <i>inter alia</i>, possible future developments in the structure of banking from the standpoint of an efficient competitive market for financial services. They recommended that the regulatory authority for financial services should be mandated to monitor and report on competitiveness in the financial sector as it affects bank customers. I have accepted this proposal, and a provision to this effect is contained in the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority Bill, 2002, which is currently before the House.</P>
      <P>The general question of competitiveness is primarily a matter for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Her remit includes fostering the conditions which support enterprises in meeting the challenges and opportunities of an increasingly knowledge-based, globalised and environmentally sustainable economy. The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is giving active consideration to having a consultancy study undertaken, with a view to a vigorous examination of the competitiveness of the Irish insurance market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Several arguments have been advanced in favour of hypothecated taxes &ndash; that they provide a clearer mechanism for public preference to be brought to the political process than the current method of general fund financing. It has also been suggested as a way of bringing more transparency and direct accountability to the setting of public expenditure priorities. The assumption is therefore that if a tax is earmarked for a certain activity then that particular area will merit more attention and that this will create the perception that the public are getting a more effective economic or social outcome than would be the case under a general allocation mechanism.</P>
      <P>Earmarked taxes, however, tend to be an inefficient long-term use of resources. Once established, they tend to determine particular levels and direction of public expenditure and generate spending in particular areas whether it is useful or desirable. The existence of an earmarked tax would tend to generate a minimum level of expenditure. This expenditure tends to generate constituencies which support this form of spending making it more difficult to abolish such taxes or divert the revenue to the general fund of expenditure.</P>
      <P>In general I believe the argument favours the current method of the allocation of tax revenues according to the expenditure requirements set by Government. I would not support the view that there should be strong earmarking, where the level of expenditure on the public service is determined by the level of hypothecated tax revenue.</P>
      <P>As regards the plastic bag levy, the intention of the levy was to facilitate a change in consumer behaviour and reduce and hopefully eliminate the use of plastic shopping bags in the State thereby reducing the number of plastic bags that end up as litter. The levy was also intended to encourage the use of reusable bags.</P>
      <P>The decision to use a 15 cent levy to encourage voluntary compliance with the policy of reducing and eventually removing the plastic shopping bag was considered more appropriate than an outright ban on plastic shopping bags which would be difficult to enforce and might not gain public acceptance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1113" />However, the extent of actual revenue raised was a secondary consideration and in time with the removal of the plastic shopping bag from use in the retail trade, there should be no long-term revenue from this source. I do not think that this is what supporters of hypothecated taxes have in mind.</P>

      <P>The national development plan is being implemented through seven operational programmes comprising 30 sub-programmes and 147 measures. Each operational programme has a managing authority which monitors financial and physical output targets, which are set out at measure level in the individual operational programmes. Each implementing agency is required to supply physical and financial progress at the operational programme monitoring committee meetings held in the spring and autumn. The progress reports for these are available from the respective managing authorities for the operational programmes as set out below:</P>

    <P>The OP progress reports are considered by the NDP monitoring committee which is chaired by my Department. The most recent meeting of this committee in Cork on 30 May 2002 noted that overall there has been satisfactory progress on NDP physical output. In particular, good progress has been made implementing the NDP infrastructure programme with financial outturns well on target and significant physical output being recorded despite a number of factors limiting progress. I would accept that construction industry inflation has been higher than anticipated at the outset of the plan. Additional costs, which impact on physical output, have also arisen in some cases due to the respecification of projects as they moved from conception to planning, design and construction.</P>
    <P>Progress is satisfactory in the area of human resource development under the NDP. Physical <Col N="1114" /> output for some measures has been below target levels due to a lack of demand for the programmes and schemes on offer, reflecting the higher level of employment in the economy.</P>
    <P>Physical progress is behind profile in areas of productive sector investment due to lower than expected demand reflecting the downturn in investment in the international economy. In the regional operational programmes, good physical progress has been recorded in some key areas such as non-national roads, but physical progress in other areas is behind target mainly because of the impact of foot and mouth and delays in receiving State aids approval from the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>More generally some NDP measures have been slower to start than anticipated but by March 2002 all measures under the NDP had been launched.</P>

      <P>The new policy sets out the Government's commitment to gender equality in the Civil Service. Under the policy, Departments are required to set strategic objectives and equality goals which will secure equality of opportunity for both male and female employees. The equality objectives must be included in departmental strategy statements.</P>
      <P>There is a particular gender imbalance at management level. Women form 69% of staff in the lower grades, but make up only 23% at management grades. A main aim of the new gender equality policy is to increase women's representation at management level.</P>
      <P>In the light of their strategic objectives, Departments must then go on to plan and implement a detailed programme of action in areas such as recruitment, promotion and training of staff.</P>
      <P>To tackle the imbalance at management level, the Government set a target for the key assistant principal grade. Departments must work to ensure that, by 2005, 33% of assistant principal posts are filled by women. At present, women fill 27% of these posts. The aim is to have a larger number of women who can be promoted to the more senior levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Departments have set goals and targets and are planning how to achieve them. For example, the Department of Finance has drawn up a policy on equality and diversity which will be issued to staff shortly. Over the next five years and subject to the number of vacancies arising, the representation of women in the Department of Finance should increase from 28% to close to 35% in the <Col N="1115" /> assistant principal grade, and from 14% to close to 25% at the principal grade. Other Departments are adopting broadly similar strategies.</P>
    <P>The equality unit in the Department of Finance has held a series of meetings with Departments and offices on the policy. The aim was to exchange ideas on how best to implement the policy. The unit is now preparing a short report which will summarise what Departments are doing and make proposals about what more could be done. The report will be circulated to all Departments.</P>
    <P>These discussions have shown that Departments are implementing the policy effectively. I am confident that the policy will secure equality of opportunity for both men and women in the Civil Service and will also address the imbalance at management.</P>

      <P>Electronic procurement is a key initiative in the Government's 2002 Information Society Action Plan, New Connections. The strategy is a blueprint for the rollout of electronic procurement across the public sector aimed at providing an improved service to users, buyers and suppliers as well as better value for money by enhancing the buying power of public bodies, reducing transaction costs and optimising inventory levels. To this end an unprecedented reorganisation and restructuring of structures, processes and systems will take place. Changes in procurement processes and practices brought about by such a strategy will first be tested on a pilot basis before being extended generally to all procurement business activities in the wider public sector. The strategy was agreed following an extensive study and consultation process and when implemented will result in a much more efficient and cost effective public procurement regime.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that as soon as I became aware last February of the events at AIB's US subsidiary, Allfirst Bank, the Central Bank was asked to provide a report, on the completion of its investigations, as to whether it considered that any changes to legislative provisions governing banking supervision might be required. I have now received the bank's report in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will also recall that the primary regulators of Allfirst's activities are the US Federal Reserve Bank and the State of Maryland Banking Regulator. When the crisis emerged last February, two officers of the Central Bank of Ireland travelled to the headquarters of Allfirst and worked with officers of the Federal Reserve to confirm the scale of the losses and to find out why <Col N="1117" /> procedures failed to identify a serious problem in good time.</P>
    <P>A major investigation was also conducted by AIB Group, directed by Mr. Eugene Ludwig, former US Comptroller of the Currency, and its report was published on 14 March last. It identified a major breakdown in internal controls and management oversight in Allfirst and in the oversight of Allfirst by AIB.</P>
    <P>As a result of these findings, regulatory action has been taken in the US in relation to Allfirst and AIB by way of a published written agreement. This requires Allfirst and AIB to perform certain actions and to address the findings from the investigations. AIB is required to provide the US regulators and the Central Bank with progress reports on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>What has emerged from these investigations is that the problem in question was not the result of legislative deficiencies but rather was due to internal weaknesses in procedures at Allfirst in the US. The Central Bank has confirmed that it has sufficient statutory authority to allow it to work closely with the US authorities in regard to supervisory issues. It also has sufficient powers to require AIB to carry out procedural changes both in the US and at group level.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the Central Bank considers that it is not necessary to recommend any changes to legislation in the area of supervision at this time.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Central Bank that it will continue to work with the US regulators in relation to Allfirst and to monitor the criminal investigation in progress. If that work or the Central Bank's own examinations of credit institutions here suggest the need for legislative change, the bank will bring the matter to my attention.</P>

      <Quest>the amount of money in 2001 which accrued to his Department by way of the Government levy on insurance policies; the amounts collected from the different sectors of the insurance industry, for example, motor, life, business and so on; and the way in which these funds are spent.</Quest>

      <P>A levy under the stamp duty code was first imposed on insurance premiums &ndash; both life and non-life &ndash; in 1982. Both levies were imposed initially at a rate of 1% of gross premiums. The life levy was increased on a number of occasions up to 3%. It was abolished with effect from 1 January 1993.</P>
      <P>The non-life levy remained at 1% until 1993 when it was increased to its current rate of 2%. The non-life levy is imposed on almost all non-life insurance premiums including motor insurance, the exceptions being re-insurance, voluntary health insurance, marine, aviation and transit insurance and export credit insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1118" />The yield from the 2% non-life levy in 2001 was &euro;69.11 million. Insurance companies pay this levy <i>en bloc </i>to the Revenue Commissioners and therefore there is no breakdown of the total yield attributable to each chargeable category. The levy was introduced to broaden the stamp duty base, thereby raising additional revenue. The yield from the 2% levy, as part of taxation receipts generally, contributes towards funding the requirements of the Exchequer such as funding public services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Overall the year-on-year increase in voted expenditure at end-May was 27%, which is in excess of the annual increase provided in the Estimates of 14%. Year-on-year percentage increases during the early part of the year are affected by a variety of factors such as the timing of payments this year, the level of spending in the corresponding period last year and the absolute size of the figures being compared.</P>
      <P>Spending to date in 2002 includes a number of such timing factors. For example, social welfare spending to end May is up 33% in comparison with an annual Estimates increase of 25%. However, this includes spending for a full five months of the weekly rate increases in both budget 2001 and budget 2002, whereas spending to May 2001 included only two months of the budget 2001 increases. Furthermore, the child benefit increases in budget 2002 are effective from April 2002 in comparison with the June 2001 payment of the budget 2001 increases. Stripping out the impact of these factors would bring the increase back to 25%, exactly in line with the projected increase for the year as a whole.</P>
      <P>The PPF pay increases also have a timing impact. The full cost of the 1% lump sum from 1 April 2002 is included in the end May figures but the year-on-year impact of this will diminish over the year. In the case of health spending, the end May figures include an extra week's payment to the health agencies which was not made until June last year.</P>
      <P>For some Departments, for example, Education and Science and Agriculture and Food, the level of spending to end May 2001 was unusually low and therefore the year-on-year percentage increase is higher than it would otherwise have been if spending in the base year &ndash; 2001 &ndash; had been as expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding these timing issues, there are pressures on expenditure in some areas such as demand led schemes in the health area, capital expenditure on national roads and prison officer overtime, for which additional funding will be <Col N="1119" /> provided. Departments have been required by Government to take appropriate measures to ensure that expenditures are controlled over the remainder of the year and to make appropriate adjustments to ensure that the final overall outturn for expenditure will come in line with the original plan for the year as whole. This is a normal procedure following a mid-year review of trends to date.</P>

      <Quest>if his Department has developed a view on the ways taxation can be used to give incentives for energy saving measures, such as lower VAT on renewable energy technologies, heat insulation, bicycles and so on, in view of the clear link between fossil fuel usage and climate change.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In general where taxation policy has an impact on outcome on the use of fossil fuels, it has focused on taxes on cars and motor fuels and provided for excise differentials to promote more environmentally friendly petrol. Tax reliefs have also been introduced in respect of the provision of wind energy.</P>
      <P>Regarding VAT, even if changes in the rates of VAT were considered desirable for introducing energy savings measures, the options for using the VAT system to promote energy efficiency are limited. While we can maintain existing zero rates on certain food, books and oral medicines, we cannot introduce any new zero rates of VAT. It would not be possible to introduce new zero rates for bicycles or any form of insulation or any such product that is not now zero rated. Likewise there are some restrictions on the extent to which reduced rates can be introduced and the majority of goods and services which could be subject to the reduced rate would have no impact on fossil fuel usage.</P>
      <P>In general however, it is not evident that making changes to VAT rates is the most appropriate way of incentivising energy saving measures. The effect of introducing a reduced VAT rate may not be evident in the overall price of an energy saving good. In addition, the price impact of any reduced rate of VAT may not be significant enough to change consumption patterns. Thus, for example, a reduced rate of VAT would have little impact on the overall cost of solar panels. Energy saving technologies are also subject to change. If an energy saving good is reduced rated, but is no longer as environmentally friendly as a newer product, it would be difficult to re-rate the older good and maintaining the reduced rate for both products in such circumstances would not produce an environmentally friendly outcome and would reduce Exchequer income from VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I receive many requests for VAT reliefs and reductions for <Col N="1120" /> different types of products and services. If it were possible to concede a relief in respect of energy saving measures, then it would lead to pressure for similar concessions in goods and services subject to VAT. The Deputy will appreciate that the yield from VAT makes a significant contribution to the funding of necessary public services in the State.</P>
    <P>As regards the issue of climate change, the national climate change strategy provides a framework for achieving reductions in greenhouse gas emission reductions in the most efficient and equitable manner while continuing to support economic growth and to prepare Ireland for the more ambitious commitments that will be required after 2012. Taxation measures can play their part in attaining environmental goals.</P>
    <P>The taxation proposals in the climate change strategy do not provide for an incentive based approach to resolving issues of climate change and minimising the use of fossil fuels. The strategy proposes the use of broad taxation instruments, which are integrated with overall economic and taxation policy with a least cost approach and which takes account of international competitiveness. In effect therefore the strategy foresees the introduction of new taxes or building on existing ones as a framework for climate change taxation.</P>

      <P>The programme for Government states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where significant once-off revenues accrue to the State through, for example, the sale of State assets or the restructuring of the Central Bank, we will use these revenues to create a National Transformation Fund. This fund, which will be managed by the NTMA, will be used to finance multi-annual infrastructural development programmes.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resources allocated to the National Transformation Fund or subsequent expenditure from the fund should not impact on the Exchequer balance. The way in which any resources allocated to the fund will be treated for general Government accounting purposes is governed by the accounting rules set out in the European System of Accounts, 1995, ESA95. EUROSTAT &ndash; the statistical office of the European Union &ndash; is the body which decides how these rules should be applied. The general Government balance or GGB represents the difference between revenue and expenditure of all Government sector bodies. The impact on the GGB of resources allocated to the fund is likely to depend on the nature and source of the resources. In general, resources gen<Col N="1121" /> erated through the sale of &ldquo;financial assets&rdquo;, as defined under ESA95 rules, do not count as general Government revenue. Resources generated through the direct sale of &ldquo;non-financial&rdquo; assets, as defined under ESA95 rules, do count as general Government revenue.</P>
    <P>The impact which any subsequent expenditure from the fund will have on the GGB depends on the nature of the infrastructural development involved. In general, expenditure on non-commercial infrastructural projects counts as general Government expenditure. On the other hand, expenditure on commercial projects is not expected to count as general Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>The overall impact of the fund on the GGB will therefore depend on the mix of revenue and expenditure items going through the fund in any one year. The allocation of resources to the fund will not have any impact on the level of general Government debt except in so far as those resources would otherwise have been used to pay off the national debt.</P>

      <P>It is my intention to provide every support which I consider appropriate to the Revenue Commissioners in carrying out their task of improving tax compliance.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are currently well placed to do this, having at their disposal a large body of enhanced audit and investigative powers, much of which was provided during my term of office as Minister for Finance, as well as having considerable additional staffing resources &ndash; over 400 additional staff sanctioned over the last two years, for example. My aim is to build on this strong base already established and any further actions deemed necessary or desirable in this regard will be considered on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>Under Revenue's current statement of strategy it is committing greater efforts and resources to improving returns filing and tax payment compliance. It is also increasing the resources that are devoted to Revenue's audit programme. Revenue will continue to tackle the shadow economy by identifying and registering all customers with a tax liability and following up taxes due.</P>
      <P>The application of these increased efforts and resources should result over time in a significant reduction in non compliance.</P>

      <P>Income tax receipts into the Exchequer up to 31 May 2002 totalled &euro;4,110 million, representing a reduction of 14.7% on the same period in 2001. The budget day target for 2002 as a whole is for an increase of 1.1% over the 2001 outturn. The <Col N="1123" /> variation between the two rates of change can be misinterpreted as there are a number of timing factors affecting income tax receipts in 2002.</P>
      <P>The change to a calendar year means that the first five months of 2002 have had to absorb the changes from both budget 2001 and budget 2002. In addition to this, payments into the SSIA accounts did not commence until June 2001. This means that income tax receipts in the January to May 2002 period have been reduced by the SSIA payments in those months whereas the same period in 2001 had no similar reduction.</P>
      <P>There is also a substantial effect from the performance of the economy in each period. Income tax receipts in 2001 weakened significantly in the latter half of that year due to declining economic conditions. This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that income tax receipts in the first five months of last year were 9.3% up on the previous year while receipts in the remainder of the year recorded a reduction of 2.1%.</P>
      <P>The combined effects of these timing factors is to reduce the rate of change of income tax receipts in the earlier part of this year. However, as the year progresses the economy recovers and these factors unwind, the rate of change of receipts should increase.</P>

      <P>The programme for Government undertakes to address Ireland's infrastructural deficit in a coherent and determined way over the next five years. We believe that new methods of financing major capital programmes are required to achieve this. These must take account of the need to maximise efficiency, delivery, value for money and appropriate risk transfer across multi-annual programmes. Accordingly, we will establish a national development finance agency or NDFA to finance major public projects and to evaluate financing options for PPP projects. This agency may finance both commercial and non-commercial type projects.</P>
      <P>The NDFA will enable the Government to apply commercial standards in evaluating financial risks, costs and options associated with projects thereby ensuring that the best financial package is availed of in each instance. The NDFA may compete with, but will not substitute for, private financing of PPP projects but will be an additional mechanism to be used in the context of achieving value for money and risk transfer in PPP projects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that under section 101 of the Finance Act, 2002, changes were made to the VAT responsibilities of arts festivals. This section provides for the introduction of a reverse charge provision to cover cultural, artistic and entertainment services provided by performers not established in the State. The effect of this change is that the supplier of the service &ndash; i.e. the non-resident artist &ndash; is not liable for VAT on his or her supply of this service and the recipient will instead be liable. In most cases, this is the promoter of the event.</P>
      <P>This section also provides for situations where the promoter and the performer are not established in the State, but where they operate from a premises within the State. In the case of all mobile traders, performers or otherwise, the owner of the premises must provide some details about the trader to the Revenue Commissioners. If such information is not forthcoming, the owner of the premises may be made joint and severally liable for the VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 101 also provides for a temporary deferral of the reverse charge provision for all bodies who have received Arts Council funding over the past three years since the passing of the Act into law. Such bodies which are eligible are <Col N="1126" /> required to apply to the Revenue Commissioners to have the enforcement of the reverse charge process deferred until 1 March 2003. The purpose of this amendment was to allow those who organised more commercial entertainment and bodies funded by the Arts Council the option of using the reverse charge arrangements, if they so choose. It was also intended to allow many bodies such as arts festivals time to organise their affairs so as to comply with VAT legislation. This derogation does not imply any deferral of VAT which should be remitted to the Exchequer by non-resident traders and performers and it will be necessary for all arts organisations to comply with the relevant VAT requirements after 1 March 2003.</P>
    <P>It has been the position since 1992 that all non-resident performers and in addition, all forms of mobile trader, have a liability to VAT when providing services in the State. This is in order to ensure that non-resident suppliers of goods and services do not evade tax, nor enjoy a competitive advantage over local traders. The changes in this year's Finance Act provide for a more effective collection mechanism for VAT incurred by non-resident performers and mobile traders. It was deemed necessary to introduce this provision in order to ensure that overseas artists do not evade their legitimate VAT liabilities.</P>

      <P>Ireland's bilateral aid is given in the form of grants and does not include lending.</P>
      <P>I welcome the emphasis given to development at the recent summit in Seville. The upcoming G7 meeting in Canada will also focus on this issue. I have no plans to launch new initiatives. I consider that the HIPC initiative, strengthened with the poverty reduction strategies, is the best mechanism currently available to bring the debts of the highly indebted poor countries to a sustainable level. That said, I recognise and have stated on several occasions that the HIPC initiative in its current form may not provide many of the eligible countries with a permanent exit from unsustainable debt. I have therefore given my support to calls for further enhancement of the HIPC initiative, including additional funding on the part of donors, if the initiative fails to meet its stated aim. I have also publicly stated that the current concept of debt sustainability may need to be revised to take account of basic social needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the issue of debt relief is vitally important in the fight against global poverty it also needs to be looked at in the context of the broader international development effort. Mere transfer of resources from other aid programmes, bilateral or multilateral, to fund debt relief would have little if any net positive effect on poverty <Col N="1127" /> reduction. The challenge now, as I see it, is to mobilise resources globally to meet the UN target of 0.7% of GNP for ODA. Accordingly, at the International Conference on &ldquo;Financing for Development&rdquo;, in Monterrey, Mexico, Ireland called on the international community to take concrete steps to implement the long standing commitment to the UN ODA targets.</P>
    <P>Finally, I reiterate that I fully support efforts to combat global poverty and I will continue to press for the implementation of a HIPC initiative that delivers on its aim of exit from unsustainable debt, and to urge the international community to implement commitments to the ODA target.</P>

Subsequently an interdepartmental committee, including representatives of the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Taoiseach, the Environment and Local Government and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, was established.

      <P>Following a meeting between Mr. Paddy Duffy and Dr. Martin Mansergh, special advisers to the Taoiseach and Mr. Barry Murphy, Chairman of the Office of Public Works in March 1999, directions were given to the Office of Public Works to contact the agent for sale of the Battle of the Boyne site and enter into negotiations; to arrange to have the site surveyed and valued; and to give an estimate of the cost of providing a visitor centre and associated facilities.</P>
      <P>A report issued to Dr. Mansergh in July 1999 and was acknowledged by him indicating the agreement of the Taoiseach that the Department of Foreign Affairs, with input from the Office of Public Works, would bring a memorandum to Government in September 1999.

      <P>On budget day inflation, as measured by annual changes in the consumer price index or CPI was projected to average 4.2% this year. The latest available data show that inflation averaged 4.8% in the first five months of the year. While the rate of increase is expected to moderate over the coming months, the budget day estimate for 2002 is under review. My Department will publish an updated estimate in the annual Economic Review and Outlook which is intended to be published during the summer.</P>
      <P>In terms of EU comparisons, the appropriate measure of inflation is the harmonised index of consumer prices or HICP. On this basis, Irish inflation averaged 5.0% in the first five months of 2002, compared to 2.2% in the EU. For the euro area, the corresponding average for the first five months is 2.4%. For the EU, the latest EU Commission forecast &ndash; spring &ndash; was for an inflation rate of 2.1% this year.</P>
      <P>Inflation is higher in Ireland than in the rest of the EU partly as a result of domestic cost pressures. It is important that these cost pressures are not allowed to lead to deteriorating competitiveness which would result in higher unemployment. This is why wage moderation, and cost moderation more widely, are so important.</P>

This position was endorsed by the Supreme Court as recently as 1998 when the court held on appeal in the case of O'Síocháin <i>v</i> Neenan that the total widow's pension paid by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs was the beneficial entitlement of the widow and that she was assessable to tax on the full amount.</P>

Following the year of bereavement, a widowed parent with a qualifying child or children may qualify for the one-parent family tax credit of &euro;1,520 in addition to the personal tax credit of &euro;1,520. A further tax credit, the widowed parent tax credit, is available on a sliding scale for the first five tax years following the year of bereavement as follows:</P>

    <P>Therefore, in the first year following bereavement, a widowed parent is entitled to aggregate tax credits of &euro;5,640, comprising a single personal credit of &euro;1,520, a one-parent family credit of &euro;1,520 and a widowed parent credit of &euro;2,600. At the present standard rate of tax, this means that in that year a widowed person with a dependent child or children can have income of up to &euro;28,200, or &euro;31,500 if in receipt of the PAYE credit, without incurring any income tax liability.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is the case that a person in receipt of a widow's or widower's contributory pension from the Department of Social and Family Affairs is exempt from liability for the health levy on any portion of his or her income.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the foregoing favourable provisions, I have no plans at present to exempt the addition(s) to a widow's or widower's contributory pension for a dependent child or children from income tax.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 130 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Public Service Benchmarking Body was established in July 2000 under the terms of the PPF to examine public service pay and jobs by comparison with the private sector. The benchmarking process and the composition and terms <Col N="1130" /> of reference of the body were agreed by the Government and public service unions. The body's report will be finalised on schedule by 30 June 2002. It will then be considered by both the Government and the public service unions.</P>
    <P>It was agreed, as part of the adjustment to the PPF, that one quarter of any increases recommended will be paid retrospectively from 1 December 2001.</P>
    <P>The adjustment to the PPF also stated that the balance would be implemented on a phased basis, to be agreed between the parties, taking account of the desirability of implementing the benchmarking body's recommendations as speedily as possible, the level of increases involved, any successor to the PPF which might be agreed between the social partners or whatever other arrangements may be in place on the expiry of the programme and the need to respect any links which the benchmarking body might establish between levels of pay and other developments.</P>
    <P>Also, &euro;150 million was set aside in budget 2002 for the cost of the benchmarking process. This is a prudent provision but there is no way at this stage of accurately estimating what the eventual cost of the recommendations will be. I expect that talks about the implementation of the report with the public service unions will begin soon after receipt of the report.</P>

      <P>As I said in reply to former Deputy Pronsias De Rossa on 23 April 2002 &ndash; ref: 12404/02, the governing council, which is the supreme decision-making body of the European Central Bank, comprises the governors of the national central banks of the euro area member states, together with an executive board. The Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland is on the governing council.</P>
      <P>The executive board includes the President and Vice-President of the ECB and four other members, all of whom are appointed by common accord of the governments of the participating member states at the level of Heads of State or Government. Ireland is not currently represented on the executive board.</P>
      <P>In the interest of balance, all member states should over time put forward nominees for positions on the executive board and membership of the board should include an appropriate balance of nationalities. Accordingly, I have advised the Spanish Presidency of Ireland's intention to nominate a candidate to the executive board next year when the term of office of the next board member expires in 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1131" />I expect that there will be strong interest among member states in this vacancy and in order to be a serious contender, Ireland must put forward a person of high calibre whose qualifications and track record are equal to the position.</P>

      <P>The Value for Money audit of the Health Services identified the need to enhance the capability of the Health Services in regard to: performance measurement and evaluation; management accounting; costing; and associated information systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking account of these findings and the proposals for developing a Civil Service-wide management information framework the commission will: examine the various financial management systems and control procedures currently operated in the Department of Health and Children, and by the key budget holders in the health boards and in the main spending and service areas of the health sector; assess the various reporting procedures in these services; assess the capacity of the systems and procedures to provide relevant, timely and reliable information, in relation to current expenditure and capital expenditure with particular reference to the measurement of resource use against outcomes and management of resources within budgets; evaluate the capacity of these systems to develop cost consciousness among resource managers and to provide incentives to manage cost effectively; examine international best practice in regard to health service financial management systems, cost control and reporting arrangements; examine how the Estimates in the health area are compiled and allocations finalised and monitored; consider how the presentation of finan<Col N="1132" /> cial data can be enhanced so as to provide better information on how service delivery is proceeding; and make recommendations in accordance with its findings, with a view to enhancing the timeliness and quality of financial management information throughout the health services and provided to Departments. The commission will report to the Minister for Finance by end 2002, with appropriate interim reports on any aspects of particular concern.</P>
    <P>The Government believes that it is necessary to improve the transparency and effectiveness of financial controls in the health service and I believe that the commission will make an important contribution in that regard. It would be my intention that it should develop recommendations for achieving effective and timely financial management and reporting arrangements throughout all levels of the health system, which will permit better budgetary control and a more informed basis for future decision making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the aims of Delivering Better Government was to put in place a process of modern business planning across the Civil Service which is based on better informed resource allocation decisions and enhanced accountability for the results achieved for these resources.</P>
      <P>A framework of expenditure reviews was established in 1997 in accordance with one of the key financial and managerial reforms in the strategic management initiative. By establishing the review system as a regular part of their annual cycle of work, Departments are assisted in ensuring the efficient use of resources. The reviews provide a systematic analysis of what is actually being achieved by each programme and assist in informing decision making in relation to the individual programmes.</P>
      <P>To date, approximately 40% of Government spending is either the subject of completed reviews or in the process of being reviewed. Building on progress to date, the previous Government agreed in May last to a framework for the next phase of the review process, focusing on more significant areas of spending. I am hopeful that the process will continue to assist both my Department and line Departments in evaluating spending priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These reviews do not, however, represent the totality of review and evaluation work ongoing in the Civil Service. Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, evaluations will be conducted at the level of each operational programme in addition to a mid-term evaluation of the plan as a whole in 2003. These evaluations will address questions of programme effectiveness and rel<Col N="1133" /> evance and will inform a mid term review of NDP priorities.</P>
    <P>Value for money studies undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General's office also made a valuable contribution to the analysis and review of various programmes, projects and expenditure areas.</P>

      <P>Authorised Revenue officers are empowered to make an application to a judge of the High Court seeking an order requiring financial institutions to supply names, addresses and other relevant information concerning account holders who may have held bogus non-resident deposit accounts. Such applications are made under section 908 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, as substituted by the Finance Act, 1999. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that information supplied by the financial institutions under section 908 orders is the principal basis of identifying bogus non-resident account holders who did not avail of Revenue's voluntary disclosure scheme in 2001.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that 15 applications for orders under section 908 have been made and have been granted. When one includes institutions which have been taken over or amalgamated with other institutions, these orders seek information in respect of accounts in 21 financial institutions. Three other applications are pending.</P>
      <P>Information under a number of the court orders has recently been supplied. This information is currently being processed to link the names and addresses provided to taxpayers. More such information will become available on a phased basis. In addition, work is in progress as regards those cases which were detected in the course of the DIRT look-back audits of financial institutions in 1999 and 2000 and did not avail of the voluntary disclosure scheme in 2001.</P>
      <P>While it is clear that Revenue is facing a long programme of investigations the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that significant progress is being made in this new phase of the investigations. The earlier voluntary disclosure phase resulted in receipts of &euro;227 million or £179 million for the Exchequer, in addition to the &euro;219 million or £173 million received under the earlier look back audits of financial institutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the principles underlying the strategic management initiative, my Department has been for some time pursuing an active policy of maximum delegation to Departments. In relation to large capital programmes therefore, responsibility for individual projects is generally delegated to the relevant Department.</P>
      <P>The role of my Department is to set out a clear framework in relation to the management of capital investment. In managing capital projects, Departments are required to comply with my Department's guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure proposals in the public sector.</P>
      <P>These guidelines set out four main stages of project appraisal and management:</P>
      <P>1.&nbsp;The appraisal stage aims to provide a basis for a decision on whether to approve a project in principle. This stage includes an assessment of uncertainty and risk.</P>
      <P>2.&nbsp;The planning stage involves the establishment of a project management structure, preparation of a design brief, detailed planning and design of the project and a review of costings.</P>
      <P>If changes are proposed to the project in the course of the planning stage the guidelines make it clear that the cost implications should be fully appraised and the approval of the sanctioning authority sought before proceeding.</P>
      <P>On receipt of a tender price and other relevant information, the case for proceeding with the proposal is again subject to review. Where it is proposed, following such reappraisal, to go ahead with a project at a price higher than that originally proposed, a decision will again be required by the sanctioning authority to proceed.</P>
      <P>3.&nbsp;The implementation stage begins once the final approval for the award of a contract has been secured.</P>
      <P>If adverse developments occur, including unforeseen costs increases, which call into question the desirability or viability of the project, the sponsoring agency should consider necessary measures to rectify the situation. Where despite these measures increased costs are likely to arise, the approval of the sanctioning authority for the extra expenditure has to be obtained before any commitment is made to accept cost increases. The viability of the project given the changed circumstances should also be reported on.</P>
      <P>4. Following the completion of a project, the final stage is post project review. Such a review is recommended to evaluate both the project outturn and the effectiveness of appraisal and management procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that the steps outlined in the guidelines provide sufficient guidance for the re-<Col N="1135" /> evaluation of projects at key points in the decision making process.</P>

      <P>A new scheme of performance-related awards for per<Col N="1136" /> sons in the civil service at the levels of assistant secretary and deputy secretary was introduced by the Government on the basis of the recommendations made in Report No. 38 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector dated 25 September 2000. The new scheme was introduced with effect from 1 January 2002 and the first payments under the scheme will arise in January 2003. In general there is an overall cost limit on awards of 10% of the paybill for those participating in the scheme. However, within this overall limit individuals may receive awards of up to 20% of salary.</P>
      <P>As recommended by the review body, a committee for performance awards, including persons from the private sector, has been established to monitor and adjudicate on the awards process. The committee will decide on the levels of awards for individuals based on recommendations from Secretaries General.</P>
      <P>Under the awards scheme, Secretaries General assign assistant secretaries and deputy secretaries specific and demanding targets for the year ahead which should go beyond the normal ongoing requirements of their jobs. Decisions on awards will be based on an assessment of performance against those targets and there will be differentiation in the awards applicable to different levels of performance. Detailed guidelines on the operation of the scheme have been prepared by the committee for performance awards and I have arranged that my Department will send a copy of these to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The 2002 Estimate for public capital spending by my Department is &euro;22,791,000. On current trends it is not envisaged that the overall estimate will be exceeded.</P>
      <P>However, the net expenditure under subhead B, consultancy services, is expected to exceed the capital estimate for that subhead. The figure for capital expenditure in the 2002 Revised Estimates Volume was &euro;250,000. It is now expected that the actual capital expenditure under this subhead will be &euro;480,649. This is an excess of &euro;230,649 over the original estimate.</P>
      <P>The provision under this subhead relates to the sale of State banks. Legal issues relating to the sale of ACC Bank have proved more complex than expected. In addition to this, extra costs have arisen in regard to the completion accounts of ACC Bank. These two issues have resulted in the expected overspend under this subhead. Nevertheless I do not expect my Department's overall capital expenditure to exceed the 2002 estimate.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in <Col N="1138" /> 1998 they obtained details of 430 cases with investments made under the Clerical Medical Insurance &ndash; NIB schemes. To date, 332 of these cases have been settled and 98 are still under investigation, seven of which are for possible prosecution through the courts.</P>
      <P>To date, Revenue has collected &euro;37.22 million in tax, interest and penalties in respect of these cases. This is made up of &euro;30.50 million in settled cases and &euro;6.72 million in respect of payments on account in cases still under investigation.</P>
      <P>As part of a further review of its records by the financial institution concerned, a supplementary list containing 22 new cases was received by Revenue in April 2001. Of these, 15 cases involve relatively small sums and are unlikely to involve substantial tax evasion. All the additional cases are being investigated as appropriate.</P>

      <P>The Central Bank, in its annual report for 2001, is forecasting real GNP growth of around 3% this year, with a return to trend growth of 4.5% to 5% envisaged over the medium term. The budget day figures were based on GNP growth of 3.5% this year, with the economy returning to around its medium-term trend growth rate from 2003 onwards.</P>
      <P>The bank believes a significant risk to the resumption of trend growth is the current evolution of Irish inflation, which, if sustained, could threaten the competitiveness of the economy, a scenario that would be exacerbated in the event of a significant euro appreciation. The competitiveness of the economy would also be threatened by unsustainable levels of wage and other cost increases, which would ultimately lead to job losses.</P>
      <P>In this regard I share the Central Bank's concern regarding competitiveness. It is imperative that wage increases, and the evolution of costs more generally, are brought down to those in our major trading partners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Employment regulation orders are concerned with the establishment of minimum rates of pay and conditions for workers in specific sectors of the economy. Each employment regulation order is managed by a joint labour committee that consists of representatives of the workers and employers functioning under the auspices of the Labour Court. For example, there is a joint labour committee for the contract cleaning sector and another for the security industry. At present, there are 15 employment regulation orders in place. There is no specific definition of &ldquo;time&rdquo; applying across all these orders.</P>
      <P>The arrangements to deal with overtime and work undertaken on public holidays, in a particular sector, are set out in each of the orders and are a matter for agreement by the joint labour committee responsible. In the context of these orders the term &ldquo;time&rdquo; is understood as referring to the minimum rate of hourly pay to which any specific category of employee, as defined in the relevant order, is entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally, the orders provide for an enhanced rate of pay for overtime by means of a multiple of the basic rate governed by bands of hours worked. So, for example, a worker might be entitled to &ldquo;time and a quarter&rdquo; for the first band of five hours of overtime and &ldquo;time and half&rdquo; for <Col N="1146" /> any subsequent hours worked. That would mean an entitlement to payment for the first five hours of overtime at the minimum hourly rate set out in the order but increased by 25%. Subsequent hours, in this example, would be paid at the minimum hourly rate again but increased by 50%.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that each employment regulation order is unique in that its terms can reflect an agreed position relative to the particular features in the specific employment sector concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for bringing this matter to my attention.</P>
      <P>The employment agency in question held an employment agency licence issued by my Department under the Employment Agency Act, 1971, until 31 March 2001. These licences are renewable on an annual basis. Despite reminders to renew the licence and an undertaking from the agency to submit a completed renewal application, the agency failed to renew the licence. In view of this, my Department formed the opinion that the agency had ceased trading and no longer required a licence in accordance with the provisions of the 1971 Act.</P>
      <P>There are no sanctions open under the insolvency payments scheme or the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Acts, 1984 to 1991 in regard to the non-payment of wages, holiday pay or overtime owed to employees when a company merely ceases to trade. To come within the provisions of the above mentioned Acts and scheme, under which it is possible for eligible employees to claim certain amounts of outstanding pay-related entitlements of the type mentioned &ndash; wages, overtime, holiday pay &ndash; the company would have to be in liquidation or receivership or be covered by any of the other proceedings which define insolvency for the purposes of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Acts, 1984 to 1991 and the scheme.</P>
      <P>One of the essential conditions of the insolvency payments scheme is the pre-existence of a statutory insolvency situation such as is defined in the definition of insolvency for the purposes of the 1984 Act. This definition covers situations such as liquidations, receiverships, bankruptcies etc. It should also be mentioned that any wage related entitlements would have to arise in the 18 month period prior to a company being formally declared insolvent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the company in question, my Department has no record of it having being formally declared insolvent in accordance with the above Acts and, therefore, at this stage the former employees would not qualify for payment under the insolvency payments scheme.  However, if at a future date, the employer is insolvent for the purposes of the Acts, the employees should complete the statutory form EIP1 which is available from the insolvency payments section of my Department in respect of any wages-holiday pay due to them and forward this form to the liquidator-receiver as appropriate. If the liquidator-receiver has insufficient funds to <Col N="1149" /> pay the outstanding entitlement he-she should apply to my Department for funds to pay the employees.</P>
    <P>With regard to minimum notice entitlements, before payment may be made under the insolvency payments scheme, the employees must first establish their entitlement by appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    <P>Full details of the information supplied may be obtained by contacting the employment rights information unit of my Department at (01) 631 3131 or on Lo-call 1890 220222 where staff will be happy to assist. A full range of information leaflets is also available on request or by logging into my Department's website at www.entemp.ie.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am advised that the issuing of cheques by the agency that have not been honoured may constitute fraud. The Deputy might wish to inform the parties involved that they may bring this matter to the attention of the gardaí for possible follow-up action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of job creation is a day-to-day operational issue for the industrial development agencies under the remit of my Department and one, in which I, as Minister, have no direct involvement.</P>
      <P>The main agencies under my Department's remit which deal with job creation are Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland. The county and city enterprise boards are also actively involved in supporting the creation of employment in micro enterprises, that is, enterprises employing ten people or less.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland is working closely with its 288 grant assisted client companies in south Dublin, including Tallaght, in helping them to increase their competitiveness and their exports by providing business planning finance, in the form of grants and equity, for the development of exports and human resources. Each company has access to the international market through Enterprise Ireland's network of 30 offices worldwide. Finance can also be provided for companies embarking on programmes of research and development to develop new products or services.</P>
      <P>As part of its strategy to support the development of new enterprises Enterprise Ireland works closely with the Institute of Technology in Tallaght, and has recently approved funding of &euro;2.54 million towards a new campus innovation centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland works closely with the South Dublin County Council in tackling unem<Col N="1150" /> ployment at local level, and in this context provided grant assistance towards the four community enterprise centres in Tallaght &ndash; viz. Main Road, Balbrook, Brookfields and Killinarden.</P>
    <P>The agency also works closely with the South Dublin Chamber of Commerce and is represented on the board and evaluation committee of the county enterprise board. In addition, Enterprise Ireland is represented on the county development board, who are finalising an integrated strategic plan for the county covering the period up to 2011.</P>
    <P>As regards IDA Ireland, south County Dublin continues to attract major projects to its two main towns of Tallaght and Clondalkin. In total, there are 30 IDA assisted companies in the Tallaght-Newcastle-Saggart area employing a total of 3,477 people.</P>
    <P>In Grange Castle, work continues on the massive Wyeth Medica project. The facility being built on a 90 acre site is costing US$1 billion and will employ 1,300 at full production. Recruitment is under way for staff to commence production in 2002. Upon completion, this will be the largest biotechnology production facility in the world. Grange Castle International Business Park is owned by South Dublin County Council and is being promoted internationally by IDA. The 400 acre park is being targeted as a location for other major biotechnology and pharmaceutical projects in line with IDA's commitment to make Ireland a world leader in biotechnology research and manufacturing.</P>
    <P>In City West the National Digital Park with its broadband capacity and its connectivity to 25 of the world's largest cities will prove a distinct advantage for companies worldwide to conduct their e-business. The continued success of City West and the development of the park through IDA Ireland, is another major boost to the economy of south County Dublin. The decision by German software giant, SAP, of its decision to locate its English speaking world technical support centre in City West was a significant development. The centre now employs 280 people.</P>
    <P>The major expansion plans announced by Xilinx together with MetroMedia's facility to distribute Microsoft product over the Internet are further evidence of south Dublin's position as a key location for new technology investment within the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The South Dublin County Enterprise Board is actively involved in supporting the creation of employment in micro enterprise in the Tallaght area. The board provides a range of training and management development and networking initiatives, together with selective financial assistance to those setting up or expanding small businesses. Since its inception the board has assisted 456 projects in the Tallaght area employing 1,045 people. It provides information and advice through its contacts with IT Tallaght and its involvement with local schools in the young entrepreneurs programme. The board will con<Col N="1151" /> tinue to work closely with community groups in supporting the creation of higher quality employment that can assist with the re-integration of socially disadvantaged groups into the workforce.</P>
    <P>The above examples clearly indicate the roles that Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the South Dublin County Enterprise Board are playing in strengthening the local economy of the Tallaght area and of south County Dublin. I can assure the Deputy that they will continue to promote the area for suitable investment projects in the future.</P>

      <P>The implementation and funding of the European Union's research and technology development policy is done through multi-annual framework programmes. The 6th Framework Programme, which will run from 2003-2006, will allocate over &euro;16 billion for research activities over a wide range of areas. These include genomics and biotechnology for health, including research to combat major diseases; information society technologies, nanotechnologies and nanosciences, food quality and safety, sustainable development, global change and ecosystems. A fundamental aim of the pro<Col N="1152" /> gramme is to enhance EU competitiveness over the next four to five years, and also to contribute to the establishment of a European Research Area, which would effectively compete with the significant research effort of the USA and Japan.</P>
      <P>The question of research in the area of human genomics is a sensitive one and I am fully aware of the concerns expressed in this regard. In the context of negotiations on the 6th Framework Programme, Ireland's position with regard to research on embryos was set out very clearly at the Research Council of Minister's meeting on 10 December last. At that Council, Ireland stated that all research activities under the new framework programme are to be carried out in compliance with fundamental ethical principles, particularly with regard to the protection of human dignity and human life, in genomics and biotechnology research. In this regard, Ireland quoted Article 40.3.3 of our Constitution and made clear that any research carried out in Ireland would have to comply with this provision.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, on 3 June last, Ireland, in supporting the adoption of the common position on the framework programme as amended by the European Parliament, joined with Austria, Italy, Germany and Portugal in a joint declaration for the Council minutes. This joint declaration emphasised the importance of an acceptable solution being found for the inclusion of bioethical guidelines for research under the 6th Framework Programme in areas of reproductive and therapeutic cloning, human germ line intervention and embryonic stem cell research. In this context, the signatories to the joint declaration agreed to work together to elaborate and include, as part of the decision on the specific programmes, more detailed guidelines regarding bioethical principles. The specific programmes will outline the actual research programmes to give effect to the framework programme.</P>
      <P>It is also worth noting that the joint declaration further pointed out that, in any event, any research activities arising from the programme will have to respect the legislation, regulations and ethical guidelines in countries where the research will be carried out.</P>

      <P>The person named held a suckler cow quota of 18 premium rights but did not use 90% of it in 2001 as is required under EU rules. He was written to in September 2001 seeking the reasons he had not used at least 90% of his quota. Following consideration of his reply, in which he said he would use the full quota in 2002, the quota of 18 premium rights was restored to him for 2002 on that basis, that is, that he would use at least 90% of the quota in 2002.</P>
      <P>Further to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 197 of 26 March 2002, the person named submitted further evidence, in April 2002, in support of his appeal to be allowed sell his quota. His case was reviewed having regard to the evidence and documentation supplied. My Department's view was that this evidence could not be regarded as constituting exceptional circumstances outside of his control, or circumstances which could not have been foreseen. As a result, it was not possible to rescind the original decision to refuse him permission to sell his quota and the person named was informed accordingly on 23 April 2002.</P>

      <P>My Department does not operate any specific schemes of financial assistance to animal welfare bodies. In recent years however, it has <Col N="1159" /> been possible to make <i>ex gratia</i> funding available to a number of animal welfare bodies from resources available towards the end of each year. Towards the end of 2001, grants totalling £512,500, &euro;650,741, were made to 52 organisations involved in the delivery of animal care and welfare services throughout the country to assist them in their work in the current year. The organisations concerned had approached the Department during 2001 seeking financial assistance. Such payments included a grant of £8,500, &euro;10,792, to the Cat Protection Society of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The payment of such grant aid is an end-of-year exercise and is in all cases dependent on there being available resources within my Department's Vote at the time in question. I cannot therefore commit in advance to providing assistance in any particular instance. I note all requests and at the appropriate time will consider any further request from the Cat Protection Society of Ireland in the light of available resources and having regard to any competing claims for grant assistance which will doubtless be submitted by other welfare bodies. Where resources are available I have consistently sought to spread grant assistance as widely as possible so as to achieve maximum benefit in care and welfare terms for the greatest possible number of animals throughout the country.</P>
      <P>A formal statutory framework for cat control is already provided for under the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, which is administered by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. That Act provides for the introduction of regulations in relation to cats, which would allow the local authority to take possession of unwanted cats. Section 33 of the Act would enable the Minister to make grants towards the expenses of a local authority or to any person concerned with the provision of homes or shelters for stray or unwanted cats or with the welfare of cats.</P>

      <P>As I indicated previously, the 2001 foot and mouth disease crisis, both here and in other EU member states, resulted in a clearer appreciation of the potential for frequent and unregulated animal movements to spread diseases.</P>
      <P>The critical importance of full traceability has also been highlighted, not just in the context of consumer protection, but to facilitate tracking of animal movements and contacts in the event that a disease outbreak occurs.</P>
      <P>I have said on a number of occasions that there are certain aspects of Irish agricultural life that may never be the same again. While certain activities and practices may have been regarded as traditional, it does not necessarily follow that they are consistent with current and prospective requirements in relation to animal health, disease prevention, traceability and other key concerns.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the campaign currently being run by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group, who are seeking a refund of all the VAT incurred by them. The current VAT treatment of charitable organisations is based on EU VAT law, with which Irish law must comply. Under the Sixth EU VAT Directive, a wide range of charitable and voluntary activities are exempt for VAT purposes. This means that the organisations involved do not charge VAT on their services but, as a necessary corollary, they are unable to recover the VAT they bear on the goods and services they purchase in the course of their activities. It is unlikely that the cost would be limited to the &euro;63 million claimed by that group. Given that there are no <Col N="1162" /> provisions for refund orders under EU law, as well as the cost involved, I have no plans to introduce any measures to allow charities to reclaim VAT.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied with the implementation of the national development plan. Good progress has been made in implementing the NDP infrastructure programme with financial outturns well on target and significant physical output being recorded. Progress is also satisfactory in the area of human resource development. Progress is behind profile in areas of productive sector investment due to lower than expected demand and in certain other areas where programme roll-out has been <Col N="1163" /> delayed by factors such as delays in schemes awaiting State aids approval from the EU and also the impact of foot and mouth disease.</P>
      <P>In relation to the key area of infrastructure, NDP investment is mostly provided for in the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme of the plan. Over the first three years of the plan, total investment under the ESIOP will amount to &euro;10.2 billion, some &euro;140 million more than originally planned. The gross Exchequer contribution will amount to some &euro;8.5 billion, which is &euro;740 million more than originally planned.</P>
      <P>I accept that construction industry inflation has been higher than anticipated since the launch of the NDP. Additional costs have also risen in some areas due to respecification of projects as they move from conception to planning, design and construction. Despite these factors, good progress has been made with financial outturns well on target and significant physical output being achieved.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the national development plan is fundamental to maintaining national competitiveness. The Government's commitment to the plan is evidenced by the fact that the Exchequer allocation for NDP infrastructure investment over the first three years of the plan was well in excess of the original projection. I can assure the Deputy that implementation of the plan will remain a top priority of Government policy.</P>

      <P>The arrangements for the composition and appointments to the boards of State bodies are normally set out in the legislation establishing the bodies in question. These arrangements are designed to ensure the efficient management of the individual bodies. Generally, appointments to the boards are made by the Minister with responsibility for the body in question, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>In making appointments, Ministers must take account of any specific legislative or policy requirements such as those contained in the Workers Participation (State Enterprises) Acts or the Government's policy in relation to gender balance on the boards of State bodies. Typically, Ministers seek to ensure that a selection of people are appointed who will bring a diverse range of relevant skills and experiences to the body. Where appropriate, Ministers may also place a value on having representation from the different strands of society such as the business community, consumers, trades unions or the other social partner groups.</P>
      <P>I am happy with the current arrangements and have no plans at present to introduce legislation to establish an independent appointments commission for the selection of members of State boards. The existing arrangements follow the routines and practices of previous Governments.</P>

      <Quest>the level of VAT chargeable on hotel and restaurant services here; the way in which this compares with other EU members states; and if he has the discretion to consider reducing the rate chargeable in order to provide a more level playing field in respect of tourism competition across the EU.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14554/02]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard rate of VAT applicable in Belgium, Germany, Denmark, United Kingdom, Finland, Sweden and Austria applies to restaurants. France and Italy apply both a standard and reduced rate depending on the type of restaurant services supplied and the remaining member states apply reduced rates between 3% and 12% to such services.</P>
      <P>As regards the VAT treatment of hotel services, the position is that the relevant standard rate applies to hotel services in Germany, Denmark and United Kingdom, while the remaining member states apply reduced rates between 3% and 12% to such services. Ireland applies its reduced rate of 12.5% to supplies of accommodation and restaurant services. While Ireland has a higher rate of VAT on restaurants and hotels than some member states, the rate is significantly lower than the one which applies in other member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under EU VAT rules member states may have two reduced rates of not less than 5% for a specified list of goods and services listed in annex H of the Sixth VAT Directive. In addition, member states may retain, at a reduced rate of not less than 12%, any goods or services not already in the reduced rate list in Annex H of the Sixth VAT Directive, provided a reduced rate applied to them before 1 January 1991. In the case of restaurants these were at a reduced rate of 10% before 1 January 1991 and it is not possible to reduce the rate of VAT applying to restaurants below 12%. As regards hotels, it would be possible under EU law to introduce a rate as low as 5% in respect of accommodation provided by hotels and similar establishments including pro<Col N="1167" /> vision of holiday accommodation and the letting of camping sites and caravan parks.</P>
    <P>Any such change would require the introduction of a second reduced rate of VAT. The introduction of a second reduced rate for hotel accommodation would increase pressure for the extension of such a rate initially to all tourist rented accommodation and ultimately to most of the categories in annex H of the Sixth VAT Directive. A reduction in the 12.5% rate of VAT applying to accommodation would cost in the order of &euro;19 million and if all activities which could benefit from a reduced rate were rated at 5% this could cost in the order of &euro;500 million per annum.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also appreciate that I get many requests for the introduction of lower or reduced rates on many goods and services. To accede to them all would mean a significant reduction in the VAT yield for the Exchequer and this would prevent the funding of necessary public services.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that VAT is not allowed as an input to registered businesses in respect of accommodation and restaurant costs; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that this is causing significant difficulty for the tourism industry in dealing with overseas businesses and conference organisers; and if he has discretion in amending the rules in this respect.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has long been national policy not to allow VAT registered businesses who operate inside or outside the State to reclaim VAT paid by them in hotels, restaurants, the lease or purchase of business cars and petrol and is the result of national VAT provisions. These restrictions also apply to overseas businesses and conference organisers.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Sixth VAT Directive allows us to maintain all our existing national restrictions on preventing recovery of input VAT. Under EU law all member states are prevented from extending deductibility to expenditure which is not business expenditure &ndash; such as luxuries, amusements or entertainments.</P>
      <P>The national restriction on deductibility for accommodation and restaurants is intended to maintain the VAT yield not just from accommodation and restaurant services, but also to prevent abuse of recovery of VAT by businesses. If deductibility was allowed it would be difficult to determine whether the expenditure was tied to the core activity of the business and was not just entertainment. This would open the possibility of fraudulent use of the deductibility provisions. The removal of the restriction on deductibility for hotel and restaurant accommodation could, over time, lead to pressure for the same treatment of business cars. This could have a significant consequence for Exchequer revenues from this source.</P>

      <Col N="1169" />While I will, as is normal, be considering VRT and all other taxes in the context of the forthcoming budget and Finance Bill, the Deputy will be aware that VRT is an important source of revenue for the Exchequer, especially given this Government's strategy of reducing other taxes such as income tax and corporation tax. If the suggestion is that the review should lead to a VRT reduction in rates and loss of revenue this would need to be borne in mind. Receipts from VRT in 2001 were in the region of &euro;790 million. To recover this amount of money in alternative taxes would require, for example, a 36% litre excise duty increase in the price of petrol or an increase in the standard rate of income tax of over two percentage points.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 185, 189 and 190 together.</P>
      <P>Supplementary Estimates are departmental estimations of additional moneys required towards the end of the year to meet both known and anticipated pressures on spending.</P>
      <P>I have approved one request for a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism &ndash; the motion in respect of that is before this House today &ndash; and I have not as yet received any other requests for Supplementary Estimates from any other Departments. I expect to receive requests from all Departments for Supplementary Estimates relating to the, as yet, unallocated funding provision for benchmarking. Furthermore, as is normal each year, I expect that I will receive a number of requests for technical Supplementary Estimates, that is, those that involve no additional funds overall but which relate to the transfer of funds between votes, the provision of additional moneys to grant-in-aid subheads, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall position on voted expenditure is being monitored on an ongoing basis. The year-on-year spending increase shown at end-May &ndash; 27% &ndash; exceeded the annual increase provided in the Estimates &ndash; 14%. However, this does not of itself indicate an end-year excess on spending, and it should be noted that year-on-year percent<Col N="1170" /> age increases during the early part of the year are affected by a variety of factors such as the timing of payments this year, the level of spending in the corresponding period last year and the absolute size of the figures being compared.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these timing issues, there are pressures on expenditure in some areas such as demand led schemes in the health area, capital expenditure on national roads and prison officer overtime, for which additional funding will be provided. Departments have been required by Government to take appropriate measures to ensure that expenditures are controlled over the remainder of the year and to make appropriate adjustments to ensure that the final overall outturn for expenditure will come in line with the original plan for the year as whole. This is a normal procedure following a mid-year review of trends to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to any recommendations arising from the review by an interdepartmental group, which is chaired by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, of the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' scheme. Officials from the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, and my own Department are also represented on the group. The group is examining all aspects of the scheme. The Deputy will appreciate that the work of this review group is very complex. As part of its deliberations, the group has heard oral submissions over a period of five and a half days and has received over 260 written submissions from interested parties. I have not yet received the report of the group but I understand that it will be finalised in the near future.</P>
      <P>I have been informed there are up to 360,000 persons in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree or other. These include both persons with medical conditions other than those which are covered by the scheme, and those with medical conditions covered by the scheme. The substantial tax benefits of the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' scheme make for considerable interest in and desire to be admitted to the scheme. At present there are approximately 7,500 beneficiaries under the scheme. Beneficiaries, once qualified, are eligible for life.</P>
      <P>The cost of reliefs, excluding the annual road tax costs, in 2001 was approximately &euro;30.5 million, as compared to &euro;5.1 million in 1994. The cost of the scheme in 2002, again excluding annual road tax costs, is estimated to be in the region of &euro;38 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" />Many factors have to be taken into account by the review group and many interests balanced. As I have said in the past, I appreciate the difficulties which people who suffer from some form of physical disability face in coping with everyday life. Any proposals, whether to widen the scope of the scheme or otherwise, which may emanate from the review group will receive full consideration. It would be inappropriate of me to make any further comments pending such consideration.</P>

      <P>In terms of EU comparisons, the appropriate measure of inflation is the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP. On this basis, the Irish inflation rate averaged 5.0% in the first five months of 2002. This compares to an average of 2.2% in the EU and 2.4% in the euro area in the first five months.</P>
      <P>Inflation is higher in Ireland than in the rest of the EU partly as a result of domestic cost pressures. It is important that these cost pressures are not allowed to lead to deteriorating competitiveness which would result in higher unemployment.

      <P>The Spring 2002 Quarterly Economic Commentary was issued by the ESRI in April and a summary of its findings are: the Irish economy grew by 6.8% in real terms in 2001 and real GDP growth of 3.6% is forecast for 2002; the recovery in economic growth will give rise to improved employment prospects and unemployment is expected to average 4.6% for 2002; despite improved growth conditions and given the expenditure commitments and revenue projections, the public finances would deteriorate this year; and the most potent threat to Irish economic prospects is the strength of price inflation.</P>
      <P>With regard to public spending, the ESRI also noted that there are expectations and pressures for additional spending but that growth in spending must be matched by revenue growth in order to avoid any breach of the EU Stability and Growth Pact.</P>

      <P>At budget time, the forecast for the 2002 Exchequer balance was for a surplus of &euro;170 million. This is still the target although it may be achieved by a lower revenue performance than forecast offset by savings and other receipts not available at budget time, including lower than expected EU budget contribution and the proceeds of the sale of ACC Bank.</P>
      <P>The most recent figures for Exchequer receipts and expenditure were those for the period to 31 May 2002 published on the Department's website on 5 June, which show a surplus of &euro;56 million for the period to end-May.</P>
      <P>While the performance of individual tax and non-tax subheads will vary, receipts should improve in particular as the full impact of the budget revenue-raising measures is felt. Similarly, there are different levels of spending to date this year by different Departments. Notwithstanding these timing issues, there are pressures on expenditure in some areas such as demand led schemes in the health area, capital expenditure on national roads and prison officer overtime, for which additional funding will be provided. Departments have been required by Government to take appropriate measures to ensure that expenditures are controlled over the remainder of the year and to make appropriate adjustments to ensure that the final overall outturn for expenditure will come in line with the original plan for the year as a whole. This is a normal procedure following a mid-year review of trends to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Unhappily, sectarian attacks have become an all too often occurrence in Northern Ireland. The Deputy will be aware, for example, of the spate of sectarian attacks recently against nationalists in Larne and some other small towns and villages. Public order has been particularly bad in north Belfast over the past year. Intensive efforts are continuing to resolve the problem in north Belfast and to generate the local dialogue that ultimately must serve as the foundation for trust and improved community relations. We cannot be complacent about the issue of sectarian tensions and the violence that it engenders. On the weekend of 11-12 May, disturbances broke out in the nationalist enclave of Short Strand in east <Col N="1175" /> Belfast. They have continued since then with varying intensity, but with the sense of siege continuing unabated. On 18 June, the Taoiseach, speaking in the Dáil, acknowledged the serious concerns of the people of the Short Strand &ldquo;who have seen their community dwindle considerably because of the difficulties over years, [and who] feel that they are under huge threat&rdquo;. The Taoiseach raised his concerns about this and other situations of sectarian violence directly with the British Prime Minister at a meeting on Friday 14 June.</P>
      <P>I have already met political representatives of the area. In addition, during a meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 14 June, I stressed the need for effective and impartial policing and increased security measures to protect the residents of the Short Strand. I have made it clear on many occasions that these concerns about policing and security measures apply equally to nationalist communities in north Belfast, Larne, Ballycastle, Carrickfergus and elsewhere across the North which have suffered at the hands of loyalist paramilitary violence. Since the most recent outbreak of serious trouble occurred in the Short Strand in mid-May, officials of my Department and the Government's representatives based at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in Belfast have been in regular contact with local elected and community representatives. They have also visited the area a number of times to assess the situation at first hand. A delegation of residents recently met officials of my Department and the Department of the Taoiseach to outline their concerns. The residents' concerns have been raised with the British authorities on a number of occasions, including through the framework of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. As the marching season unfolds, officials of my Department will continue to maintain close contact with local political and community representatives and will liaise on an ongoing basis with the British Government to ensure the safety of the people of the Short Strand, North Belfast and other vulnerable nationalist communities across Northern Ireland. I know the Deputy will join me in condemning sectarian attacks from whatever quarter.</P>

      <P>A new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was introduced with effect from 2001, with a provision of &euro;1.2697 million, £1 million The fund provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families.

    <P>Area Development Management (ADM) Ltd, under whose aegis the partnerships operate, accepted my Department's request that it would administer the fund for the 2001-02 academic year.

Northside Partnership received a direct allocation from my Department of &euro;101,579 for the 2001-02 academic year. My Department had an agreement with the partnership to provide funding in 1999, 2000 and 2001. With regard to the 2002-03 academic year, Northside Partnership may apply for funding directly from the millennium partnership fund. The partnerships and <Col N="1177" /> community groups will be invited to submit applications for funding from the 2002 fund and decisions on allocations will be finalised in due course. My Department is considering a report from ADM on the operation of the fund during 2001-02.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the EPT scheme, EPTs who are fully qualified and have given satisfactory service are re-employed on a contract basis from year to year where the same teaching hours are required.

They are entitled to incremental and pension credit for their qualified EPT service, together with recognition of this service for promotion purposes.</P>

      <P>The national educational psychological service agency, NEPS, regards the provision of psychological support for children with special educational needs as a high priority. The agency, therefore, established a task force on special education, which has now made recommendations to NEPS management. In regard to special schools, it recommends that a preliminary survey of needs should be conducted in collaboration with the schools, as it is agreed that special schools may have needs additional to those of mainstream schools.</P>
      <P>NEPS allocated time to St. Joseph's special school for the first time in the school year 2001-02. Two psychologists shared the assignment as part of their overall allocation of schools. Their role included the survey of needs with the school. When available, the outcomes of this process will assist in identifying the most appropriate level and form of support to be offered to the school in the future.</P>
      <P>In addition, this school, together with another special school, has held a series of meetings in recent months with representatives of support services from both the health and education sectors. The aim of these meetings has been to identify the level and type of resources that the schools regard as necessary. It is expected that a submission will be made when this process is completed and that this, too, will assist in allocation of appropriate resourcing.</P>
      <P>As with other schools in the region, enhanced allocation of psychologists' time will be made available as recruitment to NEPS continues. It is anticipated that a number of additional psychologists will be assigned to the region before the end of the current year.</P>

      <P>In relation to the first school referred to by the Deputy, the staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. The enrolment at the first school was 80 pupils on 30 September 2002. This enrolment entitles the school to a staffing of a principal and two mainstream class teachers for the 2002-2003 school year. The enrolment figure for the appointment of a third teacher is 82 pupils. Unfortunately, in this instance a third mainstream teacher cannot be sanctioned.</P>
      <P>The school in question currently shares a learning support teacher post with three other schools. I understand that the total enrolment of the schools in question is 307 pupils. Generally, the incidence of learning support need would be in the region of 10% of pupils. I am continuing to keep the learning support provision under review. The needs of the schools in question will be taken fully into account in the event of additional learning support teacher posts becoming available for distribution.</P>
      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy in relation to the establishment of a special class for children with autism disorder is the subject of detailed discussions between officials of my Department and representatives of the school in question. I am hopeful that these discussions will lead to a positive outcome so that appropriate support services can be put in place for the children in question as speedily as possible.</P>
      <P>In relation to the second school referred to by the Deputy, architectural planning for a building project is at an early stage. Decisions on projects proceeding to tender and construction are taken in the light of the annual allocation for primary school buildings, the financial commitments to be met and the priority to be afforded to individual projects.</P>
      <P>An extensive building programme for 2002 has already been approved and published. It is not envisaged that the proposed building project referred to by the Deputy will proceed to construction in 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Later this year, when a financial allocation has been made for the primary school building pro<Col N="1188" /> gramme in the 2003 Estimates, I will be framing a further comprehensive programme of works that will proceed to construction and the second school concerned will be one of those considered for inclusion in that programme.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to bring greater transparency to the operation of the school building programme and I intend to publish the programme annually. I am also anxious to build a multi-annual dimension into the published programme so that schools will have an indication of the expected timelines relating to their project.</P>
    <P>In relation to the third school referred to by the Deputy, an application for major refurbishment and extension at the school has been received and is currently under consideration in the planning and building unit of my Department. As part of the consideration process, a decision on the school's long-term accommodation requirements will be made and notified to the school's board of management as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The planning and building unit of my Department is monitoring primary school pro<Col N="1191" /> vision in the Lucan area on an ongoing basis and, in particular, the demand for school places emanating from the new housing developments in the Griffeen area.</P>
      <P>My Department is at an advanced stage in processing an application from the patron body Educate Together for a new primary school in Griffeen. Provided some outstanding matters regarding interim accommodation arrangements can be resolved, I should be in a position to grant recognition to this school from September next. Assuming the school develops as envisaged by the promoters, it will add to overall capacity in the area.</P>
      <P>My officials will continue to monitor the situation in Lucan to ensure that all pupils seeking places in a primary school can be provided for.</P>
      <P>With regard to the child referred to by the Deputy, the position is that the compulsory school starting age in a national school is six years of age and rule 64(1) of the rules for national schools provides that a child must be at least four years of age before she/he may be enrolled in a national school. Children of compulsory school-going age must have a place in a national school and overall there are more than enough places available.</P>
      <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.</P>
      <P>My Department will carry out an investigation where it is claimed that a board is operating its enrolment policy in a manner which discriminates against a particular child. On the basis of the details supplied by the Deputy, this does not appear to be the case in this instance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 237 and 254 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's officials held discussions with the representatives of the managerial authorities in the second level sector. This was done to ensure that schools would remain open when the ASTI directive to its members to withdraw from voluntary supervision and substitution duties took effect on 4 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following detailed discussions with officials of my Department contingency arrangements were drawn up by the representative management groups, the Joint Managerial Body, the Irish Vocational Education Association and the <Col N="1195" /> Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools. As part of the arrangements my Department undertook to resource schools in order that they could employ staff to provide supervision and thereby remain open.</P>
    <P>Payments amounting to &euro;17.8 million have issued under the plan. The plan acknowledged that supplementary allocations may need to be made to some schools at a later date if their approved outgoings were greater than the amount of the grant. Accordingly, final costs are not yet available.</P>
    <P>The contingency plan, by its nature, is flexible and does not specify a pupil-supervisor ratio. The plan recognised that the number of supervisors required would vary from school to school depending on local circumstances including layout, both internal and external. Individual school management authorities are best placed to assess the level of cover and the number of persons required on an ongoing basis. Responsibility for making appointments is a matter for school authorities. Information concerning the number of supervisors recruited by schools is not available to my Department.</P>
    <P>The management authorities informed my Department that some 500 schools have implemented the plan.</P>
    <P>Recently agreement was reached with the Teachers' Union of Ireland and the Irish National Teachers Organisation that the pensionability of the substitution and supervision payment is acceptable in principle, subject to compliance with the requirements of the existing superannuation scheme. Discussions will take place between my Department and the unions concerned during the summer months in order to resolve the pension issues before the commencement of the next school year.</P>
    <P>No additional legislative instruments were required to give effect to my Department's funding of the contingency arrangements. Funding was provided in line with normal administrative arrangements and in compliance with public financial procedures.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my predecessor approved the patron's request for the appointment of a single manager prior to the beginning of the 2000-01 school year.</P>
      <P>The role of a single manager is analogous to that of a board of management in that that person is responsible for the direct governance of the school. The difficulties referred to by the Deputy are essentially issues that need to be resolved at local level. My officials have maintained close contact with the single manager since his appointment with a view to providing assistance to him, wherever possible, in carrying out his duties.</P>
      <P>In view of the efforts that are ongoing at local level to attempt to resolve this matter, I do not consider that any public comment from me at this stage in relation to this issue would be appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy's question refers to the aural examinations which are held together with the written examinations in June.</P>
      <P>Some 10,000 aural examination sessions take place in examination centres countrywide as part of the junior and leaving certificate examinations in Irish, French, German, Spanish and Italian. While we would clearly like to have a situation where each of the 10,000 sessions were executed successfully, it is a reality of this type of examination, coupled with the risk of human error, that problems occur in a small number of cases each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department must be in a position to ensure that, as a cardinal principle of the examination system, no candidate is disadvantaged because of some occurrence outside his or her control. To that end, my Department notifies schools each year before the exams start about the process that applies should a problem occur during an aural session. This involves the examination superintendent completing a comprehensive report on any occurrence that may have impacted on a candidate or candidates during a test. This process of reporting also provides for input from the school authorities if they so wish. All of this is designed to ensure that the chief examiner for the subject has available to him-her a full report of the circumstances surrounding the test that he-she can consider in the context of the work produced by the candidates. In this way the chief examiner is <Col N="1199" /> better placed to assess how the conduct of the test may have impacted on a candidate's performance. The chief examiner has power to apply any adjustments to the marks awarded that he-she considers appropriate, based on the core principle that the candidate should not be disadvantaged in terms of the final grade awarded.</P>
    <P>My Department's examination branch reviews all aspects of the examination process on an ongoing basis. All of the arrangements in relation to the running of the aural examinations, including the appropriate sound reproduction technology to be used, continue to be evaluated and reviewed as part of this process.</P>

      <P>I am aware of concerns that have been raised in relation to the 2002 leaving certificate biology higher level paper.</P>
      <P>Our examination system is acknowledged to be one of the most open, transparent and pro-candidate national examination systems in the world. Mechanisms are in place to take on board genuine concerns which interested parties, including schools and students, might have in relation to the examinations. Over and above any individual observations submitted, as a matter of course, each year subject associations and the teacher unions regularly provide observations on question paper content to the Department in advance of each marking conference. All observations received in relation to a subject are made available to the chief examiner for consideration in the context of preparing the marking scheme for that subject. The marking scheme is finalised at the marking conference by the chief examiner and the team of examiners who are drawn from the teachers of the subject. In the case of biology, experienced teachers acting as examiners will be able to input their considered views into the framing of the marking scheme.</P>
      <P>As it has been the practice for a number of years to publish the detailed marking schemes ultimately used in the marking process, all interested parties will be able to satisfy themselves in relation to the marking process that applies in the case of biology this year. Any candidate who chooses to view his-her marked scripts will have access to the marking scheme. They will be able to see at first hand how the marking scheme was applied in their case.</P>

      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the Government is providing some &euro;700 million to support research, technological development and innovation in the third level sector. The aim is to support the development of a world class research environment in higher education in Ireland through areas designed to help to improve the research skills and capacity of third level institutions, raise the quality of teaching and learning activities in the institutions, increase the availability of highly skilled researchers in the labour force and to provide greater scope for collaboration between education and other sectors of the economy in respect of research.</P>
      <P>This investment builds on the first dedicated block of funding of &euro;6.35 million which was introduced in 1998, of which &euro;5.1 million was for the support of institutional strategic research. The programme for research in third level institutions is the main element of the RTDI and education measure provided for in the NDP. The programme's objective is to strengthen the long-term capacity of third level institutions for high quality research. The defining characteristic of PRTLI is support for institutions with strategically focused and managed research programmes. The emphasis of the PRTLI is on assisting the third level institutions &ndash; both individually and collectively &ndash; to enhance and develop their research capabilities. Proposals must satisfy demanding criteria in regard to research quality, support for learning and teaching at the institution and the contribution to realising the goals and objectives of the institution's long-term research strategy. Awards under the programme follow rigorous competitive processes involving the application of international standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Athlone Institute of Technology is the only third level institution in the midland region comprising counties Longford, Westmeath, Offaly and Laois. This institute was successful in the initial programme in 1998 and the subsequent first cycle of the PRTLI. It was awarded &euro;2.86 million of the &euro;211 million available. These <Col N="1203" /> awards have facilitated the development of its centre for biopolymer and biomolecular research.</P>
    <P>Funding is also provided specifically to the institutes of technology under the technological sector research strand of the RTDI programme. Of the &euro;14 million allocated in the period 1999-2001 Athlone Institute of Technology received &euro;888,334. The funding provides for training in research and development skills for graduates, training programmes for graduate entrepreneurs and support to develop research capacity in institutes of technology.</P>
    <P>The funding awarded to institutions under these programmes is determined on a competitive basis involving rigorous examination by independent assessment panels to ensure the highest quality projects are assisted.  </P>

      <P>A working group for the implementation of this action of the National Drug Strategy 2001-2008 has been established and is chaired by an official from my Department. The group comprises members of the statutory and voluntary sectors. Its work includes a literature review of best practice which is being carried out by the Addiction Research Centre. It is also considering legal issues in the area of provision of treatment to under 18 year olds. The group's work is nearing completion and it is expected that it will report in the autumn.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 268 and 305 together.</P>
      <P>Difficulties have arisen in inter-country adoption due to increased demand combined with problems in recruiting social workers. Efforts are being made to deal with the current shortage of social workers by recruiting internationally and by increasing the number of training places nationally. Approximately 30 additional social work training places have been created since October 2001 and it is planned to increase the number of places by in excess of 85 to be phased in from 2002.</P>
      <P>Over the last four years a range of actions have been taken to assist the health boards improve the service, including allocation of &euro;2,101,000 additional funding for the service nationally over the last four years, &euro;830,000 of which was allocated to the Eastern Regional Health Authority area.</P>
      <P>During 1999 a standardised framework for inter-country adoption assessment was introduced to streamline assessments and to provide a transparent system centred on the child's best interests and respectful to all the parties involved. The framework which is being used in all health boards has been welcomed by the boards and couples.  </P>
      <P>Significant reductions in waiting times have been achieved throughout the country, and all health boards are committed to continuing improvements. Table 1 shows the projected waiting times for first assessment, that is, time from receipt of completed application to the expected beginning of preparation stage for applicants who applied at 31 March 2002 compared to the projected waiting time at 30 June 2000.</P>

      <P>The provision of a lung transplant unit at the Mater Hospital forms part of a major capital development approved for the hospital and considerable preparatory work has already been completed in relation to the commencement of this service. The draft report of the expert consultative group established to advise my Department on the many issues associated with the development of this complex programme, was the subject recently of a very positive discussion involving the Department, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Mater Hospital. Following that meeting I understand that the <Col N="1209" /> hospital has finalised an assessment of the resource requirements associated with the introduction of the programme. This submission is being considered as a priority by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and I look forward to receiving the views of the ERHA in this regard at an early date.</P>
      <P>In terms of the time scale for the introduction of the programme I am advised that the hospital proposes to commence lung transplantation towards the end of the current year. In this regard, a number of key clinical appointments have already been made at the Mater Hospital, including the appointment of a consultant surgeon and a consultant physician.</P>
      <P>Pending the establishment of lung transplantation in this country, an agreement is in place with the Freeman Hospital in the UK for the treatment of Irish patients. To date 19 patients from this country have received a transplant at the Freeman Hospital under the agreement. This contract will continue while the necessary arrangements are being progressed in terms of establishing the programme in Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is also important to note that lungs donated in Ireland have been retrieved by the medical team at Newcastle and have helped to facilitate this additional transplant work at Newcastle for the benefit of Irish patients. Finally, I wish to assure the Deputy that the establishment of the Irish programme will continue to be progressed as a priority by my Department in conjunction with the ERHA and the Mater Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first national goal of the National Children's Strategy is &ldquo;Children will have a voice in matters which affect them and their views will be given due weight in accordance with their age and maturity&rdquo;. Key measures under this goal include the establishment of a national Dáil na nÓg and local Comhairle na nÓg, where children can raise and debate issues of concern to them.</P>
      <P>The first Dáil na nÓg was held on 5 September 2001 in the Mansion House, Dublin. More than 240 children between the ages of eight years and 17 years, representative of every county and socio-economic group attended. The Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, attended Dáil na nÓg to observe this historic inaugural session, and to listen to participants speaking about the issues relevant to their lives. It is proposed to hold the second Dáil na nÓg in October 2002. Some 200 children will be invited to attend from every county in Ireland and drawn from a range of socio-economic groups.</P>
      <P>The city and county development boards have a lead role in the co-ordination of the implementation of the National Children's Strategy at a local level. This includes ensuring that children are given a voice at a local level through appropriate structures, which can include Comhairle na nÓg. The national children's office, which is responsible for the co-ordination of the implementation of the National Children's Strategy at a national level, is encouraging the city and county development boards to hold Comhairle na nÓg and is offering any assistance or advice required.</P>
      <P>The Comhairle na nÓg has two purposes: to give children a voice in their local community in line with the first goal of the National Children's Strategy and to select local delegates for the next Dáil na nÓg. Total funding of &euro;100,000 is available for the Comhairle na nÓg in 2002. A grant of &euro;2,500 will be awarded from this budget to each city or county development board which holds a Comhairle na nÓg in 2002. The first Comhairle na nÓg which was held in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and acted as a model for the other Comhairle na nÓg was fully funded from this budget.</P>
      <P>Some 20 of the city or county development boards have already held a Comhairle na nÓg in 2002 and most of the other city or county development boards are in the process of organising one. Many of the city or county development boards are also examining the most appropriate structures which should be put in place within their area to ensure that children are given a voice on an ongoing basis. The Minister with responsibility for children and the national children's office will continue to work with the city and county development boards to ensure that Comhairle na nÓg or other acceptable structures are set up in every city and county development board area. Additional funding is being sought by the national children's office to fund the Comhairle na nÓg in 2003 and future years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 293 and 315 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, BreastCheck, the National Breast Screening Programme, commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North Eastern Health Board. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. It is <Col N="1215" /> expected that phase one of the programme will be completed by December 2002.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the programme is driven by international quality assurance and best practice and the experience gained in phase one will facilitate the process of planning and organising the roll-out of the programme nationwide. All of the health boards located outside the phase one area are represented on the board of BreastCheck by their respective chief executive officers.  </P>
    <P>Up to February 2002, the most recent validated figures from BreastCheck show that 70,435 women have been invited for screening and 49,016 women have been screened. This represents an uptake of 73%. BreastCheck has informed my Department that the percentage of women screened who have been diagnosed with cancer in the programme to February 2002 is at an average rate of 0.9% or nine per 1,000. The actual number of cancers detected is 441.</P>
    <P>My Department has been in ongoing consultation with BreastCheck concerning expansion of the programme. My Department will continue to support BreastCheck in moving to nationwide coverage as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Adoption Board entered into a working arrangement with Belarus in 1999 to facilitate the adoption of children from Belarus to Ireland. This arrangement has recently been suspended by the Belarussian authorities until a co-ordinator has been appointed to assist Irish couples in adopting a child in Belarus.</P>
      <P>The National Adoption Centre in Belarus is considering the appointment of a co-ordinator and is due to decide on this by the end of June. I understand that the board is drawing up a new information pack for prospective adoptive parents who wish to apply to adopt in Belarus.</P>
      <P>The Adoption Board is maintaining close contact with the Belarussian Authorities to try to ensure that any changes in Belarussian requirements are notified to interested couples as early as possible.</P>

      <P>The evolving role of my Department and of the health promotion unit is reflected in the National Health Strategy and the National Health Promotion Strategy. These state that if the Department is to address the key areas which it has outlined as being of strategic importance, it is crucial for it to strike the appropriate balance between its day-to-day operational work and the work required to plan, develop, monitor and review the services and the environment in which they are delivered. Thus, the executive function of the health promotion unit of my Department is being devolved to the health boards allowing its policy function to be strengthened. The health boards now have a statutory obligation to develop health promotion programmes bearing in mind the needs within each area and the objectives of the Department in relation to health promotion generally.</P>
      <P>To meet the objectives of La Leche League of Ireland and to continue the promotion of breastfeeding throughout Ireland it is essential that there are effective linkages between all stakeholders. La Leche League has applied for and received funding on an <i>ad hoc </i>annual basis from the health promotion unit over the past decade. However, while the unit provides some funding to voluntary groups, it is not in a position to provide core funding to such groups. Consequently, my Department has recommended that La Leche League makes contact with the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority with regard to its baseline-core funding needs in order to ensure the proper co-ordination and development of services at regional level. These linkages will allow for a greater degree of integration and continuity of services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of a nuclear emergency resulting in the release of radioactive iodine into the environment stable iodine is an internationally recognised and highly effective counter measure to prevent the uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid gland.</P>
      <P>Stable iodine tablets are currently being distributed to households nationwide as part of the National Emergency Plan for Nuclear Accidents. Each household will receive a packet containing six potassium iodate tablets BP 85mg, which is sufficient to provide a single dose for each member of an average sized household. The tablets are aluminium foil blister packed and sealed in a carton containing an information and instruction leaflet. Each carton will be delivered by An Post in a sealed firm envelope, which is labelled with appropriate warning statements and the name and address of the intended recipient.</P>
      <P>With regard to alternative therapies, I am advised there is no substitute to the use of stable iodine as a prophylactic agent for this purpose. However, the two principal counter measures of sheltering and avoiding the consumption of contaminated foodstuffs would provide significant protection against exposure to all forms of radioactive fall out. It is important to remember that while these other counter measures protect against most sources of radiation and external exposure, iodine prophylaxis protects only against inhaled or ingested radioiodine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Available evidence indicates that adverse effects associated with stable iodine are uncommon and generally minor. These may include <Col N="1221" /> dermatologic and sensitivity reactions. However, when potassium iodate is consumed as a prophylactic agent such adverse effects are unlikely because of its low dose and single use. Obviously in the circumstances of a nuclear emergency the benefits would far outweigh the risks involved.</P>
    <P>In very rare instances there may be an allergic response to iodine including fever and joint pain, facial swelling and breathlessness, which may require medical attention. Sufficient medications are currently available on the market for intervention in such cases. Patients with existing thyroid disease should seek medical advice as should those with vasculitis related to deficiency of immune complement or those with dermatitis herpeiformis. Any person who suffers with any of these conditions will already be aware of their condition through their doctor.</P>

The council has been advised that the difficulties now being experienced have arisen only since the road works were undertaken. The board has indicated that Kilkenny County Council has confirmed to it that the parking bays provided by it outside the health centre are fully compliant with all current national design standards and are in line with parallel parking bays throughout the country. The county council has also confirmed that while the road has been narrowed, this was done to provide footpaths-cycle ways and to reduce the speed of traffic, which according to Kilkenny County Council has been achieved and should result in improved overall safety.</P>

      <P>Arising from concerns about the use of symphysiotomy in obstetrical practice in the past, the chief medical officer at my Department asked the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists for its comments and advice on the matter.</P>
      <P>The institute represents obstetrical and gynaecological opinion in Ireland, acts as an advisory body on matters relating to education, research and administration in the specialty and seeks to raise standards in obstetrics and gynaecology in this country.</P>
      <P>The institute has replied to the CMO and confirms that from around 1920 until around 1960 symphysiotomy procedures were carried out on selected patients, mainly in the National Maternity Hospital and the Coombe Hospital. Excellent results were claimed for this procedure which had the effect of permanently enlarging the pelvis and allowing women to undergo normal delivery. This was at a time when caesarean section had a high mortality rate due to sepsis. Sepsis was one of the leading causes of maternal death at that time. The institute states that in properly conducted cases, complications were rare. Published medical reports of the time indicate favourable results for the procedure. Many of the cases referred to in these reports were emergency admissions with obstructed labour where sepsis following caesarean section would have carried a significant risk of maternal death.</P>
      <P>The institute states that from 1950 onwards, the operation of symphysiotomy for obstructed labour was replaced by the modern caesarean section. Antibiotics were available by then to treat infection and sepsis was less of a hazard.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate that we must be cautious about judging procedures and interventions which were used in previous generations in the light of current knowledge and experience. Enormous medical advances have been made since the 1950s and 1960s and medical care and procedures were not as advanced then as they are in Ireland today.</P>
      <P>I am arranging for a copy of the report to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal is the statutory body whose main function is to regulate appointments of consultant medical staff in hospitals providing services under the Health Acts, and to specify qualifications for such appointments. It also advises on matters relating to the organisation and operation of hospital services and publishes reports relating to such services. Arising from a number of meetings with various interest groups, I requested Comhairle na nOspidéal to conduct a review of neurological services and related issues. Comhairle established a committee to examine the existing arrangements for the provision of consultant level neurology and neurophysiology services nationally and, following consultation with the interests concerned, to make recommendations to Comhairle na nOspidéal on the future organisation and development of neurology and neurophysiology services. The review will focus on updating the 1991 comhairle report taking into account recent advances in and increasing demand for neurological and neurophysiological services.</P>
      <P>The comhairle review is still under way and the consultation stage is almost complete. It is expected that its report should be complete in the near future. The need for additional investment in neurology and neurophysiology will be considered in the light of the review by comhairle, other competing priorities, and the availability of adequate funding.</P>
      <P>My Department is informed by Comhairle na nOspidéal that there are currently 12 consultant neurologists in place nationally. The most recent of these appointments was made to University College Hospital, Galway, on 17 June 2002. There is also a further post approved by Comhairle for the eastern region which is currently at recruitment stage.</P>

      <Col N="1227" />With regard to use of sunbeds, the advice from my Department is that sunbeds should be used in moderation and that people should seek the advice of their doctor before doing so for the first time. In certain circumstances exposure to sunbeds may constitute a hazard. Sunbeds should not be used by persons under 18 years of age, persons who burn easily or tan poorly, those taking drugs or cosmetics thought to be photoactive, those suffering from skin disorders induced or aggravated by exposure to sunlight, those with a history of skin cancer, and those with risk factors for cutaneous melanoma. A consumer information sheet on possible risks from tanning equipment and the appropriate precautions is available from the Irish Cancer Society.</P>
    <P>Sunbeds are widely used in beauty salons by beauty therapists who offer cosmetic tanning as part of their services. Guidelines on the use of sunbeds by beauty therapists in beauty salons were drawn up by the Society of Applied Cosmetology which represents beauty therapists. These guidelines incorporate advice from the Irish Cancer Society on appropriate precautions to be taken by sunbed operators to protect the health of clients. The health promotion unit in my Department supports a range of initiatives organised by the Irish Cancer Society which impact on awareness of the risk factors associated with many cancers, including melanomas. The Sunsmart campaign is organised each year by the society to increase awareness of risk factors for skin cancer and to encourage people who are high risk to avoid excessive exposure to the sun and to avoid the use of sunbeds.</P>

      <P>The framework for the national car test, NCT, involves its operation on a public private partnership and self-financing basis. The contract for the <Col N="1228" /> NCT was awarded on foot of EU competitive tendering procedures and has the objectives of optimising test integrity, customer service and value for money. The two-yearly test, which costs &euro;48.40, provides a high quality diagnostic service using computerised testing equipment. The re-test fee has been fixed at &euro;27.20 where use of test equipment is necessary; otherwise, re-tests will be carried out free of charge.</P>
      <P>Private motoring costs have not in the past received public subsidies, apart from the reliefs of VAT-VRT, motor tax and fuel tax afforded for the benefit of persons with disabilities.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 325 and 326 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with EU Directive 96/96/EC, passenger cars are required to undergo a roadworthiness test when they are four years old and every two years thereafter. The first test due date is determined by reference to the date of the initial registration of the vehicle with subsequent test due dates falling every two years after the first test due date. Where a NCT inspection does not occur on the original test due date, the NCT certificate is valid from the date of the test to the next test due date. This is to ensure that the car is again liable for a test in accordance with the test schedule laid down in the directive. As testing arrangements for motor dealers along the lines suggested in the question would run contrary to the test schedule in the directive, I do not propose to modify the present arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a taxi-hackney reverts to private use the NCT certificate issued in respect of the vehicle as a taxi-hackney will continue to remain valid until the expiry date specified on the certificate at <Col N="1229" /> which stage a NCT is required. Subsequent tests for the vehicle will fall due in accordance with the normal criteria, which are outlined above.</P>

      <P>The national car test, NCT, was introduced in order to implement the requirements of EU Directive 96/96/EC relating to the roadworthiness testing of passenger cars. The directive specifies the items to be tested as part of a roadworthiness test and the NCT reflects the directive's requirements. The standards for the test are such that a vehicle that has been maintained and operated to the manufacturer's requirements is unlikely to be refused a test certificate.</P>
      <P>To avoid the potential for a conflict of interests and to reinforce the independence and integrity of the car testing scheme, the national car testing service, NCTS, is not permitted to carry on any vehicle-related business apart from testing. This has helped to establish a high level of public acceptance of the NCT and I have no plans to change the arrangement.</P>

      <P>It is my intention that Ireland should ratify the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, known as the Montreal Convention, as quickly as possible. Ireland has already signed the convention, along with most other EU member states and the European Community itself. Work on the ratification of the convention has begun in my Department, which will result in legislation being brought to the Oireachtas, before Ireland can formally ratify.</P>
      <P>The Montreal Convention will only enter into force when 30 states have ratified it, when it will then be in force in only those states. To date only 19 states have ratified the convention. No EU member state has yet ratified the convention.</P>
      <P>The main features of the convention are as follows: </P>
      <P>Compensation in case of death or injury of passengers: the convention removes the outdated limits of air carrier liability in cases involving personal injuries or accidental death of passengers with the introduction of a two tier liability system, similar to that provided for under EU Regulation 2027/97.</P>
      <P>The first tier of the liability system under the convention provides for strict liability up to 100,000 special drawing rights, SDRs, per passenger, approximately &euro;140,000 &ndash; a special drawing right is a unit of currency whose value is determined by the International Monetary Fund. The limit under the Warsaw Convention, as amended, is just 16,600 SDRs or about &euro;24,000.</P>

    <P>Under the second tier, unlimited liability applies depending on the cause of the damage, with the onus of proof resting on the carrier &ndash;<Col N="1231" /> the carrier would not be liable for damage above 100,000 SDRs per passenger if the carrier could prove that the damage was not due to negligence on its part or that the damage was solely due to the negligence of a third party.</P>
    <P>The convention provides for advance payments to be made without delay to persons entitled to make claims, if the carrier's national law allows this, to meet immediate financial needs. Such payments would not constitute acceptance of liability by the carrier and any payments made could be offset against any amounts paid later as damages by carrier.</P>
    <P>EU Regulation 2027-97 already provides for granting advance payments which must be made within 15 days of not less than 15,000 ecus. These payments are made to survivors of the accident itself and to the immediate dependants of those killed.</P>
    <P>Under the convention, an injured party will be allowed to take an action in respect of damage resulting from the death or injury of a passenger in the country where at the time of the accident the passenger had his or her principal and permanent residence. Heretofore an action could only be taken in the place of business of the airline, the place of the accident, the point of origin, or the intended point of destination of the flight. This &ldquo;fifth jurisdiction&rdquo; capability is subject to a number of strict conditions.</P>
    <P>The carrier is liable for damage caused by delay in the carriage of passengers, baggage and cargo, unless it can prove that it took all reasonable measures to avoid the damage or it was impossible to take such measures. The limits of liability were fixed at 4,150 SDRs, &euro;5,900 in the case of delay to passengers, 1,000 SDRs, &euro;1,400 for loss, damage or delay of checked baggage, and 17 SDRs, &euro;24 per kilogramme for cargo.</P>

      <P>The disposal of assets is a matter for the board of Aer Lingus. There is no statutory requirement for Aer Lingus to notify the Minister of such disposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the guidelines for the governance of State bodies, issued by the Department of Finance, provide,<i> inter alia</i>, that the disposal of assets of State bodies above a threshold level of &euro;70,000 should be by auction or competitive tendering and that board approval where necessary should be obtained. Also, the chairperson, in the annual report to the Minister, is required to affirm that the disposal procedures outlined in the guidelines have been complied with. The chairman has provided such confirmation in his latest report to the <Col N="1232" /> Minister dealing with 2001 dated 26 April 2002. At the appropriate time the chairman will provide similar information about disposals in 2002.</P>
    <P>However, in relation to the subsidiary mentioned by the Deputy, following a structured and open tendering process managed by independent legal and financial advisers, the board approved the transaction on 30 May 2002 and the company was sold to the highest bidder.</P>

      <P>All members of the Garda Síochána are charged with enforcing the law on drugs misuse. In addition, specialised drugs units operate in divisions throughout the country with a primary focus on local drugs activities. The Garda national drugs unit co-ordinates large-scale operations against those involved in drug dealing-trafficking and unit personnel either investigate such cases themselves or assist local Garda investigation teams. Additional assistance is also available from other specialised Garda support units, as necessary, such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
      <P>The allocation of specific resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner having regard to various policing demands, including those arising from the problem of drugs misuse. I am informed by the Garda authorities that, since the publication of the national drugs strategy, there has been a moderate increase in Garda manpower in a significant number of stations, including in existing local drugs task force areas. However, I am also informed that the Garda authorities have established a high level internal implementation group tasked with examining all of the actions in the national drugs strategy and their implications, including those for Garda resources. In carrying out that ongoing examination, the Garda authorities will have due regard for the commitments in the programme for government to complete the current expansion of the Garda Síochána and to increase recruitment so that the numbers will increase by a further 2,000 over the next five years. It is the Government's intention that those additional members will be targeted at areas of greatest need, especially areas experiencing a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, up to the end of the year 2001, the bureau had obtained interim and &ldquo;final&rdquo; restraint orders to the value of more than &euro;14 million and more than &euro;11 million, respectively. In the same period, taxes and interest demanded were in excess of &euro;56 million with more than &euro;36 million collected. In addition, social welfare savings amount to more than &euro;1.2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the safeguards of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, a disposal order cannot be made in respect of property subject to a &ldquo;final&rdquo; restraint order until a period of seven years has elapsed. A proposal under examination is that assets which are determined by law <Col N="1239" /> to be the proceeds of crime be committed directly towards community regeneration, anti-drugs and other related programmes. While I see merit in the idea, it is not a proposal entirely free of difficulty. It involves a departure from the general rules applying to the management of fines and penalties recovered from those who breach the criminal law. The examination in question will consider those aspects in detail in addition to the legal and financial implications of any possible departure from existing Exchequer arrangements.</P>

      <P>The person referred to is serving an 18 month prison sentence, which was imposed at the Special Criminal Court on 5 February 2002, for membership of an unlawful organisation and was initially committed to Portlaoise Prison. He subsequently disassociated from the subversive grouping with which he had been associated and was transferred from Portlaoise Prison to Wheatfield Prison on 7 June 2002. While the person referred to in the question has been seeking a transfer from Wheatfield Prison to either Portlaoise or the midlands prisons, it has not been possible to accede to this request for operational and security reasons.</P>

      <P>Under Section 8(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Refugee Act, 1996, there is a statutory obligation on an immigration officer to interview any person who arrives at the frontiers of the State seeking asylum in the State or seeking the protection of the State against persecution or requesting not to be returned or removed to a particular country or otherwise indicating an unwillingness to leave the State for fear of persecution. The purpose of the interview is, <i>inter alia</i>, to establish whether the person in question wishes to make an application for refugee status and, if so, the general grounds on which the application is based.</P>
      <P>The immigration officer in question is obliged to give leave to enter the State to such a person under section 9(1) of the Act of 1996. The person in question is, under section 9(2), entitled to remain in the State until his or her asylum claim has been processed to finality.</P>

      <P>The allocation of judges to the Central Criminal Court is a matter for the President of the High Court. I understand the number of judges assigned to that court by the president for most of this year has been three but that, on occasion, less than three judges have been assigned.</P>
      <P>There is a waiting period of more than 18 months for cases which are currently being allocated trial dates. All Central Criminal Court cases are heard in Dublin and cases are not listed on a regional basis. Four judges will be appointed by the Government to the High Court shortly, two replacement judges and two additional judges. A High Court judge should also be returning to the court having completed his functions as chairman of the benchmarking body. These appointments will allow the President of the High Court scope to allocate additional judicial resources to the Central Criminal Court.</P>
      <P>The board of the Courts Service has established a working group to undertake a comprehensive review of the present distribution of jurisdiction and business among the courts with a view to making proposals to me. That working group is at present directing its attention to an examination of criminal jurisdiction, including the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court.</P>

The establishment of a second Garda station in the Tallaght area would necessitate the employment of Garda personnel on indoor administrative duties. Such personnel can be utilised more effectively in providing a visible Garda presence on outdoor duties.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that Garda offices in Killinarden, Jobstown and Fettercairn are staffed for a minimum of two hours one day per week.

      <P>The small claims procedure is intended as an alternative procedure to civil proceedings in the District Court for consumers where the amount in dispute is less than &euro;1,269.74, £1,000. The actual time taken to deal with any case will depend on a number of factors, including, whether it is disputed, the amount of mediation required to settle the matter and whether the case needs to be referred to court.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Courts Service that, in general, the waiting time to have a case dealt with under the small claims procedure averages three to six months. The method of enforcing orders made by the Small Claims Court is the same as that of any other civil court, that is, where payment is not made on foot of a court order in sufficient time by the respondent, the matter is generally sent to the sheriff for enforcement. Courts do not enforce their own decrees.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has been given overall responsibility for the co-ordination of child care service delivery over the course of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. The equal opportunities child care programme, which was established in April 2000, has been developed with the objective of significantly increasing the number of child care <Col N="1244" /> places and improving the quality of child care services over the period.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by officials from the child care directorate of my Department that an application was made, on behalf of the pre-school in question, in August 2001 for a grant towards the staffing costs of the facility. It should be noted that the primary focus of the scheme of support for staffing costs is to assist projects which are located in areas of significant disadvantage or to support child care services which have a particular focus on disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The application in question was refused by my predecessor because it did not demonstrate a sufficient focus on disadvantage and because the projected income from fees charged for the service, excluding the amount sought as a staffing grant, was sufficient for the project to ensure its continued operation over the period concerned. An appeal of this decision was subsequently lodged by the service. This appeal was refused on the same grounds as the original application. A letter informing the pre-school of the decision was issued by the child care directorate in March 2002.</P>

      <P>My Department's involvement with funding for the essential repairs grant scheme relates primarily to the recoupment of up to two thirds of local authority expenditure on the payment of individual grants. The grant scheme is funded at local authority level from the authorities' own resources and within the amounts included for that purpose in the local authorities' own estimates of expenditure.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for each local authority to decide the level of funding to be provided for the scheme in their area from within overall allocations from my Department for house purchase and improvement loans, disabled persons and essential repairs grants. There are no separate allocations for the essential repairs grant scheme which represents only a small proportion of the overall allocation. While it is open to a local authority to seek a higher allocation in the event of increased demand under the scheme, an increased capital allocation would not, of itself, allow increased expenditure by a local authority without a corresponding upward revision of the authority's own estimates of expenditure. I understand that South Dublin and Galway County Councils have notified my Department of difficulties funding the element of the essential repairs grant scheme not recouped from the Department.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the amount of recoupment payable by my Department to local authorities has increased significantly under this scheme. Prior to 2 December 1998, local authorities were recouped 50% of each essential repairs grant paid up to a maximum of &euro;1,143 in each case. Since that date two thirds of the amount of grant paid is recouped, up to a maximum recoupment of &euro;8,467 in each case.</P>

      <P>Strand II of the RAPID programme for provincial towns was launched on 1 February 2002. Some 20 towns have been included in the programme. The initial process involves putting staffing and support structures in place in each town and drawing up an area plan in consultation with the local community. Recruitment of local co-ordinators for each town is almost complete. Area Development Management's RAPID support team has also been strengthened and staff are now in place.</P>
      <P>Area implementation teams representative of the relevant State agencies, including the local authorities and residents in the local community, are also in the process of being established to draw up area plans which will inform investment priorities in the RAPID towns. Two intensive briefing sessions have also taken place on the operation and implementation of the programme for key personnel from all the public and local development agencies who will be directly involved at local level. In addition, guidance on the operation of the programme, with particular reference to the establishment and support of the area implementation teams, has issued to the local authorities concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actual amount of funding which will be invested in any RAPID area under the national development plan will be dependent on the priorities of the area to be identified in the area plans. It is not possible, therefore, at this stage to project expenditure under the programme for any particular town. Following the recent reorganisation of functions at central Government level, it is intended that responsibility for strand II of <Col N="1249" /> RAPID should be transferred shortly from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are responsible, as an integral part of their housing management functions, for determining the rents of their dwellings under the differential rents scheme and the income to be assessed for this purpose. In these circumstances, the rents payable by the categories of person mentioned in the question vary as between authorities. I am satisfied that local authorities have discretion to deal with hardship cases, poverty traps and any other anomalies that arise in an individual case.</P>
      <P>Achieving equalisation between the level of rent contribution payable by tenants under the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, rent supplementation scheme and local authority differential rents schemes would not be possible without a fundamental departure from the devolved nature of the local authority schemes. In any event, the conditions of tenants under the respective schemes is not identical. Local authority tenants enjoy security of tenure, high standards of construction, entitlement to purchase under the tenant purchase scheme and eligibility for other schemes such as shared ownership, etc. Moreover, the differential nature of local authority rent schemes ensures that only a portion of income increases is payable in rent while under the rent supplementation scheme, recipients are required to contribute to their rent any additional means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate. I have, therefore, no proposals to change the existing arrangements, which are in keeping with Government policy of appropriate devolution of local functions to local authorities.</P>

      <P>The national drugs strategy 2001-2008 aims to tackle the drug problem in the most comprehensive way ever undertaken in this country. The strategy contains 100 individual actions under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. One of the actions that the strategy recommends is the establishment of regional drugs task forces, RDTFs, which will be set up in each health board area, including the North-Eastern Health Board area, which includes Drogheda and Dundalk. The membership of the RDTFs will be taken from the full range of statutory, community and voluntary sectors and will be flexible to local circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the RDTFs is to ensure the development of a co-ordinated and integrated response to the problem of drug misuse in the regions. The RDTFs will provide up-to-date information on drug related resources and services, as well as information on the nature and <Col N="1253" /> extent of the drug problem in their areas. Once the service gaps have been identified for each region, the RDTFs prepare a development plan to respond to the issues identified. Guidelines dealing with the setting up of the RDTFs were finalised in May last and have been disseminated to the various sectors and agencies. Co-ordinators are being recruited through the health boards and nominations for membership of the RDTFs have been sought from the various agencies and sectors. The first meetings are expected to be held in autumn 2002.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that included in the recently published programme for Government is a commitment to establish an Islands Council, thus recognising the islands as a region in the context of the local government system. In the light of this commitment, it is my intention to pursue this issue with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Government Department was given specific remit for the islands in 1995. This was transferred to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in 1997. With regard to the introduction of an islands policy at all levels of Government and also since 1998, there has been in existence an interdepartmental committee for the islands, the Gaeltacht and the Irish language. This committee was established to co-ordinate the implementation of Government policy regarding the islands, the Gaeltacht and the Irish language, to make every effort to ensure that that policy is implemented effectively and to review the provision of services from Departments and State organisations to the islands and to the Gaeltacht and to make the system more effective <Col N="1255" /> through negotiation and agreement. Considerable progress has been made by this committee in fulfilling its terms of reference and this work will continue during the term of the present Government.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann, in its recently issued islands manifesto for 2002 to 2007, called for the introduction of &ldquo;island proofing&rdquo; of all legislation and Government programmes as a recognition of the need for additional measures, flexible approaches and different criteria to account for the unique position of our islands. I feel that issues of concern to island communities and issues of special island policies are best dealt with through the existing rural development and poverty proofing of certain State initiatives and particularly through the workings of the above mentioned interdepartmental committee for the islands, the Gaeltacht and the Irish language.</P>

      <P>I would be in favour, in principle, of the establishment of a special enterprise fund for non-Gaeltacht islands to be administered by the county enterprise boards. I understand that my predecessor met with officials of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment earlier this year to discuss the issue and it is my intention to pursue it further with that Department at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>Regarding State support for the development of employment in the agriculture, fishing and natural resource sectors, the Deputy may be aware that the report of the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development, which was published in 1996, identified four areas &ndash; agriculture, fishing-aquaculture, tourism and information technology &ndash; which had the greatest potential for providing employment on the islands. As part of my Department's planning for the coming five years, it is my intention to consult with the co-operatives-development companies on each island, asking them to identify their development priorities in the period 2003 to 2007. When consultations are complete, it is my intention to pursue the various issues raised by island communities with the relevant Departments and State agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of roll on-roll off ferries, my Department currently pays annual subsidies towards the provision of 14 ferry services to various islands around the coast, three of which are roll on-roll off services, which require a specific <Col N="1256" /> type of landing infrastructure currently available on a limited number of islands.</P>

      <P>Recipients of social welfare or health board payments who have been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition and whose means are insufficient to meet their needs, may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Entitlement to a diet supplement is determined by the health boards in accordance with the legislative provisions which specify the medical conditions in respect of which a diet supplement may be paid and the means test which must be applied. The amount of supplement payable depends on which of two categories of diet has been prescribed by the applicant's medical adviser, the age of the person and on the income of the individual and his-her dependants.</P>
      <P>The South-Eastern Health Board was contacted on behalf of the individual in question and has advised that the application for a diet supplement was in respect of a lower cost diet. The board also advised that the person in question has a private pension in addition to his old age pension. I agree that the rate of payment in this case is low. However, as entitlement to a diet supplement is means tested, any additional income a person may have has the effect of reducing the amount of diet supplement payable. The level of payment has been reviewed and is correct. Full details of the calculations involved are shown on the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>All aspects of the diet supplement will be examined in conjunction with the review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is currently under way as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations. I have no immediate plans to amend any aspect of the diet supplement pending receipt of the review group's recommendations on the matter.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides support to carers on low incomes who look after people in need of full-time care and attention. The carer's allowance is not a payment for caring. However, carers of more than one incapacitated person are currently entitled to an additional 50% of their rate of payment. This is an acknowledgement of the difficulties, both financial and personal, which are faced by these carers. Of the 19,300 people currently in receipt of carer's allowance, 1,600 are in receipt of this additional 50% payment. The estimated full year cost of the introduction of a double payment for carers of two incapacitated people is &euro;4.6 million and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2002, provides for the amendment of the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages Acts to facilitate the implementation <Col N="1258" /> of the first stage of the civil registration modernisation programme. In particular, it provides for the introduction of electronic registers of births and deaths, electronic production of certificates of birth, death and marriage, changing of a child's surname on re-registration, creation of an electronic database of historical paper based records and electronic searching of records. A programme of work aimed at the introduction of a modern civil registration service has been under way for some months. The focus in the initial phase of the project is on the design of the new computer system and the development of the business and legislative framework for the future registration of life events.</P>
      <P>My Department is aware of the concerns expressed by the Genealogical Society of Ireland regarding access to records of the General Register Office. As part of the on-going communication-consultation process with representative groups and organisations, a letter issued on 12 April 2002 to all family research-genealogical representative organisations, which included the Genealogical Society of Ireland, inviting them to a meeting on 13 May 2002. The purpose of the meeting was to outline the approach to the modernisation of the civil registration service, provide an overview of the amendments to the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages Acts, give an update on the &ldquo;Roscommon project&rdquo; which is concerned with the electronic capture of paper based records, demonstrate the future approach to the electronic searching of indices in the General Register Office using a prototype system and discuss issues and concerns of the various groups. The Genealogical Society of Ireland was represented at this meeting and its representatives were informed that there were no plans to limit access to registration records and that the electronic search facility demonstrated at the meeting, would, in fact, provide for speedier and more efficient access to the records.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards. Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. I understand the accommodation to which the Deputy refers was established with assistance from the Department of the Environment and Local Government's <Col N="1259" /> capital assistance scheme. Under the terms of the scheme, capital grants ranging from 90% to 95% are made available through local authorities, to approved voluntary bodies to provide accommodation for persons accepted as qualified for local authority housing. In addition to the non-repayable capital grants, subsidies may also be paid under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988.</P>
      <P>The relevant housing authority has a consultation right as to the fixing of rents for properties provided with assistance under the capital assistance scheme. A normal market rent is not needed by the landlord because of the extent of public subsidy and, accordingly, a limit is set on the maximum amount of rent supplement payable to tenants in these circumstances. The maximum amount of rent supplement payable is &euro;39.36 per week for a couple and &euro;36.82 for a single person. These levels were set as and from April 2001. These are the equivalent amounts of rent supplement that would ordinarily be payable to people aged 65 years or more under the standard terms of the rent supplement scheme if their rent was &euro;90.48, in the case of a couple, or &euro;62.94 in the case of a single person.</P>
      <P>The relevant health board has been contacted on behalf of the residents in question. Arising from this, an error in the calculation of the rent supplement payable in respect of a number of cases has been identified. Arrangements have been made for an immediate review of all cases. Where errors are found, payments will be increased and any arrears due will be paid. My Department will also ensure that if any other cases exist they will be identified and similarly rectified. I wish to apologise for the error in this case. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is currently being reviewed as part of my Department's formal programme evaluation studies. The review will examine all aspects of the scheme including the issue of rent supplementation to tenants of accommodation provided under the capital assistance scheme.</P>

      <P>Under the free travel scheme, peak-time access restrictions apply on Dublin Bus and on Bus Éireann city services in Cork and Limerick. The restrictions arise because of pressure on bus capacity at peak commuter times. There are no time restrictions on DART or other rail services. My Department, in consultation with CIE, has arranged in a very small number of exceptional cases to issue a temporary unrestricted pass for a limited individual period to facilitate unavoidable hospital appointments and to enable the passholder to re-arrange appointments outside of the peak hours. When these special passes are issued, passholders are advised by the Department to re-arrange their hospital appointments to enable them to travel outside peak times after the pass expiry date. This arrangement is not sustainable on an extended individual basis.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was issued with a temporary unrestricted pass in November 2001. In view of the circumstances of this case, I have arranged to have this pass extended for a further six months. The person concerned has applied for a companion free travel pass on foot of the extension of this pass to invalidity pensioners who are medically certified as unable to travel unaccompanied. Her application has been approved and a companion free travel pass will issue to her as soon as possible. This will allow any one person aged 16 or over to accompany her free of charge when travelling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">

      <P>Child benefit is a universal payment which is payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years and continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability. Entitlement to child benefit has always been firmly focused on age. Payment of child benefit until the completion of full-time education would effectively entail the abolition of the age condition. This could give rise to a situation where persons returning to education as mature students could establish an entitlement to child benefit. In addition, the measure is likely to be extremely costly, having regard to the numbers of young people who continue in full-time education beyond 19 years.</P>
      <P>This Government intends to complete the programme of multi-annual increases in child benefit announced in budget 2001. Significant progress has already been made in this regard. From April 2002, the rate of child benefit for the first two children was increased by &euro;31.80 and the higher rate for subsequent children by &euro;38.10. These increases raised the lower rate to &euro;117.60 per month and the higher rate to &euro;147.30, in fulfilment of the PPF commitment to move towards &euro;126.97 per month for third and subsequent children. This represents an additional investment in the payment of &euro;413.82 million in a full year. When the planned increases have been fully implemented, we will have increased annual Government investment in child benefit to some &euro;1.9 billion. In light of what I have outlined, any further improvements to the payment would have to be considered in a budgetary context, having regard to the available resources and competing priorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 392 and 393 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farm assist scheme, which introduced special arrangements for farmers on low incomes, <Col N="1262" /> was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1999, and came into operation with effect from 7 April 1999. Currently, there are 8,345 people in receipt of farm assist. An approximate breakdown by county is provided in the following table.</P>
    <P>The information requested regarding the number of cases where payment was reduced or increased following review is not readily available. A special programme must be written to extract the relevant information from the Department's computer database for the period in question. Arrangements will be made to provide the Deputy with the results of this analysis as soon as possible. Where payment has been reduced or stopped, the decision of the deciding officer may be appealed to the independent social welfare appeal office. The scheme has brought about a worthwhile improvement for low income farmers and particularly for those with children. The scheme clearly makes a valuable contribution to supporting those who are at the lower end of the farm income spectrum.</P>
    <P>The following table shows a breakdown by county of current farm assist recipients. It is not 100% accurate as it has been compiled from data that is maintained on a local office catchment area basis and these do not correspond exactly with county boundaries.</P>

A significant backlog of work arose during the dispute and efforts to deal with it and to restore normal service to child benefit customers were being seriously hampered by the volume of telephone calls which were being received after the dispute. It was not possible to handle the increased volume of telephone calls without diverting staff from claim processing and making the arrears situation worse. In order to provide the best service to our customers arrangements were made to concentrate as much effort as possible on dealing with the claims and to provide information through recorded messages which would satisfy the needs of many telephone callers and act as a filter which would allow those experiencing hardship or otherwise in need of urgent payment to have their calls dealt with. The backlog is reducing due to these measures. Normal telephone service will be resumed in the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>The living alone allowance is an additional payment of &euro;7.70 per week, to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments and who reside alone. The allowance is an integral part of the Irish pension system and is paid as an additional allowance. As such, it has no applicability <i>vis-à-vis</i> pension payments made under the social security regimes of other EU member states or countries with which Ireland has bilateral agreements.</P>

      <Quest>the position regarding the payment of disability benefit to a person in receipt of a contributory widow's pension; if both payments can be made to the same person in view of the fact two separate people made the neces sary PRSI contributions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Where a person who is in receipt of a widow or widower's pension or one-parent family payment satisfies the relevant contribution conditions, he or she may be entitled to receive disability benefit or unemployment benefit at half-rate for a period of up to 15 months, in addition to their main payment. Furthermore, where a person is entitled to a widow or widower's pension or one-parent family payment at a reduced rate, for example, on the basis of insufficient PRSI contributions or on means grounds, the rate of that payment is increased to the maximum level for the duration of their claim for disability or unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide for the income support needs of individuals and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual at any one time. However, as already outlined, there are exceptions made to this rule for those receiving widow/widower's pensions and one-parent family payment. The qualifying conditions for the widow/widower's pension are unique in that they can be satisfied on either the insurance record of the claimant or their late spouse. This is intended to make qualification for a pension as easy as possible and is not something which would justify the making of the payment in addition to other benefits.</P>

      <P>My Department received an application for carer's allowance from the person concerned on 21 February 2002. The principal conditions for receipt of the allowance are that full-time care and attention are required and being provided and that the means test which applies is satisfied. While the medical eligibility conditions are satisfied, her application was referred to an investigative officer of the Department for a means assessment. She was requested on several occasions to forward details of her spouse's earnings from employment, in order to complete the means assessment. However, she failed to provide the requested information. Consequently, her application for carer's allowance was refused. She was notified of this decision on 25 May 2002 and of her right to appeal to the social welfare appeals office. No appeal has been lodged. On receipt of the necessary information, her entitlement to carer's allowance will be further examined and she will be notified directly of the outcome. Under social welfare legislation, decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>
