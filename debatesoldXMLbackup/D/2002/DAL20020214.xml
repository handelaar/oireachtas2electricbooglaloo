      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I must deal with a postponed division relating to the suspension of a Member. Yesterday, on the question, &ldquo;That Deputy Owen be suspended from the service of the Dáil&rdquo;, a division was claimed and, in accordance with Standing Order 61, that division must take place now.</P>

      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics. I propose to deal with these topics separately and I will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. In regard to the first topic, I received notice from Deputy Ó Caoláin and I now call on him to state the matter.</P>

      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to address the following matter of urgent national importance: the escalating crisis in the accident and emergency units of our hospitals. This has led to strike action by the Irish Nurses' Organisation and a balloting for industrial action by SIPTU which has described the working conditions in the accident and emergency departments as war zones.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 31 I seek the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention: the implications for the authenticity of official Garda crime figures of documents published in today's edition of <i>The Star</i> suggesting conviction rates in one Garda division had been falsified and the need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make an immediate statement to the House on the measures being taken to investigate these claims.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business today is No. 22<i>a</i>, motion re Membership of Committees; No. 23, motion re proposed approval of the terms of certain Acts of the 1994 Congress of Universal Postal Union &ndash; back from Committee; and No. 4, Finance Bill, 2002 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed). It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 4.45 p.m. today and business shall be interrupted not later than 6.30 p.m. Nos. 22<i>a</i> and 23 shall be decided without debate and the resumed Second Stage of No. 4 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 6.30 p.m., and any division demanded thereon shall be postponed until immediately after the Order of Business on Tuesday, 19 February 2002.</P>

      <P>There are three proposals to be put to the House. Is the first proposal <Col N="837" /> on the late sitting agreed to? Agreed. The second proposal is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 22<i>a</i> and 23 without debate. Is that agreed to? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 4 &ndash; the conclusion of Second Stage of the Finance Bill, 2002 agreed to?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not agreed from a number of perspectives. First, as was indicated yesterday by the leader of the Labour Party, to truncate and guillotine yet another important debate is unprecedented. Many Deputies wish to contribute to the Finance Bill, particularly in light of new inclusions in the Bill which did not form part of the Budget Statement. To end the debate today would be a travesty, particularly in view of the fact that for the month of March it is indicated we will sit for merely seven days. We are indicating we would be happy to sit extra days in March to allow for a full debate on the Finance Bill so that all Members who wish to participate can do so. Why at the conclusion of the debate, if the Government has its way, is the vote deferred on a matter as important as the Finance Bill? If the Government wants to bring it to a conclusion then let it be decided in the House at whatever time it indicates. It wants it two ways. It wants to allow its Deputies to canvass&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and it wants this House made irrelevant for the month of March, which is a disgraceful way to treat the House. Either the Government wants to run the business of the House in a normal and orderly fashion or, if it does not wish to do so, it should call an election now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>My party does not agree to the proposal. The Finance Bill is being rushed through at a time when people on just under &euro;6,000 per annum, or just over £101 a week, living alone, do not have medical cards and people who received a small increase in social welfare benefits have been deprived of medical cards, including all the implications of that. The death rate for people over 55 is 11 per 1,000 among the wealthier classes who have been given medical cards and 30 per 1,000 among poorer people who have been deprived of them.</P>

      <P>The Green Party opposes No. 4. I understand there is a legal requirement for the <Col N="838" /> Finance Bill to be passed but we are nowhere near that at this point. Therefore, there is no obvious reason for guillotining the Bill tonight. In the meantime, only two of the Opposition parties have had an opportunity to voice their views on the Finance Bill and make alternative proposals. My party, including other parties and Independents, have equally valid viewpoints and mandates to express those viewpoints. We have not as yet been given the facility to do so. In the interests of fairness, I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to ensure this time is provided and to allow the Government to indicate if it will give time to my party and others in the House who have not yet had an opportunity to speak.    </P>

      <P>Before we take leaders' questions, in view of the gross disorder during leaders' questions yesterday morning, I must again emphasise the fact that under Standing Order 26 leaders' questions and supplementary questions are strictly confined to the leaders of Fine Gael and the Labour Party and replies are confined to the Taoiseach. No other Member from either side may intervene or raise a point of order. Interruptions and refusals to recognise the Chair are not in order and interruptions should not be replied to. Yesterday's interruptions gave <Col N="841" /> rise to events which did no credit to the House. Members from all sides are obliged to observe the rules of the House.</P>
      <P>The time allowed for leaders' questions is a relatively new facility introduced just less than one year ago. However, it has been found to be a very important one in our parliamentary procedure. It is, therefore, essential that it be conducted strictly in accordance with the relevant Standing Order to which I appeal to Members to strictly adhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning I want to raise a very serious issue, the alleged falsification of crime detection figures in a Garda division. I understand the division in question is the one in the south east. In looking at the Garda Síochána annual report I notice that detection rates in Waterford city are 68% and in the area of the south eastern division outside of Waterford city, 58%. The figure of 68% is 14% higher than the detection rate in any other city area. The allegations that have been substantiated undermine the credibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, who proclaimed a zero tolerance policy. He has made claims here of a successful fight against crime, but I put it to the Minister taking the Order of Business this morning that the reality is quite different.</P>
      <P>In particular, violence on the streets is rampant. In the year 2000 some 10,400 assaults were recorded. Almost one in four crimes is going unreported. The number of rape offences has risen to six per week while wanton random attacks, particularly on young people on the streets of our towns every night of the week, are destroying the quality of life of many young people. Does the Minister have any explanation from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about the falsification of Garda crime figures? I put it to him that the regime of the Minister in charge of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been the most sorry disaster that has ever occurred in public administration. The credibility of the Garda Síochána is being constantly undermined and it will take a strong effort to restore it.</P>

      <P>After 13 months the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform finally got <Col N="842" /> around to publishing the 2000 crime figures last month. Almost immediately it emerged those figures were manipulated with some crimes having been recategorised, the net effect of the change being that what was a real increase in serious crime has been presented as a decrease. That fact was known to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when he debated these matters with me on national radio.</P>
      <P>The allegations in the national newspapers today on foot of information that was sent to them and to me are startling. In one Garda division the reportage on the new PULSE system, on which large sums of money were spent to ensure reliance on accurate figures, is alleged to have been falsified. The Government, and in particular its Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, have made their reputation on those crime figures. Is their reputation now not in tatters? Is the reputation of the Government not a complete sham?</P>

      <P>The Garda Commissioner, who was informed yesterday by <i>The Star</i> of certain information relating to the treatment of crime statistics for 2001 in Waterford city Garda district, has appointed a chief superintendent from outside the region this morning to review all aspects of the specific information and all crime reported and detected for 2001 for this district. Given the importance of the figures contained in the commissioner's annual report on crime, the report of the chief superintendent will be made public. The commissioner is gravely concerned that any doubt should be cast on the accuracy of any information which forms part of his annual report on crime.</P>
      <P>I take it that the crime statistics to which Deputy Noonan referred are for 2000. This matter refers to 2001 for which statistics are not yet available.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is in hiding. The facts are clear. I sympathise with the Minister for Defence who has been given the job of defending the indefensible and relying on statements on an issue, the detail of which we do not expect him to be familiar with. The facts are that only one crime in four is reported. In the most recently published statistics the figures were massaged by recategorising certain crimes to make an increase in crime overall look like a reduction in crime.</P>
      <P>Another fact is that in at least one Garda division detection rates are being falsified. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not in the House. The Minister for Defence said that matters have been improving. After Abbeylara, the McBrearty affair which was handled very badly by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and now this incident, it is time the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform came into the House and gave us an explanation of what is going on.</P>

      <P>I am not calling for his resignation. We are entitled to hear his explanation, but it had better be a good one. He should do it before the Dáil adjourns this afternoon. I cannot understand why he is not here this morning. It has always been the practice that if there is a major incident in one's Department that at least the Minister responsible turns up at the Order of Business and makes himself or herself accountable to the House. It is not fair to the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, to have to answer these questions this morning. This is a crisis about the credibility of the crime statistics which are fundamental to criminal justice policy. It is not possible to frame policy on inaccurate figures. These figures are now so inaccurate as to be meaningless.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister for Defence &ndash; I presume he has it in his brief &ndash; that under the new PULSE system the 2001 figures are now available to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. We on this side of the House know that the reported incidence of assault has gone up dramatically. We also know that many assaults are not reported. We call on the Minister to stop hiding the statistics before the election. He should put into the public domain what he has got. He has readily available, through the PULSE system, the statistics for 2001 and they should be published immediately. More than anything else, I ask the Minister in charge this morning to ensure the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform comes into the House this afternoon, makes a full statement, answers the questions of the Opposition and makes himself accountable.</P>

        <b>: </b>How fortuitous that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform happens to be absent again when something topical arises. The Garda Complaints Board has proven to be largely ineffective at dealing with complaints against the Garda where people's constitutional rights have been transgressed. Six months ago the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform promised to introduce legislation to establish a new Garda inspectorate. It is now February 2002. Will we see the Bill this session? Will it be enacted or will it be another empty promise?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying yesterday evening, careful economic and budgetary management provide the most sound basis for our future. That drives this Fianna Fáil-led Government's aim to secure a basis for further growth, reward work and effort, develop infrastructure, distribute resources fairly and create a society that can look forward with confidence. Over the past four and a half years, we were responsible for the most sustained and significant strengthening of the economy. We now enjoy the highest level of employment in our history. Fianna Fáil, and our junior partners, the Progressive Democrats, have generated over 350,000 jobs, cut employment to its lowest level since modern statistics commenced, substantially increased people's real incomes, boosted productivity of the workforce and successfully introduced major reform of the taxation system, while putting more money into people's pockets and improving their quality of life.</P>
      <P>We ensured that our social inclusion policies were delivered on by utilising the fruits of economic success to benefit the socially excluded, the widowed, elderly, children, disabled and all in need. Our core promises at the last election were to cut unemployment, taxes, and crime, and to build a lasting peace on this island. We delivered spectacularly on all of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Forfás 2001 review, published yesterday, chief executive Mr. John Travers said that given the unexpected high level of downturn in the world economy, Ireland's overall economic performance and job creation and maintenance in 2001 was highly creditable. During 2001, the unemployment rate in an increasing labour force fell to under 4%, its lowest level since the foundation of the State. Mr. Travers said that, despite the threat from the current global economic downturn, there are positive features which can help Ireland navigate safely through the current stormy economic waters. These include the highest ever level of employment despite the setbacks of 2001; a trade in goods and services sector &ndash; both Irish and foreign owned &ndash; which is more competitive than it has ever been in terms of productivity, sectoral positioning, technology, marketing capability, and managerial competence; a capital investment programme under the national development plan which is making progress in addressing infrastructural deficiencies and which, in the medium term, will provide a high level modern infrastructural base for future growth; and the beginnings of the foundations of future high levels of growth and living standards through the significant increase in investment in research and development by Forfás, the Science Found<Col N="852" /> ation of Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, the universities and other research funding bodies.</P>
    <P>Many politicians and commentators should take note of Mr. Traver's positive comments and should acknowledge and acclaim the positive achievements of the people and all Governments over the past ten years instead of downgrading our economic success. Criticism is welcome, provided it is constructive and we can learn from it but totally negative comment does not do the country any good.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy has marked himself out as an outstanding Minister for Finance who understood what had to be done to bring our taxation system into the third millennium and to progress the economy. I am proud to have been associated with him in the preparation of the Fianna Fáil taxation policy document prior to the last election from which 99% of the taxation changes of the past five years flowed. We were not dictated to by a political party which some claimed was the only one concerned with tax reduction. Every political party is concerned to reduce tax, but we acted upon our concern. We analysed what needed to be done to drive the economy forward and Deputy McCreevy, as the Minister for Finance, delivered, a fact recognised by workers and taxpayers who will show their thanks in the ballot box at the next election.</P>
    <P>This Bill includes personal, business, housing related and other taxation matters designed to benefit individual taxpayers, promote business growth and ensure fairness in the tax system. As I said last night, the Minister provided for a further &euro;634 million in personal tax reductions and his focus is directed at helping those at the lower end of the income scale. That means that in addition to the &euro;3.5 billion in the previous four budgets, there is now another &euro;634 million which shows there has been a tremendous amount of money given back to the people in the past five years.</P>
    <P>The entry point to the tax system was raised from &euro;183 last year to &euro;209 this year, a 14.5% increase to a threshold of 90% of the current industrial wage. Give us another year and the entry point will be equal to the industrial wage; the mind boggles at what we will do for the following four years. We will reduce the tax burden more and more.</P>
    <P>Income tax exemption limits for those aged 65 and over have increased by over 20% from &euro;7,900 to &euro;13,000 or £6,290 to £10,238 for a single or widowed person and this is to be welcomed. A single person over 65 would have to earn more than &euro;13,000 before having any tax liability and a married couple would need to earn &euro;26,000 before being liable for taxation. The exemption limits have doubled since 1997-8.</P>
    <P>The single standard tax rate band has been widened to &euro;28,000 or £22,000, an increase of &euro;2,605 or £2,000 on last year. Personal taxation measures mean a further 79,000 low income earners have been removed from the tax net, while 57,000 have been taken off the high rate. This continues the <Col N="853" /> movement out of the tax net of thousands of people on low incomes, a target we set on getting into Government and on which we have delivered.</P>
    <P>Under section 5, the allowance in respect of a person caring for an incapacitated family member has been significantly increased from &euro;12,700 to &euro;30,000 with tax allowable at the marginal rate. I welcome this provision and also welcome the extension of the medical relief claims under section 9 to include payments not only to immediate family members but to other family members, as outlined in the section, and non-relatives. This is very wise and will be beneficial to society in general.</P>
    <P>Under section 15, the BES and seed capital schemes have been extended for a further two years, while the company limit has been increased from &euro;317,500 to &euro;750,000. It was reduced some years ago but is now being extended again. This is welcome in order to ensure continued growth in indigenous industry. Despite our successes over the past five years especially, there is still a need to increase the number of indigenous industries and to put them on a sound basis so they will continue to produce jobs and wealth for the years ahead. Increasing the time frame and financial limits for the BES is welcome, as is the extension of the seed capital scheme refund period from five to six years. I have discussed this with my constituents and that extra year will be very helpful. The seed capital scheme has been very beneficial to many people in setting up their businesses. The reduction of employers' PRSI contributions will also help to save and create jobs.</P>
    <P>Following the Bacon reports, overheating in the house market was quenched. However, there were also negative aspects to that, such as the decision by many investors to send money abroad and purchase houses in Spain and the south of France. I wish them success though they will be dealing with tax authorities in those areas if they need to sell those properties and those authorities may not be as soft and lenient as ours. That is another day's work. The money going abroad meant there was a shortage of rental property here resulting in an increase in rents. It was necessary to change the system and the Minister for Finance took wise decisions by reintroducing interest relief for investors and changing stamp duty. There has been an increase in housing and that industry is now in a fairly satisfactory condition. Student accommodation is something all Members will know about. It comes to the fore every September, when our sons, daughters and constituents have problems finding rented accommodation. I welcome the extension of the tax incentive scheme to September 2005 because it is important that accommodation is available to students.</P>
    <P>Capital allowances, as we are well aware, were available over a seven year period at 15% per year for the first six years with the balance due in the last year. The Minister has reduced the write-off period to five years. That is more sensible and <Col N="854" /> is in keeping with what happens in business. It will be 20% in a straight line following this Bill which I welcome. I also welcome the clarification that, with certain conditions, milk quota purchases after 1 April 2001 will qualify for capital allowances.</P>
    <P>Section 39 is a new provision which gives relief to individuals and companies for donations to certain sports bodies for the funding of capital projects. Over the last number of years there has been a drying up of funds for capital programmes in localities because of the large demands on people in their parishes for many different types of building projects. GAA, soccer and rugby clubs must collect money to buy pitches before doing some work on them. Their members then demand more sophisticated facilities and that means more money is needed but one cannot keep going back to the well. This section's tax relief will be of benefit to those looking for funds, as companies and individuals can see they will get something out of it. This should help to raise funds for sports projects.</P>
    <P>Regarding capital gains tax, I welcome the extension of the rollover relief, particularly in relation to farmers who have had land taken from them under compulsory purchase orders due to road developments. Many farmers were extremely worried about the consequences of facing large tax bills under the old system. However, the Minister has alleviated the problems by introducing changes in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>As regards capital gains tax, perhaps the Minister would consider granting tax relief to owners of caravan sites. They are not allowed any relief if they transfer their caravan business to their sons or daughters. For many people that is their only business and I ask the Minister to consider their request for relief.</P>
    <P>The VAT ceiling for registration of services is £20,000, while it is £40,000 for trading in goods. That has been the ceiling for many years. It is time to review that and perhaps to increase it to keep in line with inflation. Some £20,000 is a small sum of money, given the extra costs faced by small business people, such as electricians and fitters, who will not make a large profit if they have a turnover of £20,000 or £25,000. I ask the Minister to table an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party was always considered to be solid, mercantilist and the legal bastion of our society. However, panic has struck at its heart. It has made outrageous promises in recent weeks, such as that to pay back Eircom shareholders who lost money. If people had sold their shares when they were at a high price, they would have made money. If the Vodafone shares had increased and people had been paid back their losses, would the Fine Gael Party have tried to recoup the money paid to them? </P>

      <P>A certain image of Ireland emerges from the Lenten pastoral I have just heard and from the Minister's speech. It is interesting to think of the essential elements. There is not any commitment to citizenship. No one will spend a penny or spend any time or effort because it is good in itself for society, for one's neighbour and for generations to come. Everyone must be at least lured into parting with their money for every social expenditure. Students are not entitled to student accommodation as of right unless one can attract specu<Col N="856" /> lators into the market who make a killing and, as a type of unintended consequence, the number of rental units increase. Equally, the sick are not entitled to hospital beds as of right because the State must not be allowed to spend public money on public health. One must lure private investors into health care. I listened to the speech and the glowing tribute by the last speaker, but I remind him of one of the significant changes in the Bill. The number of beds the private investors in medicine must provide to qualify for tax incentives is being reduced in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The tax incentives for park and ride facilities raise the question as to whether they are proper. Would it have been an idea to increase the public subvention to State companies? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not advise the Minister of State to interrupt because I might extend my time and I have a lot to say about his area of responsibility. We have witnessed in the five Finance Bills &ndash; it is seven if one adds the other two &ndash; introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, a certain vision of society which is not his vision or that of Michael McDowell. I spoke on the Finance Bill last year and I described the lovely self-congratulatory little smirk he gave when he was described in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> as the Celtic Thatcher. I want the public to know about the idea that no one does anything from a sense of citizenship. One must cripple the State; the State must not invest in public health. There must be private investment with a limited number of beds for public access. The Minister was lobbied and he said yes.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Government will be judged by a simple test not done by me or people who are ideologically of the left, but by those who objectively make measures on the proportion of gross domestic product that is spent on such things as social protection. What do we mean by social protection? Do we mean care of the young, the elderly or the disabled? There are approximately 12 indicators in total and approximately eight are common to the 15 European Union countries. The Minister of State referred to when we were in power in 1997. We spent too little a proportion of our gross domestic product on social protection, at 17.2%. However, in 1998 as the economy began to produce record surpluses, the figure fell to 16.1%, which was the first full year of the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats coalition. According to EUROSTAT, the EU statistical office, it declined to 14.7% in 1999. We spend half the European average on social protection and on the citizenship agenda of acknowledging the young and those growing old in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us reflect on the assumptions guiding the McCreevy thinking in the Finance Bill, 2002. What kind of society is it assumed to be? It is assumed to be one where the stars are the specu<Col N="857" /> lators, those who play in the public space, those who entertain and perform. A dancer might have a life of seven or eight years and is the most likely performing artist to have arthritis. Does that move Deputy McCreevy? No. Does the person who is training youngsters in a voluntary capacity interest him in regard to sport? No. What interests him is those who are stars of the entertainment industry. They are nice to have around and he is trying to persuade them to be role models.</P>
    <P>I recall a time in politics when people were offered as role models who put the needs of society above themselves, who said it was more important to leave something after them than to consume everything. That was a vision, but what we have here is something based on shoddy economics. I challenge the Minister to show me any published statistical work in any economic journal outlining a direct relationship between cutting the top rate of income tax and creating employment. He has not ever produced any factual basis for that. It is an old ideological rant and we are likely to see a great deal more of it when we see the spectre of Michael McDowell looming over the Minister's shoulder, devoid of compassion, anti-social inclusion, could not care less, rewarding those who speculate.</P>
    <P>When Deputies stand up and tell me about how much has been achieved, I think of the &euro;7 billion that has been foregone in tax, &euro;740 million of which has been given exclusively to those on the top rate of tax. Deputy McCreevy and his Government will be judged by the equality test. How could it be that in the best of times with the economy producing record surpluses, he ends his career with those on the minimum wage still in the tax net and at the same time he has produced a litany of options for those who are paying the top rate. What moral justification was there for giving some &euro;740 million to those on the top rate?</P>
    <P>What has to give way when there is a downturn in the international economy? It is public expenditure. The Minister questions the economics of the proposals of Deputy Martin, the Minster for Health and Children, and says they may not be viable. Everybody knows that money alone ploughed into hospitals will not solve the problem. Nurses and doctors need to be recruited and a career structure needs to be put in place among other things. At the basis of this is the assumption that greed is good.</P>
    <P>Some people believe we pay our taxes for a better society, for decent public health, public transport and to feel secure. I am proud to pay my taxes for every child in this country, including the one with special needs.</P>
    <P>It is a shame in 2002 that we have this smirking presentation where people stand up and say they gave those who made a killing in housing something and they are back in the market and is that not great. They gave it to those people who wanted to turn medicine into a sickness industry and are they not great. They love those lads who are around them at the racecourse and that will <Col N="858" /> be great too because they will not pay tax. I was the Minster for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Minster of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, knows as many of the artists, as I do, who are in terrible difficulties. They have a short working career and at 50 and 60 years of age can hardly pay their rent, or electricity bills. I know the dancers who are crippled and all the other people. I know Charles Lynch, the wonderful and distinguished concert pianist and the poverty he was in.</P>
    <P>All these people who give of themselves generously in public performance might have been recognised, might have qualified for pensions and tax credits. That could have been looked at but instead it was suggested that the twits who are around our lovely lads deserve it. Apart from the absurdity of ignoring those who are working voluntarily in favour of those who are working for commercial reasons, it is the mind set that one creates a new consuming elite that is central to a vision of a miserable society, one so shrunk that it no longer deals with poverty issues. We get an abuse of parliament when one Deputy after another stands up saying a mantra. They are glad to say that over the past five years so much has been spent on this and that. I even heard some Deputies saying that Fianna Fáil reduced unemployment &ndash; as if in fact they were running the economy. Fianna Fáil, good luck to it, has always been good at taking credit, but the one thing for which it had responsibility, as every other party has in here, is to say what kind of society it is trying to create. That will require saying unpopular things. I could not stand here and say we could promise to reduce the top rate of tax further while there was necessary spending required in public health or education and I would not do it.</P>
    <P>As somebody who worked as an academic for 25 years I repeat my accusation to the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, that there is not an ounce of intellectual basis for his thinking in regard to the economy and financial management. There is no evidence that reducing the top rate of tax automatically creates employment. There is no evidence either that having free capital movements internationally is of great advantage to the international economy. It is time the Minster came in here and stopped giving us statements from the form book that passes for finance speeches and states the assumptions upon which his policies are based. Lest anyone think I exaggerate one bit, I have worked on his figures. A sum of &euro;7 billion was given in tax relief, of that 43% was in tax credits that benefited all, 16% was cuts to the standard rate, which are available to all of those not just those on the standard rate and 11% of the &euro;7 billion went exclusively to those on the top rate of tax.</P>
    <P>One does not need to be a rocket scientist or to subscribe to many newspapers to see that if one is on the top rate of tax one has a surplus. This is a savage ignoring of people's needs. Fianna Fáil Deputies say they want to claim it for themselves, they were not made to do it by the <Col N="859" /> Progressive Democrats, it is really new Fianna Fáil. Whether it is new Fianna Fáil or new Progressive Democrats or resurrected &ldquo;McDowellism&rdquo;, it is a savage uncaring vision of Ireland and it is one that should be condemned.</P>
    <P>When young people ask me about life in politics, I say the best of people in all the parties went into politics for things that were beyond themselves. They did not go in so they could aspire one day to be in the most important position in the Cabinet and to be able to get up after five years and say to the rich that they were wonderful and there are a few of the lads they have not fixed up yet. That is what brought politics into disgrace and I hope the public speak on Michael McDowell, that they look hard at what he stands for and they will see an ugly insular greedy version of Ireland. I hope they will announce their verdict on it and that they come out to vote and state their opinions. There is so much more I could say, but I will reserve it for another occasion.</P>
    <P>The people of my constituency about whom I will think as I travel back there this weekend are those who have children with special needs or who care for people with special needs. They have devoted their lives to the care of other persons. I will think of the carers who are means tested. How can I attend a meeting with them and say, &ldquo;It is a pity you are not a jockey or a commercial sportsman because the Minister could have done something for you&ldquo;? It is time for a different vision and for an alternative to what has been inflicted on the people for the past five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In what my colleague, Deputy Michael Higgins, has referred to as a Lenten pastoral from the Taoiseach, we were exhorted not to criticise negatively the economy and to avoid hyperbole. I take up that challenge. I do not say the stewardship of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has been a disaster, but it has been unfair, unjust and anti-egalitarian. We have had five wasted years during the period of greatest wealth generation this economy has ever seen. The Fianna Fáil backbenchers who have contributed to this Second Stage debate have urged the House to join in the paeans of praise to the Minister. According to them we live in the best of all possible worlds. It is not to criticise negatively to say that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you compare the lot of the citizens of this country with those of some others internationally, the above is fair enough. Of course, that is not the context in which the argument is made. The context is, as Deputy Michael Higgins has said, that Fianna Fáil want to take credit for what it says is the best of all possible worlds created under the stewardship of the Minister for Finance and that without that party we would not have had the progress made in recent years. We have made progress, but let us look at the reality. What are the indicators at the end of the Minister's period in office? Let us regard the Finance Bill, 2002, <Col N="860" /> as an audit of his five years and as an audit of the economy as he leaves it, compared to what it was when he found it. If one takes any of the indicators, such as personal taxation, there have, of course, been reductions. There have been serious reductions for the highest earners.</P>
    <P>On budget day the Minister told us there was likely to be 3.5% growth, but there has been no growth in the economy since then. The downturn began as long ago as this time last year, even though it was not noticed until summer or admitted until autumn. The deterioration in the public finances is alarming, though the Minister began 2001 forecasting a budget surplus of &euro;3.2 billion. That money has disappeared like last year's snow. Through the manipulation we have discussed several times in the House, the Minister made a phoney forecast of &euro;170 million surplus at the end of the year. The reality is that he is projecting a deficit this year just short of &euro;3 billion, or &euro;2.89 billion. If he is as far out on this year's figure as he was on last year's, we are staring an alarming deterioration of the public finances in the face. Unemployment figures give real and serious cause for concern. In the past three months the live register has increased by 18,000. It is not difficult to project the result if that is repeated over four quarters. It would represent a dramatic reversal of fortune in the economy and 72,000 extra unemployed. That will not happen I hope, but I do not know, any more than the Minister, when an upturn will take place, as distinct from when it is predicted in the USA and elsewhere. However, the prospect we face is of 50,000 to 60,000 people joining the live register.</P>
    <P>That is the economic legacy of the Minister for Finance. I understand why Fianna Fáil spokespersons concentrate on the good years and on the exceptional public finances we have had, but even during those years the Minister was like the farmer from Carrickmacross who headed to the bank the other day with £50,000 on the carrier of his bicycle. Unfortunately, along the way he lost £20,000 which was strewn behind him on the roads as he headed into the town. That is what champagne Charlie was like during the boom years. He scattered money far and wide for his wealthy friends at the K Club to pick up and, of course, they picked it up. Great wealth was made in the past five years and enormous wealth was conferred on some individuals as a result of deliberate and calculated decisions by the Minister for Finance. His latest frolic is his decision to disadvantage GAA players and amateur sports people generally. I find it difficult to believe the Taoiseach is party to this. The Minister has had a number of amazing frolics since he took office, but this is the daftest proposal I have ever heard. It is proposed to refund tax, back to 1990, to the highest paid sports professionals.</P>
    <P>The Minister is given to awarding taxpayers' money to the better off. He did it when he halved capital gains tax and he is doing it again for the wealthiest sports people. The thousands who play Gaelic games for no financial reward are <Col N="861" /> excluded from this proposal, as are tens of thousands involved in other amateur sports. How can Fianna Fáil and a Taoiseach who has gone out of his way to colonise the GAA sit on their hands while a measure is passed by this House that so disadvantages tens of thousands of amateur sports people? Those people bring pleasure and credit to their counties and clubs nearly every month of the year. This is an insult to the GAA and to many who dedicate so much of their lives and free time to bringing pleasure to sports fans in every county. I do not know where the idea came from. It seems to be another daft K Club frolic born in Kildare amongst the well-paid professional jockeys with whom the Minister plays golf. Tremendously successful sportsmen like Mick Kinnane do not need the taxpayers' largesse in this fashion. Our newly professional high-earning rugby professionals do not need this kind of taxpayers' handout. Indeed, the same can be said for our mega-wealthy sports stars in the area of motor rallying.</P>
    <P>There are several sensible ways in which the Minister could have come up with methods of honouring the tremendous contribution of sportspeople in society. One can compare the position of, say, the modern rugby player with that of the top-class Gaelic footballer, from whom is expected virtual professional application and standards but for whom no recompense of any kind is contemplated. Already in the capital city Gaelic games are under serious pressure and it is a factor in the current debate about the proposition to divide Dublin. Already young people are being lured into other sports which are now paying a handsome dividend. This will further drain the resources of the GAA in the capital city and elsewhere. This is a bad day for the GAA, make no mistake about it. It will further widen the cleavage between those tremendous amateur sportspeople who play Gaelic games, which are still the dominant games in this country, and those who play professional sports. I do not know where the Minister got this idea, no more than I know where he got the idea to select the cider industry to be the target of a vicious increase in excise duty.</P>
    <P>The production of cider is an indigenous industry, mainly based in Clonmel. It uses an apple crop which is an indigenous product. Rather than looking at any other area on which he might raise excise duty, the Minister for Finance went out of his way to severely punish the cider industry, with resulting implications for it as a labour intensive industry. There does not seem to be any reason for it, other than singling out a constituency which twice rejected Fianna Fáil's efforts in by-elections. In case they did not have enough of a cross to bear, Fianna Fáil has decided to inflict Dr. Martin Mansergh on the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that, Chairman, because <Col N="862" /> I wanted to say a few words about the extraordinary spectacle of the Progressive Democrats conference last week. I could not believe the speeches from some of the party's leading spokespersons returned to the past, to the mid-1980s. They argued, without a shred of evidence, that low taxes have produced the boom, the high investment and the high employment of the past five years. Nothing could be further from the truth. This boom did not happen under the stewardship of the present Government. It did not even happen under the stewardship of the previous Government. This goes back years to the original decisions on investment in education, to the corporate regime put in place and to the fact that skilled labour happened to be available at this particular juncture of the economic cycle. These are the factors which produced the boom and for any Fianna Fáil or Progressive Democrats speaker to claim that the slash and cut of high taxes has produced this economic performance is manifest nonsense and they know it. I was amused at the Fianna Fáil Deputies seeking to disown the Progressive Democrats on that particular agenda.</P>
      <P>Apart from the indicators to which I have referred, the other indicator which affects the lives of most ordinary people, though maybe not the habitués of the K Club, is the quality of our public services. Our public services, like health, housing and public transport, are left in a shambles after the most bountiful period this economy has ever seen. That is the legacy of the Minister for Finance. It is on the basis of how it has impacted on the quality of life of ordinary people that he ought to be judged. On that basis he will be judged harshly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with my colleague who is from Kilkenny, Deputy John McGuinness.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to address the House on a small but very significant inclusion in the Finance Bill regarding shipping and in particular the continuance of vessels to be registered in this country. The introduction of a tonnage tax for the shipping industry in this Bill again underlines the full commitment of this Government to the regeneration of the shipping industry and shipping services sector. Under tonnage tax a company is taxed on the tonnage of its fleet rather than on notional corporate profits. The EU Commission strongly advocates this regime for Europe's shipping sector. Tonnage tax schemes have already been successfully introduced in countries such as Britain, Holland and Germany. This major new initiative, which has received fulsome plaudits from the industry, has already paid dividends, with Arklow Shipping having registered its newest ship on the Irish register. The company has also signalled its intention to bring back to the Irish flag ships which it has registered in the Netherlands because of the beneficial tax concessions obtainable there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="863" />The tonnage tax augments a range of other fiscal measures introduced by this Government in an effort to address shortfalls in the development of the industry. The Government's approval for this unique flat rate tax linked to tonnage will act as a catalyst to regenerate the shipping industry. The industry has contracted in recent years but this new tax regime will provide it with a more attractive and enhanced fiscal environment. It will offer certainty and clarity for future investment and ensure the Irish shipping industry remains as competitive as those in other member states.</P>
    <P>This initiative augments major new policy directions for the shipping industry and on-shore shipping services sector. These include the setting up of a dedicated shipping development office, the Irish Maritime Development Office, the development of a new maritime college in Cork, the introduction of the special £5,000 seafarers' income tax allowance and full refund of employers of seafarers PRSI payments.</P>
    <P>Shipping companies will now have the choice to opt for this new form of corporation tax, based not on actual profits or losses but essentially on the size or tonnage of their ships. This greater choice, flexibility and certainty will safeguard and grow the Irish ship register. We have been assured by Irish fleet operators that they will keep their ships on the Irish register, cease flagging out and grow their businesses in Ireland. I am confident that EU state aid approval for the new shipping tax will be quickly forthcoming, as our intention in this Finance Bill is to mirror the best of similar tax regimes currently applicable in many other member states.</P>
    <P>In their statement welcoming the tonnage tax the IMDO confirmed it will protect the long-term future of the industry and help secure jobs both on-shore and at sea. Mr. Padraic White, chairman of the advisory group to the Irish Maritime Development Office, welcomed the decision and said the budget has sent a message of hope for all those who believe in Ireland's maritime potential. I agree with that assessment, and we can reasonably look forward to the day when Ireland will capture a share of the expanding international shipping industry and its technical support services and reverse the tragic decline of ships registered in and operating out of Ireland. I was at a shipping conference in Cyprus recently and discovered that almost one fifth of the global fleet is based there. That is remarkable for a country as small as that and it sends a clear signal to a maritime nation such as ours that we should be doing much better. With the tonnage tax I believe we will take steps to redress that balance. Glenn Murphy, director of the IMDO, also welcomed the budget announcement saying:</P>
    <P>The industry was on the brink of complete collapse. Many of our larger owners, such as Irish Ferries and Arklow Shipping, would have been compelled to lower the Irish flag and relocate their core business structures to another <Col N="864" /> country if the tonnage tax regime had not been announced this year.</P>
    <P>Our shipping industry and the skills of our seafarers have long been part of our success as a trading nation. Whilst still significant, the Irish shipping industry has been in steady decline, yet growth in world trade offers significant prospects for its expansion. Our stock of skilled seafarers has also been declining and their average age increasing. Successive Governments have sought through training grants and substantial tax breaks to arrest that decline, but the most that can be said for those past attempts is that they have diminished its pace. However, the Government's approval for the development of a new state-of-the-art National Maritime College at Ringaskiddy, County Cork, will address the training requirements of the sector and attract new entrants to seafaring as a career.</P>
    <P>Without a user friendly and virtually tax-exempt environment there is no real prospect of achieving the objective of Government policy, namely, the revival of the shipping industry. A tonnage-based form of corporation tax is a key strategy to achieve the required fiscal environment. With the addition of a tonnage tax I am fully confident that Ireland can successfully develop its on-shore maritime sector. We have the English language and a UK style legal system, we are in the eurozone and will shortly have Europe's most recently introduced ship registration and tonnage tax provisions, as well as a standard rate of corporation tax of 12.5 %. With the new maritime college due to come on stream in 2003, all augurs well for the future with the provision of the right fiscal environment for shipping and seafarers; a new state of the art National Maritime College; a dedicated development office for our shipping and shipping services sector, the IMDO; and a Government committed to the development of the industry.</P>
    <P>While speaking on the issue of taxation, I would like to bring to the attention of the House a matter which has been brought to my attention in recent times, namely, the status of caravan parks. I refer to the issue of the non-availability of business property relief from capital acquisitions tax to caravan park operators. This puts caravan park operators at a disadvantage compared to most other businesses. I feel that it would be timely to harmonise the existing regulations whereby the activity carried out is treated as a trade for income tax, capital gains tax, corporation tax and value added tax, while for capital acquisitions it is effectively treated as short-term lettings.</P>
    <P>I have noted in the Finance Bill that a previous inequity whereby property held personally which is used for a trade carried out by a company can now qualify for capital gains tax retirement relief. This amendment effectively synchronises with the existing position in capital acquisitions tax law whereby business property relief is available on assets held personally. I ask that consideration now be given to capital acquisitions tax legislation <Col N="865" /> so that is amended to bring it into line with all the other tax heads that apply to the activity carried out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>My problem with the Finance Bill is that this House is meant to scrutinise spending on an ongoing basis and be accountable to the public. Our hands are tied and our opportunities for getting information from various Departments, by way of parliamentary questions or the organised contribution system, are limited. Alongside the Finance Bill and other financial measures we deal with in this House, I believe there should be a greater opportunity for Members to scrutinise the spend of the organisations that we allocate money to and are directly connected with Departments such as local government, the NRA and health boards. That we have to distance these organisations from us, almost as if they might become in some way corrupt if they were any closer, is a notion I do not agree with. I would prefer to see greater scrutiny in these areas and I believe the public would also prefer that.</P>
      <P>Why should local government be at a distance from us? Why should the NRA, an organisation that spends a considerable amount of Government allocated money, be removed so far from the Oireachtas that we cannot get information from them directly? They are spending large amounts of taxpayers' money and we owe it to the people who have worked hard and paid that tax to spend the money with the same diligence and scrutiny as it took them to earn it. That is a measure that will have to be corrected in this House in the short term. That is particularly pertinent when one reflects on the Local Government Act, 2000, and the request from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government for Members to reflect on their holding a dual mandate. I do not mind giving up the dual mandate if I have a purpose and function in this House allowing me to deal with the issues of the day. Let me be honest, that is not the case. Until such time as that is the case I, and many like me, will continue to want to be at the source of information in local government, namely, membership of county councils and corporations. Maybe it is a challenge for the Cabinet to ensure that the reform to give that scrutiny and give Members greater purpose is delivered. Until that happens, I will continue to play my role as a member of a local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard about the effects of 11 September and we must reflect on what has hap<Col N="866" /> pened in the economy since then. Tourism is our greatest asset, it is a product we can market and rely on to draw huge numbers of visitors. Tourism benefits the regions and every small town and village in this State. Much more needs to be done in this area. We must market this country more effectively than is currently done. Part of that marketing is linked to the work undertaken by organisations such as Dúchas. We pride ourselves on having a considerable number of national monuments. A number of key national monuments, such as Kilkenny Castle, the Rock of Cashel and many others, are very well managed and looked after and attract large numbers of visitors. As people come to know Ireland, they want to see more than our flagship monuments. They want to visit many counties and see at first hand what is available under the auspices of Dúchas, but not yet restored.</P>
    <P>I would like that organisation to be more efficient in how it spends money and to spread it to monuments other than flagship monuments. I can think of many in my constituency, such as Kells Priory, the largest medieval monastic ruin in Europe, which is falling down. Money has been allocated to it but there is no ongoing restoration or maintenance programme for it. There is no activity within Dúchas whereby such monuments would be given as much priority as others. While I agree that the flagship monuments need to be tended to, there should be a pecking order and a spread of the money spent to ensure such heritage gems as Kells Priory are maintained.</P>
    <P>Dúchas should also examine its operational efficiency and the efficiency with which it spends money. Perhaps it is time an independent audit was conducted on the structure of the body, what is expected of it in comparison with past work, how that expectation should affect its work and how and on what it should spend money. I hope we will soon debate that issue in the House to achieve greater efficiency in the spending of the money allocated to Dúchas. This is an issue to which I will return in future debates.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority should be scrutinised in the context of local government. It spends a considerable amount of money but, despite this, we do not have contact with it and there is insufficient transparency concerning its operations and where it spends money. Policy in this regard must be laid down by the House which must examine the efficiency with which the authority spends money.</P>
    <P>A debate took place last night in the House on transport and infrastructure. Despite the vast amount of money spent on infrastructure in the past four years, local authorities still face traffic bottlenecks and traffic management issues and still have works outstanding. I cited the example of the Kilkenny ring road. We are awaiting money from the NRA to complete that road. If this priority project were completed, we would be able to manage the traffic in Kilkenny city and to expand and move on. However, we have not yet received the money. Carlow is in the same posi<Col N="867" /> tion; it is choked by traffic. Vast amounts of money have been invested by the Government, yet we do not see the positive effects such investment should have in our counties and localities. This is because there is growth in the economy and an urgent demand for this type of infrastructure but the speed of delivery is not sufficient. The projects which have been on the books for some time and are in need of completion should be prioritised. We, as public representatives in this House, should have some input into how those projects are prioritised and how the policies of Government in this regard are delivered.</P>
    <P>This is but one issue I have with the NRA. There are others, for example, the completion of the Piltown-Fiddown bypass on which a huge amount of money was spent. Members of the local authority asked for greater safety measures to be included on that stretch of road and voted unanimously for it. Despite this, they were told it was an NRA function. As a national public representative, I raised the issue and was told I did not have any role in it either, that it was an NRA function. Who has a role in laying down policies? People expect us as public representatives to do our job and to have some input in this regard, yet we do not. We are held at arm's length as if we are a danger to the system, as if there should not be any contact with us. That is not good enough and I would like to see it changed so that we can at least begin to lobby the Minister who may, in turn, have some scope to address, for example, the concerns of the local community in the case of the Piltown-Fiddown bypass.</P>
    <P>Most of the replies one receives from Ministers in matters such as this, regardless of what Government is in power, state that it is not the business of the Minister but of the relevant organisation. The public who elect us hold us responsible. They have asked us to act on their behalf as their public representatives. However, to a degree, we are spancelled and cannot do our job properly because someone else is doing it for us. The sooner we in this House change that, the better.</P>
    <P>I have raised the issue of information technology during debates in the House. We have heard arguments about compensating people for losses incurred as a result of the Eircom flotation. It is about time that company got real. It is falling far behind in terms of information and communications technology requirements and the economy of the country will also fall behind as a result. Internet access is a huge cost to individuals and families who use it and is now also a tool for schools and businesses. It is costing jobs, the future of the country and our place in the development of a new Europe and a new world market. Nothing is being done about this. The infrastructure has been put in place in parts of the country, the cable has been laid, but it is still not operational. I have suggested to the Minister for Finance that he should perhaps tax those who have laid cable, some with the aid of grants from <Col N="868" /> the European Union, and have not yet made it operational. If it is of benefit to the economy, it should be in use. If it is not, the company concerned should be taxed in the same manner as the owner of a derelict building would be taxed.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister ensure there is engagement with service providers to ensure the costs of Internet access are reduced for individuals and people in business? Many people conducting business over the Internet pay a huge cost for it. Projects such as Young Irish Filmmakers or those involved in film production and animation suffer because the technology is not in use. If we were to bring ourselves to the cutting edge of developments in the area of technology, film production and animation, we would assist in the creation of jobs and, by presenting through technology a new form of film animation to the marketplace, create a profile for the country which would tell the rest of Europe that we are skilled and creative nation. Young skilled people are suffering because we are not doing our job in forcing companies such as Eircom and others to ensure they make the appropriate changes in the marketplace to allow us to capitalise on what is happening elsewhere in the world. This is another issue which must be taken up by the Government if we are to succeed into the future in this economy.</P>
    <P>We have all stated cases about the health services. The problem is similar to that concerning the delivery of infrastructure to county road level. I have seen huge increases in investment in roads in Kilkenny County Council and Borough Council, yet the effect of that investment is not seen on every road throughout the county. The delivery is too slow, despite the vast amounts of money involved. The same can be said of the health services. I have had many arguments with the health board and the Minister for Health and Children about the delivery of health services in the south-east. I have gone out on a limb on many of the issues. Despite the vast amount of money spent on Kilkenny and Waterford Regional Hospital, much more needs to be done. I continue to impress this on the Minster for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>Property purchased by the Department of Finance in Myshall, County Carlow, is still lying idle. I am told by the Eastern Health Board that the board has advertised for a project manager to undertake an analysis of the situation. How far has bureaucracy gone? How much money do we spend on consultants' reports and analyses to no real effect? The property in Myshall is vacant while people with autism continue to suffer. Representatives of sufferers from autism know what needs to be done and the population analysis in the south east has shown, in general, what needs to be done. Nevertheless, we are tying ourselves up in the knots of further reports from a consultant and a project manager. This is not good enough. We must take immediate action to stop this way of doing things. We have invested in a property <Col N="869" /> and we should know why we invested in it. We should proceed to delivering the much needed autism services in the south east region. It is farcical to proceed with further reports and analyses. I appeal to the Minister of State to tell the Department of Health and Children to get moving on this issue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to take note of what is happening in the rest of the world. If the Italians are confronting their problem head on, we need to do something about ours. We should examine best practice throughout the European Union and consider <Col N="870" /> licensing some of the monuments which have not been fully restored and investing in them. This would attract visitors to places throughout the country and not merely to the main urban centres and it would show the whole of Ireland to the growing number of tourists who enjoy our quality of life.</P>
    <P>We must examine best practice in other European countries in all areas including health, education and tourism. We must be innovative in all areas for the betterment of our economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>With the approval of the House I propose to share my time with Deputy Seamus Healy.</P>
      <P>It is clear the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has been guilty of monstrous incompetence while in charge of the nation's finances since 1997. The figures speak for themselves. In 1997 the figure for net current spending was just over &euro;13 billion. The Fianna Fáil target in its election manifesto &ndash; that infamous document &ndash; and in the programme for government was for a growth in annual net current expenditure of 4%. If that target had been met net expenditure for 2002 would have been just under &euro;16 billion. Instead the estimated figure for this year is almost &euro;17 billion. Net current spending has more than doubled in the five years of this Government. If the Fianna Fáil target had been met the increase in current spending in the five years of this Government, even allowing for compounding, would have been less than 22%. The actual increase was almost five times higher than the target at 104%.</P>
      <P>One might say these are just figures. However, net current spending has more than doubled in the past five years and what have we to show for it? Such squandering of a nation's wealth must surely qualify for a gold medal for incompetence, particularly when there is nothing to show for such appalling extravagance. There is no provision in the 2002 Estimate for the health strategy, which remains a wish list. While hospital waiting lists get longer unfortunate people earning &euro;136 per week cannot get a medical card and must pay &euro;35 to &euro;40 &ndash; one third of their weekly income &ndash; for a visit to the doctor. Housing lists lengthen and more than 850 schools cannot get approval for building projects.</P>
      <P>Never has so little been achieved at so much cost. No one can explain where all the money has gone. We are now presented with Enron type accounting to provide a facade of credibility to the nation's figures for the current year when the Government is going out of office leaving the finances in a virtually bankrupt state.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures for this year to date confirm my view and as the year goes on it will be further confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall my early days in the Dáil when the <Col N="871" /> Fianna Fáil Government elected in 1977 increased borrowing fourfold, from £3,600 million in 1976 to £12,000 million in 1982. During all my time in politics the country has had the millstone of the monstrous borrowing splurge of the era of Mr. Jack Lynch and Mr. Martin O'Donoghue around its neck. One voice in Fianna Fáil called for fiscal rectitude and that was the voice of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. Nevertheless in the past five years he has destroyed his image as someone who was competent to care for the country's finances. We have had profligacy on a level of the 1977-82 era from the Minister. There has been spending at a pace which is almost five times the target with nothing to show for it. The claims, demands and just requirements of the weaker sections of the community have been ignored. That is the legacy of this Government and, in particular, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    <P>The most newsworthy item in the Finance Bill was the sportsmen's bonanza. It is fair to say the actual cost proposed is not enormous. This makes me suspect that it was a diversionary tactic by the Minister to try to get people to take their eye off the overall picture of the appalling mess of the Government finances. It is important not to divert our attention away from that mess.</P>
    <P>I will make a couple of comments on the tax relief for sports persons. In one sense it is a continuation of the elitist approach of the Government whereby ordinary people do not count. Ordinary people will not qualify for this relief. The same applies to the £1 billion proposed for the &ldquo;Bertie bowl&rdquo;. Again, ordinary people did not count. It is the same kind of thinking. I will not say that because someone is allowed tax relief I want to claw it back from them straight away. I do not see any merit in that. There are situations where one could possibly argue in favour of the proposal. It might attract some support from me if the Munster team can attract Keith Wood back to play for them.</P>
    <P>Let us consider this proposal as presented by the Minister. He wants to encourage world class Irish sports people to reside in Ireland and he gives a list of the various sports which will benefit. The first one is athletics. The most famous athlete I know is Sonia O'Sullivan. I do not wish to go into anyone's personal situation, but taking her as an international figure, do we have the facilities to allow her to be resident here? We do not have international competition or sporting facilities. All this has been ignored in this top-of-the-head proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy rejected it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not tell me the &ldquo;Bertie bowl&rdquo; will allow Sonia O'Sullivan to be resident here. Let me remind the Minister of State that she comes from Cork, many miles from the &ldquo;Bertie bowl&rdquo;. The point is that if there was a genuine overall effort in relation to sports people <Col N="872" /> it should be thought through rather than this top-of-the-head, back-of-the-envelope approach. The other main criticism is that there is nothing in it for ordinary people, and I stand for ordinary people. I would be delighted if the facilities were available for Sonia O'Sullivan. However, whatever we do must be focused on ordinary people. This proposal means nothing to ordinary men or women involved in sport because most of them are amateurs.</P>
      <P>There is one issue to which the Minister might turn his attention. Given the demands nowadays on football players, county teams and so on, there is a tendency to, at least, pay some expenses to those involved. Some people may say expenses are not taxable. Will the Minister check that more carefully? First, there can be a little blurring of the line on expenses. I gather referees are already under pressure in this regard because they are being questioned about whether amounts paid are expenses or otherwise. It is already happening. Back in my student days, one could say an inspector could claim such expenses are not payable free of tax because they are not wholly, necessarily and exclusively incurred in the performance of their trade, profession or vocation. This is a grey area and I would like the Minister to do something for ordinary people involved in sport. That is my main criticism of the proposal.</P>
      <P>I will refer to two aspects which have not been touched on so far in any great detail. I am concerned about the whole area of renewable energy and the fact that the Minister has done nothing in the Bill to promote renewable energy. This matters because it is one of the most serious issues confronting the country. We are currently involved in a tug-of-war between the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister for Finance where each is passing the ball to the other. The crisis which confronts us in this area is not being faced; the ball is being dropped. I am not sure whether it is understood that this is the most energy import dependent economy in Europe. We import 86% of our energy needs.</P>
      <P>There is a need for tax relief for individuals, similar to the BES schemes, to invest in renewable energy generation. Unless we confront this problem the situation will get worse and worse. Compliments of this Government, we are now the second highest polluter in Europe in terms of CO2 emissions per person. We are supposed to meet our Kyoto obligations for greenhouse gas emissions. We have committed ourselves to the Kyoto protocol but we are moving further and further away from the target. The other side of the coin is that we have the best green energy resources in the world. However, because of the capital cost involved in harnessing them we are not availing of that. There is a disagreement between the Departments of Public Enterprise and the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Public Enterprise talks about its schemes but, essentially, it is not paying enough for green energy. The most recent scheme was over-subscribed. None of the earlier AER <Col N="873" /> schemes have been put on the ground to the extent of more than 25% or 30%. In regard to the recent scheme which was over-subscribed, the Department of Public Enterprise allowed for 3.79 pence per kwh. I guarantee this will be over-subscribed and there will not be 25% of it on the ground. One needs investment and the way to get this is to encourage it from individuals in a BES type scheme. One may say there could be corporate investment but, paradoxically, the lower the rate of corporate tax the less attractive it becomes for corporate investors. As the rate of corporate tax is now down to 12.5% it becomes entirely ineffective as an investment inducement. That is the one plea I would make if we are interested in what will be one of the most difficult problems facing the country in the years ahead. There is an opportunity to amend the Act and extend tax relief to individuals on a BES type basis.</P>
    <P>The other point which needs to be dealt with on Committee Stage is the company share options scheme. A scheme was introduced last year which apparently dealt with the problem. The problem in regard to share option schemes is that shares acquired as a result of employee share option schemes were in the past chargeable to income tax and partly to capital gains tax. It was thought that since those shares were more in the nature of a capital receipt any profits should be chargeable to capital gains tax only. This proposal was introduced to attract people in the international markets to work here because we needed them. We needed to provide the same incentives as apply in other countries. A scheme was introduced last year but, with all due respect to the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, it was a botched one and has not worked. I tabled a question to him recently to find out the outcome of the famous scheme he introduced last year.</P>
    <P>Since 2001, there have been 71 applications for schemes under the 2001 Act. Only seven of them got through the Revenue Commissioners, less than 10%. Again, that issue was drawn to the attention of the Minister for Finance and, again, he ignored it. If the Minister genuinely wants to do something constructive, that is the type of issue he should tackle. With regard to both areas, will the Minister produce the necessary amendments on Committee Stage along the lines I mentioned? I would also like him to introduce amendments to cater for the ordinary person involved in sport, although I have few expectations in that regard.</P>
    <P>This is the last Finance Bill to be introduced by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. He has completed his five years in office, which were highlighted by monstrous incompetence in terms of public expenditure. I am not the only one saying this and it is time that message got through. The Government and the Minister in particular have left such a legacy that it will be a relief for the country when there is a change of Government and another Minister for Finance takes over the reins of office to ensure some order in our public finances in the years ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has squandered the fruits of the Celtic tiger over the past five years. We have had five budgets and each in turn has discriminated against those on low pay and people who are generally poor. The Celtic tiger economy has been a huge bonanza for the wealthy. The most recent example is the special tax incentive for very wealthy sports people.</P>
      <P>The budgets increased the gap between the rich and poor on each occasion. Now, unfortunately, we have a much more divided society than we ever had in the past. Obviously, the Minister believes the small man or woman does not count. Unfortunately, many areas around the country do not count either unless there is a Minister in the constituency. This means in my constituency, for example, that two of our towns have been classified among the four most deprived towns in the country &ndash; Tipperary town and Carrick-on-Suir. It means the Minister has reneged on his promise in budget 2000 to decentralise Government Departments. It means that 500 jobs in an indigenous industry are at risk in the south east, mainly Clonmel, because of the huge hike in duty on cider.</P>
      <P>It means that the bypassing of Cashel, a town that is choked by traffic every minute of every day, is held up. It means that the major hospital project in Cashel is held up and that thousands of elderly people in our private nursing homes are denied their legal entitlement to free in-patient care in those homes. It means that 850 schools, many of them in my constituency, are awaiting improvements and extensions. Many of them have been held up continually and deliberately by the Department and the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister announced in one of his earlier budgets that decentralisation would take place. Various Fianna Fáil members, Deputies, Ministers of State and Ministers have announced decentralisation in many constituencies over the past five years. It is whispered that it is coming, but it has not arrived. It was promised for south Tipperary &ndash; it was announced in the by-election of 2000 by the then candidate, Barry O'Brien. In September 2000, the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, announced that there would be decentralisation before Christmas of that year. It was announced in the by-election of 2001 by the Fianna Fáil candidate, Councillor Michael McGuire and the Minister for Defence announced on local radio on 6 December last year that south Tipperary would benefit from decentralisation. However, it has not happened. South Tipperary is the only part of a county in Munster without decentralisation. On the basis of what was proposed in that particular budget, we would be entitled to something like 750 decentralised jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need those jobs because, as I said, the towns of Tipperary and Carrick-on-Suir are among the four most deprived towns in the country. That was indicated in the past ten days in the report from ADM on the RAPID scheme. It was <Col N="875" /> also reported a number of years ago by the small area research unit in Trinity College. Tipperary has something like three times the national average of jobless. It has lost considerable numbers of jobs over the years. It has no advance factory or decentralisation. Only 6% of students who finish their education in Tipperary town stay in Tipperary or return there to live; some 94% emigrate and never come back.</P>
    <P>My next point would be funny if it was not so sad. There is a new Fianna Fáil candidate in Tipperary, Dr. Martin Mansergh, who has apparently espoused decentralisation and advance factories for Tipperary town. Dr. Mansergh is the same Dr. Mansergh who is currently an adviser to the Taoiseach and was previously an adviser to former Taoisigh, Deputy Albert Reynolds, and Charles Haughey. He was associated with the Fianna Fáil Government which closed St. Vincent's Hospital in Tipperary town. I do not believe we will get very much from him either.</P>
    <P>Carrick-on-Suir is among the four most deprived towns in Ireland. Again, it has not benefited from decentralisation or an advance factory. In October 2001, the members of Carrick-on-Suir Urban District Council met the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to discuss job creation. They did not even get an indication that there would be any support for further job creation in Carrick-on-Suir. In a period when there is supposed to be a Celtic tiger economy, the jobless figures in Carrick-on-Suir have increased from 867 people in January 2001 to 970 people in January 2002, an increase of 103 people or 11% in a town of 5,500 people. That is the extent of the neglect and the abandonment of that town by the Government. Will the Minister put his money where his mouth is, amend this Bill and include decentralisation for south Tipperary, as he promised he would do a number of budgets ago? He could also designate areas in south Tipperary for special incentives for industrial development, something that was done in other areas a number of budgets ago as well.</P>
    <P>Another question that arose after the last budget and regarding the Finance Bill concerns the sabotage &ndash; that is the only word I can use &ndash; of jobs in the cider industry in south Tipperary, mainly in Clonmel. This is an indigenous industry going back to the 1930s in Clonmel. It has invested about £40 million in expansion in recent years and significant numbers of local farmers are growing apples for it. Unfortunately, the huge increase in the duty on cider announced in the budget in December has put 500 jobs at risk in that very labour-intensive industry.</P>
    <P>The duty on cider is now completely out of line with that in most other European countries that recognise it is a very labour intensive industry and, therefore, have either low duty or no duty. The company in question had proposed to have a flotation this year, but has now lost its good news story and its employees may well lose the <Col N="876" /> deal they had negotiated under the employee share option scheme. If the Minister had any heart, he would withdraw the huge increase he imposed. If this increase had to happen, the company would have been prepared to accept it over a number of years. However, that is not the case. I appeal to the Minister at the eleventh hour to withdraw the huge duty increase on cider.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains something that on first sight appears to be a welcome provision to allow the cost of private nursing home care for elderly people to be a tax deductible expense. However, elderly people are already legally entitled to free in-patient care in private nursing homes. There have been two reports from the Ombudsman, one late last year and the other in January 2001. In that report the Ombudsman said:</P>
    <P>The legal position in relation to hospital in-patient services both in 1990 and at present was and is relatively straightforward. Everybody resident in the State is eligible to be provided with in-patient services, where necessary, by the relevant health board. The service may be provided directly by the health board in one of its own hospitals, or in another publicly funded hospital, or by way of a contracting out arrangement between the health board and a private institution.</P>
    <P>The introduction of tax deductible fees appears to be the start of the road to eliminating the legal entitlement of elderly people to free nursing home care. Very many elderly people or their children will need to find at least £150 per week for the cheapest nursing homes. Worse still, those elderly people are being pressurised to sell their homes to fund nursing home care because the health boards are deducting from their subventions a notional rental income. That is absolutely disgraceful. These are people who have given years to the State and now find that at the end of their days their children must pay for them in private nursing homes and are under pressure to sell their homes to fund it because of the health boards and the regulations governed by the Department of Health and Children regarding a notional rental income. The law relating to this must be implemented. I fear that this section of the Bill is the slippery slope and the Government intends to withdraw the legal entitlement of elderly people to free nursing home care rather than doing what the Ombudsman recommended.</P>
    <P>What effect have the Minister's various budgets had on our schools? Some 850 projects around the country are being held up, some of them for years. In my constituency the following are affected: Mullinahone, Ballyclerihan, Gealscoil Chluain Meala, Newcastle, Mount Bruis, Ballytarsna, Annacarty and there are more. They are all held up because the Minister for Education and Science has refused to allow them to move on to the next stage of their projects.</P>

      <P>I wish to share ten minutes of my time with Deputy Crawford.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill, 2002. Earlier, I listened to the Minister for Finance who went to great lengths to praise himself and the Government for all the great things they had done in the past five years. Because of the strength of the economy it is true that things were done in the past four or five years that could not even have been dreamt of in any other period of our history. However, the acid test at the next general election for the Government is whether the people believe the resources available were properly handled.</P>
      <P>What happened our economy was like what could happen in any ordinary family. Out of the blue four or five years ago a family in receipt of £200 in old money suddenly managed to get its income up to £1,000 per week. People not used to having this amount of money could do many things. That did not necessarily mean it was always put to the best use. There has been considerable mishandling of money by the Government in the past five years. I will outline some of the things that will not only come back to haunt Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, but will also cause significant problems for many in the next three or four years.</P>
      <P>The national development plan was to be the be all of everything. All the so-called planning strategists were involved. Everybody who could be called a consultant was involved and did well out of it financially. It was a boom time to be a consultant or an adviser. Some of the advice given by them and taken by the Government will prove to be foolhardy. There were grandiose plans for roads. Nobody would deny that we should have a great road infrastructure, but the deadline of 2006 for the end of the programme will not be met. I believe it will be 2010 or 2012. There will be a huge slow-down on two aspects of the projects. First, the plan does not reflect the costs which are escalating. Something that cost £300 million last year will certainly cost £400 million next year; it may be the cost even now. Second, now that the economy is beginning to slow down, the type of money that was supposed to be available to meet the targets set will be stretched. Many of the roads that were to be built in various parts of the country will not be built for a long time.</P>

    <P>I said during the budget debate that there was a sleight of hand in that the way the budget was balanced left much to be desired. There was much more pressure on the Exchequer at that time than the Minister said there was.

Not alone are they not able to find out whether they can plan for a new school, but they have been unable to discuss their position with the Minister, Deputy Woods, because he refuses to meet them. If he had good news for them, I am sure he would meet them. The idea is to defer the project until May. That is what is happening. The Minister of State must know that as well as I do.</P>

Their boards of management, teachers and parents are asking why, if money was so flaithiúlach in the past five years, they did not get a taste of it. The response to every parliamentary question I tabled to the Minister on this matter is that the process is at a particular stage and the matter is being examined. Having regard to all the meetings of the boards of management currently taking place, the Government has a good deal of answering to do on this matter. Where did the money allocated for these projects go? Where did the money allocated for the roads go? We are being told that this work will be done, but it has not been done.</P>

      <P>It is usually a woman who gives up her job to look after an elderly person. Irrespective of income, it is unacceptable for some carers to be told on foot of the assessment of their application for the carer's allowance that they do not qualify, given that they provide care 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. If the person being cared for were admitted to one of the health board's geriatric hospitals, it would cost £700 per week to keep him or her. The Government could not see fit to give any help to such carers. If the Government has so much money to talk about that the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is on television ten times every day telling us about it, why does someone in his Department not do something to provide for carers? It is disastrous in this day and age that carers have to do that work every day of their lives. This does not have anything to do with money; it has to do with the care of the elderly, 24 hours a day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see the flag Fianna Fáil would fly for its provision for the mentally handicapped. I would be the first to admit that down through the years, irrespective of which party was in government, sufficient money was not committed to that group. One would imagine in good times that a substantial increase would be given to these people, particularly in respect of respite care. The work of many parents of children with special needs is similar in some respects to that of those who care for the elderly. Who else would do this work which parents and carers do not mind <Col N="880" /> doing. To get one, two or three nights of respite care, parents of children with special needs in Ballinasloe must go on a list for two or three months. That is how bad the service is. In a country bursting at the seams with money, until recently at least, why should that have been allowed to happen? </P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was bound to pull a rabbit out of the hat before the year was over. Under section 12, the Minister decided that because of the entertainment and enjoyment sports men and women have given thousands of our people throughout their sporting lives, they should be entitled to a tax deduction. There is nothing wrong with that. Nobody is more involved in sport than the Minister of State present. GAA players have played their hearts out day in and day out for years, but very few of them have won an all-Ireland and most of them have not got to play in Croke Park. They will view this measure as a creation of a division in sport. The Minister will be interpreted as saying to some sports people that they are good because he likes what they do and, therefore, he will give them a tax deduction while he tells others that what they do is not important. Many GAA clubs in rural Ireland will ask why they were not included. What is proposed in that section is very divisive and I am surprised that the Minister was not able to strike a balance. Irrespective of what discipline an athlete is in, he or she must be single-minded, devote a great deal of time to training and do without many of the things young people want. Such single-mindedness is not confined to one type of sport. The people who participate in an all-Ireland final spend a lifetime in training and are dedicated and disciplined because that is the way sport has gone. The Minister has, however, decided they are lesser beings than other sports people. There will be a great deal of talk about this measure before the election is held.</P>
    <P>If what I hear about this is correct, the original proposals to fund village renewal schemes are either being diminished or abolished because the proposals are considered anti-competitive by the EU.</P>
    <P>One of the schemes introduced by this Government, which I considered to be extremely useful, was the rural renewal scheme in the Shannon basin. That scheme helped many eligible towns. It was introduced on a pilot basis some years ago and everybody now understands the advantages and disadvantages. The evaluations have been carried out. Why did other towns in the west or other places that are deemed to be remote not get a chance to participate? That is a huge issue with many town development associations and chambers of commerce. No town in County Galway benefited even though part of north Galway is losing more of its population than any other place in the west according to the last census. Why did that area not benefit? If the scheme has been so successful why did the Government, <Col N="881" /> given all the money available to it, not extend it in the budget? There was no talk about that.</P>
    <P>No party made as much effort to secure special status for the BMW region as Fine Gael. I spent years arguing the case for it. It eventually secured that status and the Government made a great fuss about having delivered it. However, it attached a footnote, which is the important aspect. Laudable as the scheme was, the Government decided that 50% of all foreign direct investment coming through the IDA would come to the BMW region. Sadly, I was gullible enough to believe that would happen. Not only did it not happen but it will not happen. The independent commission for the west, established a few years ago by the House following six months of debate, produced a damning report a couple of months ago. It stated that the gap between the regions in the country was widening rather than narrowing. That is nothing to what will happen as a result of the job losses on the east coast, losses that are happening as we speak. Members can rest assured that the first IDA backed industries this Government will have anything to do with will be put on the east coast. That is where the huge numbers of people live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government could not nail its colours to the mast.</P>
      <P>I applaud the Minister for providing a tax relief on milk quota purchased after 1 April 2000. It is a reasonable encouragement for people buying milk quota, particularly since they are generally the progressive and young farmers. However, there is one glaring omission. If that can be done for dairy farmers, why not for the people doing their best in the suckler cow and weanling sector? They get no help if they have to buy a suckler cow quota. I cannot understand why people who buy a milk quota should get a tax concession while people who buy a sucker cow quota cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suckler cow quota has increased from approximately £300 last year to approximately £550 this year. The soaring price means that most of the young farmers I encounter every day cannot afford it. There has also been a tax deduction available for many years on farm buildings. Why can that not be extended to suckler cow producers? There is no reason for not doing it. From <Col N="882" /> an administrative point of view there is no problem &ndash; everybody knows who has quota, who is selling it, who will get it and who is entitled to it. Against that background, this is a major omission in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I mentioned medical cards earlier. I agree with the decision to give medical cards to people over 70 years of age. Anybody who has given that length of service to the State deserves what is going and I will not argue with that decision. It should have been done long ago. However, it is difficult to equate that with nothing being done for young mothers with children under five or six years of age who are visiting the doctor regularly. Not a day passes but I see these mothers going to the doctor. If they or their husbands or partners are working, they do not qualify for a medical card. A simple visit to the doctor costs &euro;35. After visiting the chemist, one is lucky to come out of it at &euro;50 euro. In old money, the combined cost is approximately £50. I am not exaggerating the figures; that is the usual cost. What about the family with three or four children? The families I have in mind do not, thankfully, have severe illnesses. They are just the little complaints children regularly contract but parents have no alternative but to bring them to the doctor.</P>
    <P>There are huge injustices in this Finance Bill. When the Government Deputies start knocking on the doors next May, many people will ask them why they did not do a better job with the resources when they had them.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for sharing his time with me. Members would have liked to speak on the Bill for 30 minutes but that is not possible due to the guillotine.</P>
      <P>This Finance Bill offers little hope to the many groups of people who have been dealt a severe blow by five years of the best economic growth this country has experienced. I wish to make a number of comments on agriculture. I welcome the tax relief for those affected by animal disease. However, there is an anomaly. Many people could not buy cattle last spring because of foot and mouth disease. Although there was no disease on their farms, they will pay tax on destocking. The destocking was not meant to happen because the stock was due to be replaced. In other words, people sold cattle before the foot and mouth crisis arose and intended to replace the cattle in the early spring, within the tax year, but could not do it. That group should be looked after in this Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Connaughton, I welcome the tax relief for milk quota. Many farmers were forced out of the milk sector and into the suckler cow sector. Many had to buy quotas at extremely high prices and tax relief should be equally available to them. The other issue affecting farmers and all small industries, especially those with low profits, is <Col N="883" /> insurance charges. I received a telephone call from a small business operator today who told me his insurance costs had increased threefold. There is nothing in the Finance Bill to alleviate that problem. Small business operators will be forced out of business if the insurance situation cannot be rectified. The Government must set up structures to ensure people will remain in employment. It is easier to do that than to put them on social welfare. For the first time in the past four and a half years, I agree with the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil yesterday, the Taoiseach condemned the Opposition for raising issues relating to abortion. I agree when he said there were many other important issues needing to be dealt with. I think of health, housing, education, agriculture and others that he has failed to deal with while in Government. The Tánaiste correctly said in her address to her national conference that things had improved over the past four and a half years but that we still had a Third World infrastructure. We have only fours years of European funding left and it is an extremely serious admission that, after almost five years in Government, she is handing over a Third World infrastructure. That is very clear in Cavan and Monaghan, where nothing has happened on the M2, which leads from Dublin to Derry, the country's fourth largest city. There is nothing being done on the east-west roads either, such as that from Dundalk to Sligo. Neither that road nor the Galway to Belfast road is even in the national development plan. That is some peace dividend.</P>
    <P>I remember being in the House the night the IRA ceasefire was announced. I welcomed it and approached the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, to ask that he reopen the Border roads. He pledged £430,000, which does not seem much now but was significant then. Since then, even when my own party was in Government, not much has been done to deliver a peace dividend despite the Good Friday Agreement. The only major cross-Border body to be established was located absurdly in Cork. Was that because it is easier to fly there than to travel by car in the Border area?</P>
    <P>We have no gas supply nor broadband communications in Monaghan. If we are to improve the Border area, which suffered so much for more than 30 years, we must get commitment. I am delighted an industry was found for Carrickmacross and congratulate the IDA, local politicians, and the Jones family who will create more than 100 jobs there with American backing. However, in Monaghan town, we lost Patten's Mill, Monaghan Poultry Products, St. Patrick's College and a swimming pool. I hope Deputy McDaid, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, is there today to announce funding for the pool. If not, there are questions to be answered.</P>
    <P>Many things in the north Monaghan area do not do credit to the Government. Deputy Ó Cao<Col N="884" /> láin previously claimed at various breakfast meetings in America that, when elected, he would solve all the problems. What has he solved? Not only have the national roads suffered, but, while funds have increased for regional and county roads, the dramatic cost increases mean that in the Clones electoral district, for example, there will be only 12 roads restructured this year, compared to 20 in 1996. There should be more money and a genuine increase in funding for local improvement schemes in this region.</P>
    <P>I could, if I had time, discuss the educational problems. We have no third level institution in County Monaghan. There should be cross-Border co-operation and we should have bought St. Patrick's. Likewise the health issue is one that I could speak on, as I have done many times before. The problems at Monaghan General Hospital are well known at local and national level. Housing is another issue I could discuss.</P>
    <P>However, I will return to the swimming pool which is relevant to this Bill. Many are delighted with the Minister's surprise announcement regarding sports people's tax relief. That affects a small number and makes it hard for me to tell people living in urban housing schemes and rural areas that the Minister for Finance could find &euro;5 million, by his own estimation, for sports people but no funds to provide a swimming pool in Monaghan.</P>
    <P>We must stick to the facts. The so-called Bertie bowl was a disaster. We were accused at the time of being spoilsports but independent study now shows that what was planned could not be justified. What can be justified is that the people of Monaghan town have a swimming pool. Extremely talented youngsters there must pay to go to Northern Ireland or Cavan to train for swimming.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance for recognising in the dying days of this Government that the low paid need tax breaks. Deputy Noonan, when our spokesman on finance, was laughed at three years ago when he said that the money could be spread more evenly. Now the Government admits that the low paid deserve a tax break. Yet it will sound hollow when it goes to the country as the last time it gave to those at the top. The people at the bottom will remember this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The newest idea in this Bill, to refund people in sport, is the most daft ever thought of. I spent much of my time in a voluntary capacity, and appreciated the contribution and work of so <Col N="885" /> many people, in amateur sports such as Gaelic football, hurling and athletics. It is an outrageous insult to them that certain high-powered people are being picked out. This shows the same attitude which decided the &ldquo;Bertie bowl&rdquo; would be built for top class athletes to use on the few occasions during the year one might get a reasonable crowd. The same attitude holds that those at the grass roots who give the service do not matter any more. The Government is caught up in this dangerous philosophy &ndash; Deputy Michael D. Higgins said the same today about the Government's attitude.</P>
    <P>A Government should have some philosophy but this Government's philosophy seems to be that those who are at the top or important are to be looked after while the others are ignored. Amateurs who play alongside professionals must feel very inferior. The Minister for Finance came up with the idea that if the GAA went professional it would get the same benefits. Anyone in touch with reality or who knows about the expense of running hurling and football clubs &ndash; hurling in particular &ndash; is aware that if one had professional players there would not be a hope in hell of keeping any club going. Money must come from somewhere, even if it is just to replace broken hurleys, which is a liability for many clubs. I fail to see any value in this provision.</P>

        <b>: </b>I will get to that in a minute.</P>
      <P>I can speak with a little authority and modesty on this. I was able to afford the luxury of a Morris Minor Deluxe &ndash; it was a deluxe model because one had the option of getting one with a heater or without and for all kinds of reasons at that time in my life I thought a heater would be important. I packed that car with young lads and brought them all over the place for football, hurling and athletics. I received a Setanta award for outstanding work with the youth of Carlow and I am delighted that award is still being given out as it means people are still doing the same work at that level with young people. Many teachers find that people who were not at the top academically might be talented at sport and that should be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I told the Minister for Education and Science last year that he would rue the day he docked teachers for not doing voluntary work and now the chickens have come home to roost. We now <Col N="886" /> have a situation where he is offering them money to do work that was done voluntarily in the past and they are turning it down. If the Government fails to see the importance of volunteers in the country then we are going down a slippery slope and we will never recover. One cannot pay people to do work that has been done by voluntary workers over the years. That is true of all aspects of life.</P>
    <P>The philosophy of the Government is to ignore all that. The Minister for Education and Science blew the whole thing out of the water for teachers in a moment of madness. I say that not because I was a teacher but because teachers do much voluntary work that is beyond the call of duty and which is not appreciated. The Minister in charge of them does not appreciate that and does not understand that one cannot dock people money for not doing voluntary work as they are not paid for it.</P>
    <P>This is similar to the provision for sportspeople. One is ignoring the amateurs. Look at what the GAA has done for this country, keeping it sane in times of crisis. People's parish and county loyalties helped them to get over unemployment, financial strain and emigration. It kept them going and that was thanks to people who gained nothing from it except the pleasure of helping others.</P>

It is fine for a hurler to get a belt on the hand on Sunday and have to go to work on Monday. He carries on earning his living and paying tax while the professional footballer can relax on Monday morning and have a physiotherapist ease the pains in his limbs. The amateur does not want pay but does not want to be insulted either and that is what is happening. The contribution of amateurs has been belittled beyond belief at this stage; I cannot get over it. I do not know who came up with this idea: I said it was daft at the beginning and it still is. It is insulting to every voluntary organisation and amateur in sport. For example, a jockey can get this refund. What about the horse trainer and the stable lads who produce the horse for the jockey to win races? How do they feel? What about a hurler or footballer who employs people and who must go to work on Monday even if he is injured? Business must go on but there is no recognition for him.</P>

We came up with the proposal that Eircom shareholders, who were conned into buying shares by £74 million worth of propaganda, should be given the same facility as those who can afford to buy several shares and write their tax off against losses. The wonderful PR machine of the Government, which is costing us a small fortune, was able to belittle this scheme and say it was outrageous that the ordinary taxpayer should pay this. All we asked for was a level playing field. Some Oireachtas Members who are financial journalists know this scheme exists and have used it and have never objected to it. Why should ordinary shareholders not avail of the tax credit for his or her losses? Why is it reserved for the rich? Is it the &ldquo;Bertie bowl&rdquo; or professional syndrome again? The wealthy are fine but the ordinary poor devil who lost money cannot write it off against tax because it would be dreadful to impose a tax on non-shareholders. However, the ordinary taxpayer can support the sports people.</P>

        <b>: </b>We are looking for a just society, where the same rules apply to the rich man as to the poor man. If one can afford to buy successful shares and Eircom shares one can write off one's losses against tax. That is the law as it stands. All we are saying is that the poor investors who were conned and inveigled into buying Eircom shares should be able to use the same mechanism if they made a loss and write it off against their taxes. The Exchequer loses in both cases. There is no justification for the outcry &ndash; the phone calls to local radio and newspapers is all propaganda. I have made several attempts to contradict the repeated propaganda but it cannot be done. One newspaper editor nearly had a fit because I suggested, tongue in cheek, that his journalist should carry a health warning because of his political views. He thought it was outrageous. It is amazing how sensitive journalists are. We are sitting ducks for them, but they can say what they like and they will not give us the right of reply.

Some widows faced the danger of losing their houses. In a newspaper article last week a journalist wrote an article in which he said the election gimmick by Deputy Jim Mitchell was outrageous. However, he then decided to write approximately 250 words about the efforts of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, to help taxi people. A propaganda war is being waged by spin doctors and people who have left RTE and journalism to join the Fianna Fáil press office. It is writing statements for Deputies around the country. One reads the same statement in each constituency. The propaganda war is difficult to combat, particularly when one does not get the right of reply. If it is an election gimmick for Fine Gael to propose help for widows of taxi drivers, it is also an election gimmick for the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, to introduce help for taxi drivers. People should realise what is happening.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards lump sum payments, people have been waiting almost 12 months for the pre-1953 payments and for appeals. The Government should deal with the delays in the system rather <Col N="890" /> than trying to play politics. Work on schools is being held up, yet replies to parliamentary questions to the Minister for Education and Science state there are not any delays. What has gone wrong in the Government that every school is being told to wait? Schools which accepted tenders are facing delays, yet the Minister has said that work is not being held up.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance wanted to balance the budget, he decided to raid the jam jars. Unfortunately for the incoming Government, three of the jam jars were emptied this year and there is nothing left for next year. We will probably face more problems in the future. The medical cards issue and the fact that widows under 66 years of age are paid less than widows over 66 years of age are scandals. The people on disability payments should get the money which professional sportsmen are receiving. One could do a great deal for them with &euro;5 million.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Finance Bill in the absence of the Minister for Finance. It is an opportunity for every Deputy and the public to assess the work and the failures of the Government over the past five years. The Government's record is one of dismal failure at a time of great financial resources.</P>
      <P>As regards education, the Minister for Education and Science has failed. His attempt to face down the teachers when he came to office, last year and in recent days indicates that he is determined to break the morale not only of the teaching profession but of the students and parents. No other Minister for Education in the history of the State has done as much damage as the Minister, Deputy Woods. However, he is not satisfied with what he has done to date as he is now determined to continue along that road. It is pathetic to think that his one ambition, as stated during the week, is to face down the teachers. He is using bully tactics. He will regret adopting that approach. I hope future generations not only regret his actions but remember them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's newspapers report that there is a strong possibility the Government will reintroduce third level fees. It is thinking of doing that at a time when the maintenance grant for third level students is totally inadequate. Anyone with a child going to third level college or who knows a third level student realises they are living in abject poverty. A maintenance grant of £1,800 for a student in 2002 is totally inadequate. The criteria for qualification for that paltry £1,800 are out of kilter with reality. There is an urgent need for the Minister for Finance to tell the Minister for Education and Science that the finance is available to give students that to which they are entitled to maintain a reasonable standard of living. Parents in reasonably low paid jobs, such as fast food outlets, should not be disqualified. They should be able to go outside the limits laid down for third level maintenance grants. The Government continues to claim that it will bring more people from disadvantaged areas into the edu<Col N="891" /> cation system at third level. However, it cannot keep them at second level, let alone introduce them to and maintain them at third level. That indicates the failure of the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    <P>Deputies ask questions day after day about primary and post-primary schools which have failed under the Government for the past five years not only to get resources to do the much needed extensions and repairs but to get a response from the Minister. He has stifled all information to frustrated boards of management and parents' associations throughout the country. They ask Deputies on all sides of the House to ask the Minister what stage their school is at. While 840 national schools throughout the country are in need of repair and extension how can this Minister say he has made progress? There is no need to go into the details of what this Government did in the Jamie Sinnott case, and the Department is continuing to challenge the courts' decision with regard to the recognition of its responsibilities to people with learning difficulties, particularly in regard to autism. While we have that attitude from the Minister and the Department he has to be classified as a failure.</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Byrne, who has responsibility for Coillte, not get premia parallel to what Teagasc is getting for animals and cereal premia? Somebody in Government has to answer why there is such a difference between these two State bodies.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, tell me why a pilot scheme of tax concessions that has been very worthwhile in the upper Shannon region, brought in by the Minister for Finance some years ago, has not been extended to the middle and lower Shannon basin? Towns like Ballinasloe and Loughrea in my constituency of East Galway adjoining the Shannon have not had one job created or assisted by the IDA or Enterprise Ireland, not just during the term of this Government but over the past 20 years. The IDA has failed to adhere to the guidelines issued to them that all of the jobs are not to be directed to the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway. In Ballinasloe there is an advance factory ready and there is nobody likely to occupy it in the near future. We are told that the Taoiseach is to announce 1,000 new jobs in County Galway in the near future. People are waiting to hear if they will be in Loughrea, Ballinasloe or Galway. Going on the past record it is likely to be Galway because there is no determination on the part of the responsible Minister to say to the IDA to put those jobs where they are needed.</P>
    <P>The Government reluctantly accepted that we be categorised within the BMW region. We have been in it for the past five years, yet what benefit has it brought to us in the west? We have not received the higher grants and greater incentives for job creation we were supposed to get. Great <Col N="892" /> advances have taken place in the Border counties and some jobs have been created in that region. This has happened because the shame of this cross-Border poverty could not be tolerated. Will the Minster review the pilot scheme and extend it to the middle Shannon area and put us on a level playing field with other areas that have these incentives?</P>
    <P>It is becoming more apparent each day that the NDP totally underestimated the funding required for the listed projects. Already we have a proposed extension of time with regard to roads and infrastructure, particularly in the west, the area with which I am most familiar. There have been difficulties in regard to getting access to the land due to foot and mouth disease. That delay is understandable but if we eliminate that, little has happened in the meantime. We are still far behind the timescale outlined for the various planning stages at the NDP launch. The Taoiseach came to my constituency before Christmas and said that an intrinsic part of the NDP, the replacement of the N6 and the Loughrea bypass, would start in 2002 and be operational by 2003. He said that at a time when he knew well that there was no funding. The NRA has since stated that depending on availability of land and planning requirements it could be advanced as a stand-alone project. Who is fooling who? How long can this Government continue to fool the people in instances like that? It is not just a single case of a broken promise: there is a whole raft of examples that I could refer to if I had the time.</P>
    <P>I brought a deputation from a swimming pool committee in Loughrea to Dublin and it was told that £3 million was available and that if it got its plans together there would not be a problem. The reality is that the plans have been done and there is no money forthcoming. Who has to take responsibility for this glib misinformation? We know that the promises are still being made and that the Ministers will find resources for their own constituencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to make a contribution on the Finance Bill, 2002. I will focus on glaring mismanagement by an ideologically driven Government. It can be amply demonstrated that there have been abject failures.</P>
      <P>One of the matters I have looked at over the last number of years has been individualisation. A householder whose salary is equivalent to the combined salaries of his neighbours in the household next door and who has the same mortgage and family commitments as them, will see a significant difference in his or her salary at the end of the week. The single income family is compelled to pay substantially more tax because the earner's spouse does not work outside the home. That is a repugnant provision of the tax code and it creates tremendous inequalities and anomalies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was brought in to achieve the economic objective of compelling people to work outside the home, but it fails to recognise the deeply <Col N="893" /> rooted inequality it creates in the tax system. The provision was driven by an ideological Minister for Finance. That is fine as a Government prerogative. The Minister can argue logically why the provision should be made and we can disagree with him. However, it worries me that the concept of individualisation is not applied across the board and that is something the Minister will find in his constituency.</P>
    <P>When an application for social welfare is made by a young person aged 19 years, who is unfortunately unemployed, the first thing that is done is a means test. Such tests have been there from the year dot and it is no use heaping political blame for that on anybody. I do not do that here; I try to argue logically. The young person is means tested based on his or her family's household income, a concept which is so far removed from the individual that, some day, somebody will go to the High Court and win a case against the State. That person will be able to argue, by analogy, that the principle that applies in the taxation code is the antithesis of what applies in the social welfare code. It is the antithesis of the principle of individualisation strongly advocated by the Minister for Finance, ably assisted by the Progressive Democrats element in Government.</P>
    <P>Individualisation gets rid of community and social solidarity principles and promotes the individual. The Minister of State may take a different view, but that is the essence of Thatcherism and it contributed to the fall of Thatcherism. This principle should be scrutinised. If it is such a good idea and if it is so fundamental to Government philosophy and policy, it should be applied across the board. People should be treated as individuals in the social welfare code. In fairness to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, he understands the issue with regard to the qualifying adult dependant, as does the Minister of State at the Department of Finance who is an intelligent person. It will cost money, but I do not believe in dropping the higher tax bands. We will have to fund this and we cannot resort to borrowing to pay for it. We should forget about lowering tax for people such as me from 42% to 40% and instead bring those people up. We should apply the principle to the less well off and help them out.</P>
    <P>There should be individualisation in the case of higher education grants. If one is under 23 years, one is means tested. One has the democratic right to vote at the age of 18 and one could be married with a family at the age of 21, yet for the higher education grant and third level allowance, one has to submit one's parents' details even if one lives away from the family home. The whole thing is a farce. To bring equity to the system, the ideology, against which I would argue, should apply completely. It is fair enough that there is a fundamental Government philosophy which I do not share; that is what democracy is all about. It is admirable that people have different views and express them strongly, but principles must apply across the board. It is good to have sharp ideo<Col N="894" /> logical divisions in here because sometimes it becomes bland with everyone clapping each other on the back. That is not good for any of us.</P>
    <P>On sitting days, permission is granted to debate matters on the Adjournment, the focus of which are often schools and the infrastructural capital to develop them. The Minister never comes in and instead sends Ministers of State, such as the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen. They are very capable people, but the Minister is not here to answer the questions we raise. Schools such as Castlepollard community college and Coláiste Cionn Torc, which my colleague Deputy McGrath mentioned yesterday, are still waiting for investment. It is unbelievable and I am sure the Minister of State is frustrated too. Is there not enough money? Can we not come out and say that there are 800 schools on waiting lists and that the capital cannot be provided? There are no miracles, but let us get the matter out in the open. If a school will not be ready until 2005, it is no good saying that it will be ready in 2003. Boards of management, parents' councils, teachers and pupils at schools such as Coláiste Mhuire, Mullingar, and St. Mary's CBS, are aggravated and agitated in relation to matters they feel should be attended to straight away.</P>
    <P>Often people feel that projects are being put on the long finger. A new school has been promised since 1997 for Coralstown on the N4, which many thought would be delivered two years ago. There is not a sign of it and the Government seems to be stonewalling. Some are worried that schools are dropping off the list. Nobody can answer straight questions about Dysart national school and Curraghmore national school, which are in places with expanding populations. These schools are inadequate when the least we should do is cherish all our children equally and give everybody an equal opportunity, regardless of his or her background. Children should begin their education in a comfortable and convenient primary school. Other schools waiting for additional accommodation to be provided are the Gaelscoil in Mullingar, Sonna national school, which my wife attended, St. Etchen's national school, Kinnegad, Loughnavalley national school and Gainstown national school.</P>
    <P>I could go on and on, but they are among the 800 on the list and every month the principal or board of management of each gets in contact to ask what is happening, but nobody seems to know. If one gets in contact with the Department, one is told that the process is at stage 3 or 4. Can someone not take a decision in principle to go ahead? That is what has to be done. We have plenty of ways to ensure that we get value for public money. Sometimes I am forced to think that we are being stonewalled.</P>
    <P>As I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, will agree, there should be a special subhead in the Vote of his Department or of the Department of Education and Science for safety at schools. It is a big issue for schools on national primary or secondary roads and I am sure he <Col N="895" /> comes across it in his own constituency in Waterford. We are all driving that bit faster and there are more cars on the roads. There have been about four times as many cars on the roads in the past 15 years than there were in the 1970s. The safety of children being brought to, and picked up from school is a major concern. Throughout County Westmeath a number of schools expressed major concern in this area. To ensure the appropriate traffic calming measures, safety lights, etc., are put in place, a special subhead should be dedicated to the issue. If I was on that side of the House, I would like to see it done, perhaps in conjunction with the Office of Public Works in the Minister of State's area and the Department of Education and Science. There is no use in crying when there is a fatal accident in one of those places. Then, typically, we will all rush out sympathising but the harm will have been done. Then we will try and put up the necessary lights or warning signals to try and ensure proper and appropriate safety at or near those locations.</P>
    <P>The other area in education I want to mention is third level grants. In 1974, I was lucky to get a third level education grant. I suppose I was poor enough then to get it. In fairness, I would not have got an education without it. Therefore I have a particular eagerness to see that area progressed.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the grants system which annoys people, not a little, is that one could be refused the grant because one's earnings were £20 over the eligibility limit due to doing a little overtime. Often people are forced to borrow from the credit union or the banks as a result. There should be tapered or marginal relief in such cases. It should apply where people have exceeded the income limit by between £1 and £2,500 or £3,000, and reduce in tenths until, eventually, if one is £3,000 over the income limit, one does not get anything. That would let people, whose income might occasionally exceed the income limit, avail of a partial grant and might bring a little more equity to the system.</P>
    <P>I will mention briefly a topic in which the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, would have an interest, and in which he has tried to play some role, that is, decentralisation. It is in his bailiwick. It is one of those issues which occasionally we would rather have dealt with by a committee but with some committees it might never be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation is a difficult issue which the Government mishandled. Initially its approach was like that of a bull in a china shop, where Ministers tried to select individual projects to promote their own constituencies. I am not saying I would not have done the same. I will not be a hypocrite or speak with two tongues here. I am sure that in the same position I would have done likewise and Mullingar probably would have got decentralised offices before any other place. However, it is the wrong approach and we must <Col N="896" /> get away from such a parochial approach if we are to succeed.</P>
    <P>The people of Mullingar &ndash; I must put their case because that is what I am elected to do &ndash; see decentralisation being implemented in all other areas of the midlands. We in Mullingar are on the N4, the N6, the N52, where major road networks are being put in place and there is a good railway network and good public transport. There are excellent schools and tremendous recreational facilities for equestrian sports and golf. There are tremendous GAA clubs in the area such as Mullingar Shamrocks, St. Loman's, etc., right across to Shandonagh. There are rugby clubs and the finest soccer clubs. Despite all this, the Minister has failed to make a decision with regard to Mullingar. I would advocate strongly that Mullingar should certainly be considered and I was extremely disappointed when the Taoiseach indicated that it did not appear to be on the list.</P>

      <P>The 100,000 carers have done tremendous work but we have given them scant recognition. We have a niggardly and measly way of means testing the allowance. It is scandalous. It is an indictment of this Government that it has failed to remove that means test. I have fought hard to remove it as carer's allowance is a fundamental requirement. If the Labour Party enters into Government with any other party that means test will have to go. I will not vote for a Government which fails to commit to doing that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak with conviction for carers. Many of them do tremendous work, seven days a week, 24 hours a day. They care for people and keep relations within their own home environment where they are happier. This issue is allied to the nursing home subvention. There are not enough public hospital beds to facilitate people in need and they are forced into nursing homes. There is a subvention regime which is not capable of paying the appropriate payments and we are letting people down. The Ombudsman said this in a recent report. We are in a catch-22 situation. However, if we tackle the carer's allowance issue, <Col N="897" /> it would contribute significantly to the solution to this problem. There are 100,000 people out there saving the State hundreds of millions of pounds each year and we have failed to recognise that. I am making a strong plea with regard to this fundamental requirement.</P>
    <P>I come from a strong GAA background and I was privileged to have played for 25 or 26 years. I am a good friend of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy &ndash; I am an even better friend of his brother, with whom I studied agriculture. I am surprised at the measure for élite sports people in the Finance Bill because the Minister has a strong GAA background. He is interested in innovation and does things differently. I admire him sometimes but I cannot understand why he sought to place at a disadvantage &ndash;  this is the import of what he has done &ndash; GAA players and amateur players across all the codes with this measure where he will refund taxes paid since 1990 to the highest paid sports professionals in the country. I cannot understand it.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, played those games also. As somebody who togged out behind a ditch years ago in ordinary circumstances&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is correct. He has the picture and he knows where I am coming from. Unfortunately, to my cost I also have a great interest in the equestrian sports, which is encouraged by Deputy McGahon and others, but that is neither here nor there. However, the amateur sports people to whom I referred give us tremendous enjoyment on Sundays, week in, week out. Thousands of people play Gaelic games, which are our premier national games, for no reward and they are excluded from this benefit.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed the GAA did not make stronger efforts in this regard. It would certainly have the ear of the Taoiseach and the ear of the Minister for Finance given that I used see them in Croke Park regularly. Amateur participants in all the other sports have been treated similarly.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil has always purported to be the great bastion and supporter of the GAA. At the time of local elections in the early 1980s I remember going into a Fianna Fáil meeting and being told I would not get the GAA vote. When I asked, &ldquo;Why not, I played for my county?&rdquo;, I was told, &ldquo;You are not from Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;  Times have changed. I am sure some ordinary GAA players will wonder what this measure is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measure in the Finance Bill is a clear insult <Col N="898" /> to the GAA and all other organisations and amateur sports persons who have given great enjoyment and thrills to the public and Irish people throughout the world over the years. It is a bad day for the GAA. It widens the gulf between the great amateur people who play the games in Ireland and the people who enjoy huge success and generate opulent wealth in professional sport. I am appalled that GAA players, who are true amateurs and do not receive a penny in payment, are being left further behind. The legislation is retrospective to 1990; generally, legislation is prospective. This is elitism gone mad, although I do not say that in a begrudging manner. The legislation should have attempted to facilitate ordinary sportspeople who can lose a lot and may have to take time off work if they are injured during games. Some of them may not have the best insurance policies, yet they have given great service and we enjoy their efforts. The Minister for Finance said this will only cost &euro;5 million. If some of the people I am talking about got only &euro;5,000 per year, it would make them very happy. It might allow them to buy a car. I appeal to the Minister to consider including a scheme in the Finance Bill that would help remedy this further anomaly that he has created. This is a frolic of the Minister's making.</P>
    <P>Waiting lists are an issue on which I hold strong opinions. The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, is extremely sharp at mathematics. He will tell me I cannot have my loaf and eat it. He is right, although there was a time when I wanted my loaf and I also wanted to eat it. As one gets older, one becomes more mature. I know we cannot have those things unless we pay for them. I disagree with the thrust of Government policy. The Minister of State will say that capital gains tax has been lowered from 40% to 20% and more activity has been generated because of that move. It was a 50% decrease for people who are very well off.</P>
    <P>I believe the waiting lists figures have been massaged. Some 26,000 people are waiting for in-patient treatment but there are many more on out-patient waiting lists. These people are waiting for elective surgery such as hip operations, cataract removals, knee operations and heart surgery. People are fed up waiting. Why should they have to wait two or three years, particularly if they are medical card holders? Those who have to wait for that length of time suffer and deteriorate and some will die before receiving treatment. What kind of society do we want to develop and champion? I worry about the type of society espoused by the Progressive Democrats where money is the key to getting treatment. Those treatments are a person's right and not a privilege. Every week Deputies table parliamentary questions in an attempt to expedite operations for their constituents. People come to Deputies' clinics and we try to do our best for them. Such people should have the same opportunity to receive treatment as <Col N="899" /> those who have private health insurance and significant amounts of money.</P>
    <P>I was particularly annoyed at the failure to increase the medical card eligibility limit for 2002. The poor are being penalised again. No amount of spin can disguise that those who are most in need of accessing primary care are those who are prevented from doing so because they cannot afford to visit a family doctor. Access to GPs at primary level should be free. There should have been a significant increase in medical cards eligibility limits to facilitate the issuing of more cards. The number of people who hold medical cards now is significantly lower than the number who held them in the early 1990s.</P>
    <P>The failure to raise income eligibility limits might have an ancillary affect. I welcome the increases in social welfare but when such increases are given and there is no increase in the medical card income eligibility limit, some people could lose the card as the additional payment could bring them over the qualifying threshold. That has to be revisited. Governments of varying hues always ensured that social welfare payments and medical card income guidelines were closely aligned. We always ensured that those in receipt of social welfare payments were automatically entitled to medical cards. This may come back to haunt the Government. The decision not to extend the medical card to over 200,000 people this year was one of the more retrograde steps taken by the Government. Thousands will be unable to access free GP care as a result. Under current guidelines, if one has an income of just over £5,200, one must pay for GP visits. A working parent earning £324 per week would have to have ten children before qualifying for a medical card. This is a significant issue and I call on the Minister to revisit it.</P>
    <P>The budget totally ignored the issue of child care. The Minister made no reference to it in his budget day speech and the Government has turned its back on this matter. It is a critical issue for working parents. The Government should have ensured that those in need of affordable child care have access to it. A commitment was made to the social partners under the PPF to include radical reform in the child care sector. That has been thrown out by the Government. Those issues will come back to haunt it in the forthcoming election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reflect on that in the time I have and the Minister may comment on it later. Decentralisation was referred to earlier. This <Col N="900" /> would have given a lifeline to many communities. The Minister for Finance will have received an excellent submission in this regard concerning a combination of three locations: Kilrush, Listowel and Newcastlewest. This was supported by Shannon Development, the community council and the county councils. It was an excellent proposition and it would have been laudable had the Minister given a decentralisation project to these three locations. It would have rejuvenated surrounding areas.</P>
      <P>However, it appears decentralisation, which was announced two years ago, has been put on ice until after the next election. There has been decentralisation in the past five years but it has been selective on the part of certain Ministers. For example, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform moved the Legal Aid Board to Cahirciveen and the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources moved the Marine Institute to Galway. There have been other examples throughout the country. While it may be the case, as Deputy Penrose said, that a Minister would do this and that the decentralisation which has taken place has been selective, I am disappointed, as are the communities I represent, by the delay in further decentralisation.</P>
      <P>As councils debated their budgets for this year at the end of January, the National Roads Authority was due to make an announcement about roads projects. This has been deferred until the end of February apparently because the authority did not have a new chairman. Many communities wait in anticipation of what is likely to happen. In my county, important traffic calming and safety projects for various communities have been deferred. Abbeyfeale is a classic example, as are Pallasgreen and Kildimo. The measures are extremely important for these communities and would not cost a fortune. Nevertheless, the National Roads Authority has deferred consideration of them because of restrictions on finance.</P>
      <P>I have heard many Members speak on the issue of the tax concession scheme for sportsmen. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, will certainly be remembered by the racing industry as benign and as having respect for such sporting pastimes. Many people have said to me that the concession surprised them. As Deputy Penrose said, it is magnanimous, dating back as it does to 1990 and allowing people choose the best ten years. Some of the sportsmen involved have been extremely successful and I doubt if they sought this concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it has left a gap on the amateur side, especially where the GAA is concerned. It will be interesting to see what discussions will take place between the association and the Taoiseach, who regards himself as being well disposed towards it. We all know about the £60 million in funding the GAA was given to influence the outcome of a critical vote. It will be interesting to see what develops. A person I met recently said he was appalled at the granting of this concession to many successful sportsmen. He said that, for <Col N="901" /> the past few Christmases, he had been gritting the roads for the county council and his overtime was subsequently taxed. He asked why concessions were given to some and not to others.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable debate in the House on the health service. We know the number of elderly people is growing and that facilities must be in place for them. Unfortunately, the Government appears to believe that private nursing homes will take up the slack. Not enough consideration has been given to hospitals for the elderly under the jurisdiction of health boards. A classic example is St. Ita's Hospital in Newcastlewest. In the past four and a half years, we have had visits from the Taoiseach, the previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, and his successor, Deputy Martin. The provision of an Alzheimer's unit is especially important in this hospital and the anticipated cost is more than £1 million. The Taoiseach and Ministers saw what was required but, so far, not a block has been laid and the project appears stuck interminably in design stages and so on. In its place, relatives visit the elderly people in other hospitals where the doors must be locked after them to prevent the elderly Alzheimer's patients wandering around the rest of the hospital. An Alzheimer's unit is very important in St. Ita's Hospital. There is also a shortage of respiratory and rehabilitation beds there.</P>
    <P>The regional hospital is the flagship hospital in the area. Relatives of elderly people in the hospital are often frustrated by the fact that there is pressure to create bed space which puts pressure on the relatives to find somewhere to place their elderly family member. In many cases they cannot get access to St. Ita's Hospital. I received a complaint this week from a person in Newcastlewest who was bitterly disappointed by this because he believes that his mother, who is over 80, needs the type of care St. Ita's Hospital can provide. This is an unfortunate example to bear in mind when we reflect on what has been achieved as a result of the Celtic tiger and whether we are the caring society which gives elderly people quality of life in the last years of their lives. We have not succeeded in this regard and I have only given my area as a classic example of this.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the recent announcement by Fine Gael to give assistance to people who bought Eircom shares. It is interesting to note that the economists who did not support this and who castigated it in the media are familiar with stocks and shares and write about and trade in them. They would be aware of capital gains tax, shares being offset and losses recovered by financial institutions. I am not concerned about such people, rather about the ordinary person who saw the Eircom flotation as a gilt edged opportunity and to whom it was portrayed as such by the Government, especially the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke. It was hyped out of all proportion. Do we remember the hoardings, fanfare, trumpets, smoke and the way it was presented on <Col N="902" /> television? People were told this was their gilt edged opportunity to make some money from what was regarded as a successful company. We know what happened.</P>
    <P>Many pensioners and others who invested their nest eggs have been disappointed. Why not give them a return? It is said that it will open other areas where people will want compensation for their losses from failed investments. This was not like other flotations, it was unique. This was a successful semi-State company.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State can address the matter when he replies. The Government earned more than £4.5 billion from this exercise. If everyone eligible were to avail of the compensation for losses incurred, the cost would be more than &euro;90 million. It cost £74 million to launch the flotation. People were duped and conned. I assure the Government that, if it ever floats another semi-State company, people will have been so burned by the Eircom exercise that they will not invest and it will be left to institutional investors and others who understand and trade in stocks and shares. I make no apology for the compensation scheme, given that people were conned in this exercise. I was criticised for it by people who thought it was a bad idea, but when I explained it and rationalised it for them, they supported it. The people who telephoned the radio chat shows to condemn this exercise, probably orchestrated by the Fianna Fáil press office, included a woman who had invested in Eircom shares but would not claim compensation. As Deputy Noonan said, it would not be compulsory to claim compensation. It is important to remember that the State gained more than £4 billion from the sale of Telecom Éireann.</P>

      <P>The Adjournment Debate in Dáil Éireann is a hypocritical exercise. A Deputy presents the case for a school which wants to build an extension and is given a pat answer by the Minister setting out how much the Department has spent on education over a number of years. The information sought is not provided and the Deputy is not allowed to ask questions. Within my own community people are asking when the Gaelscoil in Newcastle West and the extensions to Crecora, Drumtrasna and Pallaskenry schools will be built. We may hear a raft of announcements in the weeks before the general election in order to convince the people of west Limerick to vote for the Government but the Minister has left matters a little late.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers mentioned the carer's allowance. The medical assessment criteria seem to be designed to reject as many applicants as possible. I know of two people who are both over 80 years of age and whose daughter gave up work in order to look after them. The daughter's application was rejected on medical grounds even though both her parents suffer from medical conditions. If those two people did not have a member of their family willing to look after them, they would become a burden on the State. Are we a caring society? Do we, with the material wealth we have gained in the past few years, care sufficiently for people? The proof of the pudding is in the eating and we seem to have become a less caring society.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Finucane for sharing his time.</P>
      <P>It was amusing last weekend to listen to the Tánaiste saying at her party conference that the forthcoming general election would present a choice between the Progressive Democrats and the P45s. By the look of them, very few of the PD delegates in Limerick have ever had to worry about a P45 or to spend time standing in a dole queue. I doubt if any of them suffered from the social welfare cutbacks Deputy McCreevy introduced when he was Minister for Social Welfare. The lesser-spotted PD is a very rare bird in the constituency I represent and I hope it will be rarer still throughout the country after polling day.</P>
      <P>But their Thatcherite influence on this Government has been crucial and the Minister for Finance is their soul mate. The Finance Bill implements the tax changes in the budget and introduces further tax measures. I described the budget, when it was introduced, as a failure and there is nothing in the Finance Bill to make me change my mind. It is a last desperate gamble by a Government which has squandered the best financial position enjoyed by any Government since the foundation of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" />The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government has had two enormous advantages enjoyed by no previous Government in the Twenty-six Counties. First, it has been in office at a time of exceptional prosperity which resulted in budget surpluses in four successive years. Second, despite its slim Dáil majority, it has been able to plan for five budgets in a row. Those advantages have been scandalously squandered by the Fianna Fáil-PD Government in every budget and Finance Bill. Not only has it failed to tackle the structural inequalities which warp our economy and damage our society, it has worsened those inequalities and widened the gap between rich and poor over its term.</P>
    <P>The refusal to extend medical card coverage to people other than the over 70s was a disgrace and will be remembered as one of the great failures of this Government. We are all of one mind that the over 70s are deserving of the medical card but what of those families stuck at the very bottom of the economic reality faced by people today? The Minister complained of tighter fiscal restraints. Let us examine the facts. Corporation tax cuts cost £214 million in 2001 alone. That is more than twice what it would cost to extend the medical card to 200,000 more people. That is a damning fact and an indictment of the Minister and the Government. This does not take into account cuts in capital gains tax and other measures which will benefit the better off.</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed that only 11% of the tax measures he introduced were aimed at high earners. He forgot to say that these earners also got everything the low paid got in addition to another slice of the tax cut cake. Meanwhile, workers on and below the minimum wage are still in the tax net. While the Minister can generously play to the demands of his friends in the gambling industry, a significant number of workers earning less than the minimum wage will remain in the tax net. These workers and their families do not qualify for the medical card.</P>
    <P>The Government is restoring interest relief on rented residential property and reducing stamp duty rates for investors. This is a further bonus for landlords while the Government has failed to protect tenants from rising rents and the growing rate of evictions.</P>

      <P>A combination of factors, including in particular its increasing profile as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy in the same family of diseases as BSE, has led to a more proactive approach to the eradication of the disease from the national flock. In this regard, and on the basis of veterinary advice, it has been decided to depopulate all flocks which have had a case of scrapie since 1 January 1999. The flock owners concerned will not be permitted to restock with sheep for a period of two years from the date of depopulation. Flocks which have had a case prior to 1 January 1999 are being examined and a decision on whether similar action will be required in these cases will be made on a case by case basis. Up to 12 February 2002, 44 flocks have been depopulated and a 45th is in the process of being depopulated. This will complete the depopulations of the current tranche of cases.</P>
      <P>For the present, it is intended to continue to depopulate flocks in which scrapie is diagnosed. In 2002, however, this policy will be accompanied by a far more intensive active surveillance programme comprising a minimum of 60,000 rapid tests for scrapie at slaughterhouses. This will assist us in determining the incidence of scrapie and its geographical distribution, and will provide the basis for a review of the present policy later this year.</P>
      <P>Breeding resistance to scrapie through genotyping has been proposed in a number of quarters as a possible alternative to flock depopulation. The developing science in this area is being kept under close review by experts in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. However, their view is that, for the present, the science is not sufficiently definitive and, in particular, that the possibility exists that resistant sheep simply mask the scrapie prion and harbour infection which does not manifest itself clinically. This concern mirrors that expressed by the European Union's scientific steering committee in an opinion adopted on 18-19 October 2001 which called for further work to be done to validate the genotyping approach and, in particular, to investigate whether scrapie resistant sheep could, in fact, be silent carriers of the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the scientific uncertainty surrounding the genotyping approach, it is not considered appropriate at this stage to embark on such a programme on a national scale or seek to rely on such a programme to safeguard the future of the sheep sector. However, the experimental genotyping work being undertaken here with a limited <Col N="906" /> number of flocks will continue. In addition, sheep which test positive for scrapie will be genotyped.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the human health concerns that may or may not exist, the presence of scrapie in the national flock is a very considerable issue for the sheep sector. It is, therefore, clearly in the interests of the sector that everything possible is done to eradicate the disease. While genotyping might well be the best option when and if the science is clarified, for the present, it remains the case that national policy will focus on a multi-strand approach of additional surveillance, depopulation where appropriate, and the continuation of research into the value of genotyping on an experimental basis.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. While I understand his reservations about the science of genotyping, is he in a position to say depopulation is, in fact, a more reliable way of combating this disease and what evidence is there for this? Why has there been such a delay in depopulating the flocks first identified as showing scrapie on 1 January 1999? Is the Minister aware that a number of flock owners were told last October their herds would be depopulated and that they have been waiting for three or four months for this to take place? Is he also aware they have incurred costs during that period in feeding and keeping sheep from which they will get no return? Is he further aware that all these flocks have lambed in that period and that the business of looking at a flock lambing, helping the flock to lamb and bringing the lambs into the world, knowing they will be destroyed, is a very traumatic experience for farmers which has been drawn out over an excessively lengthy period? Will he finally tell us what he is doing to avoid a repetition of the fiasco that happened in regard to the weighing of sheep for the purpose of operating the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly, the best scientific advice available to me is that we should take the depopulation route together with research into genotyping, which is what is being done. On the slowness in taking out flocks, this was brought about because of the difficulty in reaching agreement with the representatives of the sheep owners in regard to a compensation package. However, that issue was finalised a few weeks ago and I expect the programme will now continue at an accelerated pace. Any difficulties that arose in regard to weighing and so on have been fairly well documented. The fact is that the equipment involved has been tested by third parties and found to be in order. I expect there will be no recurrence of that particular episode.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The 30 day holding period for purchases of susceptible animals, which was introduced initially in the context of the foot and mouth emergency, is intended to reduce animal movement in order to limit the risk of the spread of disease. The measure applies to all parties engaged in the movement of animals, not simply to livestock dealers and agents. It has been reviewed on several occasions, most recently in late January 2002. In announcing my decision to retain it until 28 February 2002, I also indicated that it will be reviewed again before the end of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as dealing operations are concerned, a number of exemptions to the 30 day rule are available to assist registered dealers and agents in the conduct of their business. These exemptions were extended at the beginning of this month and, subject to certain conditions, allow dealers and agents to purchase cattle from marts and sell them privately within 30 days and purchase cattle privately and sell them onwards at a mart or privately within the 30 days. Other exemptions apply in respect of animals moved to slaughter plants, <Col N="908" /> including slaughter plants in Northern Ireland, cattle moved for export from approved export assembly centres &ndash; some 14 premises in all &ndash; and the exemption exists for cattle moved through 19 premises used by live exporters to marshal cattle and test them prior to export.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the 30 day rule, as applied at present, is a sensible precautionary measure in the context of limiting the spread of disease and that the exemptions in place are sufficient to facilitate dealers, agents and exporters in their ongoing business. A 30 day retention requirement also applies in Northern Ireland with minimum exemptions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>We all accept the reason the requirement was introduced and wholeheartedly support it although some of the more extreme measures that were being contemplated have been modified. However, our fears appear to be well-founded. In terms of the emergency nature of this legislation, which was introduced in this House by way of the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Act, 2001, is it the intention, not of the Minister but of the Department, to ensure that this will be on the Statute Book<i> sine die</i>, never to be reviewed by anybody? If this is the case, a commitment to myself and Deputy Dukes, which we sought very vigorously, that this would be reintroduced to this House in the form of a consolidation of the Diseases of Animals Acts of 1966 and 2001 has not been honoured. It appears that it will not occur. Am I correct in thinking this? Why can some of the excesses of this legislation not be removed? Like much emergency legislation in this country, it will be on the Statute Book forever and a day. Is there any timetable at all contemplated for the removal of the 30 day rule, which applies to livestock dealers and agents? Those are the people upon which it impacts most critically. Has the Minister any intention of removing or modifying this legislation which is impeding trade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that I gave a commitment to the House, particularly to Deputies Dukes and Penrose, that I would consolidate and update the 1966 legislation. I put that in train immediately. As Deputy Penrose will know from his background, the legal process works relatively slowly. I inquired when I would be able to bring this measure before the House and was informed that, if we were lucky, we would be able to have it here before the summer. I hope that will happen and I will keep up the pressure in that regard. That will allow us, once and for all&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do my very best. In the meantime, we will have to roll over the existing legislation. With regard to the 30 day rule, there are generous exemptions which, on a precautionary <Col N="909" /> basis, allow trade to continue, allow people to deal in cattle and allow farmers to acquire and gain access to cattle. It is a very sensible approach at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree very strongly with what the Minister just said. I want to clarify something which Deputy Penrose put to the Minister very directly. At a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine last week, the Minister gave an undertaking to Deputy Dukes that the consolidated legislation would be introduced within a few months, if I recall correctly. This is hugely important.</P>
      <P>The Minister is missing the point. I speak for everybody on all sides of the House in saying that we do not want to return to the day when cattle could be sold at one mart on a Monday and brought to another on a Tuesday on the carousel system. Nobody is asking for that. Had the Minister attended the huge meeting in Tullamore last Sunday night, he would have noticed that not only all the livestock dealers and agents were there but also the mart managers. The big problem they have is that there is such a restriction on the live trade. To them, and to me, it seems there is a section within the Department which genuinely believes that the quicker we get rid of the live trade, the better for everybody. The only way the Minister can prove otherwise is by providing some mechanism to allow cattle to be sold more than once, but not too often, within the 30 days. In fact, one of the proposals at the meeting &ndash; with which most mart managers agree &ndash; was that the imposition of a limit of two sales or outings within the 30 days would get over the problem. The Department should be able to accede to this.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have to show in a very transparent way on the ground that farmers doing their normal business are not agents if they get another farmer to conduct business for them at a livestock mart. That is important. The Minister might say that was not the intention but, at the level of the DVOs, that is the way it appears to be put. If the Minister does not address this problem, Irish livestock marts will close.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I hope to consolidate the legislation in the next few months, before the summer or sooner if possible. We will proceed as quickly as we can.</P>
      <P>With regard to the live trade and exports generally, there is an exemption for people who want to procure cattle for the live trade. There is no impediment whatsoever to live trade. I do not know of anybody in my position who has done as much for the live trade as I have, starting with the provision of the <i>Purbeck</i>. To date, there are 19 ferries available for live trade exports.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The main live trade, apart from Egypt, is in continental Europe. For younger and store cattle, our prices compare with them on a <Col N="910" /> quality basis. That is probably one of the first times ever younger and store cattle are making a very good price. There is no impediment to the trade and the ferries are there.</P>
      <P>I understand the position of farmers very well. There is no difficulty whatsoever in somebody who is not able to be at a mart or some person living on his own getting somebody to bid on a few cattle for him a couple of times per year. If necessary, I will clarify that in writing for people. I have certainly asked the people in the veterinary section of the Department to communicate with the DVOs to that effect. We are coming out of a period in which we had the threat of foot and mouth disease, but we also have a problem with brucellosis and contagious diseases. The Deputy mentioned the creation of carousels in terms of re-presenting cattle. To reduce the number of occasions where cattle come into contact with each other is a prudent approach and is the one I am pursuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>What grants to upgrade existing premises will be available to dealers and exporters if the legislation is not altered for some months? I am worried it will take longer than the Minister alleges. Will grants be made available which are separate from the normal farming enterprise grants? Will registered dealers be allowed to sell their stock which, as Deputy Connaughton knows, were traditionally sold from lorries, marts and fairs? Will they be allowed to sell even in a curtailed way, for example will it be permissible to have two movements in the 30 day period in towns as Deputy Connaughton suggested? As I interpreted the discussion in this Chamber last year, such curtailed practices would be allowed.</P>
      <P>Will equal and fair compensation be given to registered dealers or exporters affected under existing de-stocking due to TB, brucellosis and BSE? Will different provisions be applicable to different sectors of the same industry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give an undertaking that farmers who will be buying at odd intervals for other farmers will not be asked by a departmental official to present the deeds of their holdings or other documentation to prove they are farmers? Will he ensure that such a regime will not be introduced in the mart system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>First, there will not be such a huge incidence of people buying for other people a few times during the year because the farmers in question, for whatever reason, cannot go to the mart themselves to bid. In terms of an animal travelling directly from one holding to another, there will not be any difficulty. The difficulty arises in respect of regular trading and trafficking in cattle. As everybody knows, Irish livestock is trafficked more than that in any other country of which we know.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Penrose raised that issue also. I recently met a delegation of livestock dealers led by its chairman, Mr. Foley. Up to a couple of weeks ago, they could not re-present animals at a mart and they also had to clean out the premises after six days. I increased the six days to 14 days to give them a better chance to get a load of cattle and I said that if someone bought from a farm, he or she would be allowed to present animals at a mart. This should allow reasonable flexibility. The response from the people in the livestock business indicated that this would be very helpful to them.</P>
      <P>There is significant interaction between Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic. In the North, there was a complete standstill if animals were bought into a farm. Following discussions between experts North and South, in the North, only the animals that are bought in are restricted for 30 days and the herd is not put at a complete standstill. In Scotland, they are kept at a standstill for 30 days while it is 20 days in England and Wales. They have minimal exemptions, whereas we give many exemptions. We want to improve the traceability in case there is a further outbreak and to reduce the trafficking in relevant animals. It is a relatively prudent approach to the business.</P>

      <Quest>the number of cases of BSE reported to date in 2002; the number of cases reported in the month of January; the counties in which all cases in 2002 were discovered; the number of cases which were discovered in each of those counties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of 42 cases of BSE were confirmed in January 2002. This figure is slightly inflated due to an overhang from the Christmas period of cases awaiting confirmation. To date this year, a total of 49 cases have been confirmed in 17 counties. Details of the counties and numbers involved are contained in the following table.</P>
      <P>A targeted active surveillance programme for BSE began in 2000 with the testing of a proportion of fallen stock and a random survey of cattle eligible for human consumption. This initial programme was extended in 2001. Since 1 July 2001, all cattle over 30 months must be tested for BSE using a so-called rapid test approved by the scientific steering committee of the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the 145 cases detected in 2000, 138 were detected by passive surveillance. In 2001, a smaller number, 123 cases of the total of 242, were detected by passive surveillance although a greater number of animals were tested as BSE suspects on the basis of clinical signs in 2001. The <Col N="912" /> entire increase in 2001 is attributable to more intensive active surveillance, particularly among fallen animals, which would not, in any event, have entered the human food chain.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that a comprehensive range of measures is in place to protect consumers and for the control and eradication of BSE, including compulsory notification of the disease, the depopulation of herds, the tracing and slaughter of birth cohorts, a ban on the use of meat and bonemeal for farmed animals, the removal and destruction of specified risk materials and the testing regime for cattle over 30 months. This is the most comprehensive regime ever to protect consumers and to try to root out this disease.</P>
    <P>Moreover, unlike many other member states whose BSE controls were tightened at the end of 2000, none of the positive animals identified in Ireland to date was born after July 1996 and the percentage of BSE cases in animals aged five years or less was 16% in 2001 compared to 53% in that age category in 1998. This indicates that the enhanced controls introduced in this country in 1996 are working and that the disease should begin to work its way out of the national herd as older animals leave the system.</P>

      <P>The Minister said the figures for January are inflated due to the carryover from the testing process carried out in 2001. That means the number for 2001 must have been deflated accordingly. We must keep a realistic fix on the number tested each month and ensure the positives are attributed to the correct month. Given that there are certain counties where there is a predominance of BSE relative to other counties, does the Minister think it is now realistic to have a targeted cull in those counties?</P>

      <P>There has been some recent speculation about a targeted cull of older animals. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development recently undertook a feasibility study of culls in certain circumstances. The conclusion of <Col N="913" /> this study was that there is no scientific basis for a targeted cull and that no significant human health guarantees would result, provided that the existing control measures are maintained and implemented. This conclusion has been adopted by the CJD advisory committee. Given the increase in the age profile of animals with the disease and as older cattle are removed from the system, I expected that the sooner the older animals were out of the system, the sooner we would eliminate the problem entirely, which is why I initiated the study.</P>

      <P>In the past few weeks, two animals in the North of Ireland born after 1996 have been identified as positive for BSE. Are there concerns that such an event could occur here and, if so, what precautions can be taken? There are no obvious explanations for this development. We are inclined to forget that meat and bonemeal have been technically banned in this country since 1990 and have been categorically banned since 1996. The same is true in the North of Ireland and yet two cases involving animals born after 1996 have now been identified as positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The development in Northern Ireland is worrying. We had a ban here in 1990, which was tightened very considerably in 1996 with heat treatment and the lack of cross contamination at farms, mills, etc. Since then we have had a very good run. We are fearful that a number of younger animals could be found to be positive. Fortunately, that has not happened. Some people accuse the Department of being overzealous in terms of our tight regime of monitoring, but I believe it is showing dividends. From the point of view of consumer protection, there are layers of controls and protection that seek to ensure that no contaminated meat could possibly reach the consumer. In particular, there is the removal of the risk material where the contamination resides. Overall, we are going in the right direction and I hope we will continue to do that. The current relatively high level of positive cases are due to the active surveillance of fallen animals and other animals that would not be going into the food system. They should be washed out of the system in the next two years.</P>

      <Quest>the steps he proposes to take to implement the changes in the penalties applying to European Union direct payment schemes, which were passed by the Agriculture Council in November 2001; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[4918/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been to the forefront in raising the question of simplification of the rules surrounding the penalty regime at the Council of Agriculture Ministers. A new EU Commission regulation was published on 12 December last, <Col N="914" /> which will apply to the 2002 schemes and onwards. In line with our commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and also our quality customer service, my Department has published an information booklet, which is being sent to every farmer in Ireland this week. The booklet explains how the new regime will work. It will serve as a useful guide to farmers and their advisers. In addition, starting from next week, my Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, will hold a series of public information meetings for farmers. These meetings will take place in every county in Ireland over the next two weeks. The emphasis at these meetings will be on how farmers can avoid penalties and maximise their entitlements under the various schemes.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the new arrangements, while not giving us everything we would want, will be of considerable benefit to farmers. The most significant improvements are: reduced penalties for late lodgement of area aid applications; no penalty for over-declaration of forage area; a farm based approach to bovine livestock inspections; and a fairer approach to penalties for non-compliance with scheme conditions. While there are arrangements for applying a penalty under the extensification premium scheme, this will only arise in the case of a forage over-declaration and even then a penalty will not be applied if the area found is sufficient to support the stocking density.</P>
      <P>The changes in the rules governing EU direct payment schemes will be implemented through the processing of 2002 applications. The changes have already been incorporated into the terms and conditions of the relevant schemes, which issued to each applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the continuation of his spin-doctoring. In November last or whenever the meeting took place the impression was that the position would ease dramatically. I advise his staff that when they attend these public meetings they wear bullet proof vests and helmets. Farmers are outraged. Has he any idea of the position in which farmers find themselves? They are bunged up with bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>An edition of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal </i>states that last November it understood from whoever told it that this situation had eased and the Minister has again tried to make out that it has eased, but the reality is different. The changes in penalties are more severe. The penalty rates have increased for irregularities and there is a new formula for calculating the number of irregularities on which the penalty rates are applied. Farmers are afraid to apply for schemes. Older farmers cannot deal with what is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was interesting that the Minister said the information is being sent to the farmer and his adviser, but who pays the adviser? The farmer must pay an adviser for everything he or she does, whether filling in forms or applying for a grant, <Col N="915" /> and he or she must do so out of a lower income than he or she has had in years.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister voted against what was proposed in November, but did he make any effort to point out how farmers are being treated as criminals for minor irregularities while staff within the Department can make irregularities and get off scot free? I have no problem with staff getting off scot free &ndash; anyone can make a mistake &ndash; but it is completely unjustified for farmers to be treated as rogues and as people who try to do things wrong. They sometimes lose two years' premium. I would like the Minister to clarify the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that these schemes are complex and mindboggling for many farmers. I was to the forefront in bringing this matter to the attention of Commissioner Fischler and at the Council of Ministers they agreed to seek to simplify the schemes and reduce the penalties as much as possible. They published a report on 12 December, but that did not improve the situation substantially and in some cases may have made it marginally worse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In some cases, yes. One does not get a nil payment unless one has 20% incorrect animals on an application. That, in itself, is an improvement.</P>
      <P>I decided that a number of farmers needed more help. Some 165 of the 169,000 applicants for the special beef scheme did not have a problem and got their payments on time, but more than 4,000 applicants had a problem with their applications. Some 2,900 of the 71,000 applicants for the suckler cow scheme had a problem with their applications. A small core of problems are encountered in applying for the schemes which pose a serious problem for the farmers concerned.</P>
      <P>I have arranged information meetings and I am trying to find some other way of reaching those farmers &ndash; the most helpless in society, usually small farmers &ndash; who need additional care and attention. The emphasis at these information meetings is to ensure applicants avoid penalties and maximise their payments. No other government of a member state of the European Union goes to as much trouble to make sure farmers get their due entitlements.</P>

I understand the receiver has now sold the premises of Tralee Beef and Lamb Limited as a meat processing plant and that the purchasers propose commencing production in the facility within the next three months.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the greatest sympathy for the farmers concerned who supplied animals to Tralee Beef and Lamb. Before the closure of the company farmers had to await payment for a period of four or five weeks. The company was able to avail of that period and pay additional money over and above what was being paid by the vast majority in the industry who pay farmers on the day they supply. There are no circumstances under which a government could intervene where a company was trading under those conditions and bail it out when matters such as this occur and the company goes into liquidation.</P>
      <P>My best advise to farmers is to trade with plants which pay on the day. Other formulae are brought forward from time to time such as bonding and a range of other practices similar to it, but there is no substitute for the farmer being paid on the day he or she supplies his or her animals. That saves the farmer and the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>Given that farmers will have lost more than &euro;3 million, it should be possible to provide some assistance to compensate them in some way. The Minister may be aware that in some cases their total annual kill was lost for which they did not get paid. This will spell ruin for a number of farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="917" />Following the Taoiseach's meeting with farmer representatives in November, farmers held out some hope that some aid would be provided, but that has not materialised. Will the Minister examine the possibility of compensating farmers for some of their losses, perhaps under the slaughter premium scheme or through some other provision, given that I understand from the liquidator there will be very little money available to farmers in the winding up of the company? </P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat I have the greatest sympathy possible for the farmers concerned. As the Deputy said, I understand when the liquidator was appointed by the High Court on 29 January to distribute the balance of moneys available to unsecured creditors the indications were that the total amount available for distribution would be negligible when compared to the amounts owed. That is a pity and difficult for the farmers concerned. When a company such as this delays making payments for a month or more and the dogs in the street know there is a difficulty concerning it, it is not good sense to continue trading with it. I do not know of any way the farmers concerned can be helped by the Exchequer. However, I will take the Deputy's suggestion on board and see if there is some creative mechanism whereby help can be given but I do not know of any system at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>A Presidency compromise on reform of the sheepmeat regime was adopted by a majority vote at a meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 19 December 2001. The final compromise submitted by the Presidency provided for a basic premium of &euro;21 per ewe to be supplemented by a national envelope equivalent to &euro;1.22 approximately per ewe for all producers. In addition, the compromise included a supplementary premium of &euro;7 per ewe for producers in disadvantaged areas. In other words, there is a total of &euro;29 for sheep farmers in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="918" />I saw the proposed reform as giving an opportunity both to redress some of the problems which we have had with the sheepmeat regime over the years and to place the industry on a sound footing for the future. Sheep production falls very much within the European model of agriculture in view of its extensive nature and land use requirements. I made a strong case in the negotiations for the premium to be fixed at a level which ensures that sheepmeat remains a viable farm enterprise.</P>
    <P>The outcome, while not as much as we would like, is reasonable. It provides permanency in the premium, in other words, a fixed premium, and the premium is double the amount paid last year. In addition, sheep farmers and the sheepmeat industry had a record year last year and I hope that situation will continue into the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that Ireland was isolated and outvoted in December and found itself in the company of Sweden, a country that opposes any payment? Will he agree that it indicates a hardening of the attitude of the EU Commission towards farmers' payments and that the attitude towards agriculture at EU level, with countries such as Germany and Holland believing payments are too generous, indicates we have lost all support and friends at that level? Does the Minister disagree with the IFA, which claims the outlook for the coming year is not as healthy as it was last year? The IFA believes there will be a fall-off in British demand for sheep once other markets are opened. Is that the Minister's opinion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, Deputy Penrose is correct that a number of countries voted against this proposal because it was too generous. We voted against it because we believed it was inadequate. The sheepmeat industry has had a good year. Prices were up by an average of 26% and I believe the buoyancy in prices will continue for the remainder of this year, mainly because of the substantial cull in the UK. The main destination for Irish sheepmeat is the French market so we are benefiting from the gap in the market due to the lack of sheep from the UK. Even though the UK has access to the market as well, it does not have access to the same numbers of sheep.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for my late arrival &ndash; I was given the wrong time. As the Minister for Defence informed the House on the Order of Business, the Garda Commissioner is gravely concerned that any doubt should be cast on the accuracy of <Col N="920" /> information which may form part of the Garda annual report.</P>
      <P>The commissioner, who was informed yesterday that <i>The Star</i> had information about the treatment of crime statistics for 2001 in Waterford city Garda district, appointed a chief superintendent from outside the region to review all aspects of the specific information received and also all crime reported and detected for 2001 in this district. Given the importance of the figures contained in the commissioner's annual report on crime, the chief superintendent's report will be made public.</P>
      <P>I share Deputies' concerns about these allegations. While the Minister has no role and does not intervene in the compilation of crime statistics, it goes without saying that public confidence must be upheld in the bona fides of crime statistics emanating from the Garda Síochána, the organisation solely responsible for their compilation. It must be recognised that the crimes which are the subject of this controversy occurred in 2001, for which the commissioner's report has yet to be finalised. The Minister has been informed by the commissioner that the process of processing preliminary crime figures for 2001 is under way throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister considers that this situation underlines the need for caution in placing reliance on preliminary crime figures. He and his predecessors have called repeatedly for such caution inside and outside the House. As the Minister outlined to the House in a recent debate on a Private Members' motion, the reason for this is that preliminary figures are almost invariably subject to change as part of the validation process. To illustrate the wisdom of this, the final statistics in the recently published 2000 annual report show significant differences from the preliminary ones gathered during the year.</P>
      <P>The Minister rejects the unwarranted generalisations made today about the validity and authenticity of official Garda crime statistics. He reminds the House that the current allegations relate to 14 alleged instances in one Garda district from a total of 107 districts. It is grossly unfair and empirically unwarranted to make the leap from the specific to the general. Any attempt to do so is an attempt to make political capital out of a localised issue, albeit an important one.</P>
      <P>The Minister's record on crime is there for all to see. Between 1995 and 2000, there was an unprecedented drop in serious crime of 28.5%, making the 2000 crime figures the lowest for 20 years. Unprecedented levels of resources were given to the Garda, the courts and the prisons and the issue of prisons' revolving doors, which did so much to discredit the criminal justice system, was ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The newspaper allegations are serious but they do not and cannot be used to denigrate a record of achievement second to none in the field of criminal justice. The allegations are being carefully investigated and the results will be made public by the commissioner. The Minister is satis<Col N="921" /> fied that all that can be done is being done and it is now time to await due process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that Superintendent John Farrelly said on RTE radio this afternoon that the documents have proved to be genuine? How then, in the Minister's name, can she say that the Opposition is engaged in unwarranted generalisation? How does she know that this has not occurred in other districts or other years? Does she accept that her statement displays the complacency that has characterised the tenure of office of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue? Is she also aware that the documentation, given to newspapers and me, contains a statement that the crime figures in this district were fudged for five years, that the whole station knew of it and that it was privately the biggest joke in the station? If that is the view of someone who put documents, which now appear to be genuine, into the public domain, is there not an unanswerable case for an independent investigation, led by an external authority, and for the establishment of a Garda ombudsman such as the one in Northern Ireland?</P>

      <P>Does the Minister and her senior colleague stand over the Garda crime report for 2000? Why is the reassessment of the manner in which Garda crime figures are recorded in Water<Col N="922" /> ford city confined to 2001 and does not include 2000? Is she surprised that Waterford city Garda district in the 2000 report records a detection rate of 68%, dramatically higher than any other district? Does she regard that as substantiating the statement in the document received by Members that privately this district's statistics are a joke? Is she aware that the next highest rate recorded in 2000 is for the Waterford-Kilkenny area, which at 58% is substantially above any other district? Does she agree that a checking of the figures should include a re-examination of those districts in 2000 and that an independent audit should be made of the veracity of the original documentation which led to the publication of the 2000 report?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are other gaps in the report for 2000 which clearly indicate major discrepancies and a failure to record accurately information by members of an Garda Síochána Will she explain to the House what, if anything, the Government has learned in the past five years, particularly in light of the Taoiseach's statement today that he does not see the need for a Garda ombudsman?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Why has the Minister of State tried to play down this disgraceful episode this afternoon? What does she believe is the motivation for this at a local level in Waterford city? If it is endemic in the Waterford city area, then how widespread does she feel this is? What punishment does the Minister of State feel is appropriate for individual gardaí who have doctored statistics in this way? Does she agree that this is a compelling case for the introduction of a police <Col N="923" /> ombudsman? Clearly internal investigations, as we have seen, do not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the Deputy's question about how widespread this is, the Minister is fully aware that an incident such as the one being discussed, following other high profile cases, has the potential to damage the reputation and good standing of the Garda. We are aware of that. It is natural, therefore, that the question of independent oversight of the Garda should be raised by Deputy Gormley and others. The Minister has addressed the issue of a Garda ombudsman on a number of occasions&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;along the lines of the police ombudsman in Northern Ireland, as has been suggested. Deputies will be aware that it is the Minister's view that it would not be appropriate to simply adopt the Northern Ireland model in this jurisdiction. I can assure the House that work is under way in our Department for the preparation of the legislation required to implement the measures the Minister announced for new inspection arrangements for the gardaí and for dealing with complaints against gardaí by the public. These measures will provide for the establishment of a fully independent Garda inspectorate which will have very extensive powers to examine any aspect of Garda operations. It will be open to the inspectorate to initiate such examinations.</P>
      <P>In addition, the inspectorate will be responsible for handling complaints made against gardaí and will carry out its investigations&mdash;</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that this incident is only the latest in a series of incidents which indicate serious slippage in the morale of the Garda, in the standards of training of the Garda and in its operational standards? I remind the Minister of State of some of the incidents on the list: Abbeylara, Abbeyleix, the proven fabrication of evidence in a recent court case, <Col N="924" /> the &ldquo;blue flu&rdquo;, the McBrearty affair and the Garda tyres scandal.

      <P>Does the Minister of State accept it is time for a major re-examination of how we account for the standards of the Garda? Does she agree this is far too important to be left to the Minister and that we need an independent system of verification and supervision?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have specific questions. Does the Minister take this matter seriously? Has the Minister been informed that the gardaí believe the documents published this morning are genuine? Has she been told that? If she accepts that this is a serious matter and the documentation is genuine, as stated on RTE by Superintendent John Farrelly &ndash; I checked the website before I came in &ndash; then does she accept at least some of the allegations in the newspapers, which have been accepted as genuine, that this fraudulent practice has gone on for five years? In those circumstances, does she not accept that it is absolutely imperative that the investigation would at least encompass figures for the last five years for the district concerned, if not for the whole country, if there is to be any credibility attached to the crime statistics published by An Garda Síochána? Will the Minister of State accept that the compi<Col N="926" /> lation of statistical facts should be handed over to the Central Statistics Office which handles the provision of statistics for other areas of public activity and public life in the State? It could independently validate and publish more efficiently the statistics on crime upon which important decisions are made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>

      <P>I will repeat the question. Can the Minister of State clarify the difference between preliminary figures and final figures? Why, in the context of the PULSE computer system, are figures now described as preliminary? Can she indicate in the context of the year 2000 what the difference was between the preliminary and final figures and in what way the figures were doctored? Can she confirm to the House that she has been informed that the documentation available on this matter to Members of the House and the news media is accurate and valid and reflects documentation which came out of the Waterford district? </P>

      <P>I opposed the increase in excise duties on petrol and diesel. This will badly hit those totally dependent on the private car and road freight for goods transport in the region I represent where public transport is virtually non-existent.</P>
      <P>I share the anger expressed inside and outside the House at the special tax breaks for professional career sportspeople as set out in the Bill. It is a gimmick and a stroke typical of the Government. There are amateur sportspeople in many sports, including, but not only in the GAA, who give freely of their time and effort every week with no financial reward and no desire for financial reward. Trainers and administrators of sports and youth clubs are doing tremendous work with young people, often in the most deprived communities. These same clubs must go through the demeaning annual process of applying directly to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation for sports capital grants. The sports capital grants are clearly regarded as a goody bag for distribution by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Last year the Minister favoured his own constituency once again, though I have no doubt that all the recipients were deserving. In CavanMonaghan, the Minister's Fianna Fáil colleagues were informed of the allocations before other elected representatives. In one case a Fianna Fáil councillor told a sports club member that he was giving him the news of the club's grant, &ldquo;before Ó Caoláin got the list&rdquo;. Such practices are an abuse of the sports capital grant scheme and can only bring it into disrepute. That is the type of thinking that dominates the allocation of sports capital grants and is also the type of thinking behind this special tax break for a tiny elite of sportspeople. It gives out the message that the elite who make it big are the ones who really matter while the people on the ground must wait for the crumbs from the table.</P>
      <P>A report by the European Centre for Social Welfare Policy published just before the budget found this State fourth from the bottom of the 15 EU countries in terms of wealth distribution &ndash; only Greece, Spain and Portugal fared worse. That is thanks to four years of economic management, or mismanagement, by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, and this year, the fifth, is equally flawed and inequitable. It is past the time for the Minister and his colleagues to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sad attack was levelled at me earlier in this debate by Deputy Crawford whom I note has left the Chamber. His begrudgery knows no bounds. <Col N="931" /> I availed of the first opportunity to host a US delegation that came to Ireland following from the Washington conference on trade and investment in the mid-1990s. I used my skills and talents to encourage, not only US industrialists but more importantly the US Department of Commerce, to take a fresh look at the opportunities the Border counties, particularly Cavan and Monaghan, had to offer US investing companies. That visit was a resounding success, so much so that they came back again but Deputy Crawford conveniently forgets the tragedy that followed.</P>
    <P>The US Secretary of Commerce, Ron Brown and the assistant secretary, Chuck Meissner and other senior staff members were tragically killed in a air accident over Bosnia. All my invested effort and the warmth and goodwill towards Ireland and the Border counties died with those great and tragic players. They were special &ndash; may they rest in peace. I have continued my lobbying work with influential US Administration personnel in both the Clinton and Bush years. I sought and secured the assistance of key players in Washington when the interests of Cavan and Monaghan required it.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm seans a fháil labhairt ar an mBille Airgeadais agus ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Rialtas as an am a thabhairt dom an uair seo<b>.</b></P>
      <P>
        <b>
        </b>It is important to point out that this Finance Bill, one of a series, as we have heard time and again from Government spokespeople, is set against the backdrop, which cannot be overlooked, of a growing gap between rich and poor. As the previous speaker mentioned, internationally we compare badly in dealing with that gap and, rather than closing it, we have continued to widen it. Notwithstanding the very positive releases that come from the Government Press Office, that is a reality that cannot be denied. There are a number of figures also from Departments, which indicate that the priorities in this Bill are not the areas of greatest need.</P>
      <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment gives a figure of 13,000 heroin users. An RTE &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme of last year quoted an ESRI figure showing that the number of families with disabilities living in poverty has doubled to 72% of the total. In the recent debate on crime in this House it was revealed that Garda figures for 1999 showed 10,110 cases of domestic violence<b>. </b>The Eastern Regional Health Authority indicates that there are 5,000 methadone users in the greater Dublin area. Focus Ireland revealed an increase in the number of people on waiting lists between 1987 and 1999 of 253%, up from 18,000 to 45,578. What hope is there for people with disabilities, certainly those who are under 18, people who are marginalised, and for the wider environment when those with a vote continue to return the same type of Government time and again? That is a question that puzzles many people who study those figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="932" />The ESRI gives very considered advice to the Government and, indeed, much of that advice is accepted. Today the ESRI hosts a conference focusing on an area which I have a mandate to address in this House &ndash; the environment. In its press summary it talks about Ireland not yet having taken the market-based approach to environmental protection advocated by the European environment agency and the OECD. They say eco-taxes, charges for environmental services and tradeable permits to pollute are known to be effective, but their impact must be measured against the less controversial approach of public education, direct government expenditure and licensing and regulation. The national climate change strategy, published by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, announced the introduction of taxes on CO2 emissions, starting on a gradual basis in 2002, as well as emissions trading. These proposals require careful preparation and it is in the Finance Bill, 2002, that one looks for signs of this. We do not see any, instead there are measures to bolster the number in the workplace, not by simply encouraging them, but by forcing them.</P>
    <P>I refer to the two income families which, if they had a choice, would try to live on one income. They do not have that choice and so are forced to make arrangements which do not benefit the health of their children or themselves. They are instead forced to get up earlier, go to bed later, work more hours than ever and spend more time travelling. That is the lifestyle the Bill underpins and I beg the Government to have regard to those who are sending postcards to me and I am sure to every Deputy pleading against individualisation of taxation. They are distraught at the effect reliance on two incomes has on family life and the community, in which the level of volunteerism has dropped as a result. I hope the Government will get the message. If it does not, I hope the next Government will. The individualisation of taxation may be of benefit in the short-term, but in the long-term it will seriously damage the fabric of community and family life.</P>
    <P>I have been interested in debates in this House on corporation tax. The Bill is one of the vehicles for copperfastening the levels at which that tax is paid. The Tánaiste has made the point, as I have, that research and development need to be encouraged, but a rate of corporation tax as low as ours is a disincentive. It attracts the kind of investment that does not give much priority to research and development. It is also very mobile, which moves out as quickly as it moved in when the winds of change blow internationally. I hope this point is taken by the Minister for Finance and the Government as our levels of corporation tax ought to be geared toward securing long-term, not short-term, investment. They should aim to secure investment that could become indigenous, if it is not already. It should be nationalised to become part of our economy and community development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" />On the issue of helping punters, the point is made that the Minister for Finance is a keen racegoer, to which there seems to be an element of truth given his comments. This country has a problem with gambling which is widely glamorised. Winning the lottery is seen as the greatest ambition in life. This creates a hunger for a fantasy world that can only ever be enjoyed by very few. In the meantime, the issues that need to be dealt with and the valid input people can have are overlooked.</P>
    <P>Voluntary work in the community is suffering badly and made even more difficult by provisions of the Bill. I am sure the Social Welfare Bill to follow will compound this. People are told they cannot volunteer if they are not in full-time paid employment. They must stop volunteering and find paid employment, even if the work is destructive and unhealthy or meaningless and boring. As long as it is paid, it is considered better for the economy than voluntary work involving helping other people, community development or &ndash; in a case close to my heart &ndash; helping to rehabilitate wildlife and provide employment in ecotourism which the Irish Seal Sanctuary has been trying to achieve. In spite of its appeals and the logic inherent in its work, which provides the genesis of full-time employment and a facility which Ireland, unlike other coastal European countries, does not have, it is told by the social welfare appeals officer that its activities are not in line with the Government's legislation. It is a scandal that people who are prepared to give of their time to do a job that needs to be done and which helps local authorities and the community are told they cannot do it.</P>
    <P>The case for people like those working at the Irish Seal Sanctuary provides a barometer of how sick the economy has become. It tells people they will get no help from the State, even though they are doing valuable work. That work has been endorsed by every local authority around the coastline when faced with injured wildlife, unsuitable imported pets and exotic animals. People find and bring them to this place where they are cared for and rehabilitated. They attract many visitors and create a rewarding experience for those who volunteer there who are told their work is not valued and that they must stop and find paid employment, which will, in most cases, be less meaningful and useful. That is a scandal. I urge the Government to look again at ensuring the Irish Seal Sanctuary gets £1.5 million which, in the context of the budget and other projects discussed here, is not a huge amount of money.</P>
    <P>The case being made that sportspersons should be given tax relief is one that will no doubt find favour among those who will benefit, but we must ask the question of whether we are focusing on the areas of greatest need. I know a number of elite sportspersons who do need help with training facilities, but that is assistance they require now. They do not need help into the future in terms of tax reliefs. I wonder if this is just another case of the Minister indulging his own interests, <Col N="934" /> rather than looking at the wider picture. Certainly, there are areas of much greater need than the one on which he has focused.</P>
    <P>The essential problem with the Government is that it fails to see the writing on the wall in terms of planning for the future. It believes that as long as GNP and GDP are increasing, somehow there will be enough money in the kitty to pay for whatever comes along and whatever problems we encounter. The difficulty, however, is that we have no idea how insurmountable the problem will be. We and insurance companies are already encountering the problem of the money required to cope with the problems of climate change. That cost involves more than the premia the insurance companies will charge because of increased storm damage and whatever other motivations they may have, such as profit which is the legitimate objective of any business. They also are encountering growing costs worldwide. I am sick of sounding that warning. If I am not believed by the Government for whatever political reason, let it at least listen to the insurance companies and take note of the growing number of claims worldwide as a result of storm damage. Year after year they are pushing up premia and making it increasingly difficult for people in areas prone to flooding to get insurance and making increasing numbers of people vulnerable to damage.</P>

      <P>Is féidir leis an Aire Stáit a rá go bhfuil an rud céanna ag tarlúint a tharla cheana féin ach tá mise ag caint faoi fíricí, faoin eolas atá ag eolaithe, ní agamsa. Tá sé á rá ag an OECD agus ag an ESRI sa tír seo chomh maith, gur gá dúinn a bheith ullamh agus nílimid ullamh.</P>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is that there is no preparatory thought in the Bill. It simply limps from one situation to the next. Unfortunately, we will be faced with carbon trading in Ireland. That is a cost which we have never had to contemplate before, on which we cannot even put a price at present and with which this Minister does not even seem to be prepared to cope or contemplate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairness to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, he is also blue in the face talking about the need for the Department of Finance to take on board the reforms in taxation. Such reforms would shift the focus away from income tax, which would be <Col N="935" /> wonderful, and put it on finite resources and carbon based fuels, which must be conserved for all sorts of reasons apart from their finite quantities.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance is blocking that matter at present. There is a perverse view that unless the amount of taxation collected can be quantified at the end of the year, it is not worth having that type of tax. Obviously, eco-taxes, by their nature, are variable because one is encouraging people to save resources and thereby save money. The only way we will be able to have a significant effect on the behaviour of people is if they are made to think twice before spending money, which is a very human instinct.</P>
    <P>Aside from that, the Minister for Finance also must recognise that for this change towards a more sustainable economy to take place, he needs to allow &ndash; he has already done it minimally &ndash; hypothecated taxation. He needs to allow certain moneys that are collected to be used for specific targeted areas. For example, he has made a minimal concession so that the taxation generated through the cost of plastic bags will be used by the Department of the Environment and Local Government for waste related projects which can minimise waste, etc. However, that is a small and insignificant part of the overall problem of waste and energy use in Ireland. Nevertheless, it is a start and, in fairness, I want to give credit where it is due, but let that start be much more significant.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Bill misses an enormous opportunity to address the need to shift our thinking from going along with traditional GNP-GDP measurements to more sustainable and more internationally standardised taxation methods which focus on conserving the use of finite resources. That is something which, by all accounts, has been overlooked. Any talk about it being a significant part of Government is hollow and empty when one reads the Finance Bill because it does not jump out in anything here that it is a consideration in the Department of Finance. That is sad.</P>
    <P>I hope the next Government, whatever its composition, will not just talk about this, put it in its manifesto and then pay lip-service to it, but will actually put into the Finance Bill measures which will shift the tax away from income and onto finite resources. The OECD has made these recommendations clear and if they are not implemented, the warnings are also clear to us all.</P>
    <P>The ESRI has already looked at the effects of this type of change. Competitiveness is a word which is often on the lips of Ministers and us all. According to the ESRI, competitiveness will be enhanced if this is done in a way that suits Ireland. This is why it must be done by the Government. When the Government talks about allowing it to be an EU wide measure and that we would implement eco-taxes based on what the EU decides, it fails to appreciate that other EU member states will have their own conditions and circumstances which will favour a certain type of eco-taxation which may not suit Ireland. By not <Col N="936" /> taking a unilateral position to reform our taxes in line with international standards and not bringing in eco-taxation, which is already in place in Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands and elsewhere, the Government is putting Ireland in a position where it could be disadvantaged by a convergence of taxation in the EU. If we had taken unilateral action and assisted ourselves in maintaining competitiveness, we could have argued that we had already gone the extra mile.</P>
    <P>I make that case strongly to the Minister. When he says to me, as he does from time to time, that whenever the EU reaches agreement on this, we will go along with it, he is risking the future economic prospects of Ireland which would be much better served by taking a unilateral position. If we took up such a position, we would develop the type of economy for which we would then find a market in the future. There will be no future market for countries which do not use their energy with maximum efficiency.</P>
    <P>Maximum efficiency is what eco-taxation is about. It is about making changes such as those which I tried to have included in the Sustainable Energy Bill. It is about creating a lean economy, which is able to provide services and is vibrant and sustainable, but which will not cause problems for itself. These problems, such as traffic congestion or pollution problems, are ones for which we must pay. We will have to not only suffer the health consequences, but also pay for them financially.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill, 2002, is a missed opportunity. The Taoiseach talks to me about bringing in sustainability indicators, but I hope he will do more than just talk about it. If we had sustainability indicators as well as GNP and GDP figures and quality of life indicators, we would be able hold them up, side by side, and realise that there are levels of economic growth which are not to the overall economic benefit of the country, particularly if they result in growing energy demand which means extra costs. Economists often speak about the problem of costs being greater than benefits. Our costs are currently rushing ahead of the benefits. Let us look at that kind of growth and seek growth which will improve quality of life and increase sustainability. That is the kind of growth the Green Party supports. It is important people realise that while criticising the Government the Green Party is saying there is another way. We are trying to put that alternative forward so that we can prepare for the time, which is fast coming, when we will not have the freedom to use fossil fuels in the way we now do. We will not have the same freedoms we have now in terms of large scale international transportation. These are things we will have to face up to. The Green Party wants to see a healthy economy, taking into account future conditions. In that way we will be able to look our children in the eye and tell them we are making preparations for their future, rather than just thinking of the next election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill is a damp squib. <Col N="937" /> It lacks interest, direction or any plan to enhance this country's future. Never before has so much money been awash in the country. Only 12 months ago the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, told us that the country was awash with money, that the Celtic tiger was roaming the country and that there would be no end to the prosperity. The day of reckoning arrived and unfortunately the country that was awash with money had not put it to good use.</P>
      <P>In the last budget it was clearly evident that the Minister for Finance was more interested in the gambling fraternity than in poorer sections of the community. He was careless and reckless and hopelessly failed to meet the demands of the poor. Carers were treated shabbily in the budget. They are providing a valuable service to the elderly who would otherwise be forced to seek hospitalisation, if beds were available. Carers were stunned that the Government did so little for them. After four years of unprecedented economic prosperity during which so little was done for carers, they are now being told they will have to wait because of the downturn in the economy. Does the Government know what carers do? Does it understand how degrading it is to continue to subject carers to means testing?</P>
      <P>The Government has failed to recognise the thousands of family carers across the country who provide 24 hour care for our most frail and disabled citizens. The 100,000 family carers save the State over &euro;1.5 billion per year, yet the budget made no effort to abolish means tests. No carer in a household on an average industrial wage would qualify for the full carer's allowance. This is a shocking indictment of a careless Minister for Finance who has recklessly spent billions of euro.</P>

      <P>Where are the decentralisation programmes for Bantry, Skibbereen, Dunmanway and Castletownbere? We have heard nothing about the decentralisation programme. The Minister of State knows that Bantry bay is the Mecca for aquaculture development and Castletownbere is the largest white fish port in Ireland. The Government has hopelessly failed to decentralise the Departments responsible for fisheries and aquaculture to west Cork. That is the place where it should be based and not on the lanes off Leeson Street in Dublin. The time of reckoning is coming. I can guarantee the Minister of State that the Government has very little time to correct anomalies that exist in the finances of the country.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil's only legacy for south-west Cork was to sell the railway tracks which ran from Cork city to Bantry and Skibbereen and the light rail service which ran from Skibbereen to Schull, to a Third World country in the 1950s. I am told the system still runs perfectly in that country. We were promised by the then Fianna Fáil Government that our road network would be brought to national primary and secondary standards, but that has not happened. There is not one mile of national primary route between Cork, Mizen Head, Dursey Sound and Sheep's Head.</P>

The purpose of the scheme is to make roads of the dirt tracks which lead to farmers' yards in parts of west Cork. That £150,000 would not be enough for three schemes and there is a ten year backlog of applications.

      <P>County Cork also has one of the largest housing waiting lists in the country. The most common problem I experience in my clinic is young married couples and single parent families waiting to be re-housed. We are only skimming the surface of the problem. This has been the greatest disappointment for people, especially with such a huge influx of money to the coffers. I am amazed the housing waiting lists are growing. <Col N="940" /> I understand that, at the rate at which housing is being built in Cork, it will take 20 years to clear the existing backlog.</P>
      <P>It is also evident that a huge number of national school buildings are crumbling and are unfit for human habitation. Some still have outdoor toilets. There is no progress in tackling this problem. I tabled a question two weeks ago to the Minister for Education and Science requesting the list of schools in Cork South-West scheduled for improvement this year. He answered that he was not in a position to tell me because the figures were not broken down on a constituency basis. If I had asked for a similar list for County Cork, the story would have been the same. The Minister is not capable of giving the information because he does not plan to schedule for improvement national schools in north, north-west or east Cork. This is a sad example of the lack of finance under successive Ministers for Education to tackle this serious problem.</P>
      <P>The medical card system is also crumbling. People on a meagre income are put to the pin of their collars to qualify for medical cards. We were told 12 months ago that there would be an enhanced subvention for elderly people to defray the cost of living in nursing homes. It did not arrive and is still in the doldrums. The Minister for Health and Children does not know if he has the money to grant the enhanced subvention. I do not know if he and the Minister for Finance are on speaking terms. I am amazed it has taken so long for the Minister for Health and Children to introduce the subvention for the poor unfortunate people throughout the country who await it.</P>
      <P>The list of patients awaiting admission to hospital is alarming. Hip operations are impossible to obtain unless one pays £6,000 or £7,000 to an orthopaedic surgeon who will do the operation quickly. The poor unfortunate person with a medical card must wait for at least three to four years before he or she can have a hip replacement.</P>
      <P>The same applies for orthodontic treatment, a matter on which I have received many letters. Thousands of schoolchildren throughout the country await orthodontic treatment, many for five, six or seven years, yet there is no provision for them. Some of them have entered secondary education since they were diagnosed in national school as needing treatment. The list is growing, so the time has come for serious debate. If the money is not available, the Minister should say so. He should not try to fool the people who every day expect a letter informing them their children will be called for orthodontic treatment when there is no hope or light at the end of the tunnel. The Minister should try to rectify this before polling day which, I understand, will be in early May. If some progress is not made, it will be serious as far as the health of the children involved is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill contains very little for farmers. The budget was only for betting enthusiasts. The farming community was provided with very little. <Col N="941" /> What has the Minister done to exempt pension premia paid by the self-employed from PRSI and health contributions? A full-time farmer contributing to a private pension fund should not be prohibited from continuing to contribute to this pension on entering the EU farm retirement scheme.</P>
    <P>A person with less than five years contributions should qualify for the special 50% contributory old age pension introduced in 1999 for those with five, but less than ten years PRSI contributions. Furthermore, those with nine years contributions receive the same special rate contributory pension as those with five years contributions. There is no equality in this. There should be a <i>pro rata </i>sliding scale by which a farmer or self-employed person with nine years contributions would get a larger pension than a person with five years contributions.</P>
    <P>Farm spouses should be facilitated in establishing an individual PRSI record. It is a condition of the EU farm retirement scheme that a spouse or farmer can qualify for the pension, whichever is the younger to qualify. The woman of the house is recognised as the joint worker on the farm. A special rate of joint contribution should be paid that would allow a farmer's wife to receive the contributory old age pension at the age of 66 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that topic could more relevantly be dealt with when the Social Welfare Bill is debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision for these matters should also be made in the Finance Bill, the debate on which is the only opportunity Members have to discuss these grievances.</P>
      <P>No advance has been made since the Fine Gael led Government reduced the qualifying age for old age pensions from 70 years to 66. No further reduction has been made in the past 17 years. The Minister should consider reducing the age to 65 years.</P>
      <P>The first £3,000 or 70% of income, whichever is the greater, should be disregarded for the purposes of farm assist. Capital expenses incurred in farm pollution control and related investments should be allowed over any period chosen by the farmer. Expenditure on farm waste management structures should attract an additional investment allowance of 20%. Young trained farmers should be given an additional capital investment allowance of 50%, subject to an overall limit of £50,000. The installation aid grant should be set at the maximum allowable of £19,689. Tax relief on the purchase of milk quotas should be put into effect immediately while expenditure incurred in their purchase should be allowable over a five year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income from a farmland lease between related persons for the purposes of the early retirement scheme should qualify for the same exemption from income tax as is currently available on non-family transactions. A 100% stock relief facility should be available to all farmers. All repay<Col N="942" /> ments, capital and interest, in borrowings by full-time farmers for the purchase of agricultural land to obtain a viable holding should be tax deductible where a tax liability is being incurred. Where no income tax liability occurs, the repayment should be aggregated and carried forward to offset against future income tax liabilities.</P>
    <P>Stamp duty relief for the transfer of a site from a parent to a child, introduced in the Finance Act, 2001, should be extended to include grandchildren, brothers and sisters. This would facilitate childless couples transferring property to their grandchildren, brothers or sisters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>How a grandparent could transfer a farm to a grandchild? Surely be to Heaven that is not asking too much of the Minister?</P>
      <P>Feasibility grants of at least £15,000 should be made available for small, medium and community based alternative energy projects. Capital allowance measures similar to those available for farm pollution control should be introduced by the Minister for Finance for small and medium-scale alternative energy projects while the existing tax exemption of income from the leasing of farmland should be extended to all individuals who make land available by way of lease for alternative energy programmes.</P>
      <P>Small industries need an incentive to keep going. Tourism related industries suffered severely during the foot and mouth disease and BSE crises of last year. Some relief must be given to rural businesses which suffered severely due to the absence of tourists. The Minister should give small industrial units a chance to survive. He should give a 50% reduction in rates for one year to tourism related industries.  </P>
      <P>Much more must be done for the fishing industry. Agriculture, fishing and tourism are our three main natural industries. Every step taken to promote them is a step in the right direction. This is something the Minister should consider.</P>
      <P>The time has come for the Minister to take decisive action with regard to the economy. Approximately 12 months ago the Minister told us the country was awash with money. Unfortunately, the tide went out and the money is not available. Rural Ireland is not experiencing a bonanza. I invite the Minister to my constituency of Cork South-West and I will show him the condition of the roads and schools and the length of the hospital waiting lists. All this amounts to bad management somewhere along the line. It is not too late for the Minister to clean the slate and begin again. Until such time as there are incentives to live in rural Ireland and an industrial revolution begins in parts of the country, the prosperity will not be divided equally among the people of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not matter whether one lives in Ballydehob or Ballsbridge, as citizens of this country, <Col N="943" /> people should have equal rights. Down through the years successive Governments have failed hopelessly to honour that promise. I ask the Minister, before it is too late, to retract his steps and put the country back on a level footing. There is only a limited time left to do so until the electorate give their answer.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>The Finance Bill following from the budget in December outlines and enshrines the priorities of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, a Government which rules overwhelmingly on behalf of the wealthy and the corporate sector in our society. This is nowhere more clear than in the hugely favourable tax treatment afforded to corporations and employers in this State. The Minister indicates the groups to which his party is beholden by again this year cutting the rate of corporation tax to 16%. His figures indicate that in a full year he will hand back &euro;329 million to the corporate sector as a result of that tax cut. This is a corporate sector which has enjoyed for several years a massive bonanza in terms of profits beyond its wildest dreams, yet the Minister for Finance gives a further hand-out to a sector which has been hugely favoured over decades by contrast with PAYE workers. As a result of cuts in PRSI he is giving back a further &euro;347 million in a full year to the employers sector. In one fell swoop, the Minister is handing back a massive &euro;676 million to a sector which is already hugely profitable and wealthy. At the same time his corporation and county council colleagues are imposing local service charges on householders. They are increasing the charges that already exist with the cry that local authorities need the funds to maintain or improve services.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party cannot have it both ways. The Minister, on the one hand, is making great play of cutting the level of personal taxation to PAYE workers while, on the other, his local authority colleagues are taking it back in a dishonest fashion. In the case of the local authority on which I serve, as a result of the actions of the Minister's colleagues in Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats, the Green Party and some Independents, householders face a local taxation charge of &euro;260 for this year. This is a new charge levied under the guise of an environmental charge, in effect, a bin tax. This is happening throughout the country. Let me say to the Minister that the residents of the greater Dublin area are not at all impressed or taken in by his coming in here on budget day and, with a flourish, making some cuts in personal taxation and taking some low paid people out of the tax net &ndash; many more should have been taken out &ndash; while at the same time imposing a local tax, through his colleagues at local level, on the very same people. Householders and residents see through this. I hope when the Minister and his colleagues call to people's homes during the general election campaign they will hear this quite clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the spectacle, therefore, of the Minister giving back huge amounts to the corporate sector while local authorities chase and relent<Col N="944" /> lessly pursue those who still fund the huge bulk of the taxation system. I understand that dozens of decent householders and taxpayers in Drogheda will be dragged before the courts next week because of their opposition to such a local charge. I would like the Minister to comment on his thinking on local taxation and whether he agrees with the suggestion which seems to be coming from elements within the Department of Finance that a parallel taxation regime under the cover of charges for services to the tune or &euro;600 or &euro;700 per annum may be encouraged by this Administration. Where does the Minister stand on this issue?</P>
    <P>On the financing of local authorities, if the &euro;676 million the Minister is putting into the pockets of the rich and super rich in a full tax year were committed to the improvement of local authority services not only would these local taxes not be enacted but the level of services could be hugely improved. On the issue of the environment and waste management, and the putting in place of meaningful and effective measures in terms of reducing waste, recycling programmes and so on, a massive amount could be done with such investment. However, the Minister is putting his political priorities and that minority of society which his party favours before such social considerations.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister lauded the so-called public private partnerships and indicated this is the way the Government will go to fund public infrastructure in the future. The Government has been responsible for the privatisation of more public services than any Government in the history of the State. There have been shameful privatisations where very effective public services, whether small banks that were performing a service or telecom industries, have been handed over to big business, multinational corporations and international capital to become playthings of speculators, with no reference to the common good. There was certainly no reference to the ordinary working people of this country who were badly burned in the case of telecoms, but the Minister plans to continue along these lines, allegedly as a way forward to provide infrastructure for the State in the future.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the earliest version of public-private partnership happened some time ago in my constituency in the form of the West Link toll bridge. That particular adventure is turning out to be an unmitigated disaster for the residents of the greater Dublin area, commuters in particular. A private company was given a virtual gold mine across the River Liffey in terms of being allowed to charge a toll. It is currently making huge profits. A further redevelopment and extension of the service are envisaged, part of which may have to be funded by the public purse. However, the private company will continue to rake in a huge amount of funds. On any working day the cost of this example of public-private partnership is that hard-pressed workers trying to get home from work have to sit in queues of cars from the toll bridge over the Liffey back up to Finglas and beyond. The greatest single barrier to traffic in <Col N="945" /> the greater Dublin area is evident from this particular example, which the Minister wants replicated around the country according to his budget speech. I think he wants to create 11 other such developments. He is essentially handing out the risk free sectors of infrastructure to private companies in order that they can make a fortune. This is not the way forward.</P>
    <P>Another area of major concern, the effects of which I see every day, is the housing sector. The zig-zag policy of the Government with regard to the private rented sector and the manner in which the so-called investors &ndash; speculators in reality &ndash; are treated are mind-boggling. One year, disincentives are put in the way of speculators, the next they are removed and new incentives put back. The result of this mishmash is a disaster for tens of thousands of ordinary working people and young people throughout the country waiting on the housing lists. I refer, in particular, to the tens of thousands at the mercy of private landlords &ndash; the very speculators who priced the ordinary working people and young people out of the market and now hold them to ransom for rents that one would imagine should be sufficient to rent a castle rather that a modest three bedroom semi-detached house or small apartment in this city. That is the result of the Government's housing policy. Unfortunately, all we have in this particular Finance Bill is a further continuation of the process.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister, in particular, if he will provide any relief for one group of householders currently in a terrible bind with regard to their mortgage repayments. He is probably aware that questions have been addressed to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in recent times regarding householders who purchased their homes with Housing Finance Agency loans and are now forced to pay a very high interest rate &ndash; a cripplingly high interest rate that has given rise, in some cases, to the most incredible anomalies. Will he make some provision in the Bill to overcome this grave difficulty for working people?</P>
    <P>One particular household bought a home in 1985 for £26,000. By 1995, although having made all their repayments, the amount outstanding was £37,000 &ndash; I am using round figures. By 2001, the amount outstanding was £42,000. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government said in a reply that in this bind there were about 44,000 households, and some more of which he was made aware thereafter, and that it would cost about £11 million to the Exchequer to resolve the problem. Will the Minister make this change and free the people concerned from the shackles in which they are bound due to massively high interest rates? This is really unjust in comparison with the way things are operating.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister refer to a particular body with which I was involved and to which I offered assistance over many years &ndash; the Irish Seal Sanctuary. The Department of the Taoiseach promised to be quite helpful in this regard. The sanctuary is providing a very important service for vulnerable wildlife, and was not favoured with a once-off grant in the budget. Will the Minister <Col N="946" /> lend his hand to this very worthwhile project, which is performing a very important function making people sensitive to the needs of vulnerable wildlife and awakening an appreciation of wildlife among young people and wider sections of our society?</P>
    <P>Da bhrí sin, mar chríoch, cuireann sé an-díoma orm, mar Theachta ón bPáirtí Sóisialach, an dóigh ina bhfuil an Rialtas tar éis déileáil leis an mbuiséad áirithe seo agus é ag teacht chun cinn leis an mBille Airgeadais seo.

    <P>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy): I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate on the Bill yesterday and today. Many comments focused on general economic and budgetary issues. Concern was voiced by Deputy Mitchell that I did not refer to economic circumstances. Deputy Mitchell and others painted an unfavourable picture of the Government's handling of the economy. I am very proud of the record of the Government in successfully managing the Irish economy in its term in office. Between 1997 and 2001 real GDP in Ireland rose at an average rate of 9.7% per annum; Irish income levels and living standards improved significantly; total employment rose by over 300,000; unemployment fell to an estimated average of 4% last year; long-term unemployment has fallen to around 1.2%; and involuntary emigration has been eliminated.</P>
    <P>This country's future economic outlook is bright. There is a consensus among economic commentators on this. To secure this future outlook in the longer term, I have taken steps to improve the long-term sustainability of the public finances by putting 1% of GNP by law each year into the National Pensions Reserve Fund on a statutory basis. Deputy McDowell expressed his scepticism and doubts as to whether this provision was necessary and whether we genuinely faced a demographic time bomb. I have no doubt that we must provide now to meet the certain increase in liabilities we will face as the population ages.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the facts. There are about 430,000 people aged 65 and over today. Given the numbers now aged 40 and over in our population, we know there will be about 730,000 people aged 65 and over in 2025. The number will be somewhere above 1.1 million in 2050. There are about four workers today for everybody of pension age. The prospect is that there will be fewer than three people at work per person of pension age in 2025. By 2050 there will be fewer than two people at work per person of pension age.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell need not take my word for <Col N="947" /> it. The EU Economic Policy Committee in its 2001 report on this issue projects that demographic changes will lead to an increase in public spending on pensions in Ireland from 4.6% of GNP in 2000 to 9% in 2050. The National Pension Reserve Fund is a prudent policy, which I believe we should see through to completion for all our sakes. I am concerned to protect the operation of the fund and let it seek the best return on its assets to provide for our future. I believe that is Deputy Mitchell's position too.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell claimed that budget 2002 is off the rails on the basis of developments since the budget. On the contrary, the economic outlook has improved since budget time, helped to an extent by the measures in the budget. As far as expenditure and revenue are concerned, it is obviously difficult to make a judgment based on one month's figures. Last year's January revenue figures were very good compared to the outturn for the rest of 2001. This shows the problems in making forecasts on limited data. The forecasts are based as normal on projections regarding economic growth, tax elasticities and changes in tax rates and tax collection procedures. They are not politically inspired as the Deputy sought to make out.</P>
    <P>I do not share Deputy Mitchell's characterisation of the Central Bank nor the doubts he expressed over its independence in analysis and views on certain issues. The new legislation on financial regulation is complex but it is being progressed with a view to publishing the Bill this session.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell paid me the compliment of saying that I have been consistent and coherent in my approach and I thank him for that. However, I have some difficulties in ascertaining a consistency and coherence in some of the criticisms being made of the Government's policies.</P>
    <P>Deputies Mitchell, McGrath and others seem to suggest that my changes in income tax have both excessively targeted the better off and not reduced the tax burden. At the same time Fine Gael is suggesting a middle tax rate of 30%, effectively a 12% cut in the top rate of tax, which helps higher income earners.</P>
    <P>Deputies McDowell, Rabbitte and Higgins referred to the figures I used which show that over 40% of tax cuts I made since 1997 went on personal allowances and credits which help all taxpayers, especially the lower paid. However, by their reckoning one third of benefits went to those on the higher rate because of the widening of the standard rate band and the reduction in the top rate. In Deputy McDowell's words, those on the highest rate who needed tax relief least benefited most, but whom are we talking about when we mention the higher tax rate and widening the tax bands? We are talking about many middle income earners, workers on the average industrial wage. In 1997, a single person on 89% of the average industrial wage was liable for tax at the higher rate. The Government sought to address that issue and did so successfully. Is Deputy McDowell seriously suggesting that such <Col N="948" /> taxpayers should not have benefited from the tax reform?</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell suggested yesterday that the &euro;223 million which I used to widen the standard rate bands in budget 2002 could have gone the full way to exempt those on the minimum wage from the tax net. The approach which I took in the budget was a reasonable one that sought to make progress on a number of issues within the limits of available resources. I would refer the Deputy to the ESRI analysis of the budget as quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i>, which concluded: &ldquo;the impact of budget 2002 is highly progressive, favouring those with the lowest incomes&rdquo;. <i>The Irish Times</i> is not noted for being favourably disposed towards me. That article by the ESRI said the budget was the most socially progressive of the last 15 at least.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate yesterday, Deputy Jim Mitchell made a comment on the effect of the Government's policy of widening the standard rate band. The Deputy suggested that as a result we are now in a position where if one spouse of a two earner married couple were to lose his or her job, the couple would end up paying more income tax. I indicated that this could not happen in so far as our calculations are concerned. Take an example of a two income couple, one spouse with income of &euro;45,000 and the other with income of &euro;24,500, in or around the current average industrial wage. Let us assume also that the couple splits their credits equally so that each has the benefit of a personal and a PAYE credit. The net tax liability of the couple, assuming post-budget 2002 credits and bands, is &euro;12,510. If the spouse with the lower income loses his or her job, there is no income attributable to that spouse on which income tax may be charged. However, the income tax position of the other spouse may not remain the same as before. Instead, that person may avail of a wider standard band &ndash; the married one-earner band. He or she may also avail of the married personal tax credit. The net result is that the tax liability of the couple would fall to &euro;7,060. In this example the couple's income drops by 35%, but the net income tax liability drops by 44%. I am prepared to look at the case to which the Deputy referred and, if he would like to send me the details, I will have it examined before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy is referring to the position of married one-income couples relative to married two-income couples on the same income, that is a different question and we have been down that road many times before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>No. While I am happy to hear that Deputy McDowell's party will not be reversing the various income tax reductions of the Government, he indicated he would consider the case for an increase in the rate of capital gains tax from its existing 20% rate apparently in order to increase the yield. I would like to point out that the reduction in the CGT rate from 40% to 20% was followed by a large increase in yield <Col N="949" /> from the tax, from about £130 million in 1997 to about £690 million in 2001.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that many persons who own assets would have no objection to paying CGT at 20% on the gains arising on their disposal but would find difficulty in paying CGT at 40%. Instead, they would prefer to hold on to the assets until later. If they hold on to the assets until their death, no CGT arises because death is not a disposal for CGT purposes. Thus a reversal to the 1997 position of a 40% CGT rate could lead to a decrease in the yield, which is not what the Deputy wants.</P>
      <P>Reflecting again on the lack of consistency from the Opposition, on the one hand I am criticised for letting current expenditure increase, on the other hand I am criticised for not having expanded the public services in a way that would require increased public expenditure. I first challenge the criticisms of some Deputies in relation to spending control. In 2002, voted current spending is projected at 22.6% of GNP. This compares with current spending at 23.5% of GNP in 1996. The Government is planning public spending effectively within an overall medium-term fiscal framework, taking into account revenue projections and the key issues which need to addressed in our economy. We are committed to managing competing demands for increased public expenditure, with a focus on effectiveness of spending.</P>
      <P>Deputies Mitchell, Durkan, Belton and others restated the case they see in social justice for compensating Eircom shareholders. I do not see that case, nor do many commentators. As for an independent body setting flotation prices in future, as suggested by Deputy Mitchell, I do not agree. The Minister for Finance has a responsibility to protect the Exchequer and account to the House for this responsibility. I do not see that devolving this responsibility to some non-accountable body is the appropriate way to proceed. The Government elected by the people acting through its Ministers is the appropriate and democratic way to safeguard the overall public interest.</P>
      <P>Many speakers in the debate referred to the proposed new tax relief for sportspersons. I welcome the supportive comments made by some. However, the suggestions from Deputies Deenihan, McGrath and others that the relief is anti-GAA are based on a misconception. This is not, as some Deputies seem to believe, a scheme designed to provide grant-type support for sportspersons. It is based on an approach that income earned from direct sporting activities should have a treatment that recognises the particular challenges and achievements that arise in earning that income and the short earning career involved. Of its nature, it can apply only where sports earnings are involved. Deputy Browne recognised this point. In this context, Deputy Deenihan made the comparison with artists' tax relief which applies only to earnings from the artistic work, not any other earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Opposition was quick to criticise the tax relief for retiring sportspersons, there was little comment from them on a measure in the Bill that can benefit every club and organisation <Col N="950" /> in the country, including those involved in promoting our national games. Section 39 is aimed at providing support for the construction and refurbishment of sports facilities, the improvement of playing pitches and the purchase of permanently based equipment. I am confident that this relief will be of immense benefit to organisations throughout the country and provide for an improvement in the standard of sports facilities nationwide.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies questioned the reason for the reduction in the betting tax rate. As many Deputies will be aware, the United Kingdom abolished its consumer betting tax in October 2001 and replaced it with a 15% gross profits tax. This change, allied with the growth in telephone and Internet betting, would have seen reduced business and betting tax revenues in this country. Accordingly, the rate is being reduced to one which will keep the industry competitive and keep jobs and revenue here.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell asked about carbon taxes and the climate change strategy. As he indicated, considerable work has been undertaken led by the Department of the Environment and Local Government to assess and develop a range of measures dealing with this problem. He will also know from the tax strategy group papers that considerable further detailed assessment is necessary if we are to develop measures that take into account the effect on Ireland's international competitiveness and the effect that the imposition of such taxes may have on the consumer price index and the less well off members of our community. As the Deputy knows, I announced excise increases on petrol and auto diesel which took effect from budget night, which are consistent with this strategy, though I note he seems to be criticising these increases.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that there have been calls to abolish VRT while, on the other hand, there have been calls for further environmental taxes. In my December 1998 budget I restructured VRT to favour smaller cars by raising VRT on larger cars. At the time I said that the increases in VRT would yield a contribution from the motoring sector to meet additional road use and environmental damage arising from the unprecedented growth in private car usage in the State. VRT is an important source of revenue for the Exchequer, especially given the Government's strategy of reducing income tax and corporation tax. It brings in around &euro;800 million to the Exchequer. To recover around &euro;800 million in revenue would require, for example, a 36 cent excise duty increase in the price of petrol per litre, or an increase in the standard rate of income tax of over two percentage points.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell asked the reason I increased the BES company limit from its current level when the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment review of the scheme did not suggest it. I point out, however, that economic circumstances are somewhat different from those that obtained when the review was carried out last year. A number of companies and groups made the case for an increase in the limit to facili<Col N="951" /> tate investment. As the limit had not been increased since December 1997, I was satisfied that an increase was merited. As regards the scope for tax planning in relation to BES schemes, I point out that I did not change the investor limit from &euro;31,750.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne raised the issue of the introduction of tax relief for sugar beet growers for the cost of sugar beet growing contracts. I regret that I do not believe there are sufficient grounds for the introduction of such a relief. Growers who purchase sugar beet growing contract nominations are not actually purchasing a quota as is the case with dairy farmers who purchase additional milk quota. While I am aware that a sugar beet restructuring scheme was put in place in the year 2000 as a result of an agreement between Irish Sugar plc. and the Irish Farmers' Association, this scheme does not involve the transfer of sugar beet quota as there is no such quota at farm level as is the case with milk quota.</P>
    <P>I would also like to address the suggestions made during the debate that our record on housing was poor. Only last week my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, announced the fifth record year for housing output. Some 52,602 new residences were completed last year. We are building houses at a rate of over 13 per 1,000 population, by far the highest rate of house building in Europe. In terms of social housing, over 5,000 local authority houses were completed or acquired last year, the highest level of output for over 15 years. Output under the voluntary housing programmes in 2001 was some 1,200 units, the highest level ever achieved by the sector. I expect that the output for 2002 will be higher again due to the impact of the measures introduced in my budget to stimulate housing construction.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe raised concerns about the approved share option scheme introduced last year. This scheme was introduced following extensive consultation. I understood from relevant agencies and industry representative bodies that it would meet the objectives sought. Representations have been made to me to change the terms and extensive discussions have taken place.</P>

Having reflected fully on the matter, I have decided against making any fundamental change to the scheme at this time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Roche raised the issue of the anti-avoidance changes I announced in the budget in relation to the relief available in respect of expenditure on the repair, maintenance or restoration of certain buildings by the owner or occupier of buildings of significant interest.

      <P>St. Colmcille's junior school, Knocklyon, and St. Colmcille's senior school combined as Knocklyon primary school is the biggest primary school in the country. There is a total of 1,500 pupils in all at this school which badly needs sanction from the Department for new classrooms and other facilities.</P>
      <P>A feasibility study was submitted to the Department of Education and Science on 2 December relating to the development potential of facilities at the two schools and the costings of what is required to enable the new school project to proceed. The boards of the junior and senior schools are urgently seeking a meeting with officials in the Department to discuss the needs of the school and the feasibility study as furnished. The school is anxious to begin replacing 21 prefabricated classrooms, some of which are nearly 20 years old, in substandard condition and no longer fit for use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an urgent need to upgrade playgrounds and to provide a car park of a reasonable size. There is a need for a general purposes room, a library and a variety of extra rooms for teaching and administrative purposes. Over 500 pupils and 21 teachers are currently based in the prefabricated buildings. Parents are becoming increasingly vocal and concerned about the facilities in <Col N="953" /> which their children are being taught. It is outrageous that a school of this size is conducting classes in 21 prefabricated classrooms.</P>
    <P>I visited the school and its needs are clear. The Government is deliberately delaying progressing the sanctions required to enable the development to proceed. At this stage, the management boards are making a simple request. They want a timeframe put in place to commence the badly needed redevelopment of the school. They are merely asking to meet with officials in the Department who are processing the application to ensure any outstanding information that may be required is furnished and to get some idea as to how speedily they might anticipate progress.</P>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question today on this issue, the Minister gave a general reply on what is being provided for the school building programme. It stated that the primary building programme in 2002 is being funded to the tune of &euro;153 million. The projected costings for the development proposed for the school in Knocklyon is a sum capable of being met in the context of that expenditure. We are talking about money to allow children to receive the education to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>In my parliamentary question I asked that a meeting be arranged between members of the planning and building section of the Department and representatives of the two boards of management of the school. I received the bland and useless reply that a feasibility study on the accommodation needs of St. Colmcille's is being examined &ndash; this is the feasibility study received at the beginning of December &ndash; and that when this examination is complete the Department's building unit would be contact with the authorities of both schools.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister arrange a meeting? If the Minister is refusing to arrange a meeting, when can the boards of both the junior and senior schools anticipate that the Department's building unit will be in contact with them? There is a need for communication and information. Most importantly for the community in Knocklyon, there is a need for the Government to sanction the new school buildings and additional facilities that are required so the children of the area can have a primary education in an environment that meets their needs in this modern age.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, the junior school has a staffing level of a principal, 25 mainstream classroom teachers, two remedial teachers, one special additional assistant, one resource teacher and one temporary teacher for non-nationals. The enrolment at 30 September, 2001 was 720 pupils. The senior school has a staffing level of a principal, 26 mainstream assistants, two learning support teachers, two resource teachers and one shared teacher for <Col N="954" /> non-nationals. The junior school's present facilities consist of 16 permanent classrooms and eight prefabs. The accommodation for the senior school consists of 16 permanent classrooms and nine prefabs.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science has received an application for permanent accommodation to replace the prefabs and for the provision of additional ancillary accommodation. A feasibility report on the accommodation needs of St. Colmcille's junior and senior primary schools is being examined. When this examination is complete, the Department's building unit will be in contact with the authorities in both schools.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment the issue of St. Anne's national school, Shankill. One of my children is attending this primary school. It is appropriate that the Minister for Finance will respond to this issue because it is widely believed that the logjam of building projects which has built up in the Department of Education and Science is largely due to the involvement of the Minister for Finance and his Department in restraining the Department of Education and Science from proceeding with the necessary approvals for these schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This project is in many ways similar to the one that has just been described by Deputy Shatter. St. Anne's is a primary school with 520 pupils and a full-time staff of 36 when ancillary staff is taken into account. The school is expanding and this project has been planned for some time. In 1999, the local authority, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, made a site available to the school for car parking purposes and gave planning permission for the construction of a car park. <Col N="955" /> Parallel with that, the school authorities discussed with the Department's inspectors the need to extend the school premises to provide two new classrooms, a computer room, library, new staff room, a medical room, to extend the play area, to refurbish the existing building which was built in 1961 and to carry out works which are necessary.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is frightening that they have not yet been carried out. It is necessary to upgrade the electrical installations and doors in the building to comply with the current fire and building regulations and to upgrade the mechanical installations to provide a new boiler in the school, which does not have a supply of hot water. This project had advanced quite far. The various meetings had taken place between Department officials, engineers, architects and quantity surveyors and the school management. The detailed designs, layout and costings were submitted to the Department last May. There has been nothing since then.</P>
    <P>In reply to my parliamentary question two weeks ago, the Minister stated that a building project at St. Anne's national school, Shankill, was part of the Government's programme and was currently in architectural planning. He said it would continue to the preparation of tender documents and the invitation to tenders as soon as it was possible to do so under the expanded building programme. Here we have a school building project which is manifestly needed, has been designed and planned, has been discussed with the Department of Education and Science and for part of which, the car park, planning permission has been granted. The Minister said in his reply that the project is part of the Government's programme and that it will proceed to tender stage, yet it has been delayed since last May.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Finance does not have a positive response in the reply he will shortly give me, will he give clearance to the Department of Education and Science to allow the school to apply for planning permission for this building project which is agreed with the Department, which the Minister says is part of the Government's programme and which is necessary?</P>
    <P>There is great anger among the parents and staff of the school to the point where they have taken to Shankill's streets in recent weeks to express their anger and their frustration that the Minister for Education and Science, presumably at the behest of the Minister for Finance, has held up this project. It is needed educationally, for staff facilities, and for the safety of the children who attend it. The traffic congestion and car parking problems are a danger. The architect's report makes it clear it is also needed because the electrical, mechanical and internal arrangements no longer comply with the fire and buildings regulations of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The Minister must give the decision this evening that the school can go ahead and cease the prolongation of this unacceptable arrangement.</P>

      <P>I call on the Government and the Minister for Finance to consult the European Central Bank about introducing &euro;1 and &euro;2 notes. It is important that every effort is made to maintain the euro's standing in international currency markets, but also important to the ordinary European people that their currency is consumer friendly and convenient to handle. The unit of currency can help to ensure stability of prices so that Governments are not allowed to withdraw smaller coins, like the one and two cents. For the affluent sections of society, such coins may not count for much, but for the less well-off, they can help control prices.</P>
      <P>We have eight coins and effectively five notes &ndash; for I have never seen a &euro;500 note. I doubt if the Minister, his European colleagues, or Wim Duisenberg of the ECB visit shops and supermarkets regularly.</P>

Yet, we must have the &euro;1 and &euro;2 notes. I raised this issue with the Minister in October 2000 as I foresaw the difficulties that these coins would bring. The difference between a pile of coins at checkout points and the convenience of notes has not been fully appreciated. Seven out of ten of the people I spoke to about raising this issue tonight agreed with me, although the Minister was among the three who did not. The difficulties that coins bring belittles the currency while notes emphasise its importance. Also, notes help keep prices down which would benefit the less well off.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that Deputy Enright has had a longstanding interest in this and his doggedness in pursuing it. However, I do not intend to propose to the European Central Bank that it introduce the notes in question. It would not be practical at this stage to suggest a change in the denominational structure of the single currency. The coins' and banknotes' threshold was considered during the planning phase and there was agreement that &euro;5 should be the lowest value note and &euro;2 the highest coin.</P>
      <P>Production of coins and notes in the relevant member states was planned and carried out on this basis. These are now in circulation. The Deputy is aware of the substantial effort in putting the currency into circulation. There was a similar effort in familiarising the public with the new currency's features, training cash handling staff, and adapting vending machines and other equipment to cope with the euro.</P>
      <P>At the time of the changeover, the unit of currency in many countries, including Ireland, was already in the form of a coin, a situation which evolved over time with the change in monetary value. To introduce a &euro;1 note would not make sense even in the light of Irish experience. The value of a &euro;1 note would be less than 79p.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ombudsman's report of January 2001 set out the legal situation regarding in-patient care for elderly patients in nursing homes. In the report the Ombudsman stated:</P>
      <P>The legal position in relation to hospital inpatient services both in 1990 and at present was and is relatively straightforward. Everybody resident in the State is eligible to be provided with inpatient services where necessary by the relevant health board. The service may be provided directly by the health board in one of its own hospitals or in another publicly funded hospital or by way of a contracting out arrangement between the health board and private institutions such as nursing homes.</P>
      <P>Since that is the legal situation regarding in-patient care for elderly patients in nursing homes, why are elderly patients still paying huge nursing home bills? Why is the Government standing over what is in effect an illegality, implemented by the Department of Health and Children and the health boards? There is no discretion in this matter. It is the law of the land and must be implemented. Why has the Ombudsman's report not been implemented 13 months later? </P>
      <P>Does the Government intend to introduce legislation which withdraws this legal entitlement to free nursing home care? The section of the Finance Bill dealing with tax deductible nursing home fees would appear to be a straw in the wind. There are indications that the Government intends to withdraw this benefit from the elderly in nursing homes.</P>
      <P>The situation on the ground is that it costs at least &euro;200 to keep a patient in a nursing home over and above the subvention being paid by the health boards and social welfare payments. That is approximately £160 per week. That means the elderly person's savings are drained away over a very short period and I know many elderly people who do not have enough savings left for burial expenses. It also means sons and daughters must fund the shortfall. In effect, these sons and daughters are paying what amounts to a second mortgage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Worse still, elderly people are being pressurised to sell the family home to meet nursing home <Col N="959" /> fees. What is happening is that health boards are deducting what they term a notional rent based on the value of the family home. That is being deducted from subventions payable by health boards to patients in nursing homes. This is outrageous. These elderly people have given years to building up the country and now they are under severe pressure to sell their own homes to pay for nursing home care. Will the Minister instruct health boards immediately to stop this latter day eviction, which is what I call it? It is a policy of eviction. The family home should be sacrosanct, at least as it is in social welfare legislation.</P>
    <P>There is huge public anger with this issue. The Minister would do well to take what I have said seriously and to implement the law which entitles the elderly to free nursing home care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to address this issue on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children. The report of the Ombudsman on the nursing home subvention scheme raised certain questions about older persons' entitlement to services. The Ombudsman outlined his interpretation of the Health Act, 1970, which is that any person in need of nursing home care has a statutory entitlement to the provision of that service by a health board. My Department's position, based on legal advice, is at variance with the view expressed by the Ombudsman. What is clear is that the uncertainty that undoubtedly exists in relation to eligibility and entitlement should be resolved. I am glad to record that the new health strategy acknowledges this.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to eligibility will be reviewed and legislative proposals aimed at bringing clarity to the situation will be brought forward in 2002. The application of the terms of the nursing home subvention scheme, which was introduced in 1993, was the subject of critical comment by the Ombudsman in his report. In addition, an expenditure review of the scheme conducted by Professor Eamon O'Shea outlined certain principles which should be brought to bear on the working of the scheme. Professor O'Shea's report will be published in the coming weeks, but one key area which he addressed was the paying of a home subvention payment as an alternative to the nursing home subvention. Proposals for the introduction of such a payment on a pilot basis, will be developed in 2002, in consultation with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, taking into account the need to integrate such an arrangement with the existing carer's allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government policy in relation to health services for older people was outlined in the report The Years Ahead and reaffirmed in the review of that report which was published in 1997. This pol<Col N="960" /> icy has now been given a further impetus in the health strategy.</P>
    <P>We value our older people and, therefore, will place particular emphasis on an approach which aims at maintaining them in dignity and independence at home, in restoring to independence at home those older people who become ill or dependent, in encouraging and supporting the care of older people in their own community by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies, and in providing a high quality of hospital and residential care for older people when they can no longer be maintained in dignity and independence at home.</P>
    <P>Our commitment to these principles is clearly demonstrated by the additional resources allocated to services for older people since the Government came to power. In 1997, an additional £10 million was provided, increasing to £36 million in 2000, £57.42 million in 2001 and £69 million or &euro;87 million in 2002. This is by any standard an impressive list of developments. Nevertheless, the Government is only too well aware that much remains to be done if we are to get the level of developments which we are intent on reaching.</P>
    <P>The health strategy acknowledges that the Irish population is ageing at a rapid rate. Estimates suggest that by the year 2011 our population aged 65 years and over will have grown by 25%. Each year our over 65 population increases by 6,000 and the number of people aged 80 and over goes up by 1,500. To continue to cope with the anticipated demand it will be necessary to expand significantly our current range of services. The new strategy recognises this and, therefore, commits us to a number of very specific but key developments over the next seven years.</P>
    <P>The strategy emphasises again the need to support older people in their own homes in independence and dignity for as long as possible, to restore them to that state where this is required and to provide a high standard of extended care when they need it. These aspirations are expressed in concrete terms: the continued development of community based services, such as community nursing, home help services and community supports, including the provision of 7,000 additional day care centre places; a respite care grant to those caring for older people; the provision of 1,370 additional geriatric assessment and rehabilitation places in or associated with acute medical units and the provision of an additional 800 extended care beds per annum, including beds for those with dementia.</P>
    <P>The Government places a high value on the contribution that older people have made to the development of the State and is committed to the implementation of the health strategy, including its specific proposals for older people.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 7.05 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 19 February 2002.</P>

      <P>It is my policy and that of the Government that everything possible is done to ensure that Irish livestock and meat producers have unrestricted access to all of our important markets worldwide and no effort is being spared to bring this about.</P>
      <P>The situation now with EU markets is that beef consumption in the EU as a whole is steadily recovering from the serious collapse which took place in late 2000 due to a restoration of confidence in the product as a result of measures taken at EU level. Also, the market support measures put in place to deal with the overhang of product on the market have had a useful effect in helping to restore balance. I am satisfied that all of this will help Ireland's efforts to regain our former levels of sales to these markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of third countries, many of which imposed bans on EU beef following the BSE crisis in mainland Europe, efforts at political, diplomat and technical level are continuing to secure the reopening of these important markets. My Department, together with the Department of Foreign Affairs and An Bord Bia is working intensively to emphasise to the authorities in those markets the guarantees in relation to food <Col N="962" /> safety we can offer to consumers of Irish beef. Particular attention was given to Egypt, which had been our largest single market for beef exports and, as the Deputy will be aware, this strategy proved successful in regaining access to this significantly important market. We were also successful in reopening the Russian market in the aftermath of last year's foot and mouth crisis.</P>
    <P>Particular attention is also being focused on the Gulf region which is a significant market for Irish beef. A senior veterinary official of my Department visited the region last year to brief the relevant authorities on our BSE situation. Our ambassador to Saudi Arabia has also kept in very close contact with all the important countries in the region. A further visit by a senior delegation from my Department is being arranged at present and meetings have been sought with the appropriate authorities. Renewed invitations to visit Ireland are also being issued to the authorities in question.</P>
    <P>Technical delegations from South Africa, Algeria, Indonesia and Japan have also been invited to visit Ireland to assess for themselves the quality of the controls in place in Ireland with regard to livestock and meat production. I visited South Africa last year for discussions on the reopening of the beef market there. I am pleased to say that a Japanese delegation will visit Ireland next week with a view to reopening the important pigmeat market there which was closed to Ireland as a result of the FMD crisis last year. I am confident that visit will be followed by other delegations in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1999 the national incidence of bovine tuberculosis has been decreasing. This downward trend continued in 2001 and the provisional data available to my Department indicates that for 2001 the total number of reactors in the country will be less than 34,000 compared with a figure of 39,847 in 2000. The reduction is, in part, due to reduced testing in 2001 because of FMD. However, a direct comparison is possible in the measure of reactor animals disclosed per 1000 animals tested. This reduced to 3.55 in 2001 from 3.9 in 2000.</P>
      <P>Nationally, therefore, there is an improvement in the disease situation. However individual counties have improved more than others and some have recorded poorer figures. This is usually due to a blackspot area appearing in the course of the programme and the remainder of the county will often have the improved situation reflected nationally. It is considered that infected wildlife have a role in the spread of disease in many of these blackspot areas and such areas will be targeted by my Department's enhanced wildlife programme in 2002. The Department's research into a vaccine for TB in badgers will continue in 2002 and significant progress under this heading is expected in the next three to five years. Therefore any proposal to radically change the programme will be influenced by scientific and technological developments in the period ahead.</P>

      <P>Some 11,657 live cattle were exported to the Lebanon during the year 2001.</P>
      <P>With regard to markets generally, I am particularly concerned to ensure that Irish livestock and meat producers have unrestricted access to all of our important markets worldwide. In addition to the Lebanon, the other traditional third country markets for live cattle exports from Ireland have been Libya and Egypt.</P>
      <P>An agreement signed with Libya in June 2000 provided that Ireland would be officially listed as a source country for all Libyan tenders for the supply of live cattle. Since then, however, the Libyan Foreign Minister indicated that it had not been possible to import live cattle because of what he called logistical problems and that Libya would buy beef directly. Libya subsequently issued tenders for the supply of beef and Ireland was included in the list of countries invited to tender. I understand that a number of Irish companies submitted bids at that time. Efforts at diplomatic and technical level are continuing to ensure that the agreement, in so far as it relates to cattle exports, signed with Libya is fully implemented.</P>
      <P>With regard to live cattle exports to Egypt the position is that proposals for a trial shipment of live cattle were submitted to the Egyptian authorities in 1997 but these proposals were not implemented. The lack of a market for live cattle exports to Egypt has been, however, more than offset by the volume of trade in beef exports to that country in recent years.</P>

      <P>My Department has quality of service and responding to customer needs as an operational priority in all its activities. It is fully committed to providing services in an efficient, effective and user-friendly manner. The protocol on direct payments to farmers published in agreement with the social partner farm organisations in July 2000 contains specific commitments as regards delivery of payments and achievements of these commitments is continually monitored. In general, the targets set out in the protocol have been met by my Department and the payment system is recognised as one of the most efficient in Europe.</P>
      <P>The Department's customer service action plan 2001-2004 expands the commitments undertaken in the protocol to include other schemes and services administered by my Department. Among the action points in the plan is a commitment to the use of clear and simple language in forms and information leaflets, the setting up of regional customer panels in order to get feedback from individual farmers on various aspects of service delivery, and to continue to extend the use of electronic data to reduce form filling by our customers.</P>
      <P>I am well aware of the difficulties faced by some in completing the paperwork required under many schemes. For this reason, I succeeded in getting the Council of Agriculture Ministers to reaffirm its commitment to simplification. As a result, a new EU regulation on scheme controls and penalties has been adopted and I am satisfied that the changes being introduced will be of considerable benefit to farmers.</P>
      <P>I have this week launched a guide to the recent changes in the livestock and arable aid schemes. A copy of this guide is being posted to every herdowner in the country. An extensive series of information meetings explaining these changes will take place throughout the country over the next few weeks. The guide and information meetings are intended to assist farmers in maximising their entitlements to premia and avoiding penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local office staff already provide help and advice to individual farmers on an ongoing basis. However, most errors or omissions in application <Col N="966" /> forms, apart from obvious errors such as failure to sign and date the application, can only be detected after the information on the application form has been recorded on the computer database, validated and cross-checked, where appropriate, against the land parcel identification system and the cattle movement monitoring system. It should be noted that the majority of penalties are incurred due to late submission of applications.</P>
    <P>Subject to EU regulatory constraints, in consultation with its customers, my Department will continue to seek to simplify forms and application procedures generally.</P>

      <P>The feeding of processed animal proteins including meat and bone meal to farmed animals which are kept, fattened or bred for the production of food has been prohibited with effect from 1 January 2001 under the provisions of Council Decision 2000/766/EC which was transposed into national legislation under the provisions of the European Communities (Processed Animal Proteins) Regulations, 2000.</P>
      <P>The use of meat and bone meal in the manufacture of animal feedingstuffs intended for feeding to animals which are not kept, fattened or bred for the production of food, is prohibited except under licence under the provisions of the Diseases of Animals (BSE)(No. 2) Order, 1996.</P>
      <P>Since 1 January 2001, five licences to purchase meat and bone meal under the provisions of the Diseases of Animals (BSE)(No. 2) Order, 1996, have been issued. All of the licences in question were issued to purchasers resident in the UK. A condition of each of these licenses was that the meat and bone meal purchased had to be exported from Ireland in conformity with the conditions of Article 3 of Commission Decision 2001/9/EC which implements the control measures set down in Council Decision 2000/766/EC with regard to the feeding of animal protein. No licences to incorporate meat and bone meal have been issued since 1 January 2001.  </P>

      <P>Tax allowances for expenditure in necessary pollution control work, notably the expenditure limit under the accelerated rate of capital allowance which was increased to &euro;62,000, are a matter for the Minister for Finance. Under the aegis of my Department the Government has introduced a number of other measures since 1997 to promote environmental farming. Of these, the most important are the rural environment protection scheme, the scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic sector and the scheme of investment aid for farm waste management.</P>
      <P>The rural environment protection scheme was first introduced in June 1994 and the successor scheme currently in operation was introduced in November 2000. The objectives of REPS include establishing farming practices and production methods that reflect the need for environmental conservation and protection, protecting wildlife habitats and endangered species of flora and fauna, and producing quality food in an extensive and environmentally friendly manner. REPS is 75% co-funded by the European Union, and to date a total of &euro;994.5 million has been paid to participants. Payments since 1997 account for &euro;884.3 million of the total.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" />Organic farming is acknowledged to be exceptionally sensitive to the well-being of the environment and there is special provision in REPS to support this sector. Organic farmers in REPS can avail of a supplementary measure which is designed to encourage farmers to respond to the market demand for organically produced food. An organic farmer in REPS can receive up to &euro;13,280 a year which includes payment of the basic measure, while a holding is in conversion to full organic status. When full organic status is obtained, such a farmer may receive some &euro;9,680 which includes payment of the basic measure.</P>
    <P>Further support for this area is available under the scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic sector introduced last year. The Government have made some &euro;8 million available for this scheme under the regional operational programmes for the Border, midland and western region and the south and east region. It provides grant assistance for both on-farm and off-farm investment in equipment and facilities for preparation, grading, packing, storage and distribution of organic produce. For on-farm investment projects, grant assistance is available up to a maximum of about &euro;50,000. For off-farm investment projects, grant aid up to a maximum of about &euro;250,000 is available.</P>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, provision was made for a scheme of farm waste management. A significant level of funding amounting to some &euro;230 million has been allocated for this measure, accounting in fact for almost 80% of the total available under all the on-farm investment schemes. Eligible investments under this scheme include waste storage facilities, animal housing &ndash; sheep and bovines, silage storage facilities, associated facilities and mobile equipment for applications of farm wastes. Grant aid of between 20% and 40% is available, subject to certain criteria. It is a condition of this scheme that all applicants undertake to apply the principles of good farming practice in their operations. The new farm waste management scheme replaced the national scheme for the control of farm pollution which operated from June 1999 and which provided grant aid for similar types of investment.</P>

      <Quest>the position in relation to BSE; the number of BSE positive animals for each of the past three years; and the likely indications for the future in this regard.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 49 cases of BSE have been confirmed in 2002 to date up to 7 February. In addition one positive cohort animal has been detected. There were 91 confirmed cases of BSE in 1999, 145 in 2000 and 242 in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A targeted active surveillance programme for <Col N="969" /> BSE began in 2000 with the testing of a proportion of fallen stock and a random survey of cattle eligible for human consumption. This programme was extended in 2001. Since 1 July 2001, all cattle presented for slaughter over 30 months of age and all fallen and casualty animals over 24 months of age are tested for BSE.</P>
    <P>Of the 145 cases in 2000, 138 were detected by passive surveillance. In 2001, a lesser number, 123 cases of the total of 242 were detected by passive surveillance although a greater number of animals were notified as BSE suspects on the basis of clinical signs in 2001 &ndash; 484 &ndash; than in 2000 &ndash; 354. The entire increase in 2001 is attributable to more intensive active surveillance, particularly among fallen animals which would not, in any event, have entered the human food chain.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that a comprehensive range of measures is in place to protect consumers and for the control and eradication of BSE, including compulsory notification of the disease, the depopulation of herds, the tracing and slaughter of birth cohorts and progeny of the infected animal, a ban on the use of meat and bone meal for farmed animals, the removal and destruction of specified risk materials from ruminant animals and the rapid testing of animals over 30 months at meat plants.</P>
    <P>Moreover, unlike many other member states whose BSE controls were tightened up at the end of 2000, none of the positive animals identified in Ireland to date have been born after July 1996. This indicates that the enhanced controls introduced in this country in 1996 are working, and that the disease should begin to work its way out of the national herd as older animals leave the system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>An Bord Bia has been in existence since 1994, and the success of its marketing strategy can best be judged, in my view, by reference to the increase in output and sales by the Irish food and drinks sector since that time. Output in the food industry is currently valued at &euro;13.9 billion representing 25% of all industrial output and has increased by &euro;2.8 billion since 1993. Exports have increased by &euro;1.3 billion in the same period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At export level, the work of the board has been instrumental in heightening awareness of the capabilities of our food and drinks industry and the range and quality of products that it can supply. A measure of its success has been the fact that our food exports have continued to rise since 1998 when they exceeded the &euro;6.3 billion mark <Col N="970" /> for the first time &ndash; apart from 2001, which as we can all appreciate, was a difficult year. It is worthwhile to note that the overall reduction of 7.7% in our exports for 2001 can be specifically attributed to the difficulties encountered in the beef and live cattle trade and in fact masks a significant increase in exports of sheepmeat, pigmeat, edible horticulture, cereals and prepared foods. It is predicted that this year will see a reversal of the downturn in beef sales and a steady return to the overall growth trends of previous years.</P>
    <P>Aside from the economic considerations, I believe that Bord Bia has played a pivotal role in increasing standards at all levels in our food industry. It operates quality assurance schemes in the beef, pigmeat and eggs sectors to the highest international standards. Its marketing of our food and drink industry under the &ldquo;Ireland the Food Island&rdquo; banner has served to put Ireland on the international food map and has furthermore instilled a sense of national pride in our most valuable indigenous industry.</P>
    <P>I am confident that Bord Bia has a major proactive role to play in the future development of the food industry and that it will undertake this role with the same tenacity and professionalism that has hallmarked its formative years. The range of programmes that it has in place will serve to address the challenges faced by food producers in this ever-changing environment of e-commerce, consumer trends and increasingly competitive marketplace and will assist and complement the endeavours undertaken by the food industry itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 39 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to main<Col N="972" /> taining the highest possible number of viable full-time and part-time farmers. This is the long-term strategy underpinning the Agri Food 2010 Action Plan.</P>
    <P>By way of implementation of the action plan, the National Development Plan 2000-2006 provides &euro;8.5 billion for rural areas and includes almost &euro;5 billion for expenditure specifically on development. Of specific importance to young farmers has been the policy to give them priority access under the suckler cow, ewe premium and milk quota schemes together with the enhanced scheme of installation aid for which &euro;38 million has been assigned in the NDP. Coupled with special taxation measures and the early retirement scheme this should assist in the earlier and more efficient transfer of land to younger farmers. In addition, a number of on-farm investment schemes with expenditure allocation totalling &euro;329 million is provided for in the NDP in order to maximise production efficiency and ensure economic sustainability.</P>
    <P>Under the national development plan, the schemes to encourage early transfer have been adjusted to enhance their impact on land mobility. The early retirement scheme has been modified to allow for part-time farming, and to remove the obligation to enlarge the transferred holding. These changes make the scheme more attractive to young farmers as transferees. The new installation aid scheme for young trained farmers provides for a grant rate of &euro;9,523, compared to a rate of &euro;7,112 in the previous round.</P>
    <P>Tax incentives to encourage early transfer have been progressively increased and enhanced.</P>
    <P>The Finance Act, 2000, increased stamp duty relief for young trained farmers from two-thirds to 100% and this was backdated to 1 January 2000. Some 100% stock relief was made available for young trained farmers for a period of four years after transfer. The capital acquisition tax threshold for gifts or inheritances was substantially increased. This effectively means that when combined with the 90% agricultural relied most family farm transfers are exempt from CAT. Probate tax on inheritances was abolished. For farmers aged 55, income tax exemptions apply to land leased to non-connected persons, and retirement relief is available on capital gains tax and of benefit to young farmers is the tax relief for the purchase of milk quota.</P>
    <P>For the first time, a top-up is available on grant-aid for on-farm investment by farmers aged under 35. Investment schemes cover farm waste management improvement in dairy hygiene standards and housing and handling facilities for alternative enterprises. These schemes provide grant aid of 40% in the case of farmers having up to 150 income units, equivalent to 60,000 gallon quota. A grant rate of 20% will apply to farmers having between 151 and 200 income units, equivalent to 80,000 gallon quota. In addition, grant rates are increased by 15% in less favoured areas and 5% in other areas for young trained farmers <Col N="973" /> under the farm waste management and improvement in dairy hygiene schemes.</P>
    <P>The farm waste management scheme will also provide farmers with the necessary support to improve waste management on farms. Such developments are in keeping with the Government's commitment to the protection of the environment, an issue which is of great importance at present and which will figure strongly in the future development of both Irish and European agriculture.</P>
    <P>Apart from the various financial incentives, I have emphasised the importance of education and training in making agriculture more attractive and rewarding as a career for young people. In this regard, Teagasc is currently implementing the recommendations of the task force that I established to review the training needs of the agriculture sector. A major step forward has been the mainstreaming of agricultural training in conjunction with the institutes of technology. In relation to agricultural training, additional funding has been secured for the payment of a trainee allowance of &euro;190 per week by Teagasc to students and apprentices on block-release courses.</P>
    <P>The policy framework now in place for the development of agriculture, combined with specific financial incentives for young farmers and new educational possibilities, are designed to encourage young farmers to choose agriculture as a career.</P>

      <P>The consensus of opinion was that the trials in Ireland had been carried out in a highly professional manner.

The results of this trial should become available next month. It is hoped that the EU Commission will then set down definitive standards for the approval of automated classification systems. Any proposed system in Ireland will have to undergo an authorisation trial to ensure that it meets the approved standard. While continued progress is being made in regard to mechanical classification, it is likely that it will take some time yet for the introduction of a system which <Col N="975" /> meets strict EU Commission standards. I fully support the introduction of a mechanical classification system and I will do everything possible to progress the matter.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the findings of the Eurobarometer opinion polls on the common agricultural policy which were carried out by the EU Commission in 2000 and 2001.</P>
      <P>The results of these polls show that, across the general population, the approval rating for the CAP was high in Ireland. Among the farming population, Irish farmers indicated the highest approval rating in the EU in relation to the way in which the CAP fulfils a specified list of important roles including: ensuring that farm products are safe and of no danger; providing stable, adequate incomes for farmers; protecting small or medium-sized farms; helping farmers to adapt their production to consumers' expectations; promoting and improving life in the countryside; and promoting respect for the environment.</P>
      <P>I believe that these findings confirm that EU membership has been particularly beneficial for the Irish agriculture and food industries and for our rural communities by enhancing farmers' incomes and improving living standards. Society at large has benefited in the form of a better environment, higher levels of food safety, additional employment in food processing and a positive contribution to our balance of payments.</P>

      <P>While the Department's payment system is one of the most efficient in Europe, application procedures for premia and other schemes have been, and continue to be, subject to review with a view to simplification, subject to meeting EU accountability requirements.</P>
      <P>As part of this process, a protocol on direct payments was agreed with the social partner farming organisations in 2000, and this has been carried forward in the Department's customer service action plan 2001-2004.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" />The Department's customer service action plan 2001-2004 expands the commitments undertaken in the protocol to include other schemes and services administered by my Department. Among the action points in the plan is a commitment to the use of clear and simple language in forms and information leaflets, the setting up of regional customer panels in order to get feedback from individual farmers on various aspects of service delivery, and to continue to extend the use of electronic data to reduce form filling by our customers.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the difficulties faced by some in completing the paperwork required under many schemes. For this reason, I succeeded in getting the Council of Agriculture Ministers to reaffirm its commitment to simplification. As a result, a new EU regulation on scheme controls and penalties has been adopted and I am satisfied that the changes being introduced will be of considerable benefit to farmers. I have this week launched a guide to the recent changes in the livestock and arable aid schemes. A copy of this guide is being posted to every herdowner in the country. An extensive series of information meetings explaining these changes will take place throughout the country over the next few weeks. The guide and information meetings are intended to assist farmers in maximising their entitlements to premia and avoiding penalties.</P>
    <P>Subject to EU regulatory constraints, in consultation with its customers, my Department will continue to seek to simplify forms and application procedures generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the report to which the Deputy is referring is the EPA report on IPC licensing and control 2000 which was released last December. While the EPA reported on poor environmental standards in the meat slaughtering sector, these related for the most part to problems of noise and odour. It is very important to stress that the EPA criticisms were not BSE-related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has worked closely with the EPA in recent years and would concur with its aim of reducing the level of complaints and improving the environmental record of the sector. To this end, large scale investment in equipment and state-of-the-art environmental controls has helped improve the situation, particularly that of the rendering sector of the industry in recent years. The record of the sector shows a consider<Col N="977" /> able reduction in the number of odour complaints from 1,500 in 1998 to 900 in 2000 and in the overall number of complaints generally.</P>
    <P>My Department is also working with the EPA and the industry on the issue of minimum levels of discharge into the environment and much progress has been made in this area. Again, it is important to stress that there is no evidence that the environmental performance of the meat slaughtering sector poses a BSE risk and that the scientific steering committee of the EU has seen no evidence of a route of possible BSE infection through water or any other discharges.</P>
    <P>Under the rural environment protection scheme, financial support for organic producers is provided under a supplementary measure for organic farming. The objective of this measure is to encourage producers to respond to the market demand for organically produced food. An organic farmer with 40 hectares in REPS can receive up to &euro;13,280 a year, which includes payment of the basic measure, while a holding is in conversion to full organic status. When full organic status is obtained, such a farmer may receive up to &euro;9,680 which also includes payment of the basic measure. In the first REP scheme, which had some 45,500 active participants when it closed to new applications at the end of 1999, 821 availed of the organic supplementary measure receiving over &euro;28 million in REPS payments. Of the 14,397 applicants who have been admitted to the new REP scheme, 186 farmers have opted for the organic supplementary measure. I am hopeful that the take-up will considerably surpass the levels in the first REP scheme as farmers become aware of the commercial opportunities that organic farming offers.</P>
    <P>Some &euro;8 million has been allocated to the scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic sector, which was launched on 15 May 2001 under the regional operational programmes for the Border, midland and western region and the south and east region. The scheme provides grant assistance for both on-farm and off-farm investment in equipment and facilities for preparation, grading, packing, storage and distribution of organic produce. For on-farm investment projects, grant assistance is available up to a maximum of about &euro;50,000. For off-farm investment projects, grant aid up to a maximum of about &euro;250,000 is available.</P>
    <P>There were 69 grant applications in the first tranche of the development scheme in June 2001, and so far my Department has given approval for grant assistance totalling &euro;235,172. The scheme will be reopened for applications shortly and I look forward to receiving a substantial number of applications so that my Department can give further support to organic farmers and other operators in this expanding sector.</P>
    <P>The organic development committee which I established in November 2000 will be making its report shortly, and I will of course give most careful consideration to any recommendations about <Col N="978" /> these support measures that the committee may make.</P>

      <P>There is a strong statutory basis, under the Disease of Animals Acts, 1966-2001, and instruments made thereunder, dealing with the BSE. Within this framework I am satisfied that a comprehensive range of measures is in place both to protect consumers and for the control and eradication of the disease. These include compulsory notification of the disease, the depopulation of herds, the tracing and slaughter of birth cohorts and progeny of the infected animal, a ban on the use of meat and bone meal for farmed animals and the removal and destruction of specified risk materials from ruminant animals. In addition all cattle presented for slaughter over 30 months of age and all fallen and casualty animals over 24 months of age are also tested for the disease.</P>
      <P>Some 49 cases of BSE have been confirmed to date in 2002 up to 7 February. In addition one positive cohort animal has been detected. There were 91 confirmed cases of BSE in 1999, 145 in 2000 and 242 in 2001. The entire increase in 2001 is attributable to more intensive active surveillance, particularly among fallen animals which would not, in any event, have entered the human food chain. It is noteworthy that despite the vastly increased levels of active surveillance in 2001, no case has been confirmed in an animal born after July 1996.</P>
      <P>This is a positive indication that the enhanced BSE controls introduced in 1996 are having the desired results and that the disease should begin to work its way out of the national herd as older animals leave the system.</P>

      <P>The Agenda 2000 agreement covering the period 2000-2006 was finalised in Berlin in March 1999 and represented a highly satisfactory outcome for Ireland. The agreement provides for a number of reviews. The European Commission is likely to combine these in an overall review to be presented in June 2002. My position is that the essential elements of Agenda 2000 should remain in place at least until 2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agenda 2000 agreement explicitly speci<Col N="979" /> fied that expenditure earmarked for the existing member states cannot be used to meet the cost of enlargement. The resources necessary for CAP market supports, direct payments and rural development in the existing EU, including Ireland, in the period to 2006 are, therefore, provided for and will not be affected by enlargement.</P>
    <P>The EU's negotiating mandate on agriculture for the World Trade Organisation negotiations, which was agreed by the Council of Ministers, was based primarily on the Agenda 2000 agreement and I am satisfied that the WTO ministerial declaration agreed in Doha in November 2001, which launched the current round of WTO negotiations, is in accordance with that mandate. The mandate provides a satisfactory framework for protecting the interests of the Irish agriculture and food industries and it is my intention to ensure that it will be fully respected in the negotiations themselves, which are scheduled to end by 2005.</P>
    <P>While I am committed to defending the policy framework provided by the Agenda 2000 Agreement, it is vitally important that those who operate within that framework are fully prepared for the future challenges and opportunities that may emerge. For that reason, I established in June 1999 a committee to make recommendations on the development of those industries over the present decade. That committee's report entitled, Agri Food 2010, was completed in March 2000 and I published a plan of action in August 2000 which set out the Government's policy response to the committee's recommendations. Substantial funding for many of the recommendations has been provided in the National Development Plan 2000-2006. I am confident, therefore, that the agriculture and food industries will be well prepared to cope with any increased competition on the domestic market and to exploit opportunities on export markets and so maximise their contribution to Irish wealth and employment and the development of rural areas over the next ten years.</P>

      <P>In 2002, a sum of &euro;38.6 million has been provided in respect of farm buildings under the various schemes, and a sum of &euro;4.9 million for dairy hygiene works. This is in line with the overall allocations provided for under the national development plan for the years 2000-2006 and I believe it will make a significant contribution to the fight against farm pollution. These schemes are not intended by themselves to provide the full means by which farm pollution will be controlled; a range of other measures are in place which are also designed to help promote this objective, including the REPs scheme, the scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic sector, and of course the policy of good farming practice. In addition, I should point out that it is the responsibility of farmers themselves to take all steps necessary to control pollution from their farming activities.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 contains indicative public funding of &euro;358 million for a full range of support measures for the food industry. These measures cover capital investment, research and development, marketing and promotion and human resource development.</P>
      <P>A total of &euro;106 million is provided to cover research, technology and innovation for the food industry. Of this amount, &euro;36 million has been allocated for the purpose of in-company research and technology transfer and this is being administered by the development agencies. Some &euro;70 million has been allocated towards the food institutional, or public good, research measure, administered by my Department.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the food institutional research measure are to complement the support being provided for in-company research, to provide a base of expertise and information to support product development in the industry and to assist in assuring consumer protection by ensuring that development is underpinned by attention to food safety and quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aid under the measure is provided in respect of research that is neither commissioned nor carried out in-house by individual firms. Funding is allocated on the basis of open competition organised through public calls for proposals which are announced in the national press. Projects are accepted from institutions, including the universities and Teagasc, that can demonstrate the capa<Col N="981" /> bilities to engage in this type of research. Up to 100% funding for eligible costs may be provided.</P>
    <P>The food institutional research committee comprising representatives of the public and private sectors determine the projects to be funded. In assessing projects, the committee may avail of the services of external experts to carry out independent evaluations. Priority is being afforded to the themes of food safety, new innovative food products and the enhancement of the institutions' ability to support development in the consumer foods area. A dissemination project, for the purpose of distributing the research results from the institutions participating in the measure to Irish food companies, is also being funded.</P>
    <P>Arising from a general call for projects in 2000 and a targeted call in 2001, over half of the funding available for the measure has been committed. Some 76 research projects, across a number of key areas, from the universities, Teagasc and some other institutions involving funding of &euro;36 million have been selected for aid.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the restructuring scheme I have decided to set a maximum price for the 2002-03 scheme at &euro;0.31 per litre &ndash; £1.11p per gallon. I intend to continue this downward trend in the future. I have also decided to improve the priority access of younger farmers from 20% to 25% of the pool and will continue to make provision for those producers who were unable to renew existing land or quota leases. The general priority categories will be the same as last year i.e. category I &ndash; less than 180,000 litres, category II &ndash; 180,000 to 275,000 litres and category III &ndash; over 275,000 litres, and allocations would be made to these categories on the basis of a 3:2:1 ratio. The scheme will therefore continue to be weighted in favour of small and medium scale producers.</P>
      <P>The restructuring scheme has been very successful in the two years since the introduction of the new regime. About 80 million gallons of quota has been reallocated, most of it to small and medium category producers. The gradual reduction in price along with the very favourable taxation treatment for quota purchase has made this possible. The level of quota reallocation is already bringing about an improvement in the structure of the sector at production level, something that is vital to meet future competitive challenges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The temporary leasing scheme will operate in two phases, the first closing on 31 May 2002 and <Col N="982" /> the second on 31 January 2003. In line with previous indications and with the objective of reducing production costs, the price will be reduced to &euro;0.04 per litre or 14p per gallon. Again, the scheme will be operated so as to favour small and medium size producers with the allocation among the three categories operating on a similar basis to the restructuring scheme. Specific provision would be made for entitlements which had not been satisfied in the 2002 restructuring scheme.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the reallocation of unused quota at the end of the current year &ndash; flexi-milk. This will be allocated among the three priority categories with 70% going to category I &ndash; under 180,000 litres, 20% to category II &ndash; 180,000 to 275,000 litres and 10% to category III &ndash; over 275,000 litres.</P>

In the first REP scheme, which had some 45,500 active participants when it closed to new applications at the end of 1999, 821 availed of the organic supplementary measure receiving over &euro;28 million in REPS payments. Of the 14,397 applicants who have been admitted to the new REP scheme, 186 farmers have opted for the organic supplementary measure. I am hopeful that the take-up will considerably surpass the levels in the first REP scheme as farmers become aware of the commercial opportunities that organic farming offers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="984" />Some &euro;8 million has been allocated to the scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic sector, which was launched on 15 May 2001 under the regional operational programmes for the Border, midland and western region and the south and east region. The scheme provides grant assistance for both on-farm and off-farm investment in equipment and facilities for preparation, grading, packing, storage and distribution of organic produce. For on-farm investment projects, grant assistance is available up to a maximum of about &euro;50,000. For off-farm investment projects, grant aid up to a maximum of about &euro;250,000 is available.</P>
    <P>There were 69 grant applications in the first tranche of the development scheme in June 2001, and so far my Department has given approval for grant assistance totalling &euro;235,172. The scheme will be reopened for applications shortly and I look forward to receiving a substantial number of applications so that my Department can give further support to organic farmers and other operators in this expanding sector.</P>
    <P>The organic development committee which I established in November 2000 will be making its report shortly, and I will of course give most careful consideration to any recommendations about these support measures that the committee may make.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the launch of the TB eradication scheme in 1954, and the brucellosis eradication scheme in 1966, the combined expenditure, at current cost, for both schemes has totalled &euro;1,275 million, excluding administration costs, up to the end of 2001. It is not possible to breakdown the cost of each scheme due to the fact that the majority of TB tests and the brucellosis tests are undertaken simultaneously.</P>
      <P>In assessing the level of expenditure on the TB eradication scheme I would refer the Deputy to the results of a cost-benefit study undertaken in 1991 that covered the period from 1954 until the establishment of ERAD in 1988. According to the study the total quantified benefits, not including human health benefits, were estimated to amount to 7% of total cattle and milk output in 1988. It also found that the minimum benefits of the scheme were estimated to have exceeded costs by 86% and the rate of return was calculated at 15.5%. Overall the study suggested that the scheme was highly beneficial for the national economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initial policy when the TB scheme was introduced in 1954 was to eradicate bovine TB from cattle herds and this still remains the objec<Col N="985" /> tive. Significant progress was made in the earlier stages of the scheme but the progress has stalled, albeit, at a relatively low level of the disease. However, given the experience in the past 30 years there is a recognition that the incidence of the disease in wildlife is a major impediment and that further technological advances will be needed to achieve further progress. Important short-term objectives are to ensure that the incidence of the disease is reduced to the minimum level attainable so that markets, in particular export markets, are not jeopardised and so that there is no serious threat to human health.</P>
    <P>In the context of the PPF, a package of measures was agreed with the objectives of reducing the incidence of TB by 50% over the four years of the programme. The numbers of reactors being disclosed has been declining since 1999 and this downward trend continued in 2001. The number of TB reactor animals for the year at less than 34,000 represents a decrease of 15% and 24% respectively on the corresponding reactor figures for 2000 and 1999.  </P>

      <P>Many of the measures introduced in the context of FMD have been discontinued having regard to the facts that there has not been a case of FMD in the Britain since 30 September 2001, the lifting by the EU of all FMD-related restrictions on trade in animals and animal products from the UK and the recent re-instatement by the OIE, the world animal health body, of the UK to FMD-free status. However, a number of measures have been retained in the interests of protecting Ireland's animal health status.</P>
      <P>As a result, the position is now as follows: full intra-community trade and certification rules apply to trade with Northern Ireland in animals of susceptible species; restrictions on the frequency of internal livestock movements, for example the 30 day rule, remain in place and will be kept under review; disinfection and enhanced controls at points of access to the State, i.e. ports and airports by persons travelling from outside the island of Ireland are retained; and a range of other measures such as sheep tagging, registration of dealers, regulation of trade in sheep and pigs with Northern Ireland and controls on sheep shearing and AI, remain as permanent features.</P>
      <P>Close liaison is maintained with Northern Ireland and other authorities. Protection of the animal health status of the island of Ireland is of course a particular concern of the North-South Ministerial Council. In this regard, and as jointly mandated by Minister Rodgers and I, an active programme of work across a range of headings and involving officials from my Department and its counterpart in Belfast is now under way. This will result in an unprecedented degree of North-South co-operation on animal health issues, to the benefit of all involved in agriculture in both parts of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Since 1997 three additional measures have been introduced to support the development of the horticultural industry &ndash; the scheme of investment aid for the development of the commercial horticulture sector, the capital investment scheme for the marketing and processing of certain agricultural products and the provision of financial assistance for producer organisations under the EU regulations on fruit and vegetables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme of investment aid for the development of the commercial horticulture sector is operated under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and provides for aid of more than &euro;19 <Col N="987" /> million over the period of the scheme. A total of 312 applications were received in the first round of the scheme which closed on 4 May 2001, of these 263 have been approved to date with completion dates up to the end of June 2002. It is proposed to announce a second round in late autumn.</P>
    <P>The capital investment scheme for the marketing and processing of certain agricultural products assists capital projects in a number of sectors including horticulture. This scheme is funded under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and forms part of the productive sector operational programme. Aid is provided to assist in the development of the horticulture sector by grant aiding capital investment in buildings and/or new specialised plant and equipment in commercial enterprises involved in the marketing and processing of horticulture products. Under the first round of applications 17 eligible applications were received from the sector and the first tranche of awards will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>The EU regulations on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables provides for financial assistance in respect of operational programmes carried out by producer organisations recognised under the scheme.

      <P>At the meeting, the Taoiseach outlined the steps being taken by the Government under the national development plan in the western region, which comprises the counties of Connacht along with Clare and Donegal.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The importance that the Government attaches to agricultural education and training is reflected in the substantial resources it has provided to Teagasc in recent years to deliver first class education and training programmes and to provide student facilities on a par with those of comparable training institutes.</P>
      <P>I have always held the view that training is just as important for a career in agriculture as it is for any other career and, accordingly, fostering agricultural education and training has been one of my most important priorities. In November 1999, I established a special task force, representative of all the major stakeholders, to review the training needs of agriculture in the context of the changing social and economic environment and to make recommendations, where appropriate, to address those needs. Arising from the task force's recommendations, several significant developments have already taken place in Teagasc's programmes which will transform agricultural education and training in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the accreditation of the education and <Col N="989" /> training programmes by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, incorporating the Higher and Further Education and Training Awards Councils, has raised the standing of the qualifications, both nationally and internationally. Second, ten third level education programmes, with recruitment through the CAO system, are now provided jointly with the institutes of technology. Third, students who secure the necessary merit or distinction now have the opportunity to advance into university with a one year reduction in qualification time. In addition, vocational certificates in agriculture, horticulture, forestry and horses have been designed specifically to meet the needs of school leavers who do not wish to pursue the higher education programmes outlined above.</P>
    <P>A number of improvements have also taken place in regard to student allowances. The weekly allowance payable to students while on long-term placement is being doubled to &euro;190 this year. Last year a new weekly allowance of &euro;190 payable to students while on block release was introduced while the daily allowance payable to students undertaking courses at local Teagasc centres was doubled.</P>
    <P>The Government has also recognised the need for substantial capital investment in the training colleges and centres around the country. In the past two years, my Department has provided &euro;7.8 million to Teagasc to undertake major upgrading and refurbishment of the training facilities. As announced in the recent budget, the allocation for this purpose in the current year has been increased to &euro;6.3 million.</P>
    <P>In addition to the substantial resources provided to Teagasc, the state also provides a range of incentives to encourage young farmers to undertake training. These include stamp duty exemption, stock relief, installation aid, higher rates of investment aid, and priority access to additional quota under the ewe premium, suckler cow and milk quota schemes.</P>
    <P>All of these developments should have a positive impact on take-up of training opportunities. I am pleased to see that student intake into the agricultural and horticultural colleges has increased marginally this year to 900.</P>

      <P>The EPA has issued two reports recently relating to water quality in Ireland, both of which I think are relevant to the Deputy's question. The first is the report on water quality in Ireland 1998-2000 which con<Col N="990" /> cludes that for the first time since national surveys commenced, Irish river water quality has improved. I welcome this finding and I am particularly pleased to see that the report acknowledges the impact of measures and initiatives operated by my Department in improving the situation. The second report is the phosphorous regulations national implementing report, 2001 which, I note, refers to the continuing need to provide adequate slurry storage capacity.</P>
      <P>The importance of providing adequate slurry storage facilities has been long recognised by my Department, which has put in place a series of schemes over the years to encourage and assist farmers in the provision of such facilities. Some &euro;330 million in grant aid has been paid to farmers under on-farm investment schemes for this type of pollution control facilities over the last ten years and a further &euro;230 million has been set aside under the new farm waste management scheme for such work over the period 2000-2006. Grant-aid of up to 40% of approved costs is available under the scheme, and this is increased by a further 15% for young farmers in less-favoured areas and 5% for young farmers elsewhere.</P>
      <P>These grant rates are considered adequate and were agreed following extensive consultation. This scheme is reviewed on an on-going basis in order to ensure that it remains both attractive and effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have emphasised on many occasions that the main focus of my policy in relation to the operation of the milk quota regime in Ireland is to provide additional quota to small and medium size committed producers on a permanent basis and at a reasonable cost. My objectives are to improve the structure of milk production at producer level in Ireland and to make dairying a more profitable and efficient enterprise.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, I have introduced restructuring schemes on an annual basis under which over 115 million gallons of milk has been sold to small and medium sized producers. During that time I have reduced the price of quota under these schemes from &euro;0.49 per litre to &euro;0.31 per litre, i.e., a decrease of almost 37%. In the same period, I reduced the price of temporary leased quota by almost 50% from approximately &euro;0.06 per litre to &euro;0.04 per litre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I introduced revised milk quota regulations with effect from April 2000. The main objective of the changed regime was to introduce pro<Col N="991" /> visions whereby milk quota would be placed in the hands of committed dairy farmers on a permanent basis and at a reasonable cost. Almost 80 million gallons was reallocated permanently under the 2001-2002 milk quota restructuring schemes.</P>
    <P>In excess of 41 million gallons was allocated to producers with a quota of less than 180,000 litres while a further 27 million gallons was sold to producers with a quota between 180,000 and 275,000 litres during the last 2000-2001 restructuring schemes.</P>
    <P>I also allocated the 25 million gallons of additional quota, available to Ireland as part of the 32 million gallons of additional quota which I successfully negotiated under the Agenda 2000 agreement. Some 15 million gallons was allocated to over 21,000 active producers, with a quota of less than 55,000 gallons. A further 9.5 million gallons was allocated to some 3,400 younger dairy farmers with a quota of less than 35,000 gallons during the last two milk quota years.</P>
    <P>The new provisions have already had a significant impact, in that the vast bulk of the 140 million gallons of milk quota, which was available for allocation on a permanent basis, was granted to small and medium size producers. The number of medium sized producers increased by 65% between 1997 and 2001 while the number of smaller scale producers decreased by 38% during the same period.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government have introduced tax relief on the purchase of milk quota which will be of further benefit to milk producers in growing their enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The improvement of the quality of the national beef herd is a matter of considerable importance in relation to the future viability of beef farming in Ireland in that it will facilitate the production of high quality products which are demanded in the premium priced markets of Europe and, thereby, help the industry to reduce its dependence on the more and volatile third country markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality of our beef cattle can be improved through better breeding techniques and through the use of better husbandry practices at farm level. In regard to breeding, the pooling of resources and expertise in the cattle breeding area which took place with the formation of the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation provides a real opportunity to make significant progress in beef breed improvement over the coming years. The ICBF has a mandate to improve the breeding <Col N="992" /> quality of the Irish cattle herd. Breeding objectives are being clearly defined in the context of changing market requirements and farming systems and the achievement of these objectives is being pursued through the operation of a comprehensive national recording, testing and evaluation programme. Recently an important milestone in this development was marked when ICBF launched its new animal breeding database. This database will facilitate the capture of all animal breeding data and will be the cornerstone on which to build a cattle breeding programme to produce the type of high quality products that will meet the needs of consumers in the future. ICBF has the full support of my Department and the Government have allocated significant resources to ICBF under the national development plan between now and the end of 2006.</P>
    <P>Teagasc has also committed significant resources aimed in particular at improving the quality of our beef cows and regularly undertaken demonstrations around the country to promote better breeding. Teagasc are also using focused programmes to pro-actively promote the production of quality beef on a cost effective profitable basis, using efficient breeding and feeding systems.</P>
    <P>I have also sought to improve the quality of our beef cow herd by using the discretion available to me under the national envelope provided for in Agenda 2000 to encourage farmers to replace their older suckler cows with better quality replacement heifers. A total of &euro;10.4 million will be available for this measure this year.</P>
    <P>I should point out that if beef farmers are to produce better quality beef they must be rewarded in the form of increased returns from the marketplace for their product.</P>
    <P>In this regard, my Department has worked closely with the industry over the last few years to encourage the introduction of a graded pricing structure for cattle at slaughter. I am pleased to report that these efforts have yielded very positive results in the form of significant differentials for better quality carcases.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department has been to the forefront in pushing at European Union level for the introduction of mechanical classification which would help to underpin a structured quality based pricing system. In this regard, a trial in which an official from my Department was involved, was held in Germany last September and it is hoped that the Commission will set standards for the authorisation of machines which will allow their use in member states at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>All of these measures will assist farmers to upgrade and improve their beef herds and enable them to produce quality beef more efficiently, thereby resulting in a more secure future for Irish beef farmers.</P>

      <P>My Department has arrangements in place at main ports and airports to check compliance with the relevant import requirements as specified under EU legislation. The general conditions which apply to imports are as follows: The meat products must have been prepared and stored in an approved establishment, e.g. processing plant or cold store, and which has been allocated an approval number; the meat products must be marked with a health mark containing the initials of the exporting country and the approval number of the consigning establishment within an oval surround; and the consignment must be accompanied to destination by (a)(i) a commercial document which must bear, in addition to the health mark described above, a code number by which the competent authority responsible for supervising the establishment of origin can be identified if sourced from an establishment within the European Community, or in respect of imports from third countries, (ii) a health certificate conforming to model certificates as set down in EU legislation and issued by the competent authority at the time of loading and which has been signed by an official veterinarian of the competent authority of the exporting third country, and, (b) in the case of products containing meat derived from bovine animals slaughtered the United Kingdom, a health certificate which has been signed by an official veterinarian of the competent authority stating that the products conform to the relevant conditions laid down in Council Decision 98/256/EC, concerning emergency measures to protect against BSE.</P>
      <P>In respect of bovine meat products, additional labelling requirements apply under EU legislation requiring the compulsory labelling of beef at all stages of production and marketing up to and including the final point of sale to the consumer. The legislation was introduced in two stages. The first stage, which entered into force on 1 September 2000, requires operators or organisations to label beef with the following information: a reference number or code which enables the beef to be traced back to an animal or group of animals from which it was derived; the approval number of the slaughterhouse and member state or third country in which it is located, and; the approval number of the de-boning hall and member state or third country in which it is located.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second stage which came into effect on 1 January 2002 requires the following additional compulsory indication of the origin of the animal or group of animals from which the beef has been derived: the member state or third country where <Col N="994" /> the animal was born; the member state or third country where the animal was fattened; the member state or third country where the animal was slaughtered.</P>
    <P>In the case of restaurants, compulsory beef labelling requirements apply up to and including the sale of beef to the restaurant itself. This ensures that the proprietor of a restaurant has all the relevant information concerning the origin and production of the beef he has purchased and that he can provide traceability of the product should an issue of public health concern arise.  </P>

      <P>The difficulties encountered by low-income farmers in discharging land annuities were alleviated by writing off small annuities in 1979, 1989 and 1992. Additionally, a discounted buy out scheme for farmers was introduced in 1993. This provided for a 50% discount on the annuity redemption figure, conditional on all arrears being discharged.</P>

      <Quest>the outcome of a protest staged recently by the ICSA at his Department's offices in Mayo regarding non-payment of suckler cow premiums; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that under the suckler cow premium scheme my Department is obliged to carry out a range of checks and controls including cross-checks against the bovine animal database CMMS with a view to ensuring, <i>inter alia,</i> that the animals applied on were in the herd at time of application; the animals applied on, or suitable replacements, remained in the herd for the full retention period; and the heifer-cow ratio is respected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme, over 1.1 million animal tag numbers have been cross-checked in this manner and difficulties initially arose in respect of about 30,000 tags or 2.7% of animals. These difficulties mainly relate to farm-to-farm movements where, unfortunately, either the seller or buyer or both fail to notify the movement to the CMMS. Staff at local offices are also experiencing difficulties with birth and death notifications to the database. In quite a number of cases, animals being applied on as cows were, according to the CMMS, heifers at time of application. In other words if the animal <Col N="995" /> calved down, the birth was not properly notified to the database. It has also transpired that some 2,500 farmers who have already received an advance payment now appear to have slaughtered cows before the end of the retention period without notifying my Department of eligible replacements.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are other outstanding queries under this scheme relating to issues such as area aid problems, milk quota etc. In all such cases the farmers concerned have been advised of the outstanding problem.</P>
    <P>My Department met with representatives of the ICSA protesters and impressed on them that every effort, through contact with individual herdowners, is being made to have all outstanding cases cleared for payment. In this connection it is most important that farmers respond promptly to any queries. In many cases my Department is failing to get a response to its initial query necessitating the issue of second and sometimes third reminders. When outstanding queries in relation to a case are resolved the farmer can expect to receive payment within the following week. To date 93% of all applicants under the suckler cow premium scheme have been paid 80% advances amounting to some &euro;153 million. In addition, balancing payments commenced on 31 January 2002 and over &euro;37 million has been paid to date bringing the total paid overall to &euro;190.5 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The levels of brucellosis nationally have fallen significantly over the last three years as a result of my Department's intensified eradication programme. During this period the number of brucellosis reactors has fallen by 51% and the number of newly restricted herds has fallen by 49%.</P>
      <P>On the basis of all the scientific and epidemiological information available to me, farm dogs are not regarded as playing a significant role in the spread of brucellosis in Ireland. While dogs can become infected with bovine brucellosis and can develop antibodies in their blood, they appear to be a &ldquo;dead end host&rdquo; and generally do not spread the infection, and rarely if ever develop any symptoms.</P>
      <P>The two major sources of spread of brucellosis in Ireland are (1) contiguous spread, whereby infection spreads from one infected herd to a neighbouring herd, e.g. via infected slurry etc. and (2) bought in infection, whereby an infected animal is introduced into a herd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has put a number of measures in place to tackle these sources of spread includ<Col N="996" /> ing: an intensive testing programme, rapid removal of reactors and depopulation of herds in appropriate circumstances; a requirement to pre-movement test animals prior to purchase or sale; compulsory treatment of slurry on brucellosis infected farms; and awareness campaigns to remind farmers, veterinary practitioners and others of the biosecurity measures that should be taken to minimise the risk of the spread of brucellosis </P>

      <P>In June 1999 I established an independent group, the Agri Food 2010 Committee, to devise a long-term strategy for both agriculture and the food industry. The committee delivered its report in March 2000. In August 2000 I published the Agri Food 2010 plan of action which sets out the Government's policy response to the committee's recommendations. The plan of action envisages a dynamic agri-food sector in 2010 which offers farm families attractive and sustainable livelihood options, thus ensuring the maintenance of the maximum number on the land; has the necessary strength to compete <Col N="1000" /> successfully within the EU and on our main third country markets; values our rural environment as the basis of thriving rural communities; and is focused on meeting consumer demands, particularly for the highest standards of food safety.</P>
      <P>The plan of action contains 197 specific action points aimed at achieving this vision. An implementation report, published last December, shows that 94% of the action points are either complete or have seen substantial action taken.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Rural Development, published in August 1999, sets out a vision and framework for the development of our rural communities. The overall strategy provides for balanced regional development; investment in services and infrastructure; sustainable economic development; human resources development; a determined focus on poverty and social exclusion; and preservation of the culture and heritage of rural areas and protection of the environment.</P>
      <P>The main instrument for the delivery of the 2010 vision and the rural development strategy is the funding contained in the national development plan. The NDP provides &euro;8.5 billion over the period 2000-06 for rural areas, including just under &euro;6.1 billion for agriculture, food and related rural development.</P>
      <P>In October 2001 the CLÁR programme for revitalising rural areas was launched to promote social inclusion in 16 targeted rural areas. In addition to the NDP investments, there will be &euro;25.4 million available over the period to 2003 to underpin the success of the programme.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the necessary policy framework, underpinned by both national and EU funding, is in place, together with appropriate monitoring and review arrangements, to ensure the development of agriculture and of rural society, in a manner that will benefit all rural dwellers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of 2001 beef exports to continental EU and third country markets have been adversely affected by the BSE crisis in mainland Europe late last year. While no BSE related restrictions on Irish beef or beef products have been imposed by the EU Commission or by an EU member state loss of consumer confidence in beef has led to reduced beef consumption in mainland Europe. While exports to continental markets fell substantially during that year, I am happy to say that decline has been offset by increased beef exports to the UK. Exports to this market came to about double the levels achieved in 2000 and the indications are that this level of trade will continue for the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beef consumption in the EU as a whole is steadily recovering from the serious collapse which took place in late 2000. This is due to a restoration of confidence in the product as a result of measures taken at EU level. Also, the market support measures put in place to deal with the overhang of product on the market have had a useful effect in helping to restore balance. All of <Col N="1002" /> this will help Ireland's efforts to regain its former levels of sales to the markets in question.</P>
    <P>Efforts at political, diplomat and technical levels are continuing to secure the reopening of important third country markets, most of which were closed to us following the BSE crisis last year. Earlier this year the Russian market for Irish beef, which was closed following the foot and mouth disease crisis reopened. My Department, together with the Department of Foreign Affairs and An Bord Bia, has worked intensively to point out to the authorities in those markets the level and effectiveness of the controls in place in Ireland and to emphasise the guarantees in relation to food safety that we can offer to consumers of Irish beef. Particular attention was given to Egypt as our largest single market for beef exports. We have been successful in regaining access to this significantly important market. It is hoped that the reopening of the Egyptian market will help towards the reopening of other important markets in the region and elsewhere. Efforts towards this end are continuing.</P>
    <P>Ireland exports the vast bulk of its milk products into the EU internal market, the principal markets being the UK, Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and France. Belgium and Italy are also valuable markets for Irish products. Further afield Ireland has developed a broad range of export markets, chief amongst these being in Asia and Latin America, with the US being the principal third country destination for casein and caseinates.</P>
    <P>Dairy consumption worldwide is forecast to grow by 2% per annum between now and 2006, with significant growth expected in Asia, Latin America and possibly Central and Eastern Europe. Ireland is well placed to take advantage of this expected growth in the world dairy trade.</P>

Discussions on this proposal are progressing at a technical level and experts from my Department are participating in ongoing working party meetings. I have not had direct discussions with Commissioner Byrne on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall objective of the proposal, which I support, is to develop a clearer, more systematic approach to the monitoring of controls carried <Col N="1003" /> out by the competent authorities in member states and third countries exporting to the Community in the following four broad areas: the implementation of Community legislation by member states on the production of food, plants and animals within the Community; the application of Community requirements by third countries in their own territory in relation to products they export to the Community; the implementation by member states of import controls on food, animals and plants at point of entry into the Community; and the application of sanctions where member states or third countries are not acting in compliance with Community legislation.</P>

      <P>A working group in my Department has considered various aspects of farming in partnership and identified many of the issues involved in setting up and operating partnerships. These issues include legal status, entitlement to various aids, rights and benefits and what happens on the dissolution of partnerships. There are many complex and difficult questions to be resolved.</P>
      <P>Provision is made for farming partnerships in many of the schemes operated by my Department. The working group recommended that introduction of new provisions for farming partnerships in the context of the milk quota regime should be a pilot for testing the way partnerships might be progressed in the future.</P>
      <P>Within the next few days I will sign a statutory instrument laying down the detailed rules for the registration of milk production partnerships with effect from 1 April. This development will further enhance the milk quota regime which I significantly improved through the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations, 2000. My objective continues to be to assist active milk producers to achieve greater efficiency in their operations while safeguarding a wide spectrum of producers.</P>
      <P>In essence the regulations will provide for the pooling of two quotas, two holdings and the producers' agricultural assets. Each producer will continue to hold their quota and eligibility for additional quota while jointly operating the partnership's herd and facilities. This is a significant departure from standard practice to date. Therefore, the situation will be closely monitored and reviewed in a year or so with a view to drawing lessons for the future application of this model to milk production and possibly other sectors.</P>

      <P>I have received representations from a number of firms in the equine industry regarding staff shortages and requesting special treatment in regard to applications for work permits.</P>
      <P>Applications for work permits are processed strictly in the order in which they are received. My Department's work permits section regularly receives representations from various companies and industries seeking special treatment in regard to the processing of applications. In view of the number of sectors seeking priority attention I do not consider that it would be fair or practical to single out a particular sector for special attention. Where an emergency arises the work permits section is prepared to consider the case on its merits.</P>
      <P>The new procedures, introduced with effect from 2 January, are intended to assist employers to find personnel from within the home market, in the first instance, or in the wider European economic area. Applications for work permits will be considered where this cannot be done. There is no question of denying work permits to this or any other sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Decisions on the underwriting of insurance risks and the setting of premiums are matters for judgment by private insurance companies. EU law prevents us from intervening directly in the matter. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk. In the case of motor insurance, premiums are normally based on underwriting experience, including trends in the level, frequency and cost of claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" />Since the transposition into Irish Law of the EU Third Framework Insurance Directives in 1994, insurance companies authorised in any one member state may provide insurance cover throughout the EU on the basis of their home country authorisation. This has opened up the Irish market to competition from insurance providers in other EU countries. I have constantly encouraged such competition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained in my reply to the Deputy's parliamentary question of 19 June 2001, three aquaculture licences for the bottom culture of mussels in Lough Swilly were granted in November 1999 under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997. The licences were granted following public advertisement of the applications in <i>The Derry People and Donegal News</i> on 31 October 1997 and 25 June 1999. No objections were received in response to the advertisements or from the statutory consultees including the Northern Regional Fisheries Board which were consulted directly. The decision to license in each case was also publicly advertised in <i>The Derry People and Donegal News</i> on 24 September 1999. No appeal against that decision was made to the independent statutory Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board established under that Act.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the granting of licences for the bottom culture of mussels in Lough Swilly, the Department became aware that part of the areas licensed might contain wild oysters. In order to establish if such areas existed, and to determine whether they represented a commercially viable resource, a comprehensive survey was undertaken by the Cross-Border Aquaculture Team-BIM. The survey revealed that a portion of one licensed area did contain wild oysters. This was the first systematic survey of oyster stocks in the lough to be carried out and the results are currently being assessed.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the mussel seeding to which the Deputy refers was not in contravention of the conditions of the licences issued. There have been preliminary discussions between the licence holders and local oyster fishermen in the context of the co-ordinated local aquaculture management systems process. It is hoped that a local agreement can be reached which will provide the basis for a mutually acceptable resolution of the matter.</P>

      <P>Under the SMI and in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, my Department's secretary general is required to submit, for my approval, strategy statements covering a period of three years. The current strategy statement for my Department, covering the period 2001 to 2003, inclusive, was approved by me and published last year.</P>
      <P>The secretary general is also required under the PSMA to prepare annual reports outlining the progress made in achieving the high level objectives and priorities contained in the strategy statements. Annual reports were produced for each of the years covered by my Department's previous statement of strategy for 1998 to 2000, inclusive. Later this year the first annual report on the strategy statement for the period 2001 to 2003 will be published.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness sets out objectives for the modernisation of the Civil Service in the period 2000 to 2002, inclusive. Under the PPF each Department is required to develop performance indicators in relation to these objectives. These will be processed through the partnership structures established under Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>My Department's performance indicators were submitted to, and accepted by, the CSQAG, an independent body established to assess progress in achieving the objectives of the modernisation programme. I am satisfied that they provide an effective basis on which to review and measure progress on the implementation of the SMI-modernisation programme in my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department is required to submit a report to the CSQAG detailing the progress in achieving its performance indicators in the period up to 1 April. The group will then conduct an independent assessment of the progress made by my Department in meeting the PPF objectives for the modernisation programme in the context of the final 4% payment under the PPF.</P>

      <P>In 1998 Wavegen (Ireland) Limited was successful in the wave-to-energy category of the third alternative energy requirement competition, AER III. The applicant proposed to build a 2 megawatt wave energy to electricity generating plant at Tullig, near Kilkee, County Clare.</P>
      <P>European Regional Development Fund grant-aid was offered towards the costs of building suitable infrastructural projects under AER III. European Regional Development Fund grant aid generally was confined to infrastructural projects in proven technologies only. The relevant European Regional Development Fund monitoring committee concluded the proposed project in the wave-to-energy category was more suitable for consideration under a research and development programme and the offer of grant aid was withdrawn. In the circumstances the company decided not to proceed with the project.</P>
      <P>There is clearly more work required on the research and development aspects of the wave-to-energy technology. I have secured &euro;16.25 million under the NDP to fund a programme to assist in the development of renewable energy technologies generally up to 2006. This is a major step forward providing a framework programme to fund the research and developmental works necessary to take forward the more innovative and high risk activities in this area. Recently the Irish Energy Centre, which is co-funded by my Department, put out to consultation a document on a strategy programme for renewable energy research, development and demonstration.</P>
      <P>The consultation document highlights specific priorities in wave and tidal energy technologies. This would include research to identify the most suitable locations for wave and tidal energy devices, development of cheaper sub-sea cabling and installation methods and the demonstration of wave energy projects. The closing date for submissions to the consultation process is 31 March. It is envisaged that the research and development programme will be launched later this year.</P>

      <P>The modernisation programme for the public service, as contained in Framework 1.4 of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, sets out the primary objectives of the SMI and the related sectoral strategies, which have informed and driven progress in my Department. Specific initiatives under the PPF include: the publication of three year strategy statements and the preparation of annual progress reports on the achievement of the strategic objectives that they contain; annual business planning cycles; publication of quality customer service plans; and the implementation of improved financial management and IT systems.</P>
      <P>My Department has been to the forefront of developments of the modernisation programme under SMI. In particular, progress in the development of the new management information framework, incorporating a new financial accounting system, has been spearheaded in my Department. Also, a strategic priority of my Department is the development and promotion of e-government and the continued training and development of staff to provide the organisational capability and flexibility necessary to ensure better quality in service delivery and the enhancement of policy analysis, development and implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the SMI, progress on initiatives is monitored through the partnership process established under Partnership 2000. As required under section 1.4.1 of the PPF, the partnership committee developed and agreed a list of performance indicators in relation to those initiatives. This committee is chaired by the secretary general and represents staff and management <Col N="1017" /> interests in the Department. Thus, the modernisation agenda is advanced through the participative process of partnership.</P>
    <P>My Department's performance indicators have been examined and approved by the Civil Service quality assurance group. This is an independent body established under the PPF to assess progress in achieving the objectives of the SMI. I am satisfied that the targets represented by these performance indicators are focused on outcomes that are measurable and achievable. My Department will submit a report to the CSQAG after 1 April detailing progress in achieving its performance indicators. This group will then make an independent assessment of my Department's progress in meeting the objectives for the modernisation agenda in the context of the PPF.</P>

      <P>At present my Department is in the process of engaging consultants to carry out a strategic rail study. In the coming days a notice will appear in the Official Journal of the European Communities requesting interested parties to submit tenders to undertake such work.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the study are on the following lines: prepare a strategic framework for future rail development in Ireland over the next 20 years having regard to the spatial planning context provided by the forthcoming national spatial strategy; the extensive public transport investment programme under the NDP; relevant findings and conclusions of Iarnród Éireann report entitled The Way Forward; the desirability of rail freight services; and take account of various land use and transportation strategies being developed by local authorities and other proposals for expanding rail infrastructure and services throughout the country; and the forthcoming report of the task force established by the Minister for Marine and Natural Resources on transport and logistics in connection with ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More terms of reference are: quantify the broad financial requirements, capital investment and ongoing operational/maintenance, for the recommended railway development strategy, including consideration of the implications for the Exchequer in terms of capital and current funding, the scope for alternative funding mechanisms and pricing policies; and assess the costs and benefits of the recommended development strategy for the railways to include an assessment of likely usage, regional development impacts, environmental impacts and transport impacts, <Col N="1018" /> including safety, congestion relief and diversion from other transport modes.</P>
    <P>The study will consider proposals from Iarnród Éireann and various interested parties here. Some of the routes to be examined by the study are as follows: a new service linking Blarney, Cork and Midleton; a link between Ennis, Shannon town and airport and Limerick; a commuter service between Athenry and Galway; a commuter service linking Colooney, Ballisodare and Ballymote with Sligo; a western rail corridor linking Sligo, Galway, Limerick and Cork; and the Athlone to Mullingar route.</P>
    <P>There will be a wide ranging consultation process in relation to the rail study and already there have been consultations with the Public Transport Partnership Forum on the terms of reference.</P>

      <P>During the period 1990 to 2000 a total of &euro;652.4 million, excluding administration costs, was spent on my Department's bovine TB and brucellosis eradication schemes. It is not possible to break down the cost of each scheme due to the fact that the majority of TB tests and brucellosis tests are undertaken simultaneously.</P>
      <P>The incidence of bovine TB is measured by the number of reactor animals per 1,000 tests. The average APT for the period was 3.2. Since 1999 the national incidence of bovine tuberculosis has been decreasing. This downward trend continued in 2001 and the provisional data available to my Department indicates that for 2001 the total number of reactors here will be less than 34,000 compared with a figure of 39,847 in 2000. The APT was reduced to 3.55 in 2001 from 3.9 in 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incidence of brucellosis is measured by the <Col N="1020" /> number of individual holdings restricted. In the period the total number of new restrictions was 6,129. Since 1998 the number of newly restricted herds has fallen by 49% from 1,081 in that year to 553 in 2001. With the maintenance of current testing levels it is reasonable to expect that the disease can be eradicated in the short to medium term.</P>
    <P>My Department is committed to meeting the objectives agreed under the PPF, to reduce the current incidence of TB by 50% in the worst affected areas and to make progress towards the eradication of brucellosis.</P>
    <P>In relation to TB and brucellosis, resources are being assigned to carrying out investigative work into the causes of herd break-downs, and to taking a pro-active approach to the removal of all sources of infection. Current procedures and practices will continue to ensure the gradual reduction in the incidence of both these diseases. These will be augmented by new research and testing methods.</P>

      <P>Recently Kilkenny County Council presented my Department with a feasibility study on horse accommodation for Traveller horse owners in Kilkenny. In the near future it is intended to hold a meeting between my Department's officials and the county council to discuss it.</P>
      <P>Support for this project falls to be considered by the local authority. Under the provisions of the Control Of Horses Act grant assistance where horse projects are involved is and can only be provided to the relevant local authority which must be involved in the project. It is my Department's understanding that the feasibility study has not been adopted by Kilkenny County Council nor has it made a formal decision on the project.  </P>
      <P>With regard to funding of equine projects, where a local authority supports and is involved in a project within the context of implementing the Control of Horses Act, 1996, subject to the availability of funding, my Department will give grant assistance to that local authority.  </P>

      <P>The area based compensatory allowance scheme, agreed in July 2000 and approved by the European Commission in the context of the CAP rural development plan, provides for area related payments as follows: more severely handicapped (lowland) &ndash;&euro;88.88, £70, per hectare up to 45 hectares; less severely handicapped (lowland) &ndash;&euro;76.18, £60, per hec<Col N="1023" /> tare up to 45 hectares; and mountain type land &ndash;&euro;57.14, £45, per hectare up to 60 hectares.</P>
      <P>Following a thorough review of the area based compensatory allowance scheme, proposals have been submitted to the European Commission for increased payment rates for farmers with mountain type land. The proposal involves making a payment of &euro;101.58 or £80 per hectare on the first ten hectares of mountain type land. There would also be a payment of &euro;88.88 or £70 per hectare on each remaining hectare, subject to an overall payment ceiling of 45 hectares. Subject to securing the necessary EU approval it is intended that the revised payment rates will apply from 2001.</P>

      <Quest>the expected levels of nitrogenous fertiliser used here in 2010 on a no policy change basis; and the way in which he proposes to reduce this level by 10% in accordance with the commitment in the national climate change strategy.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The business as usual projection for nitrogenous fertiliser usage in 2010 is in the region of 420,000 tonnes.</P>
      <P>A number of policy options will contribute to reaching the target for reduction in emissions of nitrous oxide under the national climate change strategy. Under the CAP rural development plan, it is projected that there will be 70,000 farmers in the new rural environment protection scheme by 2006. The impact of this additional participation in REPS will lead to a more sustainable farming environment. It is anticipated that an extra 25,000 farmers will follow nutrient management plans by comparison with REPS 1 thus improving the management of organic manures and chemical fertilisers.</P>
      <P>Under the Agenda 2000 agreement all farmers receiving payments under various Department's schemes, including the direct payment schemes, must practice farming in accordance with certain environmental requirements. Accordingly, my Department published a good farming practice booklet in August 2001 and distributed it to all farmers. Key aspects of the booklet include nutrient and grassland management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1024" />In addition, recently published new fertiliser recommendations by Teagasc are aimed at ensuring the most cost efficient production of milk, meat and tillage crops while also minimising risk to the environment.</P>
    <P>I expect that these measures will bring about a reduction in the amount of nitrogenous fertiliser used. Furthermore a research programme, under the Environmental RTDI Programme 2000-2006, is in place to identify potential actions that could be applied to reduce emissions of nitrous oxide. The implementation of existing and proposed environmental legislation should also lead to a reduction in nitrous oxide emissions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>The commitment in the national climate change strategy is to secure methane or CH4 emission reductions equivalent to a reduction of 10% in livestock numbers by 2010. A number of policy options will contribute to achieving the target and an appropriate balance will be maintained between direct reductions in stock numbers and other measures.</P>
      <P>The encouragement of less intensive levels of livestock farming following from the Agenda 2000 outcome will contribute to a reduction in the emissions of methane. The change in the disadvantaged areas compensatory allowances scheme from an animal based system to an area based system removes the incentive to maximise stocking densities. This will also be a factor in reducing methane emissions. A change in market demand for beef leading to a reduction in age at slaughter would also contribute positively to meeting climate change targets.</P>
      <P>A research programme is being undertaken to identify potential actions that would contribute to meeting the strategy's targets in the agriculture area. The research includes assessing the impact of different levels of concentrates in the diet of bovine animals on methane emissions and age of slaughter. Different feeding stuffs, dietary supplements or additives are also being examined with regard to their impact on methane emissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Based on the data in the national climate change strategy projected livestock numbers in <Col N="1025" /> 2010 in a business as usual or no policy change situation are as follows:</P>

      <P>It is my policy, and that of the Government, that everything possible is done to ensure that Irish livestock and meat producers have unrestricted access to all of our important markets world wide. No effort is being spared to bring this about.</P>
      <P>With regard to third countries, many of which imposed bans on EU beef following the BSE crisis in mainland Europe, efforts at political, diplomat and technical level are continuing to secure the reopening of these important markets. My Department, together with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia, has worked intensively to emphasise to the authorities in those markets the guarantees in relation to food safety we can offer to consumers of Irish beef. Particular attention was given to Egypt which had been our largest single market for beef exports. As the Deputy will be aware, this strategy proved successful in regaining access to this significantly important market. We were also successful in reopening the Russian in the aftermath of last year's foot and mouth disease crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Special attention is also being focused on the Gulf region which is a significant market for Irish beef. Last year a senior veterinary official from my Department visited the region to brief the rel<Col N="1027" /> evant authorities on our BSE problem. Our ambassador to Saudi Arabia has also kept in very close contact with all the important countries in the region. At present a further visit by a senior delegation from my Department is being arranged and meetings have been sought with the appropriate authorities. Renewed invitations to visit Ireland are also being issued to the authorities in question.</P>
    <P>My Department is also in contact with the authorities in South Africa, Algeria and Indonesia with a view to their sending technical delegations to visit Ireland to assess the quality of the controls in place here with regard to livestock and beef production. Last year I visited South Africa for discussions on the reopening of the beef market there. I am confident that in the course of such visits we can satisfactorily demonstrate to the delegations concerned the quality of our product and the effectiveness of the many layers of controls we have in place to protect the consumer.</P>

      <P>A national sheep identification system came into operation in June 2001 in the aftermath of the foot and mouth disease crisis last year. Initially the introduction of the system involved the tagging of all animals which were being moved off farms, followed by the tagging of the entire national flock by the end of last year. The system encompasses producers, marts, meat factories and others and provides for traceability from farm of origin through to the eventual carcass. Lamb processors are now required to link an individual sheep number to the number of the individual carcass, thereby ensuring full traceability and satisfying themselves as to the provenance of any animals they purchase.</P>
      <P>My Department has developed and implemented a computerised cattle movement and monitoring system which has been operational for a number of years. CMMS records and tracks all bovines in Ireland from birth to slaughter and operates at all levels of production including farms, marts, ports and slaughterhouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traceability within the beef sector has been enhanced by the introduction of compulsory labelling requirements during the period to which the Deputy refers. Specifically, these requirements, which entered into force on 1 January 2002, require operators involved in the production and marketing of beef to include on their labels an indication of the member state or third <Col N="1028" /> country in which the animal was born, raised and slaughtered. This is in addition to earlier measures introduced in September 2000 requiring beef to be labelled with the following: a batch number, enabling it to be traced back to the animal or group of animals from which it was derived; the approval number of the slaughterhouse and the member state or third country in which it is located; and the approval number of the slaughterhouse and the member state or third country in which it is located.</P>

      <P>As a result of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom on 21 February 2001, all imports of susceptible animals were suspended from that date. Subsequently, revised controls were put in place to allow for the importation of sheep from Northern Ireland. Prior to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK, there was a bilateral agreement in place with Northern Ireland under which sheep could be moved freely between both jurisdictions. Full intra-community trade rules are now being applied to cross-Border trade. These rules require, <i>inter alia</i>, prior notification by the member state of export to the importing member state. Under a recent EU Commission proposal, the ban on exports of sheep from Great Britain will be lifted in the near future.</P>

      <P>The original rural environment protection scheme was introduced in June 1994. When this scheme closed to new applications in December 1999, there were 45,500 active participants. Direct payments to REPS farmers during this period came to some &euro;600 million.</P>
      <P>A successor scheme was introduced in November 2000 and overall expenditure on REPS is now approaching &euro;1 billion. Since November 2000 over 16,800 applications have been received to participate in the new scheme. During 2001, 15,958 applications were received, the highest number of applications received in one year since REPS was introduced. More than 14,300 of these were processed in 2001.</P>
      <P>REPS is now one of the most important schemes in Irish agriculture. The level of interest and commitment to the scheme among the farming community shows no sign of diminishing. As well as being a most important source of income to farmers, REPS also has a significant positive impact on the quality of the rural environment, which benefits the day-to-day lives of all rural communities. I am satisfied that the scheme is operating well and is very beneficial to the country as a whole and the rural community in particular. I would urge all farmers to carefully consider the advantages that REPS can offer them.</P>

      <P>A static analysis undertaken by my Department immediately after the Agenda 2000 agreement in March 1999 estimated that the agreement would deliver a gain in aggregate farm income of &euro;502 million over the period 2000 to 2006. The national gain over the period was estimated at a total of &euro;846 million, because of additional benefits to the national economy from lower product prices.</P>
      <P>Using econometric modelling techniques, the FAPRI-Ireland partnership published a more detailed and dynamic analysis of the Agenda 2000 agreement in May 1999. This compared the Agenda 2000 changes with a baseline, defined as no policy change, over the period to 2007. This analysis concluded that the Agenda 2000 changes represented a total gain of &euro;971 million in aggregate farm income over the period 2000 to 2007. Both analyses indicated that the Agenda 2000 agreement represented a remarkably successful outcome for Irish agriculture and the economy in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agenda 2000 changes are being phased-in <Col N="1030" /> over a number of years: in the arable sector, price reductions and increases in premium payments were introduced in two equal steps in 2000 and 2001; in the beef sector, price reductions, increases in premia payments, new slaughter premia and national envelope payments are being phased in over the period 2000 to 2002; in the milk sector, a special quota increase for Ireland, three other member states, and for Northern Ireland, was introduced in two steps in 2000 and 2001; price reductions and compensating premium payments will be phased-in from 2005 to 2007. Therefore, the Agenda 2000 changes are not yet complete.</P>
    <P>Because of the BSE crisis which emerged towards the end of 2000, the Commission introduced proposals for certain changes in the beef regime to address the attendant market difficulties. These changes included an increase in the intervention intake ceiling to support cattle prices, as well as reductions in stocking density for premium purposes, with an estimated reduction of &euro;6 million a year in premium income for Irish farms.</P>
    <P>The Agenda 2000 agreement provided for a number of reviews: a review of the Agricultural Guideline, that is the legal limit on the volume of agricultural expenditure; a decision on whether to further reduce guaranteed prices and to further increase direct payments for cereals; a review of the oilseeds market; a review of the milk quota regime; and a review of expenditure to ensure that it does not exceed an annual average amount of &euro;40.5 billion in 1999 prices.</P>
    <P>It now seems likely that these reviews will be combined in an overall review of the Agreement this year. I expect that the Commission will publish its initial proposals in June, and negotiations on these are likely to continue to the end of the year at least.</P>

      <P>To date, almost &euro;757 million has been paid to farmers under the various 2001 livestock premia, compensatory allowances and arable aid schemes. Payments under the new area-based compensatory allowance scheme commenced on 21 September 2001, and in excess of &euro;214 million has been paid out to applicants, 96% of whom were successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1032" />In normal circumstances, payments under the 2001 ewe premium scheme would issue within the targets agreed in the protocol. However, due to the discrepancies which were highlighted during the cull of sheep in the Cooley peninsula, and because inspections could not be carried out during the FMD crisis, further enhanced controls agreed with the European Commission had to be applied before payments could commence. As a result, payment of the first instalment was delayed and did not commence until 17 July 2001. Payment of the second instalment commenced on target, on 19 October 2001, and a total of &euro;48.6 million has been paid to 96% of all applicants under this scheme. Payment of the third and final instalment will commence as soon as the EU regulation setting the rate is published. It is anticipated that the regulation will be published shortly and that payments will commence during this month.</P>
    <P>The position on the 2001 arable aid scheme is that payments commenced in accordance with EU rules, on 16 November 2001, and in excess of &euro;128m has now been paid to applicants, 98% of whom were successful.</P>
    <P>Under the protocol, advance payments of 60% under the 2001 cattle premium schemes were due to commence on 16 October 2001. However, following strong representations from Ireland, the European Commission agreed to increase the advance payment to 80% of entitlement for 2001. Payments under these schemes commenced on 26 October 2001, the day the EU regulation giving effect to the increased payment was published.</P>
    <P>To date, 94% of January to October applicants under the 2001 special beef premium scheme have been paid advances totalling &euro;119 million. Advance payments in respect of November and December applications will be made in late February and late March respectively, in line with the protocol commitments. Balancing payments are scheduled to commence in April, when all checks with regard to stocking density requirements are carried out.</P>
    <P>The position on the slaughter premium scheme, including national envelope, is that over &euro;58 million has been paid to 93% of applicants in respect of January to September slaughterings. Payments in respect of October to December slaughterings are expected to be made in the next two weeks. Balancing payments under this scheme will commence as soon as the quota usage for 2001 is established, which is in line with protocol commitments.</P>
    <P>To date 93% of all applicants under the suckler cow premium scheme have been paid 80% advances amounting to over &euro;153 million. Payment of the 20% balances commenced on target on 31 January 2002, and over &euro;37 million has been paid to date. This brings the overall total paid so far under this scheme to &euro;190.5 million. My Department is making every effort, through contact with individual herdowners, to have all outstanding cases under the suckler cow premium scheme cleared for payment. In this respect, it is <Col N="1033" /> most important that farmers respond promptly to any queries.  Indications are that, in many cases, my Department is not getting a response to its initial query, necessitating the issue of second and sometimes third reminders. When outstanding queries in relation to a case are resolved, the farmer can expect to receive payment within the following week.</P>
    <P>Full payments under the 2001 extensification premium scheme will be made in June 2002, as agreed in the Protocol on Direct Payments to Farmers.</P>
    <P>Payments under livestock premia schemes are continuing over the coming months with a view to having all eligible cases paid by 30 June 2002, in accordance with the protocol and EU rules.  </P>

      <P>The pig industry's main challenge is to ensure its continued competitiveness in the face of competition from imports on the domestic market, and the competitiveness of our exports on EU and third country markets. Where we have been excluded from third country markets due to FMD, it has been a top priority to regain access once our OIE FMD-free status was restored. This has been successful in the case of the USA, and a Japanese veterinary delegation is due in Ireland in the coming weeks. I am hopeful that, in the case of Japan, we will be successful in re-entering what has been a valuable outlet for Ireland in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A strategic study of the pigmeat industry on <Col N="1035" /> the island of Ireland was commissioned by Minister Bríd Rogers and myself, in order to assess the current state of the industry. The report identifies rationalisation of slaughter capacity, scaling-up of plant size and better capacity utilisation as necessary prerequisites to positioning the industry to compete on national and export markets and bringing it into line with international best practice. There are other recommendations on improving the reliability and consistency of supply to the secondary processing and catering sectors, development of the value added sector and promotion of supply chain agreements.</P>
    <P>While most of the findings of the study are very much matters within the control of the industry, Enterprise Ireland has been developing the report findings with pig producers and processors over recent months, and both Enterprise Ireland and my Department will continue to progress the issues raised.</P>
    <P>The AgriFood 2010 committee also identified rationalisation of processing capacity as an essential ingredient in achieving competitiveness. The Government's response to this report includes an undertaking that measures under the national development plan will include assistance for suitable projects put forward by the pig processing industry which are consistent with the direction in which the industry needs to go in terms of structure of processing capacity, development of product portfolio and overall competitiveness. Pigmeat is also included in Bord Bia's publicly-funded marketing promotion measures in this country and abroad.</P>

      <P>The annual value of the poultry industry for the year 2000 was estimated at &euro;188 million, IR£148 million. In my view, there is considerable potential for the poultry industry to expand and develop in the future. The issues which arise in realising this potential include the capacity to withstand competition, scale of processing facilities and the need for more market-orientated and value added products. While demand for poultrymeat is expected to continue to grow, the industry is facing considerable competition from imported product in its attempts to maintain market share.</P>

      <P>A new round of multilateral trade negotiations was launched at the WTO ministerial conference in Doha in November 2001. While not prejudging the outcome of the negotiations, the ministerial declaration for the round commits WTO Members to negotiations in relation to agriculture aimed at: substantial improvements in market access, reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies and substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support.</P>
      <P>The declaration also provides that special and differential treatment for developing countries shall be an integral part of all elements of the negotiations and that non-trade concerns will be taken into account.</P>
      <P>It would be inappropriate to speculate on the outcome of the negotiations, which are scheduled to conclude by 2005. However, I am satisfied that the terms of the ministerial declaration are in accordance with the EU's negotiating mandate on agriculture, which was agreed by the Council of Ministers and which is largely based on the Agenda 2000 agreement. The mandate provides a satisfactory framework for protecting the interests of the Irish agriculture and food industries and it is my intention to ensure that it will be respected in the forthcoming negotiations. The fact that the outcome of the negotiations on export subsidies, in particular, is not prejudged, represented a major achievement for Ireland at the Doha conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In preparation for the future challenges and opportunities that may emerge for the Irish agriculture and food industries, in June 1999, I established a group to make recommendations on the development of those industries over the current decade.

Sub<Col N="1037" /> stantial funding for the implementation of the plan of action has been provided in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. I am confident, therefore, that the agriculture and food industries will be well prepared to cope with any increased competition on the domestic market and to exploit opportunities on export markets, so maximising their contribution to Irish wealth and employment and the development of rural areas over the next ten years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 125 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>The national climate change strategy provides a framework for achieving greenhouse gas emission reductions in the most efficient and equitable manner, while continuing to support economic growth and prepare Ireland for the more ambitious commitments that will be required after 2012.</P>
      <P>The national climate change strategy states that measures will be taken to limit the rate of increase in overall fuel consumption. A switch to alternative, cleaner and more CO2 efficient fuels will also be encouraged. The strategy also states that it is intended to progressively reduce the incentive for foreign purchase of fuel in the State by 2008. This will be achieved by setting excise duty on transport fuel at appropriate levels. In the budget in December 2001, I announced increases in both petrol and auto diesel which took effect from budget night, with a further increase for auto diesel from 1 March 2002 for auto diesel with a higher sulphur content. This measure is designed to encourage a speedy changeover to the use of low sulphur diesel. It would not be appropriate for any Minister for Finance to indicate in advance any further tax measures that may be under consideration.</P>
      <P>As I have said in the past, taxation can play a part in attaining environmental goals. However, as Minister for Finance, I am concerned to ensure that tax measures take into account the effect on Ireland's international competitiveness, particularly in relation to non-EU countries which compete with us, and which may have low taxes on energy. When framing policy, I am also concerned about the effect that the imposition of such taxes may have on the consumer price index, as well as the way in which such taxes could impact on the less well off members of our community.</P>
      <P>As provided for in the national climate change strategy, a cross-departmental climate change team has been established to ensure the early implementation of the strategy. The team is chaired by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. A number of support groups have also been established to assist the team, including an economic analysis sub-group. I understand that its work is ongoing. Taxation issues arising from work of the climate change team are considered by the tax strategy group which is chaired by an official from my Department.</P>

    <P>Tax rates on fuels are monitored on a regular basis. I have no doubt that tax measures will affect the rate of consumption, although this is less certain where the tax content is already very high. Other factors also affect fuel consumption, notably economic growth and increasing use of private vehicles for transport (on which the tax element is also substantial).</P>

      <P>I am informed by my officials in the Office of Public Works that the Dukes Meadows residents association letters of 16 August 2001 and 7 September 2001 deal with a range of issues arising from the River Nore (Kilkenny City) drainage scheme that have been the subject of a number of previous discussions with the residents' representatives. The issues of concern to the residents refer mainly to the following topics: (a) the phasing and details of the work affecting the Dukes Meadows site; (b) the physical properties of the fill material to be placed on Dukes <Col N="1040" /> Meadows; and (c) environmental monitoring of the works.</P>
      <P>Information regarding the physical properties of the fill material has already been issued to the residents. This information was taken from the ground investigation factual report. A full copy of the factual report, and also a copy of a geotechnical interpretative report based on the findings of the ground investigation, are now being forwarded to the residents association for the information of its technical sub-committee.</P>
      <P>The specification for environmental monitoring of the works has already been sent to the residents' association. Arrangements for the testing of the fill material to be placed in the &ldquo;meadow&rdquo; have been put in place. Owing to the late start of the construction works on the scheme and the intervening winter period, the phasing arrangement for the works in Dukes Meadows has yet to be finalised. There is an ongoing arrangement in place whereby Office of Public Works officials and the Office of Public Works's consulting engineers meet with residents association representatives three times a year to discuss concerns and monitor progress. It is intended to have the next such meeting in the near future, when it is hoped to finalise all outstanding issues. The resident engineer for the scheme, who is based in Kilkenny for the duration of the project, is also available at all times to help the residents association in relation to any queries or concerns they may have.</P>

      <P>I have noted the comments of the National Competitiveness Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In presenting the budget to the Dáil in December 2001, I forecast that real GNP growth of the order of 3.5% was likely for 2002, and that the Irish economy would gain momentum during the second half of this year. Given the likely developments in employment over the short-<Col N="1041" /> term, I expect labour productivity growth, as measured by real GNP growth per person employed, to be of the order of 2% for 2002. With wages expected to grow in excess of productivity growth, I expect to see a gap between wages and productivity of the order of 5% in 2002.</P>
    <P>At budget time, I said that there were considerable down-side risks to my forecasts. In particular, the stronger pace of cost growth here than in many of our competitor-countries was a cause for concern. I indicated that one of the key priorities for policy makers was dealing with this weakening of competitiveness on the cost front and, more broadly, <i>inter alia</i>, by adhering to the current agreement with the social partners, the PPF.</P>

      <P>As part of the strategic management initiative, the Secretary General of my Department is required to submit for my approval three-year statements of strategy and to prepare annual progress reports on achieving the strategic priorities and high-level objectives which they contain. The detailed elements of these statements are put in place through the Department's annual business cycle, and the resulting business plans or work programmes are monitored by the management advisory committee, which is chaired by the Secretary General. A full set of progress reports has <Col N="1042" /> been published for the 1998 to 2000 strategy, and the first progress report on the 2001 to 2003 statement of strategy will be published later this year. To date, I have been pleased with my Department's contribution to achieving this Government's social and economic objectives through the implementation of its statements of strategy.</P>
      <P>A strategic priority of my Department is the enhanced management of the public service. Objectives under this strategy include the promotion and support of e-government; the implementation and development of the performance management and development system; the development of an enhanced financial management system in the Civil Service; and the preparation of legislation to support the public service modernisation programme. Again, progress under this strategic priority is monitored by the management advisory committee on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness sets out objectives for the modernisation agenda in the Civil Service over the three year period to 2002. Section 1.4.1 of the PPF requires that each Department and office, through the partnership process established under partnership 2000, develop and agree performance indicators in relation to these objectives. Thus, the modernisation agenda is advanced through the participative structures of the departmental partnership committees and progress on the PPF objectives considered.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service quality assurance group is an independent body established under the PPF to assess progress in achieving the objectives of the modernisation agenda. In line with all other Departments and offices, the Department of Finance has submitted its performance indicators for the PPF objectives to the Civil Service quality assurance group, and these have been considered by the group. My Department and all other Departments and offices will submit a report to the Civil Service quality assurance group after 1 April 2002, detailing progress in achieving its performance indicators. This group will then make an independent assessment of the Department's progress in meeting the PPF objectives for the modernisation agenda in the context of the final 4% payment under the PPF.</P>

The apparent decrease in the taxpayer's tax credits for the current year, when compared with his tax credits in 2001, is due to the fact that tax relief for home <Col N="1043" /> loan interest and medical insurance premiums is no longer shown on certificates of tax credits. Since 1 January 2002 tax relief for these items is given at source by the financial institution to which the taxpayer is paying home loan interest and his medical insurer, respectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, is the Competent Authority in Ireland charged with enforcing the novel foods regulations under which genetically modified foods currently fall. The FSAI carries out surveys of the Irish food supply to satisfy itself that regulations governing the sale in Ireland of GM foods are adhered to. With regard to the Deputy's query on the regulation of the sale of all GM foods, there are three main pieces of legislation relevant to this issue:</P>
      <P>1. Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients came into force in all member states on May 15 1997. This regulation provides that novel foods and novel food ingredients, including genetically modified food, must undergo a safety assessment and be officially approved-authorised before being placed on the European market. It also contains provisions in certain instances for the labelling of novel foods and novel food ingredients. Foods and food ingredients which fall within the scope of this regulation are those which have not as of 15 May 1997 been used for human consumption to a significant degree within the European Community and which fall into the following categories:</P>
      <P>(a)&nbsp;goods which contain genetically modified organisms, GMOs;</P>
      <P>(b)&nbsp;foods which are produced from but do not contain GMOs;</P>
      <P>(c)&nbsp;food and food ingredients with an intentionally modified molecular structure;</P>
      <P>(d)&nbsp;foods composed of micro-organisms, fungi or algae;</P>
      <P>(e)&nbsp;foods produced from plants or animals not using traditional propagation techniques; and</P>
      <P>(f)&nbsp;foods which are produced from new technologies which give rise to significant changes in the composition or structure of the food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulation states that there must be specific labelling to inform the consumer of any characteristic or food property, for example, composition, nutritional value, nutritional effects, intended use of the food) which renders a novel food or novel food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient. There must also be specific labelling to advise the consumer of the presence in the novel food or novel food ingredient of: material which is not present in an existing equivalent foodstuff and which may have implications for the health of certain sections of the population, for example, a protein from a known food allergen source such as peanuts; <Col N="1045" /> material which is not present in an existing equivalent foodstuff and which gives rise to ethical concerns, for example, a gene of porcine origin in a plant; or an organism genetically modified by techniques of genetic modification, for example, a genetically engineered tomato.</P>
    <P>2.&nbsp;Council Regulation (EC) No. 1139/98 concerning the compulsory indication on the labelling of certain foodstuffs produced from genetically modified organisms of particulars other than those provided for in Directive 79/112/EEC as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 49/2000 of 10 January 2000.</P>
    <P>The labelling and other provisions of the Novel Foods Regulation as outlined above do not apply to foods or food ingredients which were used for human consumption to a significant degree within the EU before the entry into force of the regulation and, therefore, not considered to be novel. Regulation 1139/98 applies to foods and food ingredients which are produced, in whole or in part, from: a genetically modified soya bean, manufactured by Monsanto and a genetically modified maize, manufactured by Novartis.</P>
    <P>These products were authorised under Directive 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment. This directive is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and Local Government in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This regulation lays down additional labelling requirements for the products outlined above. Such labelling ensures that the final consumer is informed of any characteristic or food property, such as composition, nutritional value or nutritional effects or the intended use of the food, which renders a food or food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient. If genetically modified protein or DNA is present in a foodstuff, then that foodstuff is subject to the additional labelling requirements. In short, the words &ldquo;produced from genetically modified soya&rdquo; or &ldquo;produced from genetically modified maize&rdquo; must appear in the list of ingredients.</P>
    <P>Commission Regulation (EC) No. 49/2000 of 10 January 2000 amending Council Regulation (EC) No. 1139/98 concerning the compulsory indication on the labelling of certain foodstuffs produced from genetically modified organisms.</P>
    <P>This regulation sets a <i>de minimis</i> threshold level for adventitious contamination at 1%, of each ingredient individually considered. It came into effect on 10 April 2000. The rationale for such a threshold is to avoid a situation whereby foods and food ingredients would have to be labelled in cases in which, despite not being from GMO origin, small proportions of modified DNA or protein would be present due to &ldquo;accidental&rdquo; contamination of conventional soya or maize with GM soya or maize. Adventitious contamination can potentially occur at many stages of the production chain, from the field &ndash; pollen &ndash; through transport <Col N="1046" /> and storage to food processing. At a level below this 1%, products not of GMO origin but containing small proportions of genetically modified DNA or protein due to adventitious contamination, will not be subject to the additional labelling requirements as outlined above.</P>
    <P>3. Commission Regulation (EC) No. 50/2000 of 10 January 2000 on the labelling of foodstuffs and food ingredients containing additives and flavourings that have been genetically modified or have been produced from genetically modified organisms.</P>
    <P>Regulation (EC) No. 258/97, the Novel Foods Regulation, or Regulation (EC) No. 1139/98 do not apply to additives and flavourings intended to be used in foodstuffs. The Commission, in consultation with member states, agreed that it was important that consumers should be informed of the use of additives or flavourings that have been genetically modified or have been produced through genetic engineering as they are already informed of the presence of other ingredients containing or produced from genetically modified organisms. Discussions culminated in Regulation 50/2000/EC which came into effect on 10 April 2000.</P>
    <P>If genetically modified protein or DNA is present in a food additive or flavouring, then that food additive or flavouring is subject to the additional labelling requirements. In short, the words &ldquo;produced from genetically modified ..&rdquo; must appear in the list of ingredients.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the Food Safety Authority of Ireland is satisfied that based on current scientific opinion, GM ingredients authorised within the EU are safe for human consumption.</P>

These objectives have the potential to make a significant contribution to the enhancement of patient safety.</P>

    <P>Arising from these increases hospitals will pay an additional &euro;12.678 million, IR£9.998 million, to the IBTS to fund the following: costs associated with the continued implementation of the service's redevelopment plan together with its blood quality and safety programme; costs arising in respect of measures to minimise the risk of transmission of vCJD, including the replacement of plasma and cryoprecipate with imported products; loss of income arising from the reduction in the demand for red cells through the introduction of blood conservation strategies in hospitals; costs of new mobile clinic in the western region and fixed donor clinics; increased donor recruitment and advertising costs; new HIV and hepatitis B core tests to enhance blood quality and safety; pathogen inactivation of labile blood products; and increased pay costs under the Partnership for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>The amount set aside for IBTS price increases represents 8% of the total amount of development funding available to the acute hospital sector in 2002. There is, therefore, a requirement on the IBTS to deliver its services in a manner which <Col N="1049" /> ensures efficiency and value for money notwithstanding the necessity to continue to improve blood safety in line with international developments. My Department has requested the IBTS to reflect this objective in all its activities, existing and planned. Given the impact of these increases on hospital development, I expect the IBTS to implement an efficiency programme to achieve greater economy and effectiveness without compromising blood safety.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department recently published Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You; a major strategy for the health service for the next 7-10 years. This document is based on the strategic management initiative philosophy of better government and improving services to the public and its core principles include accountability and people-centredness. As a statement of reform for health and social services in this country it underpins all aspects of my Department's work including targets under the SMI. This major work occupied most of the Department's resources in 2001.</P>
      <P>My Department's progress under the strategic management initiative targets is summarised as follows. Following the national health strategy, my Department is now preparing its statement of strategy which will be directly based on the strategic objectives of Quality and Fairness &ndash; a Health System for You as quickly as possible. In conjunction with the preparation of the strategy statement, the Department's business planning process is under way for 2002 and will be completed shortly.</P>
      <P>The roll out of the performance management and development system is well under way. Training in the first phase, the planning stage, has been completed and training in the second phase of the system, interim review, is currently ongoing. Training for the third and final phase, the annual performance and development review, is planned to commence in the coming months. Already, engagement with phase one of the process, which involves the completion of role profile forms and the identification of personal training and development plans, is contributing in a positive way to the formulation of appropriate and relevant training and development approaches.</P>
      <P>My Department's policy on training and development identifies the commitment to providing investment in staff through training and development and provides a framework of principles within which those needs should be addressed. With the progress of the performance management and development system, training needs are currently being identified at an individual level and on a Department wide basis. A composite response to those requirements is now being finalised in the form of a training and development implementation plan which addresses not only individual needs, but will bring about the development of sets of skills and competencies which will contribute to the progress towards the Department's overall vision, strategy statement and customer service goals.</P>
      <P>To date, each member of staff has already received the first two days training &ndash; planning stage &ndash; of the performance management and development system. My Department is currently training staff on the second phase &ndash; interim review &ndash; of the performance management and development system. The third and final phase &ndash; annual performance and development review- training is scheduled to begin in July 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996, <Col N="1054" /> was put in place to improve accountability in the health services and the resultant service planning framework has led to significant benefits in the management of health service delivery. My Department is represented on the high level group on regulatory reform by the deputy secretary. In line with the implementation of the health strategy, my Department is establishing a new legislation unit which will address the broader issues of regulatory reform.</P>
    <P>The freedom of information unit in my Department has developed new procedures to address the issue of timeliness and to strengthen existing quality control measures. The Department has also set up a panel of senior staff, chaired by an assistant secretary, to conduct internal reviews.</P>
    <P>A dedicated modernised customer services call-in centre is in place and is functioning effectively. The customer service action plan for 2002 to 2004 is being formulated. Steps are being taken to improve turnaround-response time for key items, for example, replies to correspondence, treatment of phone calls, involvement of partnership in QCS initiatives.</P>
    <P>The partnership committee to date has been involved in a number initiatives and sub-groups have been put in place to drive forward initiatives such as the performance management and development system, gender equality issue, customer care initiatives, human resources strategy and training plan. A high-level human resources strategy was drafted and circulated in late 2001. Work has now commenced on drafting an operational human resources policy for the purpose of aligning the personnel function with the strategic human resources approach.</P>
    <P>The national health strategy will have a significant impact on developing the management model, in particular, having regard to the commitment in the strategy to a restructuring exercise in the Department. The Department expects to make immediate progress on phase one and to meet the timescales as set out in relation to phases two and three. When implemented, the objective of MIF is to provide information at a high level for internal management through the provision of output measurements and performance indicators which will allow high level evaluation of programme investment.</P>
    <P>Within the service planning framework under the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996, a set of conjointly agreed performance indicators has being put in place to enable better performance and accountability in the delivery of health board service plans. A programme of work is continuing by joint Department and health board teams to further enhance these performance indicators. In addition, the strategy actions in relation to the development of three to five year implementation plans in health boards will assist greatly in providing a clearer linkage between service plans and policy-strategic objectives generally.</P>
    <P>An ICT and e-government strategy for my Department for the next three years has been drafted and is being finalised. The national health <Col N="1055" /> information strategy is also in final draft. Programme expenditure reviews have been carried out and published covering intellectual disability and dental services under the Department of Finance programme expenditure review policy. In the course of preparing Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, a major review of all current health strategies and policy statements was undertaken and informed the production of the strategy.<i></i>Two major reviews, Acute Hospital Bed Capacity and the Value for Money Audit of the Health Services have recently been published.</P>
    <P>Performance indicators on the above initiatives were forwarded to the Civil Service quality assurance group as part of the review process under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and were approved by the group. A full progress report, which must be agreed through the Department's partnership committee, will be submitted to the Civil Service quality assurance group post April 2002.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the progress being made as outlined above will ensure that my Department's targets are sufficiently measurable, quantifiable and focused on outcomes. As the work under way is constantly subject to review the associated targets are subject to ongoing refinement with a view to ensuring effective accountability. An overall review of the strategic management initiative throughout all Government Departments has recently been conducted and when the results are available they will further inform the refinement of targets.</P>

      <Quest>the reason Ireland failed to achieve the target of 25% recycling by July 2001 set under the EU Packaging Waste Directive 94/62/EEC; and if the target of between 50% and 65% recycling by 2005 is likely to be achieved.</Quest>
      <QRef>[5112/02]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste, Ireland is required to recover a minimum 25% of packaging waste by 2001. Ireland is further required to recover 50-65% of packaging waste by 2005, and also to recycle 25-45% of such waste.</P>
      <P>The EPA has responsibility for the compilation of national waste statistics. In accordance with Commission Decision 97/138/EC, pursuant to Council Directive 94/62/EC, the EPA is required to submit annual packaging waste returns to the European Commission within 18 months of the end of the relevant year. The return in respect of 2001 is not likely to be completed until early 2003. However, Repak &ndash; the company established by industry to meet Ireland's packaging waste recovery targets &ndash;  has indicated that it has recovered at least 25% of packaging waste in 2001.</P>
      <P>The 2005 recovery and recycling targets set for Ireland in the directive are challenging. However, I am confident these targets can be met in light of a number of initiatives: </P>
      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 anticipates some &euro;825 million capital investment in the development of waste management infrastructure, much of this through public private partnerships. Of this, some &euro;127 million in Exchequer-EU funding will be provided to support the capital cost of waste recovery infrastructure under the local and regional waste management plans. Details of this waste infrastructure capital grants scheme will be announced very shortly.</P>
      <P>In addition, revenue generated by the forthcoming environmental levy on plastic shopping bags and the proposed landfill levy will accrue to a dedicated central fund &ndash; the Environment Fund &ndash; for use in support of support of a range of environmental initiatives including waste recycling.</P>
      <P>A task force, comprising representatives of my Department and relevant stakeholders, is currently reviewing the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 1997. Although the task force has not yet concluded its deliberations, the provisions of the regulations will be strengthened to facilitate increased recovery of packaging waste.</P>
      <P>A policy statement on preventing and recycling waste will also be published very shortly. This will address in detail the factors and practical considerations which are relevant to the achievement of an improved national recycling performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In effect, the necessary arrangements to underpin a significant increase in national recycling <Col N="1058" /> performance &ndash; including in respect of packaging waste &ndash; are currently being put in place. Having regard to the foregoing, I am confident that the 2005 recovery and recycling targets set for Ireland in Council Directive 94/62/EC will be achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 161 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>As set out in the 1998 policy statement, Changing our Ways, the Government is committed to a major reduction in reliance on landfill and to the implementation of an integrated waste management approach which will provide the improved infrastructure to deliver our ambitious national recovery and recycling targets over a fifteen year period.</P>
      <P>Having regard to these targets, the local and regional waste management plans, which are now being implemented following the enactment of the Waste Management (Amendment) Act, 2001 incorporate proposals for: household segregation and separate collection of organic waste and dry recyclables in urban areas; a range of centralised composting and other biological treatment facilities; support for home composting of food and garden waste, especially in rural areas; an extended network of &ldquo;bring&rdquo; facilities in rural areas, typically with a target density of one facility per 500 population, and an increased network of civic amenity sites and waste transfer stations.</P>
      <P>Some local authorities have commenced their own home composting initiatives, providing composting bins, wormeries and other necessary home composting equipment to households in their areas, at highly subsidised rates to the householder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department will shortly announce details of a capital grants scheme which will provide assistance towards the provision of materials recovery and biological treatment facilities, including centralised composting facilities as called for in the local authorities waste management plans. Support from the Environment Fund, funded by the plastic bag and landfill levies, may <Col N="1059" /> also be available for suitable projects. Direct subvention of householders by my Department is not however envisaged.</P>
    <P>Progress towards meeting the targets set out in Changing our Ways will be reported by the EPA which is responsible for the provision of statistics on waste management generally. The national waste database report for 1998, which was published by the EPA in March, 2000 is the most up-to-date report available. The report, which is updated on a 3 yearly basis, provides detailed statistics on waste streams in Ireland including details on the recovery of waste. A copy of the report is available in the Oireachtas Library. The national waste database report for 2001 is currently being prepared by the EPA.</P>

      <P>The 1998 policy statement on waste management &ndash; Changing our Ways &ndash; which has as its main aim a radical reduction in national reliance on landfill, recognised that the construction industry has the primary responsibility to ensure the environmentally sound management of C&amp;D waste. Changing our Ways challenged the construction industry to treat C&amp;D waste as a resource, and to take practical steps to achieve the recycling of at least 50% of such waste within five years, and at least 85% over a 15-year period. The industry was invited to devise and implement a coherent programme of voluntary measures, involving effective least-cost solutions, to meet these national targets.</P>
      <P>In response to the targets set in Changing our Ways, a dedicated task force was established by the Forum for the Construction Industry to co-ordinate the development of a voluntary industry-wide programme to meet the proposed recovery targets. The task force concluded its deliberations and submitted its report, incorporating a comprehensive list of recommendations, last year. I have responded to the forum welcoming the broad thrust of the task force's recommendations. I have also requested the forum to take urgent steps to put in place the necessary structures and arrangements to deliver immediate and substantial increases in C&amp;D recycling rates by the industry so as to facilitate the achievement of the recycling targets set in Changing our Ways.</P>
      <P>These policies and measures are directed at a significant reduction in the use of landfill: this will permit both an improvement in environmental quality and more beneficial uses of land.</P>

      <Quest>the policy measures adopted, since publication of the National Climate Changes Strategy, to achieve the overall total reduction of 15.415 Mt CO2 equivalent, under 24 different quantified subheadings in the executive summary of the strategy; if he has satisfied himself that progress has been made under each of the 24 headings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Climate Change Strategy, which was published in November 2000 and is available in the Oireachtas Library, sets a ten-year framework for achieving the necessary greenhouse gas emissions reductions to ensure that Ireland complies with the Kyoto Protocol. The strategy identifies a range of cross sectoral and sector specific measures to achieve the necessary reductions equitably, and with economic and environmental efficiency.  </P>
      <P>Implementation of the strategy is being co-ordinated by a cross-departmental climate change team which is chaired by my Department and has met on fifteen occasions since January 2001.</P>
      <P>In addition to overseeing the successful implementation of the strategy, the team has established necessary consultative arrangements and will develop a robust and comprehensive set of indicators at a sectoral and national level, oversee the quantification of costs and benefits of implementing specific measures, and undertake the biennial review of the strategy, beginning in 2002, in consultation with Comhar.</P>
      <P>Work is under way on the development of a long-term communications strategy addressing awareness of climate change, and Comhar has prepared proposals for this; sub-groups on inventory data, emissions trading, negotiated agreements with industry, and economic analysis have also been established.</P>
      <P>The team is finalising a progress report on implementation of the strategy which I intend to publish shortly. In the interim, information on detailed progress with the quantified indicative reductions proposed in the strategy may appropriately be sought from the Departments and/or agencies concerned.</P>
      <P>In so far as my Department is concerned, I refer to my reply to Question No. 158 on today's Order Paper as regards fuel economy labelling for new passenger cars. I published consultation documents on the revision of Part L of the national building regulations in September 2001 which relate to the conservation of fuel and energy which bring forward the operative date for improved standards from 2005 to 2002. The new standards are estimated to reduce the requirements for space and water heating by 23% to 33%, depending on the type and size of the dwelling, and on current patterns of fuel use, a reduction of 300,000 tonnes CO2 per annum for 2012 is anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to traffic management, in 2002, <Col N="1061" /> approximately &euro;40 million is being provided to the Dublin Transportation Office in respect of traffic management grants, an increase of almost 20% on last year's provision. The year 2001 also saw a major expansion of the quality bus corridor network in the Dublin area with the launch of five new QBCs serving routes to Blanchardstown, Swords, Tallaght, North Clondalkin and Rathfarnham, together with the extension of the Malahide Road QBC. Nine QBCs are now in place and work is continuing on further routes. Dedicated cycleways are also being provided.</P>

    <P>Information relating to activity under the improvement works scheme for each local authority is published in my Department's quarterly and annual bulletins of housing statistics, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas library.</P>
    <P>Detailed information on the average cost in each year of improving a dwelling under the scheme is not available in my Department, as local authorities have delegated authority to undertake works which do not exceed a prescribed value without the prior approval of my Department. The current limit is &euro;63,500. It is not possible to derive an average annual unit cost from the number of dwellings improved in a particular year and the expenditure in that year because of changes in the level of work in progress in any year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities were advised in my waste policy statement, Changing Our Ways, that achievement of national waste objectives requires, <i>inter alia</i>, a major reduction in reliance on landfill in favour of an integrated waste management approach which utilises a range of treatment options to deliver ambitious recycling and recovery targets. Authorities were asked to identify and assess fully the various issues involved with a view to identifying the nature, scale and mix of facilities which at a regional level appear to offer the best balance at reasonable cost between maximised recovery of materials or energy and minimised environmental emissions. It a matter for the local authorities to take such steps as are appropriate and necessary to attain the objectives of their plans.</P>
      <P>A feasibility study examining the thermal treatment options for waste in the mid-west and north east was carried out on behalf of the relevant local authorities in these regions in January 1999. This study provided a technical assessment of thermal treatment technologies, such as incineration, gasification and pyrolysis, including the advantages and disadvantages of each technology, as well as estimated construction costs and gate fees. I am arranging to have details of this study forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that emissions from proposed thermal treatment facilities employing modern technologies and subject to compliance with strict environmental standards do not present a significant risk to the environment or public health. However, I accept that many people have genuinely held concerns about perceived health threats from thermal treatment of waste, concerns which may be exacerbated by misinformation and misrepresentation. I have asked the Health Research Board, HRB, to undertake a study utilising appropriate research expertise in health and environmental sciences which will pro<Col N="1070" /> vide an objective, independent and expert analysis of all available information regarding the likely effects on public health and the environment of landfill and thermal treatment activities. It is anticipated that the study will be completed shortly and a report will be published shortly thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the consultation paper issued by my Department on the landfill levy it was proposed that the levy would be introduced at an initial flat rate of &euro;15 per tonne with annual increases thereafter of &euro;5 per tonne. Following the formal consultation process in late 2001, my Department has received almost 40 submissions from a range of interested parties with regard to the proposed levy. These are under consideration and are informing the preparation of regulations to give early effect to the levy.</P>
      <P>The principal purpose of the levy is not to generate revenue but, by achieving a positive price differential between the costs of landfilling and the costs of &ldquo;high-in-hierarchy&rdquo; waste options, to encourage the diversion of waste away from landfill towards recycling and biological treatment options.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the principle of producer responsibility, it is appropriate that waste generators should pay directly the full costs of waste collection, treatment and disposal. In support of this approach, producer responsibility initiatives already operate in Ireland in the areas of packaging waste and farm plastics waste, that is, Repak in the case of packaging waste and Irish Farm Films Producers Group in the case of farm plastics. In these cases producers are required to take steps to recover waste or to contribute to and participate in compliance schemes set up to recover the waste in question. These schemes in turn provide variable subsidies, having regard to material market values and fluctuations, for the collection and recovery of materials for recycling, which provides economic support for the recycling sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intended that similar producer responsibility initiatives will be extended to other waste streams in the future, for example, end-of-life vehicles, tyres, waste electronic and electrical <Col N="1071" /> equipment, etc. These initiatives, together with the increasing cost of landfilling waste, will further stimulate and improve the economics of recycling in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Capital funding for suitable waste management projects, including recycling initiatives, will also be made available under a new scheme of capital grants for waste recovery infrastructure which will be announced very shortly. The Environment Fund, which will be funded by the forthcoming levy on plastic shopping bags and the proposed levy on landfilling, will provide another source of potential future support for recycling.</P>

      <P>In my Department's statement of strategy for 2001 to 2004, key performance indicators are identified for each of the Department's areas of responsibility, including the strategic management initiative. These indicators are designed to assist in measuring the achievement of the Department's objectives and, as such, these indicators are an effective means of assessing the Department's performance. Progress in the key areas of the strategic management initiative is set out below and a full report on progress in implementing all aspects of the statement of strategy is set out annually in the Department's annual report. A copy of the latest annual report, which is for 2000, is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>In 2001, the Department published its statement of strategy for 2001 to 2004 to meet the statutory requirements of the Public Service Management Act, 1997. A copy of the statement of strategy is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Business plans, which translate the goals and objectives of the statement of strategy into more detailed work programmes, are developed annually throughout my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The customer service action plan for 2001-04, which outlines the Department's approach to ensuring continuous quality improvement in customer service, was published during 2001. A copy of the plan is available in the Oireachtas Library. It includes a range of objectives to be achieved over the period and the performance measurement and reporting mechanisms. The plan also outlines the Department's approach to the <Col N="1072" /> Government's regulatory reform initiative and arrangements for the operation of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>The extension of the Freedom of Information Act to agencies under the Department's aegis is continuing. The National Roads Authority, the Housing Finance Agency, the Dublin Transportation Office and the Rent Tribunal will be subject to the Freedom of Information Act from 1 November 2002. While the implementation of the Act in these agencies is a matter for themselves, my Department is providing assistance and advice to them and will continue to provide support as required.</P>
    <P>The development of a customised human resource management strategy for the Department, which is being steered by the partnership committee, is due for completion shortly. The roll-out of the performance management and development system, PMDS, in the Department, which is an integral element of the human resource management strategy, is continuing. The phased implementation of the PMDS training programme is due to be completed in November 2002. About 40% of the Department's staff have already been fully trained.</P>
    <P>The Department has commenced work on modernising its financial and management information systems consistent with the principles which underpin the management information framework. It is hoped to select a new financial management system later this year. The Department has put forward proposals for the evaluation of its principal spending programmes in keeping with its obligation under the second round of the expenditure review initiative and the economic and social infrastructure operational programme.</P>
    <P>The Department has developed a strategy for the delivery of services to its customers over electronic media. The strategy includes both a set of strategic objectives and a clear three year implementation plan. Progress has already been made with an on-line driving test application and payment facility &ndash; www.drivingtest.ie &ndash; operational since last July. Plans are in place for the development of on-line services for motor tax renewal service and driving licence applications.</P>

The provision of a range of community, health and other social facilities is also involved. The area D plan represents one particular area in Knocknaheeny. The overall cost of the master plan is estimated at slightly more than &euro;200 million.</P>
      <P>My Department and Cork City Council met at official level on 13 February to discuss a number of issues relating to the plan.

      <P>The Road Traffic (National Car Test) No. 3 Regulations, 2001, prescribes a fee of &euro;88.80 payable to the NCT for an inspection of a vehicle for the purposes of a certificate of suitability for a small public service vehicle licence. On conversion to the euro, the original fee of £70 which had been set when the suitability testing function was assigned to NCT on 1 July 2001, was adjusted downwards by eight cents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inspection involves assessing the suitability of the vehicle as a small public service vehicle by reference to the requirements of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963 to 2000, in addition to a standard NCT roadworthiness test. As there is no difference in the inspection carried out on a new or <Col N="1075" /> used vehicle, the fee of &euro;88.80 applies irrespective of the age of the vehicle.</P>
    <P>While the renewal of the small public service licence in respect of a particular vehicle does not require a further certificate of suitability, a standard NCT roadworthiness test is necessary at each renewal date. The cost of this test, which is the standard test carried out on private passenger cars, is &euro;48.00.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The allowance in question is a diet supplement which is paid under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Under the terms of the scheme recipients of social welfare or health board payments who have been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition and whose means are insufficient to meet their needs, may qualify for a diet supplement.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a diet supplement is determined by the health boards in accordance with the legislative provisions that specify the medical conditions in respect of which a diet supplement may be paid and the means test that must be applied. The amount of supplement payable depends on which of two categories of diet has been prescribed by the applicant's medical advisor, the age of the person and on the income of the individual and his or her dependants.</P>
      <P>The basis of the calculation of the amount payable to a single person is that one third of their income is spent on food. The cost of one of the two categories of prescribed diets has been determined as being &euro;34.28, £27 per week, while the cost of the other category has been determined as being &euro;44.44, £35 per week. The purpose of the diet supplement is to make up the difference between these reference amounts and one third of the applicant's weekly income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a further amount is included in the amount payable to take account of the fact that the application of annual budgetary increases in primary weekly payments would otherwise lead to a significant reduction in the rate of diet supplement payable in individual cases. The matter raised by the Deputy arises in the manner in which this adjustment is made. In this case, the individual in question is in receipt of disability allowance from my Department and diet supplement from the health board. The rate of disability allowance in payment prior to this year's budgetary increase was £85.50, equivalent to &euro;108.56, while the rate of diet supplement in payment was £13.50, equivalent to &euro;17.14. This added <Col N="1076" /> up to a total of £99, equivalent to &euro;125.70 per week.</P>
    <P>As I told the House on 6 December 2001, we are providing a general increase of £8.00 per week in respect of social welfare customers under pension-retirement age. The rate of disability allowance was set at &euro;118.80 and the rate of diet supplement in this case was set at &euro;17.10. This amounts to &euro;135.90 in total, an increase of &euro;10.20 or £8.03.</P>
    <P>While the increase in the case highlighted by the Deputy is in line with the general increase announced in the budget, I am having the calculation mechanism for the diet supplement reviewed to ensure that the value of that element of the applicant's overall weekly payment is fully maintained.</P>

The estimated cost of paying old age non-contributory pension at the current maximum rate to the remaining 15,000 people is &euro;108.5 million per annum.</P>

      <P>The Strategic Management Initiative, Launched in 1994, has required each Government Department to examine its role in relation to delivering better quality services to the public, providing better value to the taxpayer and improving it's contribution to national economic and social development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Public Service Management Act, 1997, requires each Department and office to produce a strategy statement which outlines the organisation's key objectives and performance indicators <Col N="1077" /> relating to the achievement of those objectives. My Department's latest strategy was finalised in November 2001 and outlined our targets for the three years 2001-04. My Department has also published a customer action plan which sets out specific targets in relation to the provision of quality service to customers of the Department over a similar three year period.</P>
    <P>Business plans are produced annually by the Department and contain specific detailed commitments to be achieved in the year based on the content and direction of the strategy statement and customer action plan. Progress in relation to the achievement of the Department's strategies is outlined in the annual report of the Department.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness &ndash; PPF &ndash; all Departments-offices are required to produce a set of performance indicators which cover all the main aspects of the strategic management initiative &ndash; SMI &ndash; and against which the Department will report on progress.</P>
    <P>The SMI is intended to address every important aspect of the work of the public service at a time of increasing complexity and challenge. I am satisfied that over the period in which the initiative has been in place, the public service has risen to the challenge and that the SMI has enabled a greater focus to be put on the delivery of the highest quality service to the Government and to citizens.</P>
    <P>An independent evaluation of the progress of the SMI across the Civil Service commenced in October 2001, and will be finalised in the future. My Department participated fully in the evaluation and the recommendations which emerge will be taken on board in the context of moving forward with the SMI process in the period ahead.</P>

I have now arranged for Dúchas to undertake the remedial conservation works required to the national monument structures at the site in late spring of this year and I look forward to that work commencing as soon as possible. As the Deputy will appreciate, it would not be appropriate in view of health and safety requirements to undertake works at a site of this nature during the winter months. A meeting has also taken place with officials of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources to discuss issues arising in relation to the problem of coastal erosion at this and similar national monument sites. The response of that Department, which has responsibility for coastal erosion, is presently awaited.</P>

      <P>The Disability Bill, 2001, was published by my Department on 21 December 2001. In August 2000, my Department wrote to a range of organisations representing people with disabilities, including the Forum for People with Disabilities, inviting their views with regard to the content or development of a Bill relating to disability.</P>
      <P>My Department received a detailed submission from the Forum for People with Disabilities in September 2000 and since then they have been facilitated with a number of meetings with my colleague, Deputy Mary Wallace, Minister of State at the Department, and officials of the disability equality section. Since the Bill was published, my Department has received further comment from and has met with various organisations and representative groups, including the Forum for People with Disabilities.</P>
      <P>With regard to section 47 of the Bill, the Disability Bill, 2001, does not affect existing rights which are actionable through the courts, either by people with disabilities or anyone else. People will still be able to take civil cases to enforce these rights, seek judicial review in relation to actions of any public body and, indeed, ground a case on constitutional guarantees. However, the Disability Bill does not confer any new basis for litigation.</P>
      <P>The NDA will oversee implementation of the legislation. Enhanced powers provided for the NDA in the Bill include: power to require or undertake disability access audits to identify the extent of compliance; power to oversee implementation of disability access plans, developed to address shortcomings in terms of compliance; inspection and investigation powers which may be underpinned by court order to assure compliance with the legislation; report to the Minister, making recommendations, where appropriate, for the review of funding for any programme or service &ndash; section 15 of the National Disability Authority Act, 1999.</P>
      <P>Most of the public bodies charged with implementation of the key provisions of the Bill come within the scope of the Ombudsman's legislation. Any person who is dissatisfied with the way a public body has provided access or any service provisions in their case, would be entitled to make a complaint to the Ombudsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be open to further comment from <Col N="1082" /> interested groups as the Bill continues its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas over the coming months and I look forward to seeing the Bill enacted in the lifetime of this Government.</P>

      <P>My Department's strategic management initiative, SMI, targets have been set out in the Department's modernisation programme, which was prepared and is being implemented in the context of requirements under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The Department's strategy statement 2001-2004, Community, Security and Equality, which I launched in December 2001, sets out strategies to achieve the modernisation programme in areas such as planning and performance, training and development, customer service, IT and e-government, and financial management. The strategy statement also sets out a range of strategies across the policy and operational remit of the Department. I might add that the statement also sets out a record of significant achievements in the Justice and Equality areas since I took office as Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the modernisation programme, in March 2001 my Department submitted a report on the Department's performance indicators under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to the Civil Service quality assurance group &ndash; CSQAG. The purpose in setting out these indicators, which was the Department's first initiative of this type, was to ensure that targets for the Department's strategic management of the organisation and its resources were measurable, quantifiable and focused on outcomes. In this regard the CSQAG approved the Department's report in July 2001. The Department is required to report <Col N="1083" /> back to the CSQAG in May 2002 on progress in relation to the approved performance indicators.</P>
    <P>Key recent achievements under the programme include: publication of Department's third strategy statement 2001-04 in December 2001; publication of Department's new customer service action plan in December 2001; roll-out of performance management and development system, PMDS, 2000-02; analysis of the Department's training and development needs identified under the PMDS completed in October 2001; and equality of opportunity targets set out in the strategy statement.</P>
    <P>In the period prior to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the following key achievements under the SMI were recorded by my Department: first strategy statement was published in 1996 and the second in 1998; first customer action plan was published in 1997 and internal and external customer panels were established; partnership structures have been established; the delivery of IT services across the justice and equality sector; the development of financial systems; and a policy research capability was put in place.</P>
    <P>In the wider justice and equality sector, the Department has been implementing a wide ranging organisation change programme, which in recent years has seen a number of new organisations established to deliver criminal justice, refugee, equality and other services. The purpose of this programme is to devolve authority and decision-making to clearly defined and accountable bodies, strengthening management structures and enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the services being provided. In this regard, the Department is involved in the extension of the modernisation programme to the organisations in the justice and equality sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 197 to 199, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In response to submissions from representatives of the English language industry, my Department has for a number of years had in place a set of detailed student visa guidelines. These have been circulated to relevant education institutions and are also available on my Department's website. They are intended to assist frequent and high volume users of the student visa scheme. In general terms, however, the principal criteria applied are that the prospective student should have enrolled in a full-time course of study, should have paid fees in full for that course and should have evidence that they have sufficient funds to support themselves during their stay in the State.</P>
      <P>Where such persons intend to stay for longer than 90 days, they are required to register with the Garda registration office for the area in which they intend to reside. The standard practice is for the registration office to grant permission to remain in the State for the duration of the course, up to a maximum of one year at a time. It is possible to obtain an extension of permission to remain in order to continue with the course of studies or to move to a new course, provided the above criteria continue to be met. During 2000, an additional requirement was introduced whereby students seeking a renewal of permission to remain are now required to provide a letter from their college certifying that their attendance over the preceding period has been satisfactory. Attendance of 80% or more is regarded as satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general these arrangements are working well and facilitate the many thousands of genuine students who wish to study in Ireland. Enterprise Ireland has estimated that earnings generated by the English language industry during 2000 were in excess of £350 million. There is, however, evidence of a certain amount of abuse of the pro<Col N="1085" /> cedures by a minority of persons who seek to avail of the scheme in order to circumvent normal immigration criteria. In this regard our experience is in line with that of all other jurisdictions operating large student admission programmes and the reality is that no system can entirely prevent abuse without disproportionately burdening genuine students with reporting and other requirements.</P>
    <P>There are at present ongoing Garda inquiries into abuse of this nature, including the possibility that some organisations have provided letters of attendance, which may not be genuine. In this regard, the introduction last September of a new Garda computerised registration system is of particular value as it makes it possible to quickly generate reports of the persons who have registered and who are in attendance at each education institution and to compare this data with other indications of an institution's overall capacity. While the Garda has statutory powers to enforce compliance with immigration law generally, if it appears from the results of Garda inquiries that additional safeguards are required in order to minimise abuse of the system, then I will certainly give such proposals favourable and urgent consideration.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will also be aware, my Department will shortly be appointing a number of staff to the Irish embassies in Beijing and Moscow to improve the visa processing services at these locations &ndash; both embassies receive large numbers of student visa applications. The appointment of these officers, who will be supported by additional Department of Foreign Affairs local staff, will improve the quality of the decision making process thereby reducing the risk of abuse. Their presence will also of course improve the quality of service generally for genuine applicants.</P>
    <P>In so far as recognition by the Minister for Education and Science under the scheme administered by the Advisory Council for English Language Studies &ndash; ACELS &ndash; is concerned, the position is that this is a non-statutory, voluntary scheme. Its principal objective is the development of high quality education service standards rather than compliance on the part of students with immigration requirements as such. Most English language schools in Ireland are certified under the ACELS scheme and my Department certainly welcomes such participation. However, as there is no obligation in law to obtain recognition in order to operate this type of business, it does not follow that not doing so implies that the school is not a genuine one or that my Department can simply refuse to deal with individuals seeking to study there. My Department is, however, represented on the board of ACELS and will continue to work closely with ACELS and all other interested parties with a view to providing a sustainable system of admission and immigration regulation for non-EEA students.</P>

      <P>My Department's performance indicators for the implementation of the current phase of the strategic management initiative, SMI-public service modernisation programme are incorporated in my updated Department's business plan which is available on our website at www.gov.ie/tourism-sport. The performance indicators conform to the SMART principle as set out in the SMI implementation group's guidelines for the preparation of business plans, that is, they are specific; measurable; agreed; realistic and timebound. The Department's indicators have been agreed with staff through the Department's partnership process.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, a Civil Service quality assurance group, QAG, has been established to monitor and assess progress on the implementation of the modernisation programme in accordance with the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. In June 2001, my Department was notified by the QAG that, having completed an examination of the performance indicators provided by the Department, the QAG was satisfied that they met the requirements set out in the PPF.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Annual Competitiveness Report 2001, published by the National Competitiveness Council, compares Ireland's competitiveness with that of our main trading partners using a broad range of statistical indicators. The report focuses on 11 key aspects of competitiveness, one of which is education. In considering Irish competitiveness in the area of education, the council examined a range of indicators covering the areas of population, education expenditure, participation in education and educational attainment. The competitiveness score for education, of 16 out of 20 counties, is based on 12 key indicators, which are set out in the report. The two indicators where Ireland ranked in the fourth quarter of countries were in regard to the proportion of the population aged 25-64 years with at least upper secondary education and the percentage of the population scoring at IALS literacy level three or higher on the document scale, 16-25 years, 1994-1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While comparable education competitiveness scores for the last five years are not available, the National Competitiveness Council has backdated a number of the indicators used in the 2001 report to produce a backdated score for competitiveness in education. The report gives a backdated score <Col N="1088" /> of 15 in relation to competitiveness in education, which reflects a slight change in Ireland's position.</P>
    <P>I agree with the council's view that competitiveness scores give a useful broad perspective on the country's performance. However, like the council I also recognise that the scores are simple, unavoidably subjective measures and that there are limitations to competitiveness benchmarking.</P>
    <P>In terms of the key indicators identified in the report where our performance was weaker, the Government's White Paper on Adult Education: Learning for Life, published in August, 2000, set out a comprehensive range of over 80 policies and actions for the development of the adult education sector. These policies and actions are being implemented on a phased basis in the light of resources available. Of particular relevance in this context is the progress under the national adult literacy strategy, with the number of students in VEC schemes having increased from 5,000 to 18,862, and with some 235,000 people per week watching the second TV series &ldquo;READ WRITE NOW&rdquo;. The adult literacy budget has been increased from just over &euro;1 million prior to 1997 to &euro;16.460 million in the current year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 204 to 207, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The unit cost figure of £125,195, &euro;158,998, for 2001 referred to by the Deputy was estimated by reference to an operational capacity of 40 boys for the Finglas Children's Centre. That operational capacity of 40 was used in the calculation of the unit cost figures for each of the three years as being representative of the operational capacity for the years in question and to allow for comparisons between the unit costs for each year. The details sought by the Deputy in relation to the number of boys present in the centre at the end of each month in 2001 is being compiled and will be sent to the Deputy shortly.</P>
      <P>The accommodation units St. Laurence's care and education unit are provided across three distinct dormitory areas as follows middle dormitory, northern dormitory and the southern dormitory. These units were closed for major refurbishment works during the following periods: middle dormitory &ndash; 24 July 2000 to 30 September 2000; southern dormitory &ndash; 15 January 2001 to 12 April 2001 for the bedroom areas, this dormitory is closed currently to facilitate works on the living room areas that commenced on 14 January 2002 and which are scheduled to be completed on 28 June 2002; and northern dormitory &ndash; 4 July 2001 to 11 January 2002</P>
      <P>The Grove throughcare or pre-release unit at the centre was temporarily closed at the end of June 2001 as the need for the service had declined temporarily and the centre was short of staff in other units. The Grove was reopened in July 2001 to serve as an interim senior unit to facilitate the refurbishment works on the northern dormitory of St. Laurence's care and education unit. It is expected that the Grove will reopen as a pre-release unit in April-May of this year.</P>
      <P>The independent inspection of the Finglas Children's Centre will be separate to any inspection of the other special schools for young offenders. The inspection will be carried out by Mr. M. Laxton, who is an internationally recognised expert in the field of residential child care. It is expected that Mr. Laxton will commence work on the inspection within the next ten days and it is estimated that the inspection process will be completed in early April. The inspector will examine and inspect the operations of the centre by reference to standards that were drawn up by my Department in consultation with the centres themselves and the social services inspectorate. These standards cover all aspects of residential child care and reflect best practice both in Ireland and internationally. I have arranged for a copy to be sent to the Deputy for her information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is aware of one complaint <Col N="1090" /> received by the social services inspectorate in December 2001 in relation to the operations of the centre in question. The inspectorate referred this complaint to my Department for attention and a copy has been made available to Mr. Laxton in the context of the upcoming inspection of the centre. The director and the board of management have also been made aware of the complaint and the action now being taken. My Department has also written to the complainant to advise him of the inspection arrangements now in train and to request his co-operation with the inspector so that all relevant matters can be fully and comprehensively examined by the inspector. When the inspector's report becomes available, my Department will consider what further action, if any, is required.</P>
    <P>The board of management of the centre has been requested to provide a written report to the Department on the issue raised by the Deputy concerning the board. A written reply will issue to the Deputy when the Department receives the board's response.</P>

      <P>In the course of the Second Stage debate, the question of the scope of this Bill to deal with abuse that took place outside of residential institutions, as defined in the Bill was raised. I said in that debate that this Bill deals with a particular situation, that is abuse in industrial schools, reformatories, orphanages and similar kinds of institutions. This is an issue, which was brought graphically to light by publications, documentaries and the accounts of survivors in recent years. The purpose of the Residential Institutions Redress Bill is to deal with situations where children were abused while the State was acting to a significant degree <i>in loco parentis</i> in <Col N="1094" /> relation to children removed by the State from their parents and placed out of their protection. In the case of special schools attended by children who were deaf, in some cases the children went home to their parents on weekends or for holidays which was different to the regime which existed in most of the residential institutions. On Committee Stage, I undertook to further consider the arguments raised and to report back to the House on Report Stage. Report Stage is scheduled for 20 February.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The time in school circular (M29/95) stipulates that the minimum number of teaching days per school year in post-primary schools is 167. It is stressed that this is a minimum number that must be adhered to by all schools.</P>
      <P>A typical school day comprises six hours of instruction. Any day on which the pupils receive instruction for less than three hours may not be registered as part of the 167 days minimum. Any day on which the pupils receive three hours but less than six hours of instruction will be regarded as a half school day and may be registered only as a half day for purposes of compliance with the minimum school year requirement.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the above paragraph, schools may have a weekly school half-holiday subject to compliance with the requirement of a minimum of 28 hours of instruction per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wherever possible, training courses are organised in such a way as to minimise disruption to the pupils, their parents and the school. However, given the large number of ongoing developments in the school curriculum, it is not always possible to avoid having some courses occurring during term-time. Many training courses do, in fact, take <Col N="1095" /> place during the school holidays. For example, in 2001 more than 750 teacher training courses were held in July and August.</P>
    <P>The question of when parent-teacher meetings are held is a matter for each school. While schools are entitled to conduct these activities within the 167 days, I encourage schools to hold the meetings at times convenient to parents. The actual structure of the parent-teacher meetings themselves is, similarly, a matter for each school.</P>
    <P>At post-primary level, as far as possible, educational visits should be arranged to take place during school holiday periods. If this is not possible, then schools must seek permission from my Department to allow the days be included for the purpose of calculating the minimum number of days which a second level school is required to open in an academic year. This permission, if granted, is subject to adequate arrangements being made for the conduct of the classes of teachers during their absence on the tour, without extra cost to my Department.</P>
    <P>At primary level, the current position in relation to the length of the school year and other related issues was also outlined to schools by circular in 1995. School authorities are obliged to ensure that schools adhere to the prescribed minimum number of teaching days per annum. At primary level the minimum number of teaching days per school year is 183.</P>
    <P>A full school day comprises a period of not less than five hours and 40 minutes of instruction. Any day on which the pupils receive instruction for less than two hours and 50 minutes may not be registered as part of the 183 days minimum. Any day on which the pupils receive two hours and 50 minutes but less than five hours and 40 minutes of instruction will be regarded as a half school day and may be registered only as a half day for purposes of compliance with the minimum school year requirement.</P>
    <P>Schools are permitted to reduce the school day by one hour for children in infants and first class and the time required for a half attendance may be reduced by one half hour. The decision to apply this concession rests with the board of management. Such decisions should be dictated by the educational interests of the children. Certain school related activities such as parent-teacher meetings and school/curricular planning may be conducted within the 183 days provided that: the time spent on these activities accords with that specified in relation to the length of a full day and a half day and the school authorities certify the time spent on these activities.</P>
    <P>In addition, primary schools may close on the day of an educational tour and reckon such closing as an exceptional closure provided that not less than one quarter of the pupils enrolled at the school take part in the tour. Alternatively, the board of management may require the school to be kept in operation on the day in question and the participation in the tour may be reckoned as attendance at school.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" />For educational visits of more than one day's duration, schools must seek permission from my Department to allow the days be included for the purpose of calculating the minimum number of days which a primary school is required to open in a school year. This permission, if granted, is subject to adequate arrangements being made for the conduct of the classes of teachers during their absence on the tour, without extra cost to my Department.</P>

The high level goals are: to promote equity and inclusion; to promote quality outcomes; to promote lifelong learning; to plan for education that is relevant to personal, social, cultural and economic needs; and to enhance the capacity of the Department of Education and Science for service delivery, policy formulation, research and evaluation.</P>
      <P>In support of its high-level goals, the Department of Education and Science is engaged in a wide range of activities, covering the key elements of policy planning, quality assurance, resourcing, regulation and evaluation, as well as a wide range of support services for the education sector.</P>

    <P>Ensuring high quality in education is a core responsibility of my Department. Quality learning outcomes are vital for the achievement of active citizenship, employment and social inclusion. Evaluation of education programmes, assessment and certification, schools develop<Col N="1098" /> ment planning and the school evaluation programme of the inspectorate, staff development and curriculum review all support this function.</P>
    <P>The attainment of my Department's targets in this regard, will require continuing attention to the quality of learning experiences. It will also require the ongoing strengthening of organisational capacity in my Department. This strategic priority and the strategies to support it are set out in the strategy statement which commits my Department to strengthening its policy-making structures with particular emphasis on research, monitoring and evaluation of outcomes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsistence and travel rates payable to teachers for attendance at in-career development courses are set out in the appendix herewith. These rates are on the basis agreed in negotiations with the teacher unions as part of an overall package in the context of the particular circumstances of in-service training for teachers and the range of training situations involved. The overall package also covers travel, subsistence and fees payable to teachers engaged as lecturers on courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appropriate motor mileage rate approved by the Department of Finance for civil and public servants for travel which arises for reasons connected with official business but not the actual discharge of official business, for example, attendance at training or career development courses, is the reduced rate of mileage. This rate currently stands at 28.76 cent for cars with engine capacity up to 1200cc, 31.59 cent for cars with <Col N="1101" /> engine capacity between 1201cc and 1500cc and 35.35 cent for cars with engine capacity at 1501cc and over. The 31.9 cent travel rate indicated in the appendix herewith is the average of these and applies to all three categories.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance allows Departments to pay full mileage rates in respect of attendance at training courses where they consider it is justified by the circumstances of the case and provided any additional expenditure incurred can be met from within their budget allocations for the year in question. This discretion excludes situations where specific instructions apply in relation to the payment of reduced mileage or the use of public transport, for example, in relation to attendance at third level courses of education.</P>
    <P>In the case of civil servants, where overnight accommodation and other meals are not provided by the course organisers, the general Civil Service subsistence rates are payable provided the normal conditions governing the payment of such allowances are satisfied. The Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Health and Children will provide information directly to the Deputy on the travel and subsistence rates payable to gardaí and nurses, respectively.</P>
    <P>Appendix</P>
    <P>The subsistence and travel rates payable to teachers for attendance at in-career development courses</P>
    <P>SUBSISTENCE RATES</P>
    <P>National programmes: &euro;60.95 to cover evening meal, overnight stay, breakfast, lunch and coffee. Where meals are provided by course organisers, the following amounts should be deducted &ndash;&euro;15.87 for dinner, &euro;10.79 for lunch, tea-coffee and &euro;6.98 for breakfast. Where accommodation and meals are arranged and paid for by course organisers, only actual costs within the &euro;60.95 limit are payable.</P>
    <P>Other courses: An overnight amount of &euro;34.28, including breakfast, is payable, except for primary teachers attending summer courses for which extra personal vacation is approved. Where accommodation and breakfast are arranged and paid for by course organisers, only actual costs within the &euro;34.28 limit are payable.</P>
    <P>The above is on the basis that overnight stays occur where unavoidable.</P>
    <P>Meals [Amounts claimable by course providers for course participants]</P>
    <P>Lunch-coffee: &euro;10.79 [Minimum four hours actual training contact time]</P>
    <P>Meals for shorter periods: &euro;6.98 [Minimum three hours actual training contact time]</P>
    <P>&euro;3.81 [Less than three hours actual training contact time]</P>
    <P>TRAVEL RATES</P>
    <P>The cost of bus or train fares or 31.9 cent per mile car allowance, where less expensive public transport is not available. Mileage allowance may not be paid in respect of claimants who have to travel less than ten miles, single journey, to the course.</P>
    <P>GENERAL</P>
    <P>In each of the above cases, the amounts shown are the maxima which may be claimed by organisers in respect of course costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, the courses run in the State that allow for appointment to a permanent post in a primary school are the three year bachelor of education degree and the full-time 18 month graduate diploma in primary teaching. Both of these courses are run in the colleges of education, which specialise in the training of primary teachers.</P>
      <P>The bachelor of education, B.Ed, degree programme offered at the colleges of education is designed to equip teachers to teach the full range of subjects in the Irish primary school curriculum. Teachers who have obtained a B.Ed degree from these colleges are permitted to teach in all national schools where they are required to complete a successful probationary period leading to full recognition as a primary teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the bachelor of education programme, students must develop competencies in the full range of subjects to be taught in national schools, including Irish, and the award of the B.Ed degree signifies that the teacher involved is competent to teach all subjects on the curriculum. Consequently, the study of Irish is a core component in <Col N="1104" /> the B.Ed programme, and students entering colleges of education are required to have a minimum competence in this subject in their leaving certificate examination.</P>
    <P>Deaf children in general have enormous difficulty in acquiring a first language. As English is the preferred medium for the vast majority of deaf children, it is felt that the greatest emphasis should be placed in acquiring oral and written competence in English. Because of the difficulties some children have in acquiring a first language, English, exemption is given from the study of Irish to certain categories of children with special educational needs, including deaf children.</P>
    <P>Where children who are exempted from the study of Irish wish to pursue Irish, it is open to them to request their schools to provide instruction in Irish. My Department will provide support in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Significant and complex issues arise in relation to access to the teaching profession by people with disabilities. I have made arrangements to establish a working group to examine and review the present arrangements in consultation with relevant interests, and having regard to best international practice in this area. I have asked the group to expedite its work and report to me at an early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The process of assessing the need for new or replacement educational facilities at primary or post-primary level in any given area involves consideration of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and existing school provision serving the area. These factors apply equally in both urban and rural cases. For the purpose of second level education, Ballyfin is included in the Portlaoise catchment area. The management authorities at the Patrician College, Ballyfin, indicated to my Department some time ago that they were not in a position to continue to provide post-primary education in Ballyfin. As an alternative, they proposed to participate in the management of an amalgamated community college with County Laois VEC. I should emphasise that, as trustees of the Patrician College, the decision to withdraw from trusteeship and man<Col N="1105" /> agement of the school is a matter for the Patrician Brothers.</P>
      <P>The issue for me, as Minister for Education and Science, is how post-primary educational provision in the catchment should be structured to best effect, having regard to the brothers' decision and the major capital funding required by the other post-primary schools in the area. Taking all factors into account, I am of the view that the appropriate course of action is to support the decision taken by the Patrician Brothers and the VEC to amalgamate in a new community college on the outskirts of Portlaoise. I am advised that substantial capital investment in three modern schools in Portlaoise is the best strategy for meeting the needs of all students of the catchment area. In these circumstances, my Department has no plans to purchase the property in question. I met representatives of the Ballyfin parents' council last December and listened to its concerns. In the interim, officials of my Department have also met representatives of the parents and teachers at the school, whose objective is to retain a post-primary school in Ballyfin. The representatives were given the opportunity to submit to me their views regarding the proposed amalgamation and my officials are awaiting their response.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving the accommodation situation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997. Greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area, since this Government came into office, means that there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity. A proposed building project for Cahergal national school will proceed to architectural planning and to the preparation of tender documents, as soon as possible, under the expanded building programme.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this, officials from my Department met the board of management on 17 January 2002 and advised that it is prepared to approve interim measures to address urgent health and safety issues at the school, including additional temporary accommodation to alleviate the shortage of classroom space. It is open to the board of management to take up this offer, at any stage, in the interest of the children and teachers, if in its judgment the current facilities are unsatisfactory or unsafe.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving accommodation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997. Greatly increased levels of activity in the primary buildings area, since this Government came into office, means that there has been a substantial increase in the number of major building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity. The school <Col N="1107" /> referred to by the Deputy is being extended and refurbished as part of the Government's programme and is currently in architectural planning. The project will continue to the preparation of tender documents and the invitation of tenders, as soon as possible, under the expanded building programme.</P>

      <P>The number of learning support teachers at primary level has increased from 1,242 in 1997 to 1,485 at present.</P>
      <P>While regard is had to the number of schools served by individual learning support teachers, the key factor in the allocation of such posts is the number of pupils requiring the service. There are approximately 181 learning support teachers providing learning support to four primary schools; approximately 81 learning support teachers providing learning support to five primary schools; approximately 36 learning support teachers providing learning support to six primary schools; approximately eight learning support teachers providing learning support to seven primary schools; and approximately two learning support teachers providing learning support to more than seven primary schools.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 243 to 246, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My Department recognises English language schools that meet the criteria specified by the Advisory Council for English Language Schools for such recognition. I am arranging for the list of English language schools recognised by my Department to be forwarded to the Deputy together with the regulations governing such recognition.</P>
      <P>New applicant schools are inspected on two occasions, with a minimum period of ten months between inspections, before they are recommended to my Department for recognition. The main areas covered by the inspection are: premises, general management and administration, academic management, teaching qualifications and performance and student welfare.</P>
      <P>In relation to the recognised schools these are required to renew their application to ACELS annually and are inspected at least once over a three-year period. In addition, spot-checks may be carried out at any time. I understand that in 2001 ACELS carried out 27 such checks.</P>
      <P>New applicants that fail to meet the required standards are not recommended by ACELS to my Department for recognition. In the case of existing recognised schools, if ACELS deems that standards and regulations are not being adhered to, following an inspection or a spot-check their recognition is withdrawn.</P>
      <P>There is no obligation on schools to belong to ACELS. However, affiliation to ACELS is the only means by which schools can gain the official recognition of my Department. This recognition is of such importance for marketing reasons that most schools belong to ACELS.</P>
