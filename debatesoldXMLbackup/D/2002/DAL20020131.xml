      <P>I request, under Standing Order 31, that Dáil Éireann be adjourned to address the concerns of victims of abuse in residential institutions that the level of compensation is too low and that the financial obligations fall disproportionately on the taxpayer rather than on the institutions concerned and that the Government needs to renegotiate a fair and equitable package with those concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware, either in general terms or from his constituency, that fear of crime has increased to huge proportions? Is he aware that a recent survey found 90% of parents are afraid their teenage son or daughter will be assaulted at night? That is not only in Dublin city, it is also around the country. Is he aware that 70% of people are afraid in their own neighbourhoods at night, even in those which would be <Col N="842" /> regarded as the better suburban areas? Is he aware that over 90% of people are afraid to walk on Dublin's O'Connell Street at night? Is he aware that 94% of people are afraid of serious personal assault to themselves? In the dying days of the Government what does the Taoiseach intend to do to remove the fear of crime which is now pervasive throughout the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of the comments made by Fine Gael, does the Taoiseach share with me the views articulated by many of our constituents &ndash; both in this city and throughout the country &ndash; seeking a physical presence of gardaí on the beat? Does the Taoiseach accept that fear of crime would be alleviated if there were more gardaí on the beat providing a sense of reassurance with their uniformed presence? If so, will he indicate what steps have been taken, or the steps he proposes to take, to bring about that increased and enhanced presence of uniformed gardaí?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the public feel more confidence when they see uniformed gardaí on the street. That is a proven fact. It is welcome that there are now over 900 extra gardaí in the force. I welcome the special units that are now in existence and co-ordinated under one assistant commissioner. The drugs units, which deal with areas that create an enormous amount of the crime referred to by Deputy Noonan, are working in each of the 26 districts and have additional members and resources. The new structures introduced last year are working effectively. We have 1,200 additional prison places and the revolving door system we had for many decades no longer operates. We have had a substantial decrease in serious crime since the Government took office.</P>

        <b>: </b>Where is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Crime prevention schemes directed towards young offenders are working very effectively. We have introduced the necessary legislation and allocated additional resources to ensure that it works effectively. I am sure Deputies Noonan and Quinn will join with me in congratulating the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on overseeing such an effective operation against crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe the Taoiseach knows what is going on. Ordinary decent young fellows accept it as a fact of life that they risk being assaulted randomly and in an unprovoked fashion when they are socialising. Young women <Col N="843" /> are afraid to walk home alone, even if it is only couple of hundred yards. The thugs have taken over the streets while the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform arrogantly preaches about the concept of zero tolerance which never happened anywhere but in his own imagination. It is time to get real about this. Although the Garda recorded 10,400 assaults in 2000 there is massive under-reporting because people feel that nothing will happen. If the reports on assaults were matched with admission figures to accident and emergency rooms in major hospitals one would find there are probably double the number of assaults taking place on the streets than are reported.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach do anything about this? Does he talk to young people any more? It is the issue that most affects young people, upsetting their social lives. Young people face the risk of being randomly beaten on the streets of Dublin and that risk has escalated in other cities and every major town. The fear of crime stalks the streets. The Government has not done anything about this problem in the past five years and is not doing anything about it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While there is crime, attacks and difficulties, the Deputy should not instil fear by saying that everyone who goes out at night risks being attacked, which is entirely untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">

      <P>I, like others in this House, am out and about and the picture that has been painted is not the true position nor is it the picture that has been painted by the main police stations throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They are reported. There is a difficulty about problems outside nightclubs and bars. The Minister has given a legislative response to that problem and the earlier that legislation is passed in this session the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a separate but sadly related matter, the Taoiseach has taken a unique and personal interest in promoting economic and cultural relations between this State, of just under 4 million people, and the largest state in the world, the People's Republic of China, with a population <Col N="844" /> of, according to what various estimates suggest, 1.2 billion people. A number of those people, many of whom work in this House as cleaners, have come to this country in recent years to study English and to make an economic contribution to this State as they acquire that international language. On 21 January one of the members of that community was viciously assaulted for no other reason than he happened to be Chinese and therefore was distinctly recognisable in this otherwise homogeneous society. On 21 January, Mr. Zhao Liu Tao was attacked while walking home, in a manner not dissimilar to what Deputy Noonan outlined, and struck by an iron bar that had been left on the ground where maintenance work was being undertaken by the Dublin Gas Company. What action, if any, does the Taoiseach propose to take to deal with the increased incidence of racism?</P>
      <P>I draw the Taoiseach's attention to a survey published in September last year, copies of which, I suspect, were sent to most if not every Deputy. That survey was carried out among people of ethnic and minority communities who live and work here. They make an economic contribution to this country and many of them staff our hospitals. Without their presence our health system would grind to a halt. They were invited here, yet it is a shame on us that 78% of the sample surveyed indicated that they had experienced racism, 36.2% of them recorded that they had frequently heard or seen people making insulting comments about their skin colour or ethnic background, over 80% of them tended to agree that racism is a serious problem in Ireland today, and 81.5% of them stated that not enough was being done to educate people about racism and so on. The Taoiseach is familiar with these issues, but what will he and the Government do about them? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the racist attacks that the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, condemned as wrong and brought to the Taoiseach's attention are built on the fact that there is lawlessness on our streets? This period is the most virulent peak of it, but it is consistent with the attacks that are taking place every night in every city centre and town location throughout the country. What will the Taoiseach do about the lawlessness on our streets, the fact that our own young people are unsafe and that people of a different skin colour are like lightning conductors for the thugs who take over the night in Dublin and other cities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the horrific incident raised by Deputy Quinn. The following morning I got the full facts of what happened and the full report from the Garda. Initially two members of the Chinese community and two members of a neighbouring community confronted each other at a late night food shop. Words were exchanged, they followed them, and more members of the Chinese community joined in. Then a call was made to a local drinking site <Col N="845" /> where more members of our own community joined in and an iron bar was thrown, which unfortunately, regrettably, sadly and disturbingly killed the Chinese student. We all abhor any of those acts of violence. This happened at 10 p.m., not in the early hours when many of these incidents tend to happen. It was in a suburban area where there have been few if any reports of an attack of a racial or any other nature. It is a respectable end of north Dublin. The people of the area told me that they cannot recall any such incident in the past 30 to 40 years.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the measures that have been taken by the Garda Síochána to facilitate the reporting of crime, particularly this aspect of crime among members of ethnic minorities, through the quality customer service initiative and the establishment of a Garda racial and intercultural office. I am advised that office is well staffed and that such cases are reported. As Deputy Quinn is well aware, minorities are spending their time in certain parts of this city and those are particularly sensitive areas of which the Garda are keenly aware.</P>
      <P>On the broader aspect of the question, last autumn we launched a high level programme chaired by an eminent person, Joe McDonagh, and involving many people from different walks of life who have researched this issue and who have put a good national campaign in place to deal with the issues. The House will be aware that in some areas of our cities and in the countryside the percentage of the ethnic minorities is quite high and is creating some difficulties and tensions in those areas, where careful policing is required. Although there are a great number of Chinese here now, some 30,000 to 40,000 &ndash; according to the latest figures it is 33,000 &ndash; there have been very few incidents, but we regret those few. When the family of that young man was here, I asked the Minister if we could speak to them and assure them that we will do all we can to make sure we avoid incidents such as this. It is not easy, but at least we can advise people not to get involved in such incidents and educate them on this issue.</P>
      <P>It is unfair to mention this issue without mentioning the other side of it. There are many schools in Dublin and elsewhere where different nationalities learn side by side. I visited one recently with Members of the House and other groups, where there are between 10 and 15 different nationalities gaining an education side by side and encountering no difficulties. That is the example. It is a credit to the teachers, the parents and the communities. It is possible to go through this transition to a multicultural society without encountering any difficulties. We must be vigilant about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Taoiseach has said. Does he consider the following comments to be helpful in light of what he has put on record? The comments are:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Too many are coming to Ireland and too many to Cork in my view. In the past five years <Col N="846" /> there have been 35,000 applications for asylum and 80 per cent of those have been from illegal immigrants using the refugee system to get in. . . . We are against the spongers, the freeloaders, the people screwing the system. I'm saying we will have to close the doors. The majority of them are here for economic reasons and they are thumbing their noses at Irish hospitality and demanding everything under the guise of the Geneva Convention while the taxpayer is paying for it all. The bill was £20 million in 1997 and by the end of last year it was rapidly approaching £200 million.</P>
    <P>I'm suggesting the following: the application and deportation process should be speeded up and a special High Court judge designated to deal with legal matters.</P>
    <P>This was said by Deputy O'Flynn who is not in the House at present. It fuels what the Taoiseach has just discussed. It is a pity Deputy O'Flynn is not in the primary school to which the Taoiseach made reference. The way people are identified as spongers, freeloaders and those who screw the system is not by talking to them or finding out where they work or live but simply by the colour of their skin.</P>
    <P>In light of his earlier comments, what action, if any, does the Taoiseach intend to take with regard to the comments made by Deputy O'Flynn and does he regard them as inflammatory?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Needless to say, I reject those comments and since he is a member of my party I have already made that clear. An increasing number of people from different parties, perhaps not Members of the House, are making these comments. People need to look at the broader picture of what happens. It is easy to raise racial issues. In my view, anybody who does that to satisfy a group in one area should be extremely conscious of what a group in another area feels. It is not an educated or tolerant view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a dangerous view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another aspect to this issue which we have been endeavouring to deal with and to which we have given enormous resources. Deputy Noonan mentioned research. We should be frank about the research and acknowledge that people are raising this issue. They are saying they are happy to follow the UN system but they also want the system to operate speedily so that refugees who come to this country and who are covered by the proper procedures are protected and that others are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have put forward a system that deals with people properly and according to the rules and regulations. Everybody is entitled to come in and make an application. They are cared for when they make their application but people are not prepared to tolerate the fact that nobody leaves if they are found to be illegal. That is what people are saying. If we follow due process and adhere <Col N="847" /> to the mechanisms, the community will not have these attitudes.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask about two legislative measures. The first is the Electoral Bill which will introduce a new system for nominating candidates for election. It follows the decision of the High Court which found that the payment of deposits is unconstitutional. All Members would like to know when the Bill will be published and when it will be taken in the House.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach, in reply to a question I put to him on the housing (private rented sector) Bill, which will provide rights to tenants, informed the House that the Department of the Environment and Local Government is still considering the Bill. He had previously told us the heads of the Bill would be approved before Christmas. Does his reply yesterday mean that in the lifetime of the Government no action will have been taken to give legal rights to the 150,000 tenants who do not have such rights?</P>

        <b>: </b>Deputies Noonan and Quinn have already demonstrated that zero tolerance has been a dismal failure. It has been a farce, a cliché and a con job. Given that between 35 and 40 people will be seriously assaulted on our streets tonight, is the Taoiseach serious about tackling crime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 38 justice Bills before the House, of which 14 were published yesterday. This is a wish list but if the Taoiseach is serious about tackling crime, will he front-load the Criminal Justice (Enforcement of Public Order) Bill, 2001, to provide the Garda with additional powers to deal <Col N="851" /> with street offences so that there are more guards on the beat to combat thugs?</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Crime Levels: Motion Resumed.</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Shatter on Wednesday, 30 January 2002:</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann, conscious of the promises made by the Government to cut crime down to zero-tolerance levels and mindful of the need for ordinary citizens to feel safe while going about their daily lives and the fact that many Irish people are living in fear of violent attack, borne out by the recently published Garda Annual Report which shows a dramatic increase in the incidents of violent crime and highlights the failure of the Government to implement its promised zero-tolerance approach, condemns:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the attempts by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to portray Ireland as a place of falling crime rates by focusing on so-called 'headline offence' figures which ignore the occurrence of assaults and woundings;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the failure of this Government to address the problem of violent assault which resulted in over 10,400 reported assaults to an Garda Síochána in 2000, and which includes a 131% increase in assaults causing harm;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the inaction of the Minister in combating the prevalence of rape, which now averages six per week, violent assaults causing harm that number 5 per day and serious drug offences, of which there are four every day of the year;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the way in which the present administration has allowed a situation to develop whereby only one in four crimes are reported to the Gardaí, thereby damaging the reputation of the force and diminishing their status within the wider community;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the refusal to publish preliminary figures for 2001 which would provide a more up-to-date picture of crime in this country but <Col N="855" /> which are being withheld from public scrutiny for brazenly party political reasons;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the contempt with which the Government holds the business community, half of whose enterprises were victims of crime in 2000 and who have witnessed a 19% increase in crime since the Government came to power;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the lack of determination to address lawlessness which, in 2001, led to 5,000 people in Dublin needing overnight hospital care following violent attacks; and</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the Government for failing to make our streets safe, for the dramatic escalation in violence and for betraying the promises it made to the electorate prior to the general election on this critical issue.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably.</P>
      <P>There are some areas of Government failure where a certain tolerance can be anticipated from the public in terms of the customary media manipulation, stage managed photo opportunities and spin doctoring that goes on. For example, for reasons I can never understand, an otherwise angry and frustrated commuting public will still laugh out loud when the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, pulls an outrageous stunt like being photographed beside a static tram that comes from nowhere and goes nowhere. However, the crime situation is no laughing matter. It is not just the admitted 130% increase in violent crime or the almost weekly spate of gangland killings and other violent deaths, nor is it only about the manipulation and so-called reclassification of statistics and the apparent deliberate delay in publishing up to date statistics. Above all, it is the fact that large tracts of our cities are unsafe and many working class communities are besieged by lawlessness and marauding gangs of young thugs. Women are afraid to walk the streets at night, old people are afraid to leave their homes and parents are fearful their children will fall in with youth gangs or be preyed upon by local drug pushers. Some of these communities in our principal cities betray all the signs of being ravaged by anti-social behaviour, petty crime and, latterly and all too frequently, violent crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only in Ireland could all this have transpired under a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who came to office loudly banging the zero tolerance drum. Couched in the verbosity of his advisers in the Bar Library and reflecting his own unerring predilection for hyperbole, he whipped up a storm of fear and exaggeration. The House will remember the homilies about New York and how big John would, once in office, pin on the sheriff's badge and clean up this town. Woe betide the wrongdoers and criminals as big John, like St. Patrick, would drive them from our shores. He could see no complexity or obstacles <Col N="858" /> in the way of his mission, only a supposed lack of political will on the part of his predecessor. He milked it for all it was worth without any sense of responsibility and scant regard for the facts.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach told us this morning that we on this side of the House should not exaggerate criminal activity. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform got where he is today through exaggeration and bombast and without responsibility or regard to the facts. The only thread of consistency between his barnstorming in Opposition and his blundering in Government is his capacity to ignore the facts. He refuses to see that there are entire communities devastated by lawlessness and crime or to acknowledge the extent to which law-abiding citizens despair of even reporting petty crime. He refuses to understand urban Ireland and the complexities of the policing needs of working class communities. He refuses to take the necessary steps to bring the production of accurate, intelligible and accessible statistics up to date. He refuses to understand the reason the traditional high regard in which this society held the Garda has been eroded and, in many areas, regrettably replaced by alienation. He fails to understand the reason reform of the Garda is not just essential in terms of the requirements of our society but in terms of the Garda itself.</P>
    <P>There is no refuge for the Minister in latching on to the performance of the Criminal Assets Bureau or in hitching his case to the modest abatement of figures for burglaries, break-ins, handbag snatching and such crimes. Both decisions which contributed to this modest improvement were taken by the rainbow Government. It decided to introduce the Criminal Assets Bureau and the legislation was put through the House by my colleague, Deputy Quinn.</P>
    <P>The abatement in crime covering break-ins, burglaries, thefts and handbag snatching is primarily due to the decision I took in the previous Government to set up the local drugs task forces. As recently as last night on the &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo; programme, the well known and respected criminologist, Dr. Paul O'Mahony attributed the abatement in this type of crime to the decision to set up the local drugs task forces, to the community treatment centres they put in place and to the stabilisation effect of the methadone programme. This is what has contributed to the modest improvement in this type of crime about which the Minister boasted last night.</P>
    <P>I will refer in passing to my constituency. I attended a meeting before Christmas in a part of that constituency with gardaí and representatives of the local community about the extent to which it has been taken over by marauding young thugs and the reason there is a general air of lawlessness and intimidation of people. The gardaí did what they must do in such a position; they made the best of a bad lot. They do not get into the politics of criticising the Government for adequacy of policing. They suggested the position was not that bad. While we were inside at the <Col N="859" /> meeting, youths outside set fire to one of the cars. When the gardaí emerged from the meeting, the car was on fire.</P>
    <P>Despite this, a decision taken to give divisional status to Tallaght in 1997 by the then Minister, Deputy Owen, has still not been implemented. Until that decision, Tallaght, with a population of 101,000, was a sub-station of Crumlin. A chief superintendent has been appointed and that is all that has been done. The excuse is that there is not enough room in the station. Can Members present from Cork and Laoighis-Offaly understand what it must be like for there to be only one Garda station in a population of 101,000 people?</P>
    <P>The excuse of big John, who was going to clean up this country, for not implementing the decision is that there is not room in Tallaght Garda station to allocate the additional resources, manpower, vehicles and equipment that would have come normally with the decision to award divisional status. It is a disgrace. There are 159 gardaí to police that area on five days over seven with three shifts in operation. According to the Minister's reply to a parliamentary question, Limerick, which has serious problems such as we discussed last night and today, has an allocation of 446 gardaí. How can he justify that allocation?</P>
    <P>This man does not understand urban Ireland. He came to office banging the zero tolerance drum, outrageously exploiting fear and building this exaggerated case. Deputy Howlin pointed out last night that the Minister said in November 1997 that he wants to be judged at the end of his term of office according to the test of whether people feel safer in their homes. By that yardstick, he has been a disgraceful and lamentable failure because people do not feel safer in their homes. They are afraid to walk the streets of some of the cities. Old people are besieged in their homes, women are afraid to walk in public parks and when their teenage children go out, parents are concerned about the condition in which they might return. That is the reality.</P>
    <P>There is no emphasis on community policing or recognition by the Minister that reform is badly needed in the Garda. This is the legacy the author of zero tolerance has left our society. It is a disgrace. It has been a hypocritical period in office. He drives up from Caherciveen and signs whatever is put on his desk by his officials. He has never taken control of his Department or of the Garda and the country is the worse for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with other Deputies. I have given a list of them to the Ceann Comhairle. I pay tribute to the Garda Síochána whose members have always been in the front line of the fight against crime. They do a difficult job well. They are prepared to place their lives and wellbeing at risk on a daily basis so that we can go about our own business, live in our communities and enjoy ourselves without always having to look over our shoulders. The Garda deserve our unstinting support in this <Col N="860" /> endeavour. There is a real responsibility on communities, parents, educators and others in our society to play their parts in ensuring that crime is wiped out.</P>
      <P>Too often we hear that the Garda do nothing, that young thugs are allowed to run riot and that criminals are never caught. However, in my own area of Cork gardaí are performing their duties to the highest level. The Garda Síochána crime figures for 2000 show that the fight against crime in Cork city is achieving results. Three homicides were recorded for the period and three were detected. Of the 117 assaults recorded, the culprits were detected in 92 cases. Overall, the detection rate for Cork city stands at a remarkable 51%, as opposed to a national average of 42%.</P>
      <P>I return to the important matter of public support for the Garda. We, as legislators, entrust the Garda Síochána with the onerous duties we expect them to fulfil. It ill behoves us, therefore, to undermine them in this role by heedless or unwarranted criticism in pursuit of political point scoring. Of course, where wrongdoing on the part of any member of the Garda is found we should speak out, but only to ensure that the force as a whole is not tainted by the actions of a few. I appeal to all sides of the House to demonstrate their support for the Garda Síochána as the legitimate police force in this republic.</P>
      <P>This Government is tough on crime and I applaud it for that. However, the long-term anti-crime policy must engage local communities in co-operation with the Garda Síochána. This is why the Government established a national crime forum in 1998 and established the State's first ever national crime council to continue this open and innovative approach to crime policy development. It is the high priority of the Government to ensure that everything possible is done to divert young people at risk from becoming involved in crime. While the mechanisms and legislation are in place to tackle crime it is equally important to tackle the causes of crime and prevent young people entering the downward spiral which so often marks a life of crime.</P>
      <P>I listened to criticism last night from Deputies Shatter and Howlin and this morning from Deputy Quinn. I now respond to those criticisms. I have been vocal about anti-social behaviour and crime on our streets since I first entered politics. Am I now to be silenced because some of those causing the problem are illegal immigrants? Deputies will find the coverage given to my remarks by <i>The Irish Times</i> on 29 January 2002 paints an accurate picture of what I said. However, I would amend the headline to read, &ldquo;Illlegal Immigrants&rdquo; and not &ldquo;Asylum Seekers&rdquo;. I do not write the headlines. I can also give Deputies a copy of comments I have received from NASC, the Irish immigrants support centre in Cork so that they can see the point of view of that body. NASC is asking me to reconsider my stance. This I will not do.</P>

It is important in a democracy that one is allowed to express one's views and that people are allowed to oppose them because people are entitled to their views. It is essential that the law of the land is applied to everyone in the country regardless of their race, creed or religion. There should be no special treatment for natives of the country or those who have recently come here. The same rules should apply across the board to everyone.</P>
      <P>It is important to realise that there has been a major reduction in serious crime in the past four years. I was first elected to this House following the last general election. During the run up to the election the only issue mentioned on a consistent basis at meetings I attended throughout Laois and Offaly was the level of crime and the fact that people living in rural areas were afraid in their own homes. The message candidates received was that they were being elected to this House to do something about crime. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, has done a magnificent job. There has been a major improvement in detection rates.</P>

      <P>The revolving door syndrome has ended, which required tough measures.

In addition, as a result of the work of the Government and my constituency colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, we are now experiencing a peace dividend. Places are now available in the high security prison in Portlaoise for serious criminals and drugs barons which were previously held exclusively for subversives. These people should be held in high security centres such as Portlaoise Prison. Tremendous progress has been made in ensuring that people responsible for crime are put behind bars and remain there.</P>
      <P>A record amount of legislation has been introduced. The assets of drug barons can now be seized. The Criminal Assets Bureau has tremendous power and there are mandatory jail sentences if the amount of drugs seized exceeds a certain figure. I welcome the Government's announcement yesterday of the publication of a Criminal Justice Enforcement Public Order Bill which will be passed into law during this session. This is very important because street violence is a major concern. Street violence experienced in provincial towns and other areas throughout the country is due to a large extent to the consumption of too much drink and drugs. In future we must clamp down on this type of crime.</P>
      <P>Some pubs have been closed temporarily where the owners have been found guilty of allowing under age drinking. I call for the introduction of legislation to ensure that pubs, discos and night clubs where drugs such as heroin, hash or ecstacy are found will be closed for a period. If owners of some night clubs and discos in towns throughout the country knew they would face closure in the event that drugs were found on their premises they would quickly clean up their premises. I realise it is an inordinate onus on owners of these premises because they are not responsible for everyone. However, the message will get across quickly and people who leave discos at night will not fear the occurrence of rows on the streets.</P>
      <P>Tremendous progress has been made in increasing the strength of the Garda to approximately 12,000. However, in this day and age there cannot be sufficient numbers of gardaí. I would like to see more gardaí in Portlaoise, Mountrath, Borris-in-Ossory, Arles, Ballylinan and other areas in the constituency. I would like to see consistency among judges by putting people who are convicted behind bars and taking a more stern line with them.</P>

      <P>I regret I have little time available to me because I would like to say a number of things to the motion, including the audacity of members of the Opposition who tabled it.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, on the excellent job he has done over the past five years and which he continues to do on a daily basis. It is of little surprise that there is still a problem with crime given the type of society in which we live. I speak not just of Ireland but globally. One need not look past 11 September last to see just how low some people have sunk in their efforts to strike at the heart of decency as we have traditionally known it.</P>
      <P>We too have suffered a reduction in standards by a small section of the population. That section which has traditionally given trouble has got involved in crime and has consistently been part of the statistics for many years. There are always people who will break the law but the measures we apply to deal with these criminals is what matters. Let me give an example from my own constituency and city. At first glance the crime figures might seem bad and in decline given that there were more crimes in Waterford city in 2000, the last year for which figures are available, than in Limerick city. The comparative figures are 1,543 to 1,412. However, on closer examination it emerges that the reporting rate in Waterford is much higher than in Limerick. There is a 68% detection rate in Waterford, the highest in the country, while the national figure stands at 42%. This means the gardaí in Waterford must have adopted some procedures which other areas have yet to do. Crime figures for 2000 are down and I believe the trend continued into 2001. I await the official figures with interest but I have no doubt they will bring good news both for the communities and the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Crime is being reported and co-operation is given to the gardaí in Waterford at a level which is probably ahead of other areas throughout the country. This stems from people having confidence in the gardaí and in their policing measures and methods. This, in turn, can be traced back to the actions of the Minister and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the policies they have devised and implemented. I compliment them on the job they are doing and the professional manner in which they go about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This success also stems from the programmes which have been initiated in the city in recent years, particularly that of community policing. There are now two sergeants and nine gardaí on community policing duties. This has the effect of penetrating deep into the lives of the people of Waterford, raising the profile of the gardaí and encouraging co-operation on the part of the people in preventing and detecting crime. There are several Garda-sponsored projects for specific areas of the city or for specific target groups, particularly youth groups. There is the BALL project, the SWAY project and another inner city initiative on the way. There are 36 neighbour<Col N="866" /> hood watch areas, all of which have built up an excellent rapport between the community and the gardaí. All this is as a result of the solid policies promoted and implemented by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, who has given an exemplary lead in the fight against crime.</P>
    <P>Closed circuit television is about to arrive in Waterford, which will further strengthen the fight against crime, assist convictions and act as an effective deterrent. I am pleased Dungarvan has initiated moves to cover the town centre with CCTV. I hope it will be assisted in this measure in the near future. All this may not be happening in other areas but the benefits await those who avail of all the schemes and initiatives available. This will take little initiative on the part of local communities but the benefits gained are well worth the effort and communities will find that gardaí will only be too willing to respond to any lead given by the community. It is up to all of us to help in the fight against crime and not slavishly wait for the gardaí to do everything. The gardaí are well aware that a vigilant and co-operative public is its greatest asset and I urge communities to assist the gardaí whenever and wherever possible.</P>
    <P>Parental control is another area which needs to be seriously considered. Unless and until parents are made responsible for the actions of their dependent children, there will be little incentive shown by them in controlling their children.</P>
    <P>I regret that time constraints do not allow for a greater indepth study of crime figures generally but I am confident the Minister has the various agencies properly directed and motivated. I fully support his measures and initiatives. His record in regard to legislation is unsurpassed, which is just one of the more visible benefits he has brought to his office. I again express my confidence in the Minister whose record is a proud one and is there for all to see.</P>

      <P>I wish to avail of the opportunity to support the Government's programme over recent years and to reflect back on 1997 when the Government was campaigning for election and one of the issues was that of crime. It is fair to recognise and recall that the main issues then were the revolving door syndrome, the lack of Garda manpower and the lack of financial resources. These three ingredients were put clearly by the public during that campaign. Unless these issues were resolved the fight against crime could not be won. Looking back over the past four and a half years, I am pleased to say the ingredients to fight that problem have been put in place. I refer specifically to the commitment by the Minister to increase Garda manpower. While I acknowledge that the extra 900 gardaí on the streets will not be sufficient to resolve the problem, nevertheless it is a move in the right direction. There is also a clear commitment to ensure that gardaí will not be tied up with office duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last general election campaign I attended many meetings in the constituency of <Col N="867" /> Laoighis-Offaly and obvious concern was expressed by people about the revolving-door system in prisons. They felt that not enough was being done to ensure that criminals stayed behind bars. People wondered what was the use of Garda manpower being used to catch law breakers when they would be back on the streets within a few months. I am pleased to see the Minister's commitment to tackling this issue is being lived up to. The provision of extra prison places, particularly in Portlaoise Prison, has backed up Garda activity.</P>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister referred to the issue of public order legislation which I would like to see being addressed in the coming months. Yesterday we had an opportunity to meet members of the Vintners' Federation of Ireland and this is clearly an issue we must address. Maybe the time has come for us to revisit the extension of public house opening hours and weekend trading. The issue is causing huge concern among people who feel it is impossible to have adequate Garda resources to assist on the streets late at night on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. I do not know of anybody who is actively campaigning to retain the extra hours, but many people say the longer opening period is causing more difficulty for the Garda Síochána in terms of resources. In the coming months we should examine that issue which is a cause for concern because people feel Garda resources are being used up when they could be more usefully directed elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred in his speech to rape and sexual assault generally and he made the point that the penalties for sexual offences are severe. He has invited Deputies from both sides of the House to put forward proposals as to how extra law enforcement measures can be introduced to make the streets safer, particularly for young women, and to deal with the terrible crime of sexual assault. Unfortunately, we have come to know such assaults not only in our cities but throughout the midland circuit. Local newspapers in recent months have reported a huge increase in such crimes.</P>
    <P>The campaign to fight crime generally, however, is well under way and the past four years have been a success in this regard. Garda manpower levels now exceed 11,700 and we are on target to meet the commitment of 12,000. When our party's manifesto was published some years ago, that very commitment was challenged and we were told it could not become a reality. Now, however, we are heading towards that target which forms part of the resources the Minister is making available to fight crime.</P>
    <P>While all the resources for which we campaigned four years ago have not been put in place, nevertheless, there has been an increase in spending in this area of £472 million to £723 million under the programme. The Minister was strong enough to secure £87 million under the national development plan for the period 2000-2006 under the heading &ldquo;fighting crime&rdquo;. He can <Col N="868" /> also be judged on his ability to enact legislation and it should be noted that he has introduced 42 Bills dealing with crime.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of special powers to deal with the problem of violence against women. As we head into the next election campaign we will find that throughout constituencies there is great fear that not enough resources are allocated to combating this type of crime. I welcome the commitment of the Minister and his invitation to all Deputies to make submissions to deal with public order offences and violent crimes against women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and the Government for introducing a wide range of legislation to fight crime. The Minister has pioneered legislation and has identified the relevant issues in a changing society. Even when he was in Opposition, Deputy O'Donoghue, was able to identify serious crime issues to introduce legislation to deal with them.</P>
      <P>I compliment gardaí for the work they do. In many parts of the country it is now a thankless task to be a member of the Garda Síochána. I also thank the Garda Commissioner and his assistant commissioners for their work in fighting crime. With the co-operation of the community, public representatives and the Garda Síochána, we will be able to address many of the existing difficulties.</P>
      <P>We pass much legislation in the House but I often wonder if it is capable of being adequately enforced. The Public Order Act was passed by the previous Dáil, yet in my experience it is being enforced in an uneven way. It is capable of addressing many of what are now called crimes of anti-social behaviour. I wish the latter term could be dropped, however. Certain political groups seem to think that anyone who looks crookedly at anyone else is guilty of anti-social behaviour, but they are not.</P>
      <P>Dublin City Council introduced by-laws prohibiting the consumption of alcohol in public places but I have not seen those laws being enforced to any great extent. There is a huge amount of drinking in streets and other public places in Dublin so the by-laws should be enforced more rigorously. There are very good alternatives such as the village project run by the probation and welfare service in Finglas. It is far and away the best deterrent to crime for our young people. Previous speakers have also spoken about other crime diversion projects.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to the further allocation of CCTV in Finglas. Such a scheme is in operation in one part of my constituency and it works extremely well in co-operation with the Garda Síochána. There has been a huge reduction in the level of drug-related crime and public order offences generally in that part of the constituency. In the other part of the constituency which is not covered by CCTV, however, the situation has not been as satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" />There is no point in trying to brush issues under the carpet because our society has been changing rapidly in recent years. I strongly suspect that the people we will ask to vote has changed a great deal since the last general election in 1997. There is an increased level of street violence. Sadly, in my constituency in the past month three men have been murdered, one of whom will be buried today. This street violence is related to issues that we need to explore, such as late-night drinking and the increased availability of alcohol. It is possible to obtain alcohol in some supermarkets from 7.30 a.m. and by 10 a.m. some people are terribly drunk.</P>
    <P>Gangs of young people are congregating on street corners. I saw 25 people at one corner recently and they all had cans of drink. The licensing laws constitute a serious issue because young and not so young people are coming out of pubs very late at night or early in the morning almost incoherent because of alcohol. That problem needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>There has been a spate of attacks on the elderly in my constituency, about which I am concerned. Thankfully, the matter is being addressed by the Garda Síochána. Another worrying issue is the interference with regular bus services. There is also an increased availability of guns around the place.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new legislation from the Minister which constitutes an important intervention in the fight against crime. He said that measures in forthcoming legislation might provoke resistance given the civil liberties instincts in some of us. However, I think the public is prepared to work with legislators and with the Garda Síochána to ensure that we have safer streets. The record of the Minister in that area is excellent. I have no doubt the legislation he introduces will address the current difficulties which are prevalent in urban areas. I look forward to co-operating with other parties in ensuring the passage of that legislation through the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion tabled by Deputy Shatter which is timely and of huge importance. The terror on the streets of almost every city and town needs to be tackled urgently. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform owes his position in office to the promises he made before the last general election to clean up our streets and to introduce the concept of zero tolerance. However, his efforts have proved to be a total farce. The statistics speak for themselves. Perhaps the most important statistic is the growing number of people who fail to report crimes committed against them because they do not expect them to be resolved or the perpetrators to be brought to justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's efforts have failed. Instead of zero tolerance, we have had <Col N="870" /> zero action. He is now trying to quote statistics and to use words and phrases to make his track record seem less unimpressive than it is. It is false for the Taoiseach and the Minister to claim that the problem is under control. It is not.</P>
      <P>Some weeks ago I was a victim of crime within 150 yards of the gates of Leinster House. I was approached or set upon by a little gurrier with a syringe. It is not a pleasant experience to have someone push a syringe against one's face at 12.30 a.m. on the streets of Dublin, particularly when one is within a stone's throw of the seat of Administration. It is shocking that such occurrences are frequent. Many Members of the House have personal experience of crime. Although my experience ended without much difficulty, it was most unpleasant and it brought home to me the scale of the breakdown of law and order. Within a few yards of me on that occasion three or four young ladies were approached by the same gurrier and a colleague of his. Unfortunately, they were forced into handing over a sum of money to escape their clutches. The Garda were called and I am sure they did whatever they could. However, what chance did they have of apprehending such vicious thugs? </P>
      <P>This is an issue on every street in every town and city. We must declare that it is unacceptable. We must ask the Government in its dying days to do something about the levels of crime and to stop hiding behind statistics and talking about zero tolerance. Zero action is what we have got from the Government. We now want real action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a sad reflection of the Minister's policy of zero tolerance that in 2000 violent assaults increased by 131% on the 1999 figure, bringing them to a total of 1,703. It is virtually certain that the true figure is higher since these figures reflect only the crimes reported.</P>
      <P>I refer to a recent headline I saw in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> by Joe MacAnthony, which read: &ldquo;Tide of Street Violence And Misery Is Of the Government's Making&rdquo;. A similar headline in <i>The Irish Times</i> read: &ldquo;The Insidious Creatures Stalking Our Streets&rdquo;. Both headlines sum up what is happening on our streets.</P>
      <P>Although the overall crime detection rate by the Garda was 42% in 1999, only 5.5% of the &euro;60 million worth of stolen property was recovered. I recognise the work the Garda does in detecting crime. However, 5.5% is a small amount of the total property taken. That statistic creates a sense of hopelessness, which is why people do not report burglaries and other crimes to the Garda. The number of crimes committed is higher. I am aware of people who do not bother to report the type of petty crime which they would have reported in the past and I am concerned that the statistics do not reflect the true extent of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was most striking about the crime report was the <i>vox pop</i> when people were asked if they felt safe on the streets. The overwhelming response was that they did not. It is worth noting that between October 2000 and May 2001 there <Col N="871" /> were approximately 50,000 public order offences on our streets, which is staggering.</P>
    <P>I refer to the Minister's own county and to a recent crime survey I carried out in Tralee in response to concerns expressed to me by a number of people, particularly following assaults on gardaí. Six gardaí had to go on long-term sick leave because of assaults on them in Tralee in November. The GRA threatened industrial action at the time unless more resources were provided to help its members deal with public order in the town. The survey asked 19 questions, one of which was whether people believed they were safe walking in Tralee town centre. Some 84% of people said they were safe during the day, but 86% said they felt unsafe at night. Some 98.25% of people said they wanted to see more gardaí on the beat.</P>
    <P>The Minister bragged here last night about the extra 1,000 gardaí he has provided. He provided them during good economic circumstances. They would have been provided in the past if such circumstances had prevailed. However, those extra gardaí are tied up with PULSE and with drug and other programmes which were not available in the past. There are more demands now on Garda time than in the past. There are family breakdown problems, etc. with which gardaí must deal. As a result, there are not as many gardaí on the beat.</P>
    <P>The Minister disputed the figures from the survey. I know fear is hard to quantify. Rosita Boland summed it up in a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> when she said that fear is an insidiously powerful creature which can be very difficult to erase once it gets hold of the collective consciousness.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he was looking for the House to come up with proposals. I gave him recommendations, but he described my survey as balderdash. That is an insult to the people in Tralee who filled out the survey and returned it. More than 400 people sent it back, which means they were interested in it. The Minister's description of the survey as balderdash is an insult to those people. He was criticised in the responses. One comment was that the main reason for the breakdown of law and order in Tralee and other town centres around the country is alcohol abuse and that by extending pub opening hours, for which there was no demand from the public, the Minister is mainly responsible for the increased thuggery in our streets. The article by Joe MacAnthony states, &ldquo;Ahern Government, unthinking and irresponsible in the extreme, has set society on an anarchical journey.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shatter and his colleagues for giving us the opportunity to discuss this major issue. It was said that people are afraid on the streets of Dublin. I assure the Minister that people are afraid in small villages and everywhere else. A woman in my area who was widowed recently commented to her family that she would <Col N="872" /> live happily on her own until she was beaten to death some night. Those are her thoughts about living in rural Ireland and show how serious the situation is. By coincidence, shortly after, Sister Philomena's tragic death occurred in broad daylight in Ballybay.</P>
      <P>Anyone who says that things have improved is fooling himself or herself and being unrealistic. No one welcomes this situation. Extra gardaí on the streets of Ballybay resulted in a noticeable change because crowds no longer gather late at night outside chip shops after pubs close and older people have peace of mind. I hope that the two extra gardaí, who were drafted into that town before the death of the nun, remain as it is proven that having extra gardaí on the beat improves people's security.</P>
      <P>We all know of the robberies that have occurred, but in my constituency, as everywhere else, people no longer think that it is worthwhile to advise the Garda Síochána of crime because they have such difficulty in dealing with it. It comes down to manpower on the streets. Organised gangs come from Dublin to my constituency with wheelbarrows to steal cigarettes and other goods from two or three filling stations in one night.</P>
      <P>Drugs are a menace at every level. Some action has been taken, but there is much more known about drug pushers than the action would indicate. Parents do not know what to do with teenagers. Should they keep them at home or let them go to what is considered a safe place? However, it is difficult to find a safe place today in any town, village or city where parents can be sure that drugs will not be pushed. Much stronger action must be taken at an earlier stage against drug pushers.</P>
      <P>In line with that, the issue of late night pub hours must be re-examined. Before the change in legislation, young people left the pub to go to a disco or club for dancing. They might still have had access to alcohol, but they sweated it off in some activity. Today, with later pub hours &ndash; I was one of the few who objected to them &ndash; young people stay in pubs until they get drunk. Now they also get drugs. I am glad the Minister stated that at the end of five years, he will introduce legislation to deal with the problems the Garda experience with crowd control in areas where there is late night opening.</P>
      <P>However, we must ensure that young people and others can go out at night in towns and villages safe from being attacked or beaten to death, which is the current reality that we cannot escape. In my county, we have a higher than average level of suicide because of peer pressure. The Garda and the psychiatric services must seriously examine this problem instead of dismissing it as something that they can do nothing about. Something must be done.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I despair at the response of the Minister for Justice, Equality and <Col N="873" /> Law Reform last night and the arrogance of the Taoiseach this morning when he tried to mislead the people by saying that there is no problem. He should at least face up to the problems and give the people some comfort in the realisation that the Government has at last got the message. However, he turns a blind eye and pretends that nothing is wrong. He does not fool the people and the answer will come on election day. The only light at the end of the tunnel is that there are only 90 days left of this failed Administration and failed Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fear among people, young and old? The elderly who live alone and elderly couples living in remote areas and urban housing estates are being targeted for their savings by thugs who know they are a soft target. It was once commonplace for them to keep these savings and to leave the door on the latch for neighbours to walk in, but that day is gone. That is the result of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue's stewardship over the past five years. The barricades are up, the shutters down and the blinds pulled as the elderly, who built this country, live in fear. If there is nothing else for them, there should at least be safety, but there is no effort to provide it.</P>
      <P>There is a pretence that nothing is wrong and that the Opposition is hyping up the problem. We are not hyping it but drawing attention to it. The Government does not listen, but its days are almost over and there will be a new Minister who will deal with this problem properly. Young thugs are murdering this country in every town, village and city. They should be dealt with in time but instead they receive a pat on the wrist. Young people have no fear of the gardaí or of court because the penalties are laughable. In the district court in my area, the new system is to put a donation into the poor box at the back of the court.</P>
      <P>Recently two thugs from this city who came to my county on an expedition of robbery and intimidation were told by the judge to donate &euro;30 to the poor box. They had the cheek to ask a garda for the loan of the money. They were then given ten days to pay, during which time they organised another robbery with their friends to pay the fine and ended up back in court. They had no crime recorded against them because a donation to the poor box is not a sentence and so were treated as first time offenders. If such offenders were put behind bars and forced to do menial work, they would be taught a lesson and would think again before reoffending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is law and order, why do young people go out to discos armed with knives? Why do young people from good families go out afraid <Col N="874" /> of intimidation? As a family man, is the Minister aware that young people will only go out in groups to socialise for protection because there are other groups armed with knives? Why are they not searched?</P>

As a decent man, will the Minister not recognise that there is a problem which the Government must deal with immediately, or else call the election and allow us to take over the Government benches? We were the party of law and order and will be the party of law and order.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and to express the concern of the many people who spoke to me in recent years about the level of crime and the fear they have for their lives and persons as they go about their daily business.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of people in this State feel unsafe when they leave their homes after dark. How can the Minister suggest that crime prevention is successful when the statistics decry that claim? There was a 133% increase in assaults during 2000. We do not have the information for 2001 but it will be very interesting. I speculate that the situation has deteriorated. This serious issue needs to be dealt with by the Minister. People are in fear for their lives and rightly so. In 2000 there was a 19% increase in murder and manslaughter.</P>
      <P>It is a disgrace that the Minister can state that there is not a crime crisis. He would do much better to face up to the situation and accept it. He would have much more credibility if he were to do this rather than browbeat people by saying that everything has improved, it is a much safer place. People are saying it is not. We know this because they are telling us. We are very much aware of it. People are entitled to feel safe and not to feel under constant threat to their lives. Law abiding people are attacked without warning and seriously injured. Lives are destroyed.</P>
      <P>One can only be appalled at the details of the savage attack on the Italian student whom we recently saw on television. A young, vibrant person, with a very fulfilling life ahead of him, was attacked without provocation and confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. He has very little use of most of his limbs. This happened in daylight. That young man's life was destroyed.</P>

    <P>Young people who socialise at night are in fear of their lives. They will talk about this. The Minister should listen to what they are saying about their fears and experiences. Deputy Boylan has pointed out very vividly the difficulties and fears experienced during the ordinary socialising of all young people. They are entitled to go to discos <Col N="875" /> without having to look over their shoulder. They are entitled to come out on the street, to walk to the chip shop, to their mode of transport or to their home. They do not feel safe doing these things. It is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister must put resources into tackling the problem. The answer is, as most of this side have said, more gardaí on the beat. This is the immediate intervention which must take place. The installation of closed circuit television cameras in cities and towns must be given priority. People will know that they will be identified and charged if they offend. The proper penalties should be applied. The courts must take very seriously any attempt on someone's life or person. There does not appear to be a planned approach to tackling the problem.</P>
    <P>Elderly people are living in fear. Two women were assaulted in Newcastle West, in my constituency. They were tied up and left to suffer for a long time and were terrified out of their minds. I regret to learn today that one of these women has died. Surely the elderly are entitled to live the latter years of their lives in safety, without fear, in enjoyment and in looking back to their successes, rather than wondering who is going to knock at their door, who is going to tie them up, who is going to rob them, who is going to assault them, who is going to kill them. Surely that should not be the mindset of an elderly person.</P>
    <P>One in four crimes is unreported. The Minister's statistics are irrelevant in the context of the true level of crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shatter for putting down this motion and I support what has been said. I also thank Fine Gael for sharing time. It is clear, from the Green Party's point of view, that the Government is living in another world which is not based on the reality of people on the ground. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform says that the incidence of crime is going down. A garda inspector in my area is quite clear that crime is on the increase.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise that there are very serious problems on an area by area basis. The headline in my local paper describes a major change for the worse in the last five years in Dublin North. That is of huge concern to me and I am surprised that it is not of huge concern to the Government. It is a matter of local interest. It is also a matter of national interest, given the large amount of white collar crime as well as violent and vicious crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also an international interest. The Government is involved in paying other governments which are patently corrupt and have been found to be so. I refer to the Democratic Republic of Congo which was paying 21,652 non-existent, ghost civil servants. It was part of a corrupt scam in that country. In Bangladesh 25% of foreign aid reached its target group, so 75% was looted. This was money which the Government <Col N="876" /> paid to other governments in many cases, rather than to <i>bona fide</i> development agencies or community groups who need the money. That type of corruption reflects a culture which is enormously tolerant of crime.</P>
    <P>There is a type of crime which could be called discreet, in the sense that people do not hear about it every day. There is also the &ldquo;in your face&rdquo; crime referred to by Deputy Bradford when a syringe was literally in his face. Both kinds of crime must be seen as unacceptable and this type of event highlighted. There is no doubting the corruption in this country when we look at the Comptroller and Auditor General's report detailing 56 settlements to the Revenue Commissioners of over £100,000 each. Perhaps some were not corrupt but how could all of them have been oversights? Nobody is going to jail or being held accountable for the bank fraud of almost £200 million.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;pick me up&rdquo; idea which some commentators discuss in relation to political parties must be examined if these parties are to have credibility. The Green Party is not involved in a &ldquo;pick me up&rdquo; scheme. Some commentators are loose in their terminology and talk about all political parties being involved in this scheme. They are as loose with their words as some people are with their tax compliance. It is important to report facts as facts.</P>
    <P>On the question of crime on the streets, it cannot be denied that people are in fear. They have good reason to be in fear when they see and hear the reports of particularly vicious crime and the number of break-ins. I hear reports daily of break-ins and burglaries in areas of my constituency such as Balbriggan, Skerries, Swords and Malahide. There is a constant feeling that people expect to be burgled. If they have not been burgled it is only a matter of time. That is an appalling level of acceptance of crime. It is not proper for the Government to indicate that this is any way acceptable.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Garda are overstretched. They are living and operating with the same manpower as many years ago when there was a much smaller population in their areas. They are expected to deal with increased problems and attacks by gangs who are on the move. This is an issue in north County Dublin where there are many gangs coming from other areas. People in other rural areas have reported this previously.</P>
    <P>A number of people have said that the later opening time of licensed premises has been causing a problem. I agree. It is not possible to operate a European model where people go home when they have had one or two drinks. There is a culture in this country of binging and staying until the last minute or until you are thrown out. We have to recognise that and change the late opening hours as a result. The issue of drinking has to be addressed if we are serious about dealing with crime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to outline the facts about the success the Government has had in tackling crime and to remind the Opposition that it was not so long ago, during the rainbow coalition's term in office, that crime statistics, no matter how one looked at them, were far worse than they are now. Members will recall that at that time the criminal justice system was disgracefully starved of resources.</P>
      <P>The Minister addressed many of the specific issues raised by Opposition Deputies last night and laid bare their lack of any meaningful contribution to solving the problem of crime. Already this morning some Fine Gael Deputies said they support specialist units in the Garda while others said they did not, so there seems to be a degree of disagreement within Fine Gael on how the Garda should be managed.</P>
      <P>Some speakers supporting the original motion have referred to unreported crime and accounts of individual victimisation. The most comprehensive personal and household victimisation survey carried out in the history of the State was conducted by the Central Statistics Office as part of its quarterly national household survey in late 1998. Among many other matters, the survey found that 63% of all assaults are reported to the Garda and that more than one quarter of those who did not report an assault failed to do so on the basis that those involved did not consider it important enough to do so. The phenomenon of unreported or unrecorded crime is well documented in international criminological literature and is not unique to this jurisdiction. Although Deputies have tried to insinuate that unreported crime is somehow a new arrival, there is no real evidence to suggest that the level of under reporting now is any greater than in the past or that the level of unreported crime in Ireland is any greater than in other jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>The recently published National Crime Council report, &ldquo;Crime in Ireland&rdquo; states that in some countries there has been at least 20 years' experience of crime surveys and that this is a substantial period over which to compare what can be learnt about levels of crime from both sources. One important conclusion that has emerged is that the recorded crime figures pick up on real changes in crime and can also be taken as an indication of its real level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attempts by Deputies to find a cloud in every silver lining comes unstuck when faced with facts. The Minister's response to the spiralling crime problem, which he inherited from the rainbow coalition, has been wide-ranging and focused on a broad spectrum of measures which go beyond law enforcement. Much of this focus has been on tackling the causes of crime and the expansion in the number of local projects for offenders and young persons at risk is proof positive of this commitment. Last night the Minister outlined some of the measures in this regard. One <Col N="878" /> measure I have seen at work on many occasions is the Connect programme in prisons, which is a huge success. I compliment the prison officers working on this; they are hugely enthusiastic about it as they have had a great deal of success with it. People are not re-offending but are going out to work in the community and leading crime free lives. That is one of the many successful schemes.</P>
    <P>I share the Minister's concern with the incidence of violent assaults and the worrying anti-social behaviour of some young males. The Minister must be commended on the measures he has introduced regarding under-age drinking, public disorder and racism. Although law enforcement has a crucial role in dealing with these problems, many of them require changes in behaviour and attitudes. These are very difficult problems to solve and, as has emerged in other countries, there are no quick fix solutions. However, we are on the right track to dealing with them.</P>
    <P>Deputies will know all too well the personal and social costs associated with the misuse of drugs. As a result, extra demands are placed on the Garda, the courts and the prison services. Until this Government took office, these vital services were denied the resources they needed to manage even at minimal levels and the record high in crime figures we experienced under the previous Government was the inevitable result. Any fair-minded observer would concede that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has addressed the enormous problems he inherited with unprecedented resources and legislation. He has been successful in tackling crime and the causes of crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Shatter on putting this motion before the House, as it affects every citizen of the capital city. One of the first duties of a Government is to protect its citizens and to create a climate in which people know they are safe. The current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform presented himself as the great guardian angel who would allow no evil to interfere with the electorate. Some angel he has turned out to be. Since this Government took office, the public feels less confident that people are safe than at any other time in the history of modern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People live in fear. Almost two thirds of people are afraid to walk the streets of Dublin, irrespective of the time of day, because of the high levels of violent crime. Unfortunately this fear is shown to be well founded by the information contained in the annual Garda report, which shows how the Government has failed to deliver on its commitment to zero tolerance. When the Minister was in Opposition he proved to be most adept at shouting the odds but he has proved to be a consummate failure and someone who is incapable of producing a positive result &ndash; all mouth and little action. He chooses to ignore the occurrence of assaults, the crimes that get under the skin of the ordinary citizen and undermine people's confi<Col N="879" /> dence in walking their neighbourhoods at night unmolested.</P>
    <P>The Government ignored the 10,400 reported assaults in 2000. That figure reveals a massive increase in the number of assaults causing injury. The elderly lock themselves in their homes each evening and are fearful when they hear unexpected noises. They spend their last days waiting not for the grim reaper but for something more immediate and terrifying. It is the elderly generation which experiences the effect of inept administration by this Government. Violent assaults are running at more than 17,000 per year, with serious offences running at approximately 120 per month as a result of the failure to curtail the illegal drugs trade. Worst of all, six women are raped each week. Six women have their lives shattered each week because the Minister has allowed them to become victims and they must endeavour to reconstruct their lives.</P>
    <P>The public has little or no confidence in the logic of reporting crime to the Garda. Confidence has vanished. Women call to my office and tell me they are concerned for their families and communities. They feel helpless and see no sense in reporting crime. Today a young woman told me her Laser card was stolen and used to take £2,000 from her account just before Christmas. Despite the fact that the thief was filmed on closed-circuit television, the issue was not actively addressed until some 36 days later. This sort of service gives rise to a justifiable loss of confidence in the operational efficiency of the Garda.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government regarding the establishment of a community warden to be utilised as a back-up for the Garda, as I proposed this measure here some 16 years ago. However, I object to its being implemented as a three year pilot scheme. We in the greater Dublin area need this additional presence now. The Garda operational division should be restructured to fit the pattern of the local authority profile so a true working relationship may be developed between the Garda and other community-based services. My constituency is ripe to be a pilot zone to test the effectiveness of the proposed operation. The great guardian of justice has presided over a near 20% increase in the crime affecting business and we are all aware that the streets are not safe. The Government's failure has caused some 5,000 people to require an overnight stay in hospitals because of injuries sustained during violent attacks in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>This House is brought into disrepute by the consummate failure of this Government which, while in Opposition, bragged it had all the solutions. However, on traversing the floor of the Chamber it has seemingly lost its direction and ability to determine the way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important debate. The motion is about the need for ordinary citizens to feel safe while going about their daily lives. Many <Col N="880" /> Irish people are living in fear of violent attacks both on the streets and in their homes.</P>
      <P>The recently published annual Garda report highlights the fact that there is an alarming increase in crime, especially in attacks causing serious bodily harm. There is fear on the streets and people are afraid in their own homes. No bluff or bluster from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform can disguise this. The Garda report for the year 2000 shows that there was an increase of 131% in attacks causing bodily harm, with a jump from 737 attacks in 1999 to 1,703 in 2000. This is a major indictment of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue. The number of manslaughter cases, showing a 50% increase and jumping from nine to 17, is another worrying trend. These statistics and the breakdown of Garda figures from all over the country indicate the need for a major effort on the part of the Minister. This increase of 131% should cause any self-respecting Minister for Justice to go to Cabinet with proposals to reduce the level of crime but the Minister has not done so.</P>
      <P>This month a Chinese student, Zhao Liu Tao, was murdered in Beaumont. The Garda have confirmed that the attack was sparked by racism. The Minister is aware of that. He is also aware that a French woman of Moroccan heritage was left unable to bear children after an attack. There has been an enormous level of increase in attacks on people here. Members should show some leadership and try to ensure that racism does not raise its head.</P>
      <P>In 1999 the then chairman of the Eastern Health Board, Deputy Ivor Callelly, said that we needed to get tough on asylum seekers and throw out illegal immigrants. He said, &ldquo;I am concerned about a block of people coming to Ireland to cash in on the benefits asylum seekers are able to claim.&rdquo; He went on to say that to misspend money on people who had no right to come and claim asylum in Ireland was wrong. Deputy Noel Ahern also said at the time, &ldquo;There is a concern, rightly or wrongly, amongst people who feel threatened by them and who feel they are in competition with them for housing and jobs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The attack made by Deputy Noel O'Flynn is outrageous and it bears the hallmark of the comments made by the late Enoch Powell, a former member of the House of Commons. He repeated those comments here this morning despite the Taoiseach having said, &ldquo;Needless to say, I reject those comments and since he is a member of my party I have already made that clear.&rdquo; Yet the Deputy came in here a few minutes ago and repeated the same comments. It appears there is a concerted policy in Fianna Fáil to give free rein to backbenchers to say what they like and play whatever card they like. It appears that the racial card is being played and I regret having to say that in the House. It is alarming. The Taoiseach is distancing himself from it and just stands back and says that he regrets the comments.</P>

      <P>I found the Minister's speech yesterday depressing. It was the usual mish mash of self-congratulatory back slapping that the Minister feels a need to engage in, presumably because if he does not slap himself on the back very few people bother to do so when he steps outside the House.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil came into office using the mantra of zero tolerance. We know that has meant an unprecedented escalation in street violence. People no longer feel safe in their neighbourhoods at night or in our towns and cities and far too many of our young people have been the victims of an attack. Elderly people no longer feel safe in their homes at night. The Minister has just sat back and congratulated himself on everything he has been doing and done absolutely nothing to prevent the escalation of street violence which has occurred. He tells us now, some two and a half months before a general election, that he has a Bill and he is going to produce some sort of measure dealing with public order, offences and assaults. Is it not extraordinary that the Minister has watched the growth of violence in our streets over four and a half years and in the dying days of his term of office some new unspecified legislation is to be published? Nobody will take that seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of this issue we have had, in one aspect of the difficulties now being experienced in the State, an eloquent example from Deputy O'Flynn this morning of the worst possible face of Fianna Fáil. The Taoiseach presents the respectable face of Fianna Fáil and will continue to do so while all of his backbenchers and those around him seek to exploit people's <Col N="882" /> fears. They play the racial card for electoral purposes and make inflammatory speeches and use language which instigates the type of appalling incidents we have seen on the streets.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Flynn made a speech this morning which went further than the disgraceful remarks reported in last weekend's papers which I referred to last night and which were referred to this morning by Deputy Quinn. The Taoiseach said this morning, &ldquo;Needless to say, I reject those comments and since he is a member of my party I have already made that clear.&rdquo; When did he do so? Was Deputy O'Flynn listening? When Deputy O'Flynn made what I would describe as the most disgraceful racist speech I have heard in my 21 years of membership of this House, what notice was he taking of the Taoiseach's comment? Will the Taoiseach call Deputy O'Flynn into his office and remonstrate with him or is the Taoiseach happy that Deputies O'Flynn and Callely and his own brother, Deputy Noel Ahern, make the type of speeches to which my colleague Deputy Enright referred? Is he happy an impression is created which results in further violence on our streets, with people picked out for no reason other than their ethnic origin or the colour of their skin? Is the Taoiseach now trying to follow the example of Prime Minister Howard in Australia and run the type of political campaign that produces the consequences that we have seen in Australia in recent days? Is that the Taoiseach's ploy in this election? Is this the scheme of things that is being prescribed for the backbench members of the Fianna Fáil Party and for the Fianna Fáil candidates around the country?</P>
      <P>I do not believe that if the Minister, Deputy Ryan, was here this morning he would have tolerated the comments made by Deputy O'Flynn. I caution the Minister not to make comments and interrupt me in a manner that might be misinterpreted. I will conclude by inviting the Taoiseach to come back into the House today to disown the comments made by Deputy O'Flynn. If he does not do so&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Bill 2001  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will be aware of the Corrib partner's plans to land gas from the Corrib field located off the Mayo coast. This gas is expected to come to market in the latter part of 2003 and further pipeline construction work is to be undertaken by BGE on a Mayo-Galway pipeline to allow for its delivery into the national gas grid. Corrib gas, as an alternative source of gas, will play an important role in increasing consumer choice.</P>
      <P>Completion of all pipeline projects is subject to the relevant company meeting all necessary statutory requirements. The position with the three projects mentioned is that BGE has obtained ministerial consent for the construction of the second interconnector and the ringmain pipelines. The company's application for consent to construct the Mayo-Galway pipeline is currently under consideration within my Department and I expect to be in a position to make a final decision on this issue in the very near future.</P>
      <P>In addition to the three projects I mentioned, I take this opportunity to update Deputies on the proposed extension of the gas network to the north-west and on the developments proposed for the Northern Ireland network. Deputies will be aware of the Government's decision last year that the natural gas network should be extended to the north-west. An initial analysis by BGE on the route options for this network extension concluded that none of the possible options would be commercial in its own right and that substantial grant aid would be necessary to bring the projects to fruition. In light of this the Government decided that detailed costing should be obtained for an extension of the gas transmission system to Sligo via Ballina from BGE's proposed Mayo-Galway pipeline and to Letterkenny from the proposed Belfast-Derry pipeline.</P>
      <P>The provision of such grant aid raises issues relating to EU state said and procurement rules. My Department has been in touch with Commission officials on this matter. The next step in moving the projects forward involves carrying out detailed engineering and planning work to establish a firm estimate of the capital costs for the Government to be in a position to make a decision on grant aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to get the necessary detailed information to enable a final decision to be taken by the Government on these projects. I understand the concerns expressed to me on many occasions by Deputies and local representatives in the areas in question that these projects be placed on a firm footing. However, given that there are competition and state aid issues involved, it is essential to ensure at the outset that the approach taken to the next stage of the pro<Col N="888" /> ject does not create difficulties which might result in the project being delayed at a later stage. I have, therefore, sought the advice of the Attorney General on the best approach to be taken. Once there is clarity on the best approach to adopt, I will move swiftly to get the detailed planning of the project under way.</P>
    <P>In regard to proposed developments in the Northern Ireland network, BGE and Questar, an American pipeline company, had applied to the Northern Ireland regulator, the OFREG, to build two pipelines, one linking Belfast to Derry that would supply the planned new Coolkeeragh power station and the city of Derry and the other comprising a South-North interconnector from Gormanston to Antrim to tie into the proposed Belfast to Derry line. While Questar decided at the end of last year to withdraw from the partnership for internal commercial reasons, BGE has confirmed its commitment to continue with the development of these projects. In recognition of the wider benefits of cross-Border links, the Government supports these pipeline proposals and has decided to make a &euro;12.7 million grant available toward the development of the Northern Ireland gas network.</P>
    <P>Taking these infrastructure projects together, it is estimated that the number of households with access to gas will rise from 500,000 to more than 750,000 by 2010. In addition, countless small businesses, shops, pubs and so forth not currently connected will have access to gas. Given the present infrastructure developments and my proposals for full competition in the market, it is now timely to provide for independent regulation of the gas sector.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an interim measure that uses the existing regulatory frameworks set out in the Gas Act, 1976, the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1987 and the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, to create a coherent framework for the independent regulation of the electricity and gas sectors. Using these existing frameworks, approved by the Oireachtas, has certainly facilitated the creation of the over arching framework. As Deputies will appreciate from reading the Bill, ensuring this coherence as an end result has, however, been a complex task.</P>
    <P>I will now give Deputies an overview of the structure and main provisions of the Bill. The Commission for Electricity Regulation was established by way of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. The main provisions that link into the 1999 Act comprise section 6, which sets out the duties of the commission, section 13, which deals with licensing, section 15 regarding authorised officers and section 18 on the funding of the commission. There are also links with section 16 dealing with gas capacity statements and section 19, which provides for a number of miscellaneous amendments.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes extending the remit of the commission so that it encompasses responsibility for the regulation of the natural gas sector. This adaptation will include changing its name to the <Col N="889" /> Commission for Energy Regulation. There are a number of reasons for choosing the commission. First, there are similarities between the electricity and natural gas sectors. The two industries are in direct competition with each other in the domestic market through the supply of alternative means for cooking and heating and in the UK, for example, many of the regional electricity companies are now involved in the gas market with their own gas supply arms.</P>
    <P>There are also commonalties between these sectors in regard to regulatory activities such as price setting and monitoring quality of service. Furthermore, there is an increasing dependency on natural gas by electricity generators. Regulation of both markets by the commission will mean there is one body with an oversight role in ensuring that there is sufficient gas capacity to meet the demand of the electricity market. The fact that the CER is already functioning effectively as regulator will assist in the speedy implementation of independent regulation in the natural gas sector.</P>
    <P>The use of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, also means that other more important issues, such as the accountability of the regulator, have been dealt with in a manner already approved of by the Oireachtas. The commission has obligations to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Minister in regard to its accounts. It is also required to account for the performance of its functions to the appropriate joint committee of the Oireachtas whenever so requested by the committee. These obligations ensure accountability and they will continue to apply to the commission in its extended role.</P>
    <P>The Gas Act, 1976, established Bord Gáis Éireann as the State owned monopoly operator of the natural gas transmission system. The 1976 Act has undergone a number of amendments in relation to the provision of pipelines and third party access rights. The Bill updates these provisions in the light of the proposed transfer of functions to the commission and as a result of the proposed increase in the level of market opening. The relevant provisions in the Bill linked to the 1976 Act comprise section 8, in regard to the functions of the board, section 9, in regard to consents for the construction of pipelines, section 11, on third party access arrangements, and section 12, dealing with ministerial shareholder functions. As in the case of the 1999 Act, there are also a number of consequential amendments to the 1976 Act set out in section 19 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Gas (Amendment) Act, 1987, was enacted as a consequence of the demise of the old town gas companies and gave the power to the Minister to confer town gas functions on Bord Gáis Éireann by order under section 2 of the Act. This allowed BGE, which had formerly been only engaged in gas transmission activities, to take over the town gas operations in areas such as Clonmel, Cork and Dublin and to avoid any disruption for the thousands of town gas customers that may otherwise have arisen. As a result of <Col N="890" /> amendments tabled by me and accepted by the Seanad, the Bill now provides, in section 19, for the transfer of the Minister's powers under section 2 of the 1987 Act to the commission and for the possibility of having other undertakings, in addition to BGE, operating as town gas companies.</P>
    <P>My decision to provide for competition in the area of town gas distribution is based on a number of reasons. First, the extension of the natural gas network being undertaken by BGE will bring gas to many areas of population not previously supplied. This development presents an important opportunity for the introduction of competition into this area of the market and, by presenting opportunities to new market entrants, will act as a spur for the growth of competition throughout the gas market. Second, my decision to reduce the third party access eligibility threshold to zero by 2005 to allow for full competition requires that a mechanism be put in place for the commission to effectively regulate the domestic supply market. The framework established under the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1987, provides an effective solution for this.</P>
    <P>Combining the existing frameworks contained in the 1976, 1987 and 1999 Acts through the proposals in this Bill has been a complex and painstaking task but one that will result in the provision of a coherent and effective framework within which the commission can carry out its duties for both the gas and electricity sectors. In preparing the Bill, my officials have consulted the main players and interest groups in the gas industry as well as with other relevant Departments and agencies. Where possible, the concerns expressed by the relevant parties have been taken on board during the drafting process.</P>
    <P>I have maintained an open door policy in regard to consultation on the Bill and I have received some useful suggestions for amendments to the text. As a consequence, I will put forward a number of amendments on Committee Stage that have resulted from this process. One of the most notable of these will be a proposal to insert a new section to deal with third party access to upstream pipelines, which link production platforms in gas fields to onshore terminals and are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. The amendment, which is being put forward at the request of the Minister, ensures that Ireland's EU obligations in this area are fully complied with.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that the Bill is an interim measure. While it establishes the basic principles and methodologies governing the regulation of the gas sector, further work will remain to be done in this area, work that could not have been carried out at this stage given the short timeframe within which the Bill is required. I advise Members, therefore, that I propose to initiate a comprehensive review of gas sector regulation immediately upon enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The aim of the review is the development of a modern regulatory regime appropriate to a multi-<Col N="891" /> operator environment in which full competition is the order of the day. As part of the review, I will undertake a wide consultation process with interested parties. While it is too early to identify the specific issues to be addressed in the review, I can confirm that it will include an examination of issues resulting from the ongoing work in the EU on the revision of the current gas directive. It is also my intention that a thorough consolidation and repeal of the Victorian and early 20th century gas legislation that remains on our Statute Book will be undertaken as part of this work. This will provide much needed clarity for market players and customers alike.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline some of the more important provisions in the Bill. Sections 6 and 7 and the Schedule provide for the transfer of functions from the Minister to the CER, as well as expanding the current duties of the CER in light of its role in regard to the natural gas sector. These duties include advising the Minister on the gas industry, promoting competition in gas supply and protecting the interests of final customers. The Schedule identifies a number of the functions to be transferred to the CER from the Minister in the Gas Act, 1976, in relation to the construction of gas pipelines and in the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1987, in relation to town gas distribution.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 9 amend the existing provisions in the Gas Act, 1976, dealing with pipeline consents. A new section is to be inserted in the 1976 Act so that BGE and all other prospective builders of pipelines will in future make their applications for consent to build pipelines under this one section. There is also a separate provision dealing with consents for construction of upstream pipelines, which are the responsibility of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. In addition, the section gives a new power to the commission, where it considers necessary, or where directed by the Minister, to conduct a competitive process for granting consent for the building of a particular pipeline in a specific area.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with third party access rights and provides for increased market opening by reducing the threshold above which consumers can source their own gas. It is my intention that full market opening be introduced by 2005, and this provision allows for this to be done by way of statutory instrument. Section 13 provides for a licensing framework covering operators engaged in the supply of natural gas, the operation of distribution or transmission pipelines and the storage of natural gas. No such framework has existed until now.</P>
    <P>Section 14 requires gas undertakings to keep separate accounts for their different gas activities such as supply and transmission and, where appropriate, consolidated accounts for other non-gas activities. This is to avoid discrimination, cross-subsidisation and distortion of competition and is based on the provisions of the current EU <Col N="892" /> gas directive. Section 17 provides that the Minister may impose public service obligations or PSOs on natural gas undertakings, for instance, in regard to security of supply, technical safety or environmental protection. This section specifically excludes using PSOs for non-commercial extensions of the natural gas network.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides for a number of miscellaneous amendments, mainly to the Gas Act, 1976. The section also includes an amendment to the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1987, designed to allow persons, in addition to BGE, to become town gas distribution system operators.</P>
    <P>The Bill's provisions provide a sound mechanism for establishing, within the shortest timeframe, independent regulation of the natural gas market. Additional legislation will be needed to provide a regulatory regime compatible with the fully competitive multi-operator gas market envisaged after 2005. For the present, however, this Bill is a significant step forward in achieving this goal. I look forward to hearing the views of colleagues on this important legislation. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>
        <i> (Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>I welcome the Bill and hope it will have a speedy passage through the House. The principle of independent regulation of the telecommunications, electricity, gas and aviation markets is a good one. The incompatibility of the role of the Minister for Public Enterprise as the main shareholder in Eircom, before its privatisation, the ESB, Bord Gáis and Aer Rianta and the Department's role as the market regulator is obvious. Despite the best intentions in the world, there must be a conflict, but the good work done by the relevant section in the Department up to now must be acknowledged. One could be forgiven for believing that there is a perceived conflict when it comes to the deregulation and opening up of markets and awarding of licences in the various sectors.</P>
      <P>Apart from the need for an independent agency to oversee the opening of the markets and to set fair market prices, the expectation was that the new regulators, in their respective roles, would drive the various markets for the overall benefit of the country and the consumer, but, alas, this has not happened and at best one can only concede that deregulation in both the telecommunications and electricity sectors has been a limited success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deregulation is limping along in the telecommunications sector. Instead of creating the necessary competition that would expand the market and reduce access costs, our charges are among the highest in Europe. I am an Internet user and I pay exorbitant fees for a service that is available throughout most of the developed world and the semi-developed world for a fraction of the cost in Ireland. The problem is that we pay by the minute &ndash; 5 cent a minute approximately during the day and 1 cent a minute during evenings and weekends &ndash; whereas in most other countries one <Col N="893" /> pays a fee per month regardless of the connection time. This is known as flat rate access.</P>
    <P>When one examines the figures, there is a stark comparison. For example, in Finland the monthly flat rate is &euro;45 while the average cost in America is &euro;35. The monthly flat rate in the UK is &euro;33 while it is &euro;35 in Poland whereas if I were to pay for continuous access for one month to the Internet it would cost me &euro;1,328. These figures demonstrate clearly that Ireland's competitiveness is being undermined by high Internet charges. Every Department and office uses the Internet and they are becoming more reliant on it for information and e-mail access. This is an obvious area where the telecommunications regulator should be able to apply pressure on the organisations which control these costs and supply these services to introduce a regime similar to that which applies in other countries, but this has not happened.</P>
    <P>In the mobile phone sector, there are three main providers: Eircell, Esat Digifone and Meteor. The charges are prohibitive in comparison with other countries. While each company vigorously advertises its various rates for weekends and off-peak periods, giving the impression there is real competition in the marketplace, despite the varying rates and charges there is little difference and little benefit accrues to the consumer.</P>
    <P>An area crying out for regulation and for co-ordination between the various member states is roaming charges for the use of mobile phones outside the country. Holidaymakers and business people are repeatedly ripped off. A person who calls another person from a phone in Ireland pays the cost of the Irish bill, while the holidaymaker or businessperson abroad receiving the call is charged for availing of the facility of receiving the call through the network of a host country. If there is no charge for fixed line arrangements, why should there be a difference for the mobile phone sector? Surely this is a glaring issue which could and should have been tackled by mutual co-operation between the telecommunications regulators and companies in the different member states. It would be to the obvious advantage of consumers, yet it has not happened. Why not?</P>
    <P>The unbundling of the local loop, the opening to competing companies of the last mile of copper wire owned and controlled by Eircom, is necessary before competitors can arrange or offer meaningful voice and Internet alternatives. It should have happened last January. A year later, there is not a single unbundled local loop. The net result is that several telecommunications companies who were to provide competition and services have withdrawn from the market.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be too critical of the regulator. She has a difficult job. Tackling monopolies which have had it all their own way can be a formidable challenge. Monopolies will fight back and one must recognise that right to do so to preserve products and monopolies. They will do everything to protect their dominant position. <Col N="894" /> This has been the experience in the telecommunications, electricity and aviation sectors. Although the Bill is welcome, the fear is that exactly the same experience will be replicated in the gas sector.</P>
    <P>We saw what happened when the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation produced the schedule of interim prices for the unbundled local loop sector. It proposed line rental of &euro;13.53 a month in addition to a once-off connection fee of &euro;119.73. These were reasonable charges pitched in the middle range of charges throughout the EU. However, they were less than the figures sought by Eircom, which immediately slapped a lawsuit on the regulator questioning her powers to impose such charges. Eircom has had a tendency in both public and private ownership to run to the courts as soon as an attempt is made to move into its territory.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise stands indicted for her failure to bring forward the long-awaited communications (regulation) Bill to enhance the ODTR powers in order that real and substantial progress can be made rather than merely chipping away at the monopoly edifice. The Bill was on the list of proposed legislation circulated by the Government Chief Whip this week. It is urgently needed to revamp, re-organise and reconstitute the ODTR. With 38 pieces of legislation going through the House and bearing in mind the parliamentary calendar, the reality is that the Bill will not see the light of day during the term of office of the Government. If it sees its way to bringing forward the legislation, we will not have any problem in facilitating its passage through the House. It is urgently needed but, in terms of processing legislation in the House and given the wish list prepared the other day, I do not see it being dealt with. Deputy Flanagan and I met deputations from several different companies pleading for the front loading of this legislation to enhance the role of the regulator and give her the powers she does not have and to prevent her decisions being challenged in the courts.</P>
    <P>The regulator's and Government's performances in the area of third generation or 3G mobile phone licences have been the subject of critical scrutiny. Other EU countries have had their 3G operations in place for several years.</P>

        <b>: </b>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be glad to hear we will have great gas soon.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer in passing to the area of 3G licences because it is very important and has come in for a great deal of criticism. Other EU countries have had their 3G operations up and running for several years, yet it is only in recent weeks agreement has finally been reached between the regulator and the Minister for Public Enterprise on the price of 3G licences. We are second from bottom in the European league of those who have introduced the new service, as a result of which we are forced to run fast to stay still. Everyone knows the telecommunications market is a fast-moving and competitive one. We are still in the process of awarding licences to 3G operators when other countries and companies are discussing 5G licences.</P>
      <P>There was a great deal of talk, hope, aspiration and expectation that we would make ourselves the e-commerce capital of the world. Unless we move quickly to award licences and provide real competition, we will lose our position in the marketplace. I welcome the concept of the e-commerce hub, the digital hub and such developments, but unless the process can be speeded up, we will slip quickly down the league table. Regulation is not delivering what it is supposed to have delivered. I subscribe fully to the reservations of the alternative licensed telecommunications operators and their frustrations.</P>
      <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be glad to hear I will now address the Bill. The legislation is designed to open up the gas sector, allow new entrants to the market, enable greater competition and provide cheaper prices to the consumer. The Commission for Electricity Regulation is being re-titled the Commission for Energy Regulation. Re-titling the office will not do the business. The regulator will have powers similar to those vested in him by the Electricity Regulation Act. Despite the intent of that legislation, matters have been far from satisfactory in that sector. The fair and competitive market promised has not been delivered. There was a queue of entrants to the market to avail of new commercial opportunities and provide real competition, yet they have walked away in sheer frustration. At least 15 have done so to date. Many of them had elaborate submissions and plans which cost millions of euro to prepare and which ended up being consigned to the dustbin.</P>
      <P>E-power is one example. It ceased trading having incurred losses of &euro;6 million during its 18 month existence. The chairman of the company gave the reason for pulling out as: &ldquo;The regulator does not have sufficient powers to ensure proper competition.&rdquo; This is the same regulator we will have in the gas sector. Have we any reason to believe the same will not happen in the opening up and regulation of the gas industry, something which is the purpose of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Have things changed since the electricity regulator, Mr. Tom Reeves, wrote to the Minister for <Col N="896" /> Public Enterprise in July 2000 and stated, &ldquo;The reality is that potential new entrants struggled to develop bankable projects while those independent suppliers already in the market find it very difficult to operate on a financially viable basis.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Despite the best will and powers of the regulator the ESB still rules OK. It dominates the generating sector. Viridian Power and Energy, for example, is using natural gas and has a power station on the brink of commissioning. Viridian has encountered huge obstacles, particularly with regard to regulation 31 of the Electricity Act, 1999, which provides that for a transitional period ending in 2005 the ESB need not purchase any electricity from independent suppliers, regardless of the price or environmental benefits, unless or until it has exhausted all its own capabilities to produce power. When put together with the fact that the ESB's final tariff prices, especially in the sector in which Viridian is free to compete, are significantly below cost, this presents a real obstacle and difficulty for Viridian. In effect, Viridian has nowhere to sell electricity, unless it is prepared to sustain substantial losses. This is the reality which has deterred all others from entering the generation market. While this situation may come to an end after 2005 the economy cannot withstand a protracted lack of investment in this all-important sector for any length of time. This is the only independent IPP generation project currently under construction in Ireland and it is encountering obstacle after obstacle. A company which would bring to the market an urgently needed 346 megawatts of electricity is encountering cost obstacles and frustrations.</P>
    <P>I do not mind the ESB protecting its market monopoly and dominant position. However, it is the duty of the regulator to try to level the playing field to induce competitors to come into the market. As well as having a huge monopoly in the generating sector the ESB also owns the network but EirGrid controls the flow of power through it, to ensure fair competition to independent producers of electricity. Now the electricity regulator, Mr. Reeves, has taken High Court action to enforce a direction on EirGrid. EirGrid directors maintain that they cannot fulfil their statutory remit without control over detailed planning and the problem for Mr. Reeves is that EirGrid's stance has been supported by the Competition Authority.</P>
    <P>Based, therefore, on the experience of the regulators for the telecoms and electricity sectors one is forced to ask if we can expect the same degree of resistance and challenge when this Bill is enacted? Will the gas regulator, Mr. Reeves, be hauled before the courts time and again? Is the Bill strong enough to enable him to deliver on his remit?</P>
    <P>The confirmation that testing by Enterprise Oil of its Corrib gas find off County Mayo was greeted with considerable jubilation. The Minister of State has referred to it today. From a national perspective the timing could not have been better, in view of the imminent expiration <Col N="897" /> of the gas field off the Old Head of Kinsale. The Kinsale field has produced 1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas and has accounted for 20% of the country's energy needs. This amounted to cumulative savings of more than £3 billion. In the west of Ireland &ndash; and particularly in job-starved County Mayo &ndash; there was tremendous excitement and anticipation. The expectation is that gas will be in the pipeline by 2003, that is, if we can deal with the objectors. The objectors are concentrated in my constituency but I do not subscribe to their objections or support them. They are a small coterie and are not representative of the general population.</P>
    <P>Despite the excitement and anticipation there has not been a syllable of commitment from the Government regarding the use of the gas for the economic benefit of the western region, which has been bled white for generations by emigration, is currently being bled white by internal migration and is totally neglected with regard to Government channelled industrial jobs. There are no plans for industrial parks or estates, no attempt to develop a cohesive blueprint to address the imbalance and job deficit which has always prevailed and has been the scourge of the region and no proposal to build a Government encouraged gas fired power station to compensate for the forced closure of Belacorrig peat station with the loss of 400 related jobs in Bord na Móna and the ESB. The pipeline passes within a stone's throw of Belacorrig. There is no design to work with the Western Development Commission in order to maximise the benefit of the gas find for the region. The gas will simply be brought ashore, put into the pipeline and fed to Dublin and around the country. The only jobs accruing will be in the laying of the pipeline to Galway. There is no promise of further jobs on the horizon or even a pretence of creating jobs. The pipeline is not being seen as a dynamic for the industrial development of the west. There will be a small number of jobs at the gas head where it comes ashore in county Mayo but that is all.</P>
    <P>There was an expectation that spur lines from the main Mayo and Galway pipelines would supply such towns as Claremorris, Castlebar, Westport, Athenry and Tuam. However, despite the assurances given a number of weeks ago by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, the only definitive statement on the issue has come from the public relations manager of Bord Gáis, Miriam Farrelly. The Minister of State repeated today what he said in the Seanad, that the pipeline will go to Sligo <i>via </i>Ballina &ndash; presumably Ballina will benefit &ndash; and from there to Letterkenny. However, the only definitive statement relating to the status of the promise made to the towns I have mentioned comes from Miriam Farrelly. She is quite emphatic that no commitment has been given, merely that an evaluation of these towns is being carried out. Apart from an indication that the pipeline would be extended to Sligo, Ballina and Letterkenny, no definitive political commitment has been given. Is the Mini<Col N="898" /> ster of State prepared to state clearly that the five towns I have mentioned, as well as some other towns in the immediate vicinity of the pipeline, will be connected to the supply. The Minister of State has already spoken about the public service obligation. If a public service obligation is contained in the Bill, why not bring it into being in order to facilitate the provision of spur lines to supply these towns. Is it the Government's intention to have these towns included? Is there a firm commitment on the part of the Government to deliver gas to these towns? There is a great degree of expectation in the west and this Bill will be a contentious political issue in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>Section 6 assigns to the commission responsibility for the promotion of safety and efficiency on the part of electricity and natural gas undertakings. How far does this responsibility or power extend? The electricity industry is extremely loose and unregulated. One must give credit to RECI for the manner in which it and its sister organisation have policed their own 2,000 members. The problem, however, is that the whole issue of regulation of electrical contractors is entirely voluntary and in urgent need of proper regulation. Between 1998 and 1999, 76 people were killed in Ireland as a result of accidents attributed to electricity. In 1998 almost 5% of all fires were attributed to electrical causes, that is more than 1,265 fires in Irish homes and businesses. For too long this whole issue has been passed from the Health and Safety Authority, which says it is not its business because its job is accidents in the workplace, to the Department of Public Enterprise and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Will the Minister of State clarify how far the safety remit of the Commission for Energy Regulation will extend under the particular section of the legislation?</P>
    <P>Section 6(<i>c</i>)(ii)(<i>h</i>) obliges the commission to secure the continuity, security and quality of supplies of natural gas. Will the Minister of State clarify the issue of continuity of supply? For example, does this extend to the area of exploration, including the granting of exploration licences and the terms under which such licences can be granted? I am extremely disappointed &ndash; I believe my view will be shared by many people &ndash; at the terms negotiated with the oil and gas companies in 1992 whereby the State ended up with the worst possible tax deal, that is, a 25% tax rate which can be written off against costs, abolition of all royalties and other protection levies and the freedom not to avail of Irish labour, goods, supplies and services.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the transfer of functions from the Minister to the commission. Subsection (4) reads: &ldquo;Where, immediately before the appointed day, any legal proceedings are pending to which the Minister is the plaintiff or the prosecutor and the proceedings have reference to functions transferred by this section to the Commission, the name of the Commission shall, in so far as the proceedings relate to any functions <Col N="899" /> transferred by this section, be substituted in those proceedings for that of the Minister, or added in those proceedings as may be appropriate, and those proceedings shall not abate by reason of such substitution.&rdquo; Under the section the role of the Minister is transferred to the commission where it reads, &ldquo;Where, immediately before the appointed day, any legal proceedings are pending to which the Minister is the plaintiff or the prosecutor&rdquo;. In other words, that particular role will now be assigned to the commission. Subsection (5) reads: &ldquo;Where, immediately before the appointed day, any legal proceedings are pending to which the Minister is a defendant and the proceedings have reference to any functions transferred to the Commission by this section, the Commission shall not be substituted for the Minister in those proceedings notwithstanding the transfer of functions under this Act.&rdquo; In other words, the commission shall not be substituted. Does that mean the liability remains with the Minister?</P>
    <P>I welcome this very comprehensive and detailed Bill and my party will certainly assist its passage through the House. We have not even touched on many of the issues such as natural gas, licensing, funding of accounts and so on. However, I look forward to a constructive debate on Committee Stage. My party will table amendments with a view to improving what is essentially a good Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not welcome the Bill. It is a temporary measure which is unnecessary. I am not sure why after a five year period in Government this temporary measure is being introduced in the dying days of this Dáil. I will outline my reasons for not welcoming the Bill.</P>
      <P>Essentially we are talking about the old chestnut of whether it is better for the State to have regulation or ownership in the commercial semi-State sector. I argued that regulation is more important from the strategic and public interest point of view than the actual ownership of companies, but that did not find favour in my party &ndash; perhaps I did not explain it well enough. What we are now doing is removing regulation from the democratically controlled sector and following that up in most cases with the dispersal of ownership from the public area. Therefore, we will have the worst of both worlds. If we were to deal with the ownership question first, the regulation could be retained within the State without let or hindrance. The only reason the regulation is being removed from the Minister of State's remit is that he is technically the owner and, therefore, a player in the market, and he should not regulate his own company in competition with others. If the Government and the thinkers in the Department were really honest they would tell us what is their agenda. By first hiving off the regulation they are removing both the regulation and the ownership from the public area, which is a very serious matter for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="900" />I am also concerned about our representative democracy and the accountability of the people we will appoint. I am concerned that we are going headlong after this type of structure, arising from a decision made at one time which gave rise to the Maastricht Treaty and which set up the market as the god. At that time 15 of the 18 countries in Europe had right wing Governments, led mainly by Margaret Thatcher, who drew up an anti-public enterprise treaty. Since then the Government structures in Europe have changed dramatically but they seem to be stuck with this decision. I have spoken to people on the Government side who are unhappy about this transfer of power and responsibility from the democratically accountable sector, namely, this House which represents the people, to the private sector and very regularly outside the country altogether.</P>
    <P>We are talking about control of our destiny and we now have some experience of the effect of that. We appointed a regulator for Telecom and then sold the Telecom company to anyone who would buy it. A carpetbagger who got one lump of it pretended he was a tax exile in Spain for a period so that he would not have to pay his due taxes in Ireland amounting to £50 million. He then had the cheek to turn around and make a public statement saying he would raise some money for charity in Ireland. If that particular carpetbagger paid his taxes he would not have to raise money for charity because the State would have the money to do the job. These people, including those in boardrooms in Sweden, Germany, Japan and London, own and control our total telecommunications sector. The Minister and the Minister of State have no say in the sector. The result is the picture painted by Deputy Higgins whereby the regulator cannot get any of the companies to do the job the Government wants done in this country, which is to provide infrastructure outside the highly populated areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now the regulator of this sector. As the junior Minister in that sector, when I introduced the first area of competition in the 1995 Bill I retained very deliberately the regulation in the Minister's office. I recall having a great debate with officials whose agenda was somewhat upset by the retention at that time. I believe that the senior officials in our Departments are a form of permanent government with their own agenda, and it takes really strong political action to thwart that agenda. Although I have the highest respect for the people concerned, as well as for their diligence and everything else about them that is positive, they have their own agenda. As public representatives we should be aware of that reality and should take it into account.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also the owner of Bord Gáis and, hence, the argument for the need for what is called an independent regulator, but of whom is this regulator supposed to be independent? I presume he or she will be independent of the representative of the people, who is the Minister. I also presume the reason for that is that techni<Col N="901" /> cally the Minister, on behalf of the people, holds shares in the State company. If the regulator is independent of the Minister, he or she is not accountable either to the Minister or to the House. I will demonstrate why that is the case in more detail later.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that he is further opening up the area to competition and I have no difficulty with that. He has set an objective date for the full opening of the market and I have no difficulty with that either, but there will be problems. Commercial problems will arise for existing companies from the full opening of the market and, therefore, much thought needs to go into this matter. The Government and the Department will have the benefit of the experience of what happened in other countries when full opening occurred.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that Europe is not forcing us to open up the gas market and, thus, we are ahead of the EU in this regard. Due to the lack of examination of the experience we now have from our own regulators in other areas, the possible after effects have not been examined in this case. It is premature to go ahead with this measure, given that the Minister has told us that immediately this temporary measure is passed he will undertake a major review of the regulation area. I urge the Minister, however, not to confine his review to the gas sector. He should ensure that the whole spectrum of regulation, right across the areas within his Department's ambit, is included in the review. A single sector review will not do the job because what needs to be examined are the principle and desirability of this form of regulation.</P>
    <P>While gas is not in competition with other players in the gas market, it is in direct competition with other fuels. The competition that is now being promised will not necessarily provide lower prices for customers. The only previous example of competition affecting prices in the energy sector was the case of the ESB, where prices increased dramatically to make it profitable for the private sector to move in and make a killing. That is the only effect we have seen on prices arising from competition in the energy sector. The regulator was handed the power to do that, without any further reference to this House. In addition, because he had a brief to encourage competition he increased the prices payable by every household in the country and by industrial users as well. Amazingly, to encourage competition the Minister appointed an independent regulator who increased prices. Nobody has ever given me an explanation as to why that was positive or desirable.</P>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister dealt with gas infrastructure and business, to which I want to refer briefly. The Government deserves criticism about the interconnector which is going ahead now. I am not criticising the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, who, I know, tried to reach agreement on this matter for a long time before it came forward. The delays on the part of the Government, <Col N="902" /> and within the EU, on the final decision on the interconnector means that we are now short of gas. Because of this, power stations that might otherwise have been built have been shelved. There is a real danger that not alone will we be short of gas for direct use, but we will also be short of electricity arising from the long and unnecessary delay.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to security of supply which we need to bear in mind. One of the methods the State has always employed to ensure a secure supply of energy was to make available various types of energy, including oil, coal, turf and gas. There is a real danger now, however, that we will have all our eggs in the gas basket, the vast majority of which will be imported. We will be hugely dependent on imported gas, through two interconnectors, for our energy supplies. As far as the electricity interconnector is concerned, the supply might even come from Sellafield. We do not know yet. When it is up and running, however, we will certainly be more dependent on supplies from external sources. That will not provide us with security of supply and we will be vulnerable to other Governments which, in times of crisis, may break supply agreements with us because they need the energy for themselves. We could also be vulnerable to terrorist attacks on the supply lines. More thought needs to be given to the issue of security of energy supplies here. In that regard, alternative indigenous energy sources should be developed.</P>
    <P>I agree there is a limit to the amount of wind energy that can be put into the system because it is an occasional source of energy that is available for approximately 30% of the time. Therefore, the volume of such energy that can be put into a permanent supply system is limited. I am glad to see, however, that Mr. Eddie O'Connor has bounced back again and is doing the trick off the Minister's coastline. I cannot understand why the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, who is known as the Minister for the west, announced this positive proposal off the Wicklow coast when the Minister of State was sitting, looking out the window of his own house at the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure there was a scéal eile there somewhere. As a Mayo man, I welcome the Corrib well and I strongly support what Deputy Jim Higgins said about the objections to putting in place the required infrastructure. I do not support the objections which are baseless. If we did not have a 1992 exploration deal, which does not seem to give much to Ireland in the form of taxes or royalties, we would not have the Corrib well. Although I did not make the deal when I was a Minister of State in the Department, it was extremely difficult to achieve. I think either the current Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, or the former Deputy and Minister, Mr. Ray Burke, made it. I was convinced by the arguments that <Col N="903" /> we needed a favourable deal to get the exploration companies to come into what, from their point of view, was extremely hostile territory, including difficult waters and short windows of opportunity for exploration. In addition, there was no great knowledge about the prospects and so it was extremely difficult to get them to come in at all. However, because the deal was favourable from their point of view, it attracted them and as a result we now have the Corrib well.</P>
      <P>It would be unbelievable for any Government to bring a pipeline through Mayo and into Sligo without having spurs for the various towns there. I am sure the Opposition and Government representatives in Mayo will make that message clear to the Minister. I am sure also that the Government will be favourably disposed to it. It is time to decide. We should not dally on the decision on the Mayo-Galway line, which is an important part of the infrastructure. We should ensure it is structured in such a way that it can supply those along it.</P>
      <P>The Dublin-Galway-Limerick line was an old hobby horse of mine. If one wanted to get a good example &ndash; I am sure it is not taped but it is probably recorded &ndash; of how officials would fight a Minister when he or she was about to do something with which they did not agree, that would probably be the best example. It took a long time, but eventually I got it to Government and I got a positive decision. However, another loophole was found when it was decided it might need State aid. It was then referred to Europe. It fell to the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, to finalise it when Europe said it did not need any approval for State aid or, if it did, it was approved. I congratulate the Minister of State for finishing that job. The line from Dublin to Galway should be built as quickly as possible. There will be opposition from various people, including those who supply bottled gas along that route and those who supply central heating oil to houses as they will now be in competition with someone else for the first time. However, I am sure the Minister of State will overcome that by demonstrating to the public that it will have a choice of fuel sources and by putting the line in place to ensure that happens.</P>
      <P>From an infrastructural point of view, it is important not to have gas lines running into a cul-de-sac. They should be in circular systems so that if there is a breakdown, the effect can be limited. If grant aid is required for the Ballina and Sligo line and the Letterkenny line, we should go after the State aid agreement as hard as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the accountability of the regulator, the Minister of State said he will have to come before the appropriate joint committee. I want the Minister of State to seriously consider that. The appropriate joint committee is the Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport which would be capable of talking to the regulator twice a year or once a year if it is busy. However, that is not accountability. We need a specialist com<Col N="904" /> mittee of the House, which will be resourced with expertise, to deal with regulators to ensure they cannot dance rings around politicians and public representatives who will not have the resources to deal with them effectively. That is dealt with by the Department at present and we can question the Minister on a daily basis. We need a specialist committee with specialist back-up, research and direct advice to ensure that the regulators are accountable to the democratic assembly. The present system does not work because I and other members of the committee do not have the resources to make it work. It is important to do that.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Mr. Tom Reeves, who is and will be the electricity regulator, will be the most powerful man in Ireland once the Bill is passed. He is a public servant of the highest renown. He has achieved a high level of public service and his integrity is beyond question. I know him well as I have worked with him. He saw himself as an essential public servant both before and after he was appointed regulator. He wants to serve the public. However, that does not take away from the reality that his office will be extremely powerful and totally independent. The system of making him accountable is not capable of doing that. We need to change that system.</P>
    <P>The first step in privatisation is to hive off the regulation from the Minister's office. However, there is no need for privatisation as we could keep the regulation in the Minister's office. The problem of accountability would then not arise because the Minister would be the person accountable to the House. If we are to sell Bord Gáis and its assets, we should do so and keep the regulation. However, we should not get rid of both because we will lose the totality of the power the people have through the Chamber. There is a long standing agenda in the Department, which has the various steps and stages well laid out and choreographed, for the privatisation of all State companies. The Minister of State does not agree with that, but I saw it clearly. I do not see any change in the steps being taken in that regard. I will resist any such moves.</P>
    <P>I am not just complaining or being negative about the matter, but there are other possibilities available to us in the House. Given our experience, we should look at other formats for doing this rather than following the example of Eircom. I am not talking about the price of the shares, but about the lack of control the House, the Parliament and the Government have over the telecommunications issue, which is now controlled from outside the country. We should set as a long-term objective the public ownership of these companies so that they have commercial freedom, they are not subject to being second-guessed by an assistant secretary in the Department, the Minister is no longer the shareholder and the regulation would be retained in the Department and with the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" />I will give the House an idea of how that might work. We could transfer the shares in the State companies to an independent agency, such as the National Treasury Management Agency, which used to be called the Debt Management Agency but its name was changed because we now have money. That agency could be an umbrella or holding company for all the companies. That would remove the shareholding from the Minister and the conflict of interest in terms of regulation. That would allow the companies to find the money they need to invest in their proposals. It would also give them the commercial freedom to act quickly and in the interests of their companies and customers. That is what the Labour Party is arguing for. It is a new format of public ownership and regulation without handing it over to the private sector, particularly the foreign private sector. These are strategic companies which are important to Ireland and to the life blood of the economy. We cannot afford to allow the cheque book invasion of these companies to be successful. They should compete with other companies in the market, but they will be the backbone of the economy for the foreseeable future. The example of Eircom is gone and this Government and future Governments will not have control of such companies in Ireland or have any serious input into how they operate because they will be subject to international agreements and treaties.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to prolong the debate on the proposal. Although it took a long time to prepare and he has agreed it is a temporary measure, I ask him not to implement it. If it is implemented, it will be virtually impossible to take it back. The danger is there will be someone in the near future sitting where the Minister of State is sitting now who will take the next jump quickly and sell off the energy company. If it is sold off, it will be gone for good. As sure as God made little green apples, those, who will be here long enough, will see this turn back full circle with Governments forced to nationalise these companies again.</P>
    <P>In the United States, the most ardent and successful capitalist country in the world, the states and cities are taking the energy companies into public ownership in a variety of forms because private sector competition fragmented the companies or resulted in monopolies which did not serve the interests of the public. The cities and states have been forced to &ldquo;nationalise&rdquo; them, not a word they use in the United States but the effect will be the same. We will see the same here. I suggest that we should learn from that by cutting out the middle stage and find a new form of public ownership and regulation for these companies in the interests of the public now.</P>

        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>: </b>I will not detain the House long but take the opportunity to speak about those areas which do not have a supply of <Col N="906" /> gas. I welcome this detailed Bill but I also share the reservations of Deputies Jim Higgins and Stagg that once we privatise and put control outside of this House, it is difficult to get a response, as the National Roads Authority and other bodies illustrate. Politicians get short shrift when they make representations to those bodies. We all have expressed concern about this.</P>
      <P>This Bill covers in detail, as did the Ministers speech, the road that gas will take, but I am concerned that natural gas is not being distributed fairly and equitably, particularly as I am from the south-east. Deputy Jim Higgins is lucky as the gas from the Corrib field is coming in on the west coast and probably all the towns in his constituency and along the west will benefit. That is what ought to happen. In the south-east, the gas pipeline runs through Waterford, Carlow, Kilkenny and Wicklow. Thanks to the Minster of State, Deputy Jacob, it is part and parcel of the latter's economy.</P>
      <P>Yet, in County Wexford, where we are surrounded by the pipeline, we do not have any gas. I appreciate Deputy Jacob's meeting with us recently on our attempt to encourage Bord Gáis to extend the pipeline into Wexford. Arklow's economy benefits from gas but nearby Gorey, in Wexford, where there is no gas, has lost around 1,000 jobs in the past year. The economy of the county suffers because of such job losses. It is unfair that gas goes to surrounding counties but not to Wexford where it would benefit industry and the ordinary consumer.</P>
      <P>The Minister must look into this. Bord Gáis has many well worn excuses, like that there is not enough industry or not enough economic development. However, industrialists will not set up in our county but prefer to go to counties where gas is available. The extra spur must be extended into the county because, although many counties benefited from the Celtic tiger, Wexford suffered badly. We lack a third level education institute, although one will come on stream soon. The broadband infrastructure &ndash; to mention another issue &ndash; is coming into County Wexford in Curracloe and Kilmore but not to the general community in the county. That is another reason industrialists will not come here. Only one town in each county in the south-east will benefit from broadband. That is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Gas is distributed unfairly by Bord Gáis. The population of Wexford is 104,000, making it the most densely populated county in the region. It is surrounded by other counties which the pipeline goes through. This is wrong and I am critical of previous Ministers and Bord Gáis executives for denying gas to the county. I ask the Minister to re-examine this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred in his speech to town gas operations which Bord Gáis took over. From the 19th century on, town gas was important to Wexford and Enniscorthy. Although, gas distributors <Col N="907" /> went out of business in the 1960s because they could not compete, we have that history of gas which we want to revisit. Bord Gáis says it must be commercial, but it is important that gas is brought to the county, as it is being brought to Ballina, Sligo, Galway and Letterkenny by way of the Belfast-Derry pipeline. The Minister spoke also of grant aid to make it viable, detailed engineering and planning work, and possible problems arising from EU rules on procurement. If that is so for this new pipeline, then grant aid should be available to assist gas going into Wexford county because of the job losses and its lower manufacturing base.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for bringing the Bill before the House and giving us the opportunity to air our views and problems. As I said to the Minister before Christmas when he met our high powered deputation led by the county manager, we will fight on behalf of the 104,000 people of Wexford to ensure that sooner rather than later that we get our share of the national cake and of the natural gas that is being distributed around the country. Before Deputy Jacob became a Minister of State he fought the cause of Wicklow when it came to natural gas but I hope the decisions being taken on which counties might or might not get gas is not based on whether those counties have Ministers. I saw recently that places such as Tullamore, Athlone and Ennis were being considered and the one common factor is that the towns mentioned all were in the constituencies of Ministers. If I were cynical I would say that is the reason, but I hope that is not the case and that the Minister for Public Enterprise, with the prompting of her Minister of State, will look seriously at the provision of natural gas for Wexford to benefit consumers and to attract more industrialists to the county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Sargent.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for the regulation of the gas sector in the State by the Commission for Energy Regulation and, for that purpose, to transfer to it certain functions of the Minister for Public Enterprise. It is important that we have a commission for energy regulation to make sure there is some order regarding the distribution and price of gas as well as the provision of gas for industry and I hope to households also in the near future. That is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well to set up a commission and to appoint a regulator. We have a regulator for the electricity sector who is discharging his functions in an exemplary manner and is top class but nevertheless the powers of the regulator need to be more closely scrutinised and examined to make sure electricity is properly regulated for the consumer. Regarding telecommunications, the regulator is also working to some extent but this <Col N="908" /> needs to be properly organised. I go along with the comments about this Bill's provisions being temporary but this area needs to be closely examined in the long term.</P>
    <P>The Bill is to deal with the whole area of gas supply but we must not just examine this area from an economic or monetary perspective. We must also look at the social aspects. Until now Bord Gáis has supplied gas to large industries, which is very commendable and has been of great benefit to the industries concerned. It is also hoped, over the next few years, to provide a gas supply for houses. I welcome this as it is essential. The social context is very important and should be taken into account by the regulator.</P>
    <P>Approximately £1 billion is being spent on the connector and I am pleased we will now have the benefit of a pipe running from the west across the midlands to Dublin. Towns will be connected along the Dublin-Galway-Limerick line in the first phase, along with Enfield in Meath, Mullingar, Athlone, Ballinasloe, Galway and Ennis in Clare. I seek confirmation that the Department is also looking for tenders for the gas line which will come to the Offaly region from above Horseleap and which will take in Kilmucklin, Tullamore-Rhode and Clara before continuing to Tullamore via the N80, where at the roundabout it will veer on to the Clara road and the Kilbeggan road. That is important for Offaly and the midlands &ndash; towns like Tullamore, Edenderry, Birr and Ferbane. It is also important for Laois. This project is going ahead in Portlaoise anyway and Abbeyleix, Mountrath, Durrow and Portarlington should be included along these spurs.</P>
    <P>We in the midlands have been involved in electricity production for many years but under the present Government we have seen the closure of Ferbane power station. When Deputy Dukes was Minister he offered a £17.5 million investment and more than £12 million of that was spent to re-open Ferbane. After that money was spent, the Minister, the Government and the ESB decided to close Ferbane power station. Rhode power station is about to be closed and every local newspaper has a screaming headline: &ldquo;Rhode Power Station to Close.&rdquo;  The damage that will be done to the village of Rhode by the closure of this station is very serious and I am deeply concerned by it. I call on the Minister of State to make every effort to keep the power station open. The ESB is believed to be considering selling off Ferbane power station so that it can be used for waste disposal but I do not want that. Will the Minister of State consider adapting the Ferbane and Rhode power stations to produce electricity from gas. With proper management and expertise these power stations could be used in some way for the distribution of gas.</P>
    <P>The people of Ferbane were outraged by the closure of the power station, as were the people of Rhode. It is wrong. The Government lacks the <Col N="909" /> commitment to keep power stations open. Fair play to the people of Ferbane, who are making an effort to fight back. Its development association is making major efforts in this regard but these closures are devastating bombshells. It is a priority that these pipelines be extended with spurs to ensure proper gas supplies in counties Laois and Offaly. We have seen Portarlington power station and Croghan briquette factory close. Electricity has been produced for years in counties Laois and Offaly and it is now imperative that an effort is made by the Department, the regulator, Bord Gáis and the new regulatory board to provide jobs there. We have suffered under the Government which should make it up to the people of counties Laois and Offaly who should have a proper gas supply which I now demand on their behalf.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an dTeachta Enright as a chuid ama a roinnt liom. This is not the first time we have handed powers over to a regulator. I know from previous experience that it is important to keep an eye on the interpretation of the regulations which is what I hope the Minister will do. With the development of wind energy we found it important to point out that this country's international obligations are real. Our obligations do not simply involve commercialising resources and selling them off in a competitive environment.</P>
      <P>We need to look at this matter in a global context before looking at the local situation. Ninety per cent of world energy supplies are fossil fuel based, of which gas is an increasing part. The 1992 convention on climate change, signed by 157 countries, started us on a serious approach to the issue and the effects carbon and fossil fuels have on it. The United Nations international government panel on climate change, involving 300 scientists, made it clear that cuts of 60% are needed to stabilise climate change globally. That is the scenario in the background.</P>
      <P>An OECD report shows us as inefficient in terms of energy use. Ireland comes 23rd out of 24 with Italy on top and Turkey at the bottom. The Government agreed to hold our CO² greenhouse gas emissions at 13% above 1990 levels. Obviously, that will not happen by 2008 or 2012. There is talk of our emissions being three times higher than this, as a consequence of which we are paying large fines internationally. The European Union has 5% of the world's population, but emits 15% of global greenhouse gases. There is a huge imbalance and injustice, of which we enjoy the benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gas has a short-term role to play, but will not get us out of the woods in terms of the climate change problem. It will take us in the right direction if combined heat and power is used. Coal-fired plants have a maximum efficiency rating of 40% while emitting large quantities of carbon <Col N="910" /> dioxide, but with a combined heat and power natural gas plant we can achieve rates of 95%. There is a need to convert many of the older stations to gas, but that will not end the matter. The Bill does nothing to ensure long-term energy security as mentioned by Deputy Stagg. Currently, 75% of Irish energy supplies are derived from imports accounting for 25% of our greenhouse gas emissions. This figure is due to rise to 90% by the year 2010, of which only a fraction, 1% , will come from renewable energy resources such as wind. This problem must be grappled with. However, the Bill does little to address it.</P>
    <P>I know from international experience that wind could account for a large part of our energy requirements. Because of its erratic nature it could not make up 100% unless the energy could be stored by batteries or converted to fuel like hydrogen. Gas has an important role to play because it is the source of energy for the transition to a hydrogen economy. I hope it can be used in this way over the next three decades which is about the time we have before a serious problem emerges and the people ask the reason the Government of 2002 did not see it coming. We need to be conscious of the long-term view.</P>
    <P>On the local front, it is disgraceful how we have allowed our resources, our once-off gas reserves, to be taken out with little benefit to the economy or the people. The Enterprise Energy Ireland exploration of the Corrib gas field should really be seen as that of Norway's Statoil, the United Kingdom's Energy Enterprise Oil and US Marathon. It is not an indigenous Irish concern as some might think from the name. The exploration companies do not pay anything for the exploration licence. If they find commercial amounts, then under law the Minister will be obliged to give them a production licence. Essentially, Ireland is seen as a soft touch by international exploration companies. Up to 1992 we took a royalty, had the ability to take an equity share and could tax them from the first year. Now, we only have the third option available and even in that case the company concerned can write off its exploration costs against income.</P>
    <P>Scotland and Norway insisted on spin-offs that would benefit their local economies. We know how well Aberdeen was set up. In Norway the Government took control by insisting there would be Norwegian workers on rigs in order that they could receive training and by insisting on shares. What happened? The companies left, yet it was not a disaster because Statoil was established. It is doing a very good trade. In Ireland there are no Irish workers on oil and gas rigs which are serviced from Ayr in Scotland and there is no spin-off to the State. That is a disgrace. The Government, supposedly, represents the interests of the people, yet the companies concerned pay no royalties on what is produced. Instead, they pay the normal 12.5% profits tax <Col N="911" /> payable by any business and are allowed to offset as much of the profit as they like against exploration costs. Once an exploration company sets up in Ireland it can continue to produce gas or oil and plough back money into the exploration with no payback to the people.</P>
    <P>These terms are the most favourable in the world for an oil and gas company. They were introduced at a time when there was little exploration off the west coast. Now, we realise their full significance. In County Mayo the word on the ground is that a great deal of fossil fuels has been found, but the companies are not telling the full story, which means they have gone against the terms of the licences which states they must fully report finds. If the Government could prove this, it would be a good opportunity for the Minister to revoke the licences and negotiate new terms. I challenge it to look into this and prove it. I hope the Minister shows the necessary backbone to do so and ensure the people have something to show for our reserves which are now being taken out of the country.</P>
    <P>SIPTU organisers say that few Irish workers are involved. In Norway there is a Government representative on rigs. Here there is none. This needs to be investigated further as it presents a problem. It is possible, therefore, that the company concerned could supply false core samples to the Minister and purposely disguise interesting strata to give the impression that there is not as much there as there actually is.</P>
    <P>We should examine what would be regarded as good terms and that might be a 50-50 share with the exploration companies. Once the gas is brought ashore it enters the European gas grid. It is no longer Irish gas. The gas grid will be a common carrier just like the electricity grid. The moment Corrib gas enters the grid there will be a common price with no advantages to Ireland apart from the possible employment opportunities and the tax levied on profits. Essentially the resource will be sold off for a pittance. There is a strong case for examining the Corrib gas field. By 2020, geologists and exploration experts believe that world gas will be costlier than at present because consumption will have peaked. Many experts, including economists, suggest that the gas in the Corrib field should be kept in the ground until a more advantageous time. The national grid is not dependent on gas from the Corrib field at present. I ask the Minister to consider the legislation regarding gas exploration. We must ensure that Ireland is not forced to depend on the goodwill of other countries through lack of a secure supply of gas.</P>
    <P>The 1992 guidelines for oil and gas exploration were a turning point. They give impetus to fossil fuel development by private companies. The State cannot stop exploration of the Corrib field. <Col N="912" /> The sole trigger for exploration rests with the company. The Government is cutting off the reserve which is ultimately our birthright and is a resource upon which future generations will depend. I ask the Minister to change the guidelines and return to the 1992 situation to use the reserves, just as Scotland and Norway have done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The second interconnector will be in place next winter and I refer to the extension of the grid to the land bank in Ballylongford-Tarbert, County Kerry. I understand that Bord Gáis is proceeding with its proposal to construct the new transmission pipeline between Dublin, Galway and Limerick and that there will be a spur connecting Aughinish Island, one of the biggest employers in the whole mid-west region, employing 700 people. The provision of a gas pipeline to the site will help considerably in securing employment there. It will also help reduce the level of emissions into the environment.</P>
      <P>The Tarbert-Ballylongford land bank was purchased by the State over 30 years ago. It has not been developed. It comprises 1,000 acres, mostly in public ownership. Some of the land has been planted over the years. The local people resisted a recent proposal to install a wind farm on the site. The land was bought originally because of the strategic nature of this site &ndash; it is contiguous to some of the deepest water in Europe. A ship of up to 400,000 tonnes can be docked just 20 metres offshore, equalling Rotterdam in that respect. Despite various promises, commitments, sod-turnings and pre-election hype, very little has happened. I expect that there will be an announcement relating to the Shannon estuary before election time. I ask the Minister to speak to Bord Gáis regarding the feasibility of extending the line to the land bank.</P>
      <P>The area of north-east Kerry has suffered a lot from the downturn in the farming industry. It had been a very productive dairy farming area but it has suffered from people leaving the land. Up to 50% of people have left the land and are working instead in Limerick or Abbeyfeale. The decline in farming has eroded the economic vibrancy of the place over the years. An effort must be made to find a replacement for this loss of earnings and I regard the land bank as an obvious choice. The provision of a gas supply to the site would be a major selling point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shannon Development and IDA Ireland maintain that one of the reasons development is not taking place is the lack of services on that site. The N69 from Limerick to Tarbert is a national secondary road and is not suitable for heavy vehicles such as trucks. They can get as far as Foynes port but the road from Foynes to the land bank is too narrow for such traffic. Services such as sewage and water treatment and the provision of gas are essential. The gas should be extended from the nearby pipeline to the land bank. If the <Col N="913" /> services were provided IDA Ireland claims that it could then encourage foreign operators to set up a container port or a trans-shipment port at that location. The site is close to Foynes port and it might not therefore be feasible to set up a rival port on the site. It may be possible to provide a horticultural industry on the site. The land is of very high quality, probably the most productive in the region. Some 20 or 30 farmers were removed from that land when it was bought by the IDA and this removed some of the economic base of that region. At the time these families were well compensated for their land. They bought land in Limerick and elsewhere but the whole place was denuded of its population and we can now see houses that are boarded up including some which are quite new. This is a reflection of the bad planning of that time. Options could have been taken on the land with people being allowed to remain. However, this was not done and they were encouraged to leave quickly. Since then the land has been rented and in some instances has become run down. It was always regarded as one of the most productive parts of north Kerry and possibly of Munster. If gas were provided, this land could be ideal for horticultural industry.</P>
    <P>If it is within his brief, the Minister should consider extending the gas grid to places like the land bank. From the point of view of strategic development and to balanced regional development in the mid west region, it would be important to provide gas for this part of Kerry. I heard Deputy Browne speak about the lack of gas provision in Wexford. Kerry is a peripheral county totally bereft of any gas provision and given that the pipeline will go from Limerick to Cork, it will isolate Kerry. Apart from the land bank, provision should be made to extend it further through Listowel, Tralee and Killarney to retain whatever competitiveness exists in the county now. Because of infrastructure, we are losing out to other locations and this could help to put us on a more level playing pitch with our competitors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has said, this legislation is quite complicated. From perusing the Bill, I appreciate the amount of work the Minister and his officials have put into it. As the Minister stressed in his speech, I note it is an interim Bill with further legislation to be brought forward later. This will be important in bringing consolidation to this whole area. A number of Acts are mentioned here: the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1993; the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1995; the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999; and the Gas (Amendment) Act, 2000. In trying to understand this Bill, it is necessary to move back and forth through these various Acts. Sections are being inserted and removed and the framework is quite complex. I know there may be <Col N="914" /> other constraints, however this whole area should be consolidated as soon as possible so that we can have a clearer picture of the legislation that applies. I appreciate that much work will be involved in that.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for the regulation of the gas sector in the State by the Commission for Energy Regulation. It transfers it to certain functions of the Minister for Public Enterprise and provides for the change of name, etc. However, transferring functions from the Minister of Public Enterprise seems to happen very frequently. On a number of occasions, I have spoken in this House about various Acts in which the Minister has transferred functions out of the Department. One of the effects of that is to raise questions about the accountability of regulators. Many colleagues on all sides have expressed their concern about the accountability to this House of bodies and regulators. It is important to also have independence. This was mentioned in the document published by the Department of Public Enterprise &ldquo;Governance and Accountability in the Regulatory Process&rdquo;. We need to examine how we can have accountability.</P>
      <P>Ultimately the consumers' interest is paramount. The reason to have regulators is to try to bring competition into the marketplace, to try to break up monopolies and allow others into those sectors. Is there a mechanism to see if what we are doing is protecting and advancing the consumers' interest and thereby lowering prices by introducing competition? It will be interesting to see how that will come about.</P>
      <P>On the other side of that coin is the public service requirement. As many colleagues have already mentioned, many areas of the country need infrastructure, gas, electricity, etc. The telecoms area is of particular concern. If it is not profitable for a telecom company to open up broadband technology in a certain area, then it does not happen. The State has given over the role of providing this infrastructure to private companies. The public service requirement is of concern and we should keep it to the fore. There are a number of competing issues that need to be investigated.</P>
      <P>Putting gas and electricity regulation together is a good idea. We have built up expertise under the Commission for Electricity Regulation and it is right to regulate both sectors by the one commission. They are both energy sectors so the idea of calling it the Commission for Energy Regulation is to be applauded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently we had the Second Stage debate on the Sustainable Energy Bill. Will the measures being discussed today in any way affect or advance the area of sustainable energy? Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether the measure we are proposing to adopt will affect or advance sustainable energy. This is something we all have to keep in mind. Deputy Sargent mentioned the <Col N="915" /> Kyoto agreements and CO² emissions, and I know the Minister is concerned about that as well. I am anxious to know if this Bill will help or impinge on the new body, Sustainable Energy Ireland.</P>
    <P>Should we have a national regulatory council? I know the Minister has spoken of a consultative process but we may need to go further than that. The role of the Minister is moving from ownership and regulation to policy. One concern is that the areas of electricity, gas and telecommunications are part of the vital infrastructure of the State. It is important that is kept in mind. There are parts of the country that need gas and other infrastructure to develop industry and tourism. I hope this Bill will help advance infrastructure in the peripheral areas of the State. Will the Minister let us know how these areas can be helped and advanced by the Bill? How will the consumer be helped by it? Will the Minister show how similar measures in other sectors tangibly assisted the consumer?</P>
    <P>How does regulation in Ireland compare to that in other countries? Does our regime stand up to scrutiny and compare favourably with similar measures in other countries? Have studies taken place on this in Europe or North America where regulation seems to be the order of the day? Have we learned anything from what has happened there? What mechanisms are being put in place to scrutinise and report on the effectiveness of regulation in the various sectors? Will such a measure be included in this Bill? How often should reports on the cost effectiveness of regulation be sent to the Minister and this House? Is it worth it? There must be a balance between the cost effectiveness of regulation and its general effectiveness. What role has the regulator and how will it impinge on the Competition Authority? What is the relationship between regulators and the Competition Authority?</P>
    <P>I welcome this measure. It is a good idea to have the two sectors regulated under the umbrella of energy. We have to consider the question of accountability. We must look at the relationship between this House and regulators. Until now the Minister was accountable to the House. Setting up regulators will mean they will be independent, with which I agree, but we will still need to have some form of accountability to this House, possibly through the Minister. The Minister should not be responsible for what they do but information should be available by way of parliamentary questions if it is required. The people are sovereign and we are here to represent them. If one were to survey 100 people how many would know what the electricity regulator does? How many citizens will know what this Bill is about and how it affects them? These are highly technical and complicated measures but there is a duty to educate the public about them. There <Col N="916" /> should be an onus on the Minister and the Department to explain what the role of the regulators is and how they affect the public. That is not being done.</P>
    <P>Members will not be able to get the information either because I am sure we will be told that the Minister will not be accountable to the Dáil on these matters. There is a distancing between these agents of the State and the citizens, and that is not good. Perhaps part of the reason the Nice treaty was not ratified was the distancing of certain arms of the State and the citizens. We should work to ensure that people know exactly what these offices do and present it to them in a straightforward and simple manner. A mechanism to inform and educate people about these offices should be established. It is not good enough that the offices are remote from the people even though they impinge on their lives. It is not fair on Deputies, who have to account to people, that these offices are not to be held accountable to them.</P>
    <P>A number of bodies have been set up by the Government and the same thing could be said about them. We have tabled a number of amendments to Bills asking that such bodies be made accountable, for information purposes only, through parliamentary questions in the House, but the Government has consistently refused to allow that to happen. It has cited Dáil reform. We still await that and I look forward to reform which will enable us to get information on these bodies. I acknowledge that the Minster for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has been unusually generous at times in giving information when she was not required to do so. I hope this will continue when these commissions are established. If another Minister comes to office that might not happen. That is why we are so concerned that some change be made in the regime to enable us get the information we require.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. We have concerns about infrastructure around the country and areas that need development. We are also concerned about accountability and the consultative process. I look forward to addressing that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>This report by an independent group of experts is the first external review of teacher allocation practice and policy in second level schools. The recommendations made in the expert group's report for future policy are currently under review in my Department. I welcome this report, which represents a comprehensive review of the important issues in teacher allocation policy in second level schools. It is a significant document which will help to inform discussion and decisions on policy options and development. I appreciate Dr. McGuinness and the other members of the expert group for their contribution and commitment in undertaking their task.</P>
      <P>The report makes recommendations on teacher allocations in a number of areas, including: a special reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio for the first 150 pupils to provide greater choice of subjects for smaller second level schools; the further reduction of class sizes using posts freed up by the demographic dividend arising from the decline in student numbers; a further reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio for all disadvantaged schools; and improved teaching allocations for career guidance and improved allocations in respect of deputy principals by reducing the threshold from 1,000 to 850 pupils. Other recommendations include: a review of learning support teacher allocations to provide a more targeted approach at individual school level; a review of school management requirements and structures; the introduction of an effective cross sectoral redeployment scheme for supernumerary teachers based on the needs of the school; and clearer criteria for the allocation of posts on appeal and the establishment of an independent appeals board.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to be in a position to deliver on our commitment to the reduction of the pupil-teacher ratio in secondary schools. In 1999, 225 additional posts were created. In the 2000-01 school year, 1,000 additional posts were created and a further 400 new posts will be created by the Government in accordance with the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The extra 1,000 teaching posts enabled a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio from 19:1 to 18:1 for appointment purposes and further improvements in teaching post allocations targeted at programmes such as the leaving certificate applied, the junior certificate school programme and the guidance enhancement initiative. The pupil-teacher ratio has been reduced by this Government from 16:1 in 1996-97 to 14.8:1 in 2000-01. This figure will be reduced further this year to almost 14:1. I expect to announce details of the allocation of the 400 new posts in the coming weeks.</P>

      <i>Additional Information</i>The preliminary text of the report of the expert group on the allocation of teachers to second <Col N="918" /> level schools, the McGuinness report, was received in my Department in July 2001. My Department then arranged to tender and engage contractors for the design, proofing and printing of the report with a view to its publication and dissemination. Final printed copies of the report were received in my Department in late November 2001. Following the Christmas period my Department arranged for the publication of the report. Copies are being sent to all interested parties and may also be accessed on my Department's Internet website.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that the findings of the report are a shocking indictment of our second level education system? He should not be so disingenuous as to try to mix and match between the additional staffing requirements, for which he will now provide and for which there is provision in the budget under the PPF, and what is contained in this report. The report recommends that 1,200 additional teachers are required in post primary schools. In respect of the 400 additional teaching posts sanctioned under the PPF, for which there is financial provision in this year's budget, will 100, 200 or 300 of those be prioritised &ndash; or how many of them will be &ndash; for post primary schools? Will the Minister accept that students in 1970 had a far better quality of education in respect of the pupil-teacher ratio than students have today? That is the core finding of the report and it is an indictment of the Department of Education and Science in respect of the current pupil-teacher ratio.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the issue of balance. The pupil-teacher ratio has fallen to 14:1. However, once the extra teachers are appointed to tackle disadvantage, to remedial education posts or to ex-quota posts, they will not be counted in the <Col N="919" /> appointments ratio, which is the one about which people talk.

      <P>Will the Minister accept that in many respects the big losers identified in the McGuinness report are small schools, schools with fewer than 300 pupils, where the range of subjects available is severely restricted because of the lack of provision of an increased number of teachers? I refer specifically to the crisis in terms of the availability of science subjects that emerged in recent days, to which the IDA adverted. Only 40% of small schools offer chemistry as an option to leaving certificate students. Will he accept this is an issue that urgently needs to be addressed in the context of the McGuinness report?</P>

      <P>As a result of the Government's unprecedented and sustained investment in first and second level educational infrastructure, very substantial progress has been made in improving <Col N="920" /> school accommodation in recent years. Last year alone more than &euro;316 million was expended on schools' infrastructure and in the current year a sum in excess of &euro;335 million has been allocated for school buildings. This is almost four times more than the 1997 allocation.</P>
      <P>Clearly, it is not possible to wipe out in the lifetime of one Government the cumulative deficit of generations and also to deal with emerging needs at the same time. This Government from the outset has been committed to addressing that historical deficit in educational infrastructure and has set about rectifying the situation by allocating substantial funding in each of its budgets. The Taoiseach has very recently given a categorical assurance about our clear commitment to continuing with the work we have started and to build on the substantial progress that has already been made in recent years in order to ensure that the needs of schools right across the country are met.</P>
      <P>To support that programme going forward and to facilitate the more precise targeting of available funding&mdash;</P>

      <P>The report of the steering committee on the future development of higher education, published in June 1995, outlined indicative student numbers for the academic years 2000-01 and 2006-07. The figures indicated a total of 2,800 full-time students for Sligo Institute of Technology for the 2000-01 academic year and a total of 3,000 full-time students for the 2006-07 academic year. These figures represent projections which inform my Department in terms of capital works and equipment provision. They do not represent a cap on student numbers for the institute.</P>
      <P>The annual returns from the institute for 2000-01 indicate a stock of 3,021 wholetime students. Accordingly, the actual figures exceed expectations for 2000-01 and even for 2006-07.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department provides current funding to the institutes of technology on the basis of annual <Col N="925" /> programme and budget submissions made by the institutes and within the limit of available resources. Over the past four academic years my Department has approved eight new degree courses, six new diploma courses and two new certificate courses in the institute. The institute has been allocated additional staff to support the delivery of these courses. The institute's current budget has been increased from &euro;10.268 million in 1998 to &euro;16.161 million in 2001 which represents a total increase of over 57% over a three year period.</P>
    <P>My Department is also engaged in detailed consultation with the institute in relation to the implementation of a master plan for capital works. Recently completed building projects include a new engineering building, refurbishment of St. Columbus units 14-16 and extension of the general engineering wing. A major new apprentice facility is currently under construction at the institute and is expected to be completed in September. My Department is awaiting the master plan currently being undertaken by the institute which will indicate the development potential for the institute for the coming years.</P>

      <P>At present there are 3,300 students in the Sligo Institute of Technology. A total of 75% of second level students in Leitrim and 65% of second level students in Sligo go on to third level education, with the vast majority going to colleges in Dublin, Limerick and Cork. The cap that currently applies prevents the Sligo Institute of Technology growing. If it is Government policy to restrict the growth of institutes of technology to these limits, will the Minister state whether the same policies are being applied to the university sector? In the context of the national development plan, does the Minister envisage the front-loading of investment into the institutes of technology, particularly Sligo Institute of Technology? The number of students in the institute currently exceeds the number envisaged in the development plan for 2006. If the college wants to grow and to provide proper facilities for extra students, it needs funding from the Department. Will the Minister provide that this year?</P>

Recently completed projects at the institute include the ones I mentioned earlier. In addition, the Department agreed funding of approximately £1.3 million in April last year for a piece of land along a public road, creating an opportunity for the possible provision of another entrance to the institute. The plan for the campus <Col N="926" /> identified this land as being suitable for academic buildings and for car parking. The plan for the campus identified this land as suitable for academic buildings and car parking. A new major apprentice facility is currently under construction and should be ready in September. However, it is agreed that the institution is growing and that it should grow in principle. The institute needs to provide a master plan which the Department awaits. The master plan currently being undertaken by the institute will indicate the development potential for the college for the coming years. The Department's capital funding programme will be targeted to enhance that capacity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority has asked Sligo Institute of Technology to produce a master plan which is limited to provision for 3,000 students. The institute currently caters for 3,300 students and, therefore, it cannot provide a master plan to the Higher Education Authority within that guideline. I ask the Minister and the Higher Education Authority to give permission to Sligo Institute of Technology to increase the number of institutes for which it plans. The institute has exceeded the cap on student numbers and, therefore, cannot produce a master plan. That does not make sense because the institute needs to increase student numbers.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to parliamentary Questions Nos. 188, 189 and 190 of 6 December 2001, he will provide the information regarding the Finglas Children's Centre as requested; the reason for the delay in providing this information; and if he will make a statement on the operation of this centre.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to the Finglas Children's Centre, one of the five special schools for young offenders under the aegis of my Department. The Deputy requested very detailed <Col N="927" /> statistical information concerning the centre covering a four year period. I informed the Deputy on 6 December that the information was not readily available in my Department and that I had arranged for it to be collated and forwarded to her as soon as possible. This involved contact with the management of the centre and subsequent checking of the data supplied by it. The information is now available and I have arranged for it to be transmitted to the Deputy this week.</P>
      <P>There is a number of factors which have impacted on the operation of the Finglas centre in recent times. A major programme of capital redevelopment works has been undertaken at the centre in the past 18 months. This chiefly involved the conversion of the old dormitory style accommodation to meet modern standards. These works have significantly reduced the capacity of the centre and caused considerable disruption for both the young people in care and the staff. The centre has had to cater for severely disturbed children also during this period.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Finglas centre has had a high staff turnover in recent times. This experience is mirrored throughout the entire residential child care area where there are difficulties in recruiting and retaining experienced staff. I understand that current recruitment drives have generated a better level of response than previous ones and it is expected that the majority of vacancies will be filled shortly. I have also secured agreement for an independent review of existing child care staffing levels and reporting arrangements in the centres, including Finglas. This review will indicate the staffing levels and structures required to enable each centre provide a high quality and caring service to its residents in an efficient and economic manner.</P>
      <P>There is also a need to ensure that there are adequate places available to accommodate children who have been convicted or placed on remand by a court. I have commissioned an independent audit of the residential requirements for young offenders. The purpose of this audit is to ensure that there are sufficient and appropriate residential places available to meet the needs of the target group into the future. The audit will also indicate if existing places, including those in the Finglas facility, are being used optimally. In addition, the recently established Special Residential Services Board will have a role to play in ensuring the efficient and co-ordinated delivery of services for the young people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>I am conscious of the overriding need to ensure that the quality of care provided by my Department's centres for young offenders, including the Finglas facility, meets recognised standards. To this end, it is my intention that each centre will be independently inspected by an external agency <Col N="928" /> as soon as possible. Independent inspection will give assurance concerning the standard of care being provided, the efficacy of the systems and procedures being followed and the efficiency of each centre's operations. My Department has consulted the centres and the social services inspectorate on this matter and I expect to commission a pilot inspection of one of the centres shortly as a first step in this process. I am confident that independent inspection will identify any weaknesses that may exist and give confidence that the children concerned are being cared for in a manner that accords with established best practice.</P>

      <P>As was the case with the previous question, it is a disgrace that I have had to wait almost eight weeks for basic information about an important institution under the Minister's care. I am concerned about the operation of the Finglas centre. Further to the questions I tabled in early December, has the Minister or any of his officials been in direct contact with the centre to ascertain what are the problems there? Will he confirm that the centre has capacity for 37 children but that in recent months the maximum number in its care has been seven? The Minister referred to the presence in the centre recently of children with particularly difficult or challenging behaviour. Has he considered the possibility that the atmosphere there and the ethos of management has contributed to extremely disruptive behaviour on the part of the residents? I urge him to take urgent action to examine what exactly is going on in the centre and to report back to the House within a few weeks.</P>

      <P>This matter is being investigated and I accept it needs investigation. Having regard to the seriousness of the issues involved the Department is arranging to have a general inspection of the centre carried out immediately by an internationally recognised expert in the field of residential child care. The focus of the investigation will be an examination of the systems, operations, procedures and standards of care provided for young people in the centre's care. The inspection will identify operational difficulties that exist at the centre and bring forward proposals to remedy deficiencies. The Department has drafted a set of standards covering all aspects of residential child care and these will be used as the basis for the inspection of the Finglas centre. Following receipt of the inspector's report we will decide what further action must be taken.</P>
      <P>More generally all the centres within the Department's remit will be inspected by an external independent agency using the same standards as soon as possible. The inspection of the Finglas centre will go ahead immediately.</P>

      <Quest>his plans to improve and increase the higher education maintenance grant to a realistic figure; his further plans to make special provision in order that disadvantaged students may be given access to third level colleges on a par with other students; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My approach to the value of maintenance grants has been to increase the level of grants annually at least in line with inflation. Last June, in line with this policy, I approved increases of 6% in the rates of maintenance grant. The reference value for inflation is the annual percentage increase in the consumer price index to mid-February. The increase of 6% in grant rates for 2001-02 was higher than the reference value of 5.3%.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the practice in recent years has been to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. I approved an increase of 6.5% in the reckonable income limits for the 2001-02 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1999 to March 2000, which was 5.9%. I also increased by 6.5% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On my initiative a special project team is carrying out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants and other student supports to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review includes the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, <Col N="930" /> the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures.</P>
    <P>Some of these topics are complex by nature and require detailed research.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the review, the Economic and Social Research Institute was commissioned to undertake research on the effect of changes in the income thresholds and on related matters. The report's findings have informed the work of the project team and drafting of the team's report is now being finalised. Issues relating to the implementation of the team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>
      <P>I have already introduced special rates of maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders with effect from the 2000-01 academic year. The rates are &euro;3,809 for students residing more than 15 miles from the college attended and &euro;1,535 for students residing less than 15 miles from the college attended. These increased rates of grant will be a powerful incentive to eligible students to enter third level and to complete their studies in the knowledge that additional financial assistance will be available to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that the cost of rent in the past four years has increased by 100% whereas his increase in the maintenance grant is just 10%? Is he aware of the difficulties students face? Regarding income limits, any two parents working in jobs such as those in a food outlet, for example, would exceed the income guidelines for a third level grant for their child. Is the Minister aware that one in ten students who receive an offer turn it down because they fear the financial cost of going to college?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where is the fairness in the Minister's plan for third level maintenance grants? There is no indication that he is in touch with the reality of the difficulties students face where accommodation is concerned. He is to blame for the drop-out rate throughout the third level sector, be it at universities, institutes of technology or otherwise. The drop-out rate at third level is increasing rapidly and the Minister is to blame for that because of the inadequacy of grants. I want him to explain himself fully to students who have suffered as a consequence and whose lives have been turned upside down because of his failure to obtain from <Col N="931" /> his colleague in the Department of Finance adequate&mdash;</P>

      <P>The planning group that prepared proposals for the National Educational Psychological Service agency, NEPS, recommended an overall target of 200 psychologists and 36 administrative-secretarial staff. It also recommended that this target should be achieved over five years beginning during the school year 1999-2000. The Government made a decision in early 1999 that these recommendations should be implemented.</P>
      <P>I launched the new NEPS in May 2000 with the 43 psychologists already employed in my Department. The recruitment of additional psychologists involved the organisation of competitions through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. Notwithstanding the time-consuming nature of such competitions, there are now almost 100 psychologists deployed in the education sector. The Civil Service Commission is at the interview stage for the recruitment of additional psychologists to NEPS. It is envisaged that many of them will be in the post by the end of this school year.</P>
      <P>I also announced recently that arrangements are being made to enable the full complement of 200 NEPS psychologists to be appointed within the next 12 months.

He said now there is just under 100. The Minister is failing to meet the targets he set himself and which he gave in information to the House on 20 March 2001. Does the Minister accept that in many cases when a pupil with a specific learning disability enrols in September the school seeks a psychological evaluation but it does not take place for a number of months? The student then becomes disruptive in class, the education of other children is disrupted and the psychological service is entirely unavailable. Affluent parents can access the service of a psychologist privately. In the interim until the NEPS is operational, will the Minister ensure that in any case where the service is not available to a school which seeks it, the Department will cover the cost of a private assessment?</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>his plans to build on the success of gaelscoileanna; and the demand which exists for all-Irish secondary schools in this regard.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2842/02]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my policy to support the provision of all-Irish school facilities at primary and second level in areas outside the Gaeltacht regions, where a demand for such provision is demonstrated and no alternative exists within a reasonable distance.</P>
      <P>There are 114 recognised gaelscoileanna operating within the State, with the possibility that further such schools may secure recognition and open in the future. With the growth in the number of all-Irish primary schools around the country over the past two decades, there is, understandably, an increase in the demand for all-Irish school provision at post-primary level also. There are currently in excess of 50 schools providing varying degrees of education through Irish at this level and the planning section of my Department is examining applications for the development of such facilities in a number of other locations.</P>
      <P>In line with the provisions of the Education Act, 1998, I recently set up a new statutory body, The Council for Gaeltacht and Gaelscoil Education, to promote education through Irish as well as the teaching and learning of Irish. The new body will undertake a range of advisory and support functions in relation to Irish language education. These functions will include the planning and co-ordination of textbooks and learning aids and the development of policies to facilitate the provision of education through Irish in Gaeltacht schools as well as recognised schools generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to those schools at first and second <Col N="935" /> level which are providing tuition entirely or predominantly through the medium of Irish, the valuable contribution to the Irish language being made by many other schools is recognised and appreciated. These schools, some of which have established dedicated all-Irish streams, are an important resource in the promotion of Irish as a living language and as a medium of instruction. I have asked that these arrangements be reviewed and, in particular, the Commission on School Accommodation is to carry out an in-depth examination of all-Irish provision at post-primary level.</P>
    <P>I am firmly committed to the promotion of the Irish language through the development of a range of school models with appropriate structures and resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>How many gaelscoileanna, primary and post-primary, are among the 800 or more schools building projects whose progress is stalled in the Department of Education and Science? Does the Minister accept that gaelscoileanna are one of the great success stories of Irish education in recent years, particularly in promoting the language outside the Gaeltacht areas? There is a need to build on that progress by providing access to post-primary education through Irish. What plans has the Department for a proactive approach to providing sites and trained teachers to meet this demand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 114 recognised gaelscoileanna operating in the State and a number are developing. What happens in practice is that a new school is set up and when it has been shown to have adequate numbers it becomes accredited as a school. When this happens the Department takes over all payments and arrangements. At this stage schools are usually housed in rented accommodation which is paid for by the Department. The next step is to find a site for a permanent school building. The Department will purchase a site under the usual conditions which apply in all circumstances. Interim accommodation is often required, either rented off-site or in temporary buildings on the site, while the permanent building is being planned. In some cases gaelscoileanna are accommodated in school buildings which have been vacated. It depends on what resources and facilities are available.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that a gaelscoil in Ballinasloe has been located for seven years in shopping and enterprise units and that despite every effort and endeavour during the years there has been no positive response from the Department to deal with the situation? What is the excuse for this if we are to promote the Irish language?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>

May I draw <Col N="936" /> his attention to two gaelscoileanna in Bantry, County Cork, and Wexford town? He has acknowledged that most gaelscoileanna are located in very poor quality built environments. We need to be proactive in this regard.</P>

I would not spend &euro;500,000 on a school if I was not interested in it. The normal procedure is to obtain a site which, in this instance, we have obtained at a cost of more than &euro;500,000. We are now prepared to provide on an interim basis portacabins, which many other schools use while their school accommodation is being built. Even if I made the money available, it could not be provided by next September, therefore, it will be the following year. Cover must be provided in the meantime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils validly enrolled on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule, which is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. The staffing schedule is issued to the boards of management of all schools by circular letter. I will arrange for a copy of the current schedule to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A primary school in a developing area may have a significant increase in enrolments which would make the previous September's enrolment inappropriate in determining the staffing. <Col N="937" /> Developing school status accommodates this situation. Where a school can give evidence that it will meet specified increases in numbers it is provisionally allocated an additional post pending experience of its actual enrolments in the new school year.</P>
    <P>To obtain an additional post there must be a specified minimum increase in valid enrolments between the two school years. The enrolment increase necessary is determined by the size of the school and a stipulated excess figure above the appointment figure. In the case of schools with fewer than 299 pupils, an additional 25 pupils are required, with an excess of five pupils above the appointment figure. In schools with 299 pupils or more, 30 additional pupils are required, with an excess of ten pupils above the appointment figure.</P>
    <P>If the board of management believes the school will achieve the projected increase in enrolment as I have outlined, it may apply to my Department for sanction to appoint an additional teacher in excess of that warranted by the staffing schedule. Boards normally apply in May-June of a particular year for sanction for a post in the following school year. Any additional post granted in response to such an application is conditional on the projected enrolment being achieved.</P>
    <P>In the case of a new school at primary level, the board of management may appoint a principal once provisional recognition has been granted by my Department. Additional mainstream teaching staff are granted in accordance with the criteria for developing schools. I have established for the 2002-03 school year a formal independent appeals procedure to consider appeals on mainstream staffing from boards of management of primary schools in accordance with certain criteria. In that context, I have established an independent appeals board to consider appeals. One of the functions of the appeals board shall be to review appeals on the mainstream teaching staff allocation from schools in areas where the population is expanding rapidly. I will be announcing further details regarding the appeals board in the near future.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>It is open to the authorities of existing individual second level schools to apply to my Department for an additional teacher allocation to cater for particular circumstances in the school, including projected increased enrolment. Any additional allocation granted in response to such an application is conditional on the projected enrolment being achieved.</P>
    <P>In the case of a greenfield school or a school resulting from the amalgamation of two or more schools, my Department allows the school authorities concerned to appoint the principal of the new school well in advance of the scheduled date of opening of the new school. This enables the new principal to assess the needs of the school <Col N="938" /> and submit an application to my Department for the appropriate staffing resources to cater for those needs. In considering such an application my Department takes account of such matters as the curriculum which is to be offered in the school, the projected enrolment and, in the case of amalgamated schools, the existing teaching resources.</P>
    <P>The recruitment and appointment of staff for the new school is a matter in the first instance for the authorities of the school. My Department's decision on the application for teaching resources is notified to the school authorities in sufficient time to ensure they are in a position to make the appropriate arrangements for the recruitment and appointment of staff in advance of the commencement of the school year.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of widespread dissatisfaction among parents and teachers at the injustice inflicted on students in rapidly developing suburban commuter belt areas around this city and all the major urban centres throughout the country where schools are exploding at enormous rates? Notwithstanding what the Minister has outlined, they find the provisions to review entitlement to an additional teaching post are failing to take account of the explosion in numbers during the school term. In the light of this fact and notwithstanding what he said, will the Minister review the current situation in order that these schools can access during a school term the appointment of additional teachers to take account of their actual enrolment on any given date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In exceptional situations a temporary arrangement can be made up to the date set out. In other words, a teacher can be taken on, on a temporary basis, up to that date. This would apply where there is a rapid and major expansion. This is a contentious matter which has been argued for years. A formula is agreed by the education partners, which is where the difficulty lies. Once one puts in place a formula exceptions will arise in different circumstances, which is the reason I want the appeals board to be seen to deal with the issue in an independent manner.</P>

Does he realise the hardship and problems this is causing for teachers, students and parents throughout the country? Will he agree it is not good enough to establish more boards, bureaucracy and red tape given it is a simple matter to solve this problem rather than let it drift and drift?</P>

      <P>My Department is fully committed to the overall strategic objective for the national drugs strategy, 2001-08, which is, through a concerted focus on the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, to reduce significantly the harm caused to individuals and society and, especially, the most vulnerable children and young people by the misuse of drugs.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, of the 100 actions set out in the national drugs strategy, there are nine, Nos. 29 to 37, under the prevention pillar for implementation by my Department in partnership with the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children and the health boards, where relevant. A further two, Nos. 42 and 43, are for joint implementation by my Department and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>Progress is being made on all these actions. In particular, seven senior officials have been nominated by my Department to serve on the 14 local drug task forces; extra support personnel are being put in place to ensure the commitments relating to implementation of drug education programmes in all schools in these areas are fulfilled; the audit of education supports is being finalised and proposals for a significant expansion of the initiatives to tackle early school leaving are under consideration in the Department.</P>

      <P>The Minister's Department is supposed to be delivering the drugs awareness programme in all schools. Will he tell us what percentage of primary schools are providing the Walk Tall programme and what percentage of second level schools are providing the On My Own Two Feet programme? The Minister often produces figures for the number of teachers who have been in training, but the word on the ground is that few schools are providing an adequate drugs education programme. This is often because, due to a crowded curriculum, there are not enough teachers to provide the programme. Unless we tackle the drugs issue at that level it will clearly be a losing battle.</P>

      <P>Action 32 was aimed specifically at implementing the Walk Tall and On My Own Two Feet programmes in all schools in the drugs task force areas during the academic year 2001-02. My understanding, however, is that neither programme is in place in schools serving some of the worst hit areas. Will the Minister indicate how many schools have still not implemented those programmes? I am talking about schools in drugs task force areas where there was a clear commitment that the Walk Tall programme in national schools and the On My Own Two Feet programme in secondary schools would be in place during the current school year. My clear understanding, however, is that the programmes have still not been implemented in schools in the areas worst hit by drugs.</P>
      <P>Action 36 was aimed at ensuring that every second level school would have an active programme to counter early school leaving, with particular focus on areas with high levels of drug misuse. Will the Minister indicate what progress, if any, has been made on implementing action 36?</P>

      <P>In 1998 the school authorities in question sought approval for a PE hall for the school. My Department agreed to the provision of a hall of 608m² and a further 200m² of ancillary accommodation. That is 808m² in total.</P>
      <P>In January of last year the authorities of the school requested my Department to assess its overall accommodation needs and to include the PE and ancillary needs in that assessment. As the school was now effectively requesting a potentially more significant capital investment, my Department sought to establish the long-term viability and enrolment projections for the school. Last summer it was agreed with the school authorities that a long-term projected enrolment of 500 was a reasonable basis on which to base the detailed assessment of the school's future accommodation requirements.</P>
      <P>Last August, my Department provided the school with a draft schedule of overall accommodation, seeking its agreement. This draft was based on an educational worksheet prepared by the school showing its curricular options. The school authorities responded in October with some queries. My Department has addressed these and a revised schedule was recently issued to the school. As soon as the school authorities agree the schedule the question of designing accommodation for the future needs of the school can be addressed.</P>

The Deputy will be aware that, arising from the Cromien report which I commissioned on my Department's operations, systems and staffing, the Government approved a programme of structural reform for the Department which is being negotiated with staff interests. This programme includes reformed departmental structures to reflect greater emphasis on core functions and provide for a thematic as opposed to a sectoral approach to educational provision.</P>
      <P>My Department's functions in the area of social inclusion, including provision for Traveller education, are being reviewed by senior officials with a view to the realignment of responsibilities and reform of delivery mechanisms.

      <P>The town and county of Monaghan have in recent times experienced a succession of closures and job losses which have had a severe impact on an already marginalised and disadvantaged local economy. Some 300 people lost their jobs with the closure of Monaghan Poultry Products and we lost 70 or more jobs in our local jeans factory, Montex. The closure of other traditional employment opportunities in the Monaghan town area, such as Patton's Mill following a devastating fire and <Col N="946" /> McCaldins and Lavery's bakeries and, although it happened some years ago, the closure of the traditional pig processing plants, Castlebar and Grahams AIBP, have all contributed to a growing despair in our community. Without any new or replacement industries, inward investment, Government decentralisation or peace dividend, the Border county has been wilfully neglected by successive Governments and the so-called Celtic tiger.</P>
      <P>Time does not permit me to detail the symptoms of economic neglect which are evident in my county and a direct result of Government inaction. County Monaghan has a high dependency on a declining agricultural sector and is overly reliant on traditional industry, such as primary processing, furniture and general engineering. It has a weak infrastructure, a poorly developed tourism sector and the lowest take-up of third level education of the 26 counties. Its <i>per capita </i> income is below the national average.</P>
      <P>I have engaged with surviving players in industry in the north County Monaghan area believing that we must depend on our own genius and entrepreneurship to stop the haemorrhage of valued employment and set the area on course for new industrial opportunities. I have placed before the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, a proposal to revitalise the economy of north County Monaghan. There is an agreed need to both encourage and facilitate new business ideas. Many existing manufacturing plants started out as home based or small site enterprises and have outgrown the potential of their locations. Natural expansion and new job creation have been curtailed by site restrictions. Access to and from many of these industries is restricted and unsuitable and encroaches on an already choked and limited urban infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a Monaghan business park would aid relocation and the realisation of full expansion and employment potential. It would mould together the collective experience of many business families, individuals and managements and afford each other and new players critical backup, encouragement and expertise. It would facilitate new business ventures and help establish a marketing tool of excellence. I affirm there is an extensive interest in the proposition and an across the board acceptance of the good sense of such an initiative. To assist, encourage and facilitate the establishment of Monaghan business park and ensure its successful launch and development, I have requested the Minister's favourable consideration of the key element in the proposition, namely, the approval of a special tax designation or incentive to relocate, expand or establish on the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I express my disappointment at the lack of response from the Minister to this constructive proposal. I have received only an acknowledge<Col N="947" /> ment to my letter of 7 November last and have had subsequent oral exchanges with the Minister in the House. Yesterday the other Monaghan Oireachtas Members, Monaghan County Council elected representatives and executive members and I met the Minister. I did not note an awareness of the pressing need to address the experiences and restrictions faced by existing manufacturing entities. I hope I am wrong, although others from the delegation also commented on it. There was no real understanding of commitment to the employment needs of County Monaghan detected on the Minister's part. I hope the Minister of State will convey to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment that I wish to be proven wrong.</P>
    <P>I understand that an announcement on the location of a significant inward investor in this country, Associated Packaging Enterprises, employing more than 100 people is imminent. The prospective location is Carrickmacross, but there is dismay in County Monaghan at reports that this project may be diverted to another location in this State, and it is alleged for purely party political electoral advantage. If true, this would be an outrage. I hope the Minister and the IDA will ensure that the Carrickmacross site will yet win the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the Government, through our enterprise development agencies, is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities and to encouraging the establishment of industry in all our regions. A key factor in the achievement of this objective, and a primary objective of this Government, is the creation of a business environment in which job opportunities continue to flourish and, equally, in which job applicants have the requisite skills requirements. Deputy Ó Caoláin must accept that the environment in Northern Ireland for the past 30 years was not conducive to getting investment into the Border region. We worked assiduously over many years to bring peace to the whole island and are confident that we have now created the business environment in which investment can be delivered to all parts of our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with commitments in the national development plan, the enterprise development agencies are strongly focused on achieving this aim and resources are being deployed to reflect this new focus. The new 12.5% corporation tax rate and initiatives on matters such as education, physical infrastructure and technology under the national development plan, allow Ireland to remain competitive both in developing indigenous industry and securing inward investment projects. Since we came into office in 1997, we have reduced corporation tax from 40% to an agreed <Col N="948" /> 12.5% across the board. In an effort to ensure the objective of balanced regional development will be achieved, IDA Ireland has, through Government direction, over the past 18 months radically changed its policy with a commitment to delivering half of all new green field jobs into the Objective One regions in the coming years. The IDA is working to benefit the entire Border region and, in particular, towns such as Monaghan.</P>
    <P>Part of this strategy included the establishment of an IDA regional office in Cavan to increase its focus and marketing efforts in the mid-Border areas, of which Monaghan is a part. There are currently six IDA Ireland assisted companies in County Monaghan, employing more than 430 people, including Bose Products, Containers and Pressure Vessels Limited and Gernord Limited. Allied to IDA job creation initiatives, Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprises boards are also actively promoting the development of indigenous enterprises and they have been successful in creating very good and enduring employment throughout the region.</P>
    <P>There are currently 164 Enterprise Ireland assisted companies in County Monaghan, which employ more than 4,300 people. These are in a range of sectors, mainly manufacturing in the food processing, timber and furniture and engineering sectors. The natural resource based sector, which includes food processing, dominates among Enterprise Ireland client companies in the north east. Some of the major companies in County Monaghan include Barford Meats Limited, Kingspan GSP Limited, Lissadell Towels Limited and Rye Valley Foods Limited. In the company of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy O'Hanlon, I visited some of these companies during my term of office.</P>
    <P>The current strategy of the Enterprise Ireland's regional office in Dundalk is centred on the further development of the county's food processing sector, particularly that of prepared consumer food products, a market segment which is growing at 13% annually. The development of an integrated food enterprise park at Lough Egish is seen as the core of a food industry cluster in the region, which is anticipated will copperfasten County Monaghan's excellent reputation in the production of quality foodstuffs for export markets. Discussions are under way with Bord Gáis Éireann on the commercial viability of extending the natural gas pipeline from Kingscourt to Lough Egish.</P>
    <P>The food enterprise park, emanating from a model partnership between the community, the private sector and State agencies, currently employs more than 300 people. Kozy Shack Enterprises Inc. of the US has commenced production in the Lough Egish food park, Castleblaney, County Monaghan, to manufacture and supply chilled desserts to European markets. <Col N="949" /> Combi Lift won the prestigious Ernst and Young entrepreneur of the year award in November, 2001, and now goes on to the world final in Monte Carlo in April next.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland recognises the essential need for balanced regional economic development and its regional structure reflects the commitment to deliver a proactive response to regional needs. The north east regional office of Enterprise Ireland deals principally with companies that employ more than ten people. The special needs of these businesses are addressed by regionally based development advisors who provide a proactive approach to meeting their client needs. In adopting this approach, Enterprise Ireland is putting increased effort into and emphasis on assisting businesses to improve and sustain their competitiveness by utilising the considerable expertise of the agency's development advisors working directly with their client companies. Monaghan County Enterprise Board, which I initiated some time ago, has supported the creation of more than 450 new jobs in small enterprises since 1997.</P>
    <P>As regards the establishment of a business park in Monaghan town, IDA Ireland has statutory responsibility for the provision of industrial property. IDA Ireland owns a 30 acre business park in the town. It points out that the availability of an advance factory is critical to securing a project for Monaghan and the agency has secured planning permission for the construction of a 25,000 square foot factory. It is currently endeavouring to secure a developer to provide this facility. In addition, to bring the business park up to the appropriate standard required to attract foreign direct investment, it employed consultants to master plan the entire site. Arising out of this, the agency is currently applying for planning permission for a 20,000 square foot office facility on the park and to upgrade the entrance and landscaping to make it more attractive to investors.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland has concluded a sale to Monaghan County Enterprise Board of a four acre site. The county development fund is constructing a facility to encourage investment in teleservices and software development, which is part of the Armagh Monaghan digital corridor, something I was deeply involved in with Deputy O'Hanlon, having visited the area and secured the necessary grants required for both developments. This is currently nearing completion and IDA Ireland will actively market this facility through its network of regional and overseas offices. Our Department of Education and Science is building a retraining centre on a two acre site formerly owned by IDA Ireland.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland to date has supported four county enterprise centres in County Monaghan. In June 2000, it approved a package of £100,000 to Monaghan county enterprise fund for the establishment of an enterprise centre in <Col N="950" /> Monaghan town, which is currently under construction. Enterprise Ireland also supported Ballybay business centre, Lough Egish enterprise centre and Castleblaney enterprise centre. I had the honour of opening many of these centres in recent years.</P>
    <P>Recent developments in Dundalk Institute of Technology and regional development centre have strengthened the support service to local industry and the college is a key resource in the development of high technology enterprise in the region. There are also two FÁS training centres which serve Monaghan, situated in Dundalk and Sligo. IDA Ireland is working closely with the third level colleges in the region to ensure the provision of relevant courses and training. The availability of suitably motivated and educated staff will be a key element in attracting quality employment to the area.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the CSO live register area analysis figures for County Monaghan show a drop of more than 20% in the past five years from 3,475 people in December 1996 to 2,752 in December 2001. While this is not entirely due to the efforts of the industrial development agencies, there is no doubt that their efforts have produced results in the region.</P>
    <P>As recently as yesterday, which the Deputy alluded to, the Tánaiste met a delegation of public representatives from County Monaghan and assured them that the ongoing and co-ordinated job creation efforts by the industrial development agencies in County Monaghan will continue to be a priority for these agencies.</P>
    <P>Deputies in the House can be assured that we will leave no stone unturned to ensure that the positive and proactive progress that we made in County Monaghan will continue during the lifetime of the national development plan between now and 2006 to ensure that equality of opportunity exists for all the people in County Monaghan to be involved in mainstream economic activity and employment opportunities in that beloved county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification from the Minister on the time scale for Carbury national school, the Mall, Sligo. The school has inadequate accommodation for six teachers and 146 pupils. Will the Minister tell us the progress on the selection of the preferred scheme option, the steps taken to locate the new school, and deal with it this evening? The Minister will indicate in his reply that the highest allocation of building funds in 2002 is &euro;153 million, which is a high level, but, in light of that, will he ensure that the building project at Carbury school is part of this year's plan? The Minister should indicate when he will instruct that the architectural planning and the preparation of ten<Col N="951" /> der documents be expedited as it is important that we have that information now.</P>
      <P>Carbury national school was built 25 years ago with accommodation comprising four classrooms and a general purpose room. That room has been occupied by a fifth class for 16 years and this year the school had to obtain a portacabin for the sixth class and another smaller one for a resource teacher based at the school. The school has a definite need for more accommodation and the Department of Education and Science has accepted that case in principle. It takes time to arrange architectural drawings and tender documents and the &euro;153 million allocated is a considerable sum. However, I appeal to the Minister of State, in light of that allocation and the state of the economy in general, to indicate to the management of the school as to when they can plan for this new building.</P>
      <P>The planning process involves two schemes. Scheme one involves extending the present school building at ground floor level and constructing a second storey on top of that building, while scheme two involves the complete demolition of the present building and the construction of a completely new building. Estimates show there is little difference in the cost of these two schemes and the board has decided that scheme two is the preferred choice, as it avoids the restrictions which come with extending an existing building. The new building can be sited so as to maximise the play area for pupils rather than having a restricted site. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the second scheme is the one the Department proceeds with.</P>
      <P>This is a very important issue. There has been unprecedented prosperity on the island and primary school facilities have developed over the years. However, this issue has been raised since I became a Member and the school's board of management has been more than patient. It has done everything asked of it by the Department. It is waiting for a clear indication and I hope the Minister of State will indicate that he will allow this project to proceed to the stage of architectural planning and the preparation of tender documents. I hope the Minister of State announces this in terms of future enrolment. The indications are that numbers will certainly increase, despite some classes being in portakabins and the resource teacher's inadequate facilities. This school serves a huge area of north Sligo, Sligo town and beyond. The dedicated teaching staff and management have over the years endured inadequate facilities but in 2002, when the Minister has announced unprecedented funding, we in Sligo want some of the &euro;153 million that the Minister has indicated as being available. I hope the Minister of State indicates tonight that the school will get the go-ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Arís, I am glad to outline the Department's current position regarding the building project for Carbury national school, the Mall, Sligo. The school has a staffing complement of principal, five mainstream class teachers, a shared remedial teacher and a shared resource teacher. The enrolment of 30 September 2001 was 148 pupils. The school's facilities consist of four classrooms, a general purposes room and a related portakabin classroom, which the Deputy mentioned.</P>
      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is, as the Deputy said, &euro;153.6 million, a record level of funding which demonstrates the Government's commitment to improving the accommodation in primary schools such as the Carbury school under our expanded schools building programme.</P>
      <P>Because of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary schools building area since the Government took office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction. This has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity. A building project for Carbury school is in the early stages of architectural planning. This process will continue to the preparation of tender documents and the invitation of tenders as soon as it is possible to do so under the expanded building programme. The Department is fully committed to the provision of improved accommodation at Carbury national school and I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position. As the architectural planning proceeds, as soon as conclusions are arrived at we will be delighted to make the relevant decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the chance to raise the need for a new purpose-built school for Malahide community school. It is one of the largest post-primary schools in the country. It was built 25 years ago to accommodate 750 students but today the enrolment has reached almost 1,120 with a projected enrolment of 1,200 students in the near future. This has been achieved by adding extra prefabricated accommodation on a piecemeal basis over the years to the detriment of the campus. As a former member of the board of management I assure the House from experience that the provision of further extensions to the school in such a manner would be time-consuming, inefficient, more expensive and detrimental to the education of the students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The choice of subjects on offer to the students over the years has been limited as the school has been unable to provide specialist subjects due to overcrowding and a shortage of accommodation. Parents, students and teachers have stated clearly that enough is enough. Denis Crowley of J S Atkins, Architects, has carried out an assessment of the potential of the whole campus. His pro<Col N="953" /> posed two options are the refurbishment-extension of the existing development or an entirely new two storey building. The refurbishment-extension option would involve the decanting of students over prolonged periods and as the site is relatively small, it would limit the circulation area and playing areas of 1,200 students. It would also reduce the capacity for monitoring and supervision of students in the campus area. The decanting of students to alternative accommodation could mean significant costs as well as other implications for examination students.</P>
    <P>Over the years the school has maintained an enrolment policy to accommodate students from its traditional catchment areas, including many students from Donabate and Portrane, where there are no second level education facilities. This policy has satisfied the Department's requirements and the school has put up with much hardship and disruption over the years. On behalf of the current students, parents, the wider community of Malahide and representatives of the five local national schools, I demand that a new purpose-built school be sanctioned and that this decision be made immediately. An early and favourable decision is vital as parents of incoming children for the 2002-03 year have relayed their concerns about the inadequate provision of classrooms, specialist rooms, amenities, canteen facilities, toilets and social areas because of lack of space.</P>
    <P>The board of management has refused 28 applications for the first year intake for the 2002-03 school year. Parents urgently need to know the outcome of the Department's decision so they can plan ahead for where their children go to school. No commitments on the basis of &ldquo;We're in support of the objective of meeting the requirement&rdquo; is satisfactory. Specific commitments are needed. At a time of unprecedented growth in our economy, when ours is one of the richest countries in the world, it is not too much to expect that students of Malahide community school will be provided with a modern, top quality school structure with the necessary infrastructure to enable teachers to play their role in enabling their students fulfil their potential.</P>
    <P>I compliment the dedicated teachers of this school over the years for ensuring, notwithstanding the shortcomings in the infrastructure, a high standard of education in this school, Pobalscoil Íosa. A new school is required and nothing less is acceptable to the people of Malahide and its catchment area.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the Department's current position on this matter. In June 1998 the school authority made an application to the Department for an extension of school accommodation. The Department requested the school authority to provide infor<Col N="954" /> mation on the internal arrangements which it would propose for a long-term projected enrolment of 1,050 pupils. On receipt of this information a schedule of overall accommodation was prepared by the Department for agreement by the school authority. Subsequently the school authority indicated that it considered a long-term projected enrolment of 1,200 pupils more realistic and appealed to the Department to revise the figure of 1,050. This was done and a revised schedule of overall accommodation was prepared based on the higher figure. The school authority accepted this schedule.</P>
      <P>The Department commissioned a feasibility study on the school in April 2000. The study is based on the original long-term projected enrolment of 1,050 pupils and consequent schedule of overall accommodation. It put forward three options for the provision of additional accommodation at Malahide community school. Option 1 proposed the renovation and extension of existing accommodation at an estimated cost of &euro;4.9 million, inclusive of VAT. Option 2 proposed demolishing the existing building and building a new two storey school on existing school lands at an estimated cost of &euro;7.2 million, inclusive of VAT. Option 3 was a variation of option 2 and also proposed demolishing the existing building and rebuilding on unused school lands at an estimated cost of &euro;7.4 million, inclusive of VAT.</P>
      <P>Upon examination of the feasibility study option 1 appeared to be the most cost effective, particularly taking into account the recently completed re-roofing and drainage projects at the school. The re-roofing project was carried out at a cost of &euro;365,521.47. The drainage works were carried out at a cost of &euro;292,016.27. However, I am aware that the preferred option of the community school has always been a complete new building.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Department met representatives from the school authority to discuss the project and agree to an approach to the project that will lead to the delivery of additional permanent accommodation at the earliest possible date in view of accommodation pressures at the school. A full design team, an architect, quantity surveyor, structural engineer, and a mechanical and electrical engineer, was appointed through the Official Journal of the European Communities in August 2001. A meeting was convened in September 2001 at the Tullamore office of the Department at which officials from the Department, the school authority and the design team met to discuss the brief for the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was explained at this meeting that the design team had been appointed to redevelop the school. This meant that the decision as to whether additional accommodation would be provided by means of refurbishment and extension of the existing premises or whether there would be a completely new building would have to be <Col N="955" /> explored in full by it. It was informed that the Department is the client for the project, but that it must liaise with the school to achieve the appropriate design solution. The school, as end user, has an important input. The design team was requested to consider issues such as value for money, the projected life span of a refurbished portion of the building and the possibility of a phased delivery of the project.</P>
    <P>The design team was also informed at the meeting of the proposed programme for the project. It was anticipated that stages 1 and 2 of architectural planning would be complete by December 2001. The aim then is to have stages 3 and 4 complete by April 2002. Assuming there are no complications in obtaining planning permission, it is anticipated that stage 5 will be completed by 31 September 2002 and the project could then go to tender.</P>
    <P>Officials from the Department recently visited Malahide community school to discuss interim solutions to the difficulties regarding the shortage of accommodation in the short term. Plans have been put in place to arrange temporary accommodation during the construction of the new permanent accommodation. It is anticipated that this accommodation will be in place for September 2002.</P>
    <P>A pre-stage 1 and 2 meeting was convened in the Tullamore office in November 2001 which the school authority and design team and officials from the Department attended. The objective of the meeting was to discuss progress of the stage 1 and 2 report and resolve any issues that the school authority or the design team wished to raise.</P>
    <P>The stage 1 and 2 report was submitted to the Department, as agreed previously in September, on 21 December 2001. It outlined eight possible options for the redevelopment of Malahide community school. The design team presented several options, recommending a new building option with the demolition of the existing junior and senior blocks as being the optimum architectural solution to the redevelopment. The recommended option is, however, the most expensive at &euro;11.5 million. As the Department is charged with the responsibility of ensuring the best value for money is obtained from any investment in a school, it could not justify committing itself to this option without exploring further some of the refurbishment and extension options, which range in price from &euro;9.6 million to &euro;11.02 million, as outlined in the design team's report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a delaying tactic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we do not operate like Fabius Cunctator. As may be gathered from the price range, all the options under consideration will result in considerable upgrading and extension of <Col N="956" /> the school. The design team has been asked to explore some of the refurbishment options further. This information, once submitted, will enable the Department to make a clear judgment on which is the best option in ensuring the needs of the school are met, while ensuring the best possible value for money is obtained. The Department must be convinced that the design solution will provide a building, which is viable from an educational, architectural and economic point of view.</P>
      <P>The Department is undertaking to make every effort to complete the architectural design process, up to and including the obtaining of planning permission to be in a position to invite tenders for a construction contract as quickly as possible. This will involve all the parties engaged in it &ndash; the school, the Department and the design team &ndash; working in close liaison throughout the life of the project.</P>
      <P>I again thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity of outlining the current and future position to the House. We have given a clear indication pertaining to our commitment, dates of schedule and conclusion. We are confident that working together with a coherent, cohesive and positive attitude there will be a positive conclusion for all parties very soon.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Water and Sewerage Schemes.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is not present, but I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, will provide him with a synopsis of the debate. This issue affects not only County Roscommon, but also the Minister of State's constituency of Galway East. For a number of years Roscommon County Council has had a proposal before the Department of the Environment and Local Government for the development of a new sewerage scheme for Creagh, south Roscommon, adjoining the town of Ballinasloe. However, it is not feasible to proceed with this development due to the fact that the sewerage scheme to which it would connect is located in Ballinasloe, County Galway. For Roscommon County Council to proceed with the scheme it must connect to Ballinasloe UDC's treatment plant. However, Ballinasloe UDC's plant does not have the capacity to meet the additional demand that would have to be catered for with the connection to south Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Department to deal with both applications together &ndash; the application from Ballinasloe UDC and that from Roscommon County Council &ndash; in relation to the town of Ballinasloe and Creagh, County Roscommon. This is the only feasible way it can be done. The Creagh area is of fundamental economic importance to south Roscommon and it is vitally important that the scheme goes ahead, not just because of its <Col N="957" /> location in the hinterland of Ballinasloe, but also because it contains the only access point in County Roscommon to the proposed new motorway between Dublin and Galway. To ensure County Roscommon is on a level playing field with other counties along the new M6 it is important that approval is given for the scheme with the Ballinasloe sewerage scheme.</P>
    <P>The problem is that the Ballinasloe sewerage scheme application only considers the capacity and demand required to be met in the County Galway element. It does not consider the proposal submitted from County Roscommon. Roscommon County Council is left with the alternative of proposing a further sewerage scheme in the town of Ballinasloe. At present there are two sewerage schemes serving the town of Ballinasloe, one run by Ballinasloe UDC and the other by the Western Health Board. Now the Department of the Environment and Local Government is in the position where it has to consider a third sewerage scheme in the town of Ballinasloe, yet, Athlone, in excess of twice the size of Ballinasloe, has had for many years only one sewerage scheme serving it.</P>
    <P>In terms of value for money it makes sense that the two schemes would be connected and approval given for both in conjunction with each other in order that both can be developed together. The difficulty lies with Ballinasloe UDC and Galway County Council, the net beneficiaries of the system as it stands. Young people from south Roscommon cannot get planning permission in south Roscommon because there is no development land with sewerage schemes available. They must go to County Galway before they can get planning permission. This may suit Deputy Treacy but young people who were born, bred and reared in County Roscommon must go and live in County Galway if they want to live locally. Section 86 of the Local Government Act, 2001, states that two local authorities may make arrangements for joint discharge of their functions. If that does not happen, the Minister has the authority to force the local authorities to come forward with a joint proposal. I ask the Minister to use his powers under section 87 of the Local Government Act, 2001, to force both Ballinasloe UDC and Roscommon County Council to make a joint proposal to the Department of the Environment and Local Government for the development of a sewerage scheme in Creagh and in the town of Ballinasloe. There should be a redevelopment of the treatment plant on the banks of the River Suck. A co-ordinated approach would be of mutual benefit to the counties of Roscommon and Galway and would benefit the town of Ballinasloe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity of replying to Deputy Naughten on a matter in which I have a great personal interest. <Col N="958" /> I regret that this beautiful area and these wonderful people are not in the county of Galway and the constituency of Galway East. Perhaps Deputy Naughten and I might agree a consensus on how we could achieve their absorption into the greater Ballinasloe area.</P>
      <P>The provision of modern environmental infrastructure to support social and economic objectives has been a major focus of Government spending over the past four and a half years. The unprecedented increase in investment by the Department of the Environment and Local Government during that period on water and sewerage schemes has made a key contribution to the remarkable economic growth that has benefited every part of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Total investment in water and sewerage facilities over the period of the National Development Plan 2000-2006, will amount to almost &euro;4.4 billion, of which more than &euro;3.8 billion is earmarked for major public schemes. This investment is aimed at supporting economic and social development, employment generation and the achievement of high environmental standards.</P>
      <P>The additional water production capacity generated by the resulting expansion of the Department's water services investment programme during the first year of the NDP alone in 2000, equated with the average daily requirements of more than 300,000 people. This represented, in just one year, 36% of the corresponding figure for the entire 1994 to 1999 period. The increase in waste water treatment capacity in the same year represented the requirements of a population equivalent of 180,000 &ndash; almost half the entire increase between 1994 and 1999. When the figures for 2001 become available shortly, I am confident they will be just as impressive.</P>
      <P>Funding is being provided under the water services investment programme for new schemes in every single county. The total allocated for County Roscommon under the first phase of the programme amounts to just over &euro;58 million in respect of 13 schemes. About half of this, more than &euro;28 million, relates to five large sewerage schemes &ndash; Ballaghadereen, Boyle, Monskland, Roscommon town and Castlerea. Major water schemes, such as the north east Roscommon water augmentation and treatment scheme, the Arigna regional water supply scheme, the Boyle-Ardcarne regional water supply scheme, and the Roscommon central regional water supply schemes are also included. Funding has also been provided under the serviced land initiative to bring additional serviced residential sites on stream as rapidly as possible to meet housing needs at a variety of locations around the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in drawing up the current water services investment programme covering the period 2000 to 2002, which was announced in July 2000, the Department took into account the list of water and sewerage <Col N="959" /> schemes identified as priorities by Roscommon County Council. All local authorities were asked to undertake fresh assessments of the need for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments.</P>
    <P>Creagh sewerage scheme was fifth on the list of sewerage scheme adopted as priorities at the time by Roscommon County Council. Three of the schemes ahead of it on the priority list were approved under the programme. However, given the lower rating afforded to the Creagh scheme by the council, the level of competing national demand, and the funding available, it was not possible to approve it at the time. In the meantime, a draft brief for the appointment of consultants to prepare a preliminary report for sewerage schemes at 16 villages in Roscommon, including Creagh, has been submitted to the Department by the council for consideration.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the current water services programme is only the first phase of a strategy that will be progressively rolled forward on a phased basis up to the end of the national development plan in 2006. Further schemes will be added to the programme in each future phase. The Creagh scheme will be considered for approval in the context of the next phase of the <Col N="960" /> programme, in light of the council's identified priorities at the time. The Deputy can also be assured that the points he has made in the House this evening will be taken into account when the new schemes are being selected for approval.</P>
    <P>I agree completely with Deputy Naughten. It is illogical that there are two local authorities which are joined together at one point and where there is a grave need for the upgrading of the environmental infrastructure. There is no reason we could not find common agreement and have one authority responsible to ensure that equality of opportunity would prevail for all the people. I will convey Deputy Naughten's request to the Minister to see whether we can find common ground. It shocks me to hear Deputy Naughten say that there is not sufficient capacity in the Ballinasloe sewerage scheme to include this small area. We installed one of the most sophisticated and modern systems in Ballinasloe just two years ago. It serves the town &ndash; our county town &ndash; and I cannot understand how there could be a problem with capacity. I will speak to the Minister. If we can achieve co-operation from Galway, Roscommon and Ballinasloe, we will be able to progress rapidly on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 5 February 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements are in place for the recognition in this State of teachers who are recognised teachers in another member state of the EU and to whom the terms of Council Directive 89/48/EEC apply. Statutory Instrument 1/91, by which Council Directive 89/48/EEC on the Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications was implemented, stipulates that the Minister for Education and Science is the designated authority for the recognition of teachers in primary, community, comprehensive and vocational schools, and that the registration council, with the approval of the Minister, is the designated authority in the case of teachers in voluntary secondary schools.</P>
      <P>At primary level, teachers are class teachers rather than subject specialists and must be qualified to teach the range of primary school subjects to children aged four to 12 years. To be fully recognised to teach at primary level in this country, teachers must have undertaken a recognised primary teaching training course and possess a recognised primary teaching qualification. Primary teachers trained outside the State, whose qualifications have been assessed and accepted by my Department but who do not possess an appropriate Irish language qualification, are granted a five year period of provisional recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools. However, teachers from abroad who qualified as second level teachers in their country of origin and who have not undertaken an appropriate conversion course in primary teacher training are not accepted for the purpose of recognition to teach in a permanent capacity in primary schools. This is in line with what pertains in relation to qualified second level teachers who trained in this State and who have not undergone a postgraduate conversion course to qualify as a primary teacher. Such teachers are not recognised to teach in a permanent capacity in primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To be recognised to teach at second level a teacher must, in general, hold a degree of a recognised university that will enable them to teach at least one subject from the second level curriculum. In addition, in voluntary secondary, community and comprehensive schools, the teacher <Col N="962" /> must also hold a suitable training-in-teaching qualification, such as the Higher Diploma in Education, which would enable the teacher to teach his or her specialist subject(s) to students in the age range generally of 12 to 18. Common criteria are used, by the registration council and my Department, for assessing the suitability of the qualifications of all applicants for teaching in this State. A teacher who is recognised as a fully qualified teacher in a member state of the EU may apply to my Department for similar recognition in this State. Full recognition is granted to such applicants where the appropriate authority is satisfied that the qualifications held by the applicant are of an equivalent standard to those required for teaching at second level in this State. Where a substantial shortfall in the education and training of the applicant is identified, provisional recognition may be granted on the applicant undertaking to make good the shortfall within the required time limits by means of either passing an aptitude test or completing an adaptation period.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1999, in addition to the academic requirements which I have outlined, teachers had to have a recognised qualification in the Irish language to be recognised as a fully qualified second level teacher. This requirement no longer applies to the generality of teachers at second level since the beginning of the 1999-2000 school year. This change has meant that, subject to their having acceptable academic qualifications, it is easier for teachers, including those trained in other EU countries, to gain full recognition in this State.</P>

      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1969 to 1992, provides for means tested higher education grants to assist students to attend full-time third level education. An approved course for the purposes of the higher education grants scheme is, generally speaking, a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years' duration or a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year duration pursued in an approved third level institution. The institutions approved under the scheme are, generally speaking, publicly funded third level colleges offering full-time courses at undergraduate and postgraduate level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly under the terms of the free fees initiative whereby the State meets the tuition costs of eligible students, an approved course is defined as a full-time undergraduate course of a <Col N="963" /> minimum duration of two years in an approved third level institution.</P>
    <P>Courses provided by the Open University are not approved courses under the terms of the maintenance grant schemes or the free fees initiative. Tax relief is, however, available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved distance education courses provided in Ireland by approved colleges or institutions in another member state of the EU. In common with other institutions, the Open University may seek to have specific courses designated as approved courses for tax relief purposes. An extension of the scope of the free fees initiative or the maintenance grant schemes to provide for students pursuing distance education courses, on a similar basis as currently exists for full-time students, could only be considered having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector.</P>

      <P>Significant and complex issues arise in relation to access to the teaching profession by people with disabilities. I am making arrangements to establish a working group to examine and review the present arrangements in consultation with relevant interests, and having regard to best international practice in this area. I am asking the group to expedite its work and report to me at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="964" />At present, the courses run in the State that allow for appointment to a permanent post in a primary school are the three year bachelor of education degree and the full-time 18 month graduate diploma in primary teaching. Both of these courses are run in the colleges of education, which specialise in the training of primary teachers. The bachelor of education, B.Ed., degree programme offered at the colleges of education is designed to equip teachers to teach the full range of subjects in the Irish primary school curriculum. Teachers who have obtained a B.Ed. degree from these colleges are permitted to teach in all national schools where they are required to complete a successful probationary period leading to full recognition as a primary teacher. During the B.Ed. programme students must develop competencies in the full range of subjects to be taught in national schools, including Irish, and the award of the B.Ed. degree signifies that the teacher involved is competent to teach all subjects on the curriculum. Consequently, the study of Irish is a core component in the B.Ed. programme, and students entering colleges of education are required to have a minimum competence in this subject in their leaving certificate examination. At present there is no undergraduate course in the State specifically designed to train candidates, either hearing or deaf, to teach deaf children.</P>
    <P>My Department will grant restricted recognition to the following categories of teachers: teachers who trained outside the State, including teachers who trained outside the EU, with a recognised primary teacher qualification for teaching the aspects of the primary school curriculum to pupils aged four to 12 years; teachers with the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full-time course in the Association Montessori Internationale College, Mount St. Mary's, Milltown, Dublin 14; and teachers with the national diploma or degree in humanities in Montessori education from St. Nicholas Montessori College, Dun Laoghaire, which is accredited by HETAC.</P>
    <P>I have had inquiries made in relation to entry requirements to the two Montessori colleges and I understand that Irish is not an essential subject for entry to the Association Montessori Internationale College in Milltown. Teachers with restricted recognition are eligible to teach only in certain categories of special schools, such as special schools for hearing impaired children, and in special classes in mainstream schools, that is, where Irish is not a curricular requirement.</P>

This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997. Because of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity. Records are not prepared on a constituency basis. However, I will be pleased to provide the Deputy with information on any specific building project on which he may have an interest.</P>

      <P>The 1995 OECD international adult literacy survey found some 500,000 adults in Ireland scoring at the bottom literacy level. The adult literacy budget has been increased from just more than &euro;1 million prior to 1997 to &euro;16.46 million in the current year, and participation in VEC literacy schemes has been increased from 5,000 in 1997 to 18,862 by the end of June 2001. In addition to this some 235,000 people per week availed of help in their own homes through watching the second TV series &ldquo;Read Write Now&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The national adult literacy strategy was given top priority in the White Paper on Adult Education: Learning for Life, published in 2000. Investment in this area has increased 16 fold since 1997, and the funds are being used to expand the scale and scope of provision, support awareness promotion, outreach, the development of referral networks and flexible provision and to promote quality. New forms of provision such as family learning, workplace learning, provision for special needs, and for those for whom English is not the mother tongue form part of the strategy, as well as optimising the use of TV and radio, so that people can access help in the privacy of their own homes. The TV and radio programmes have been supported by the provision of free learner packs and a freephone helpline manned by trained tutors provided by the national adult literacy agency. Videos of the TV series are being made available free in adult literacy centres, training centres, libraries and video outlets.</P>

      <P>I allocated 50 additional posts for guidance and counselling to second level schools this year under the guidance enhancement initiative to enhance the provision of guidance to young people at risk, to improve links between schools and the world of work and to improve the take-up of science subjects. This initiative, which benefits 103 schools throughout the country, is being monitored by a group representative of the partners in education.</P>
      <P>There are now more guidance counsellors employed by schools than at any previous time. A total of 630 whole-time teacher equivalents, inclusive of the 50 posts under the guidance enhancement initiative, have been allocated to second level schools this year. As a result, schools, whatever their size, are in a position to ensure that pupils have access to counselling and career guidance by qualified personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the current availability of guidance services, the results of an audit of all second <Col N="967" /> level schools conducted on behalf of my Department by the National Centre for Guidance in Education clearly show that a significant number of schools are not fully utilising the resources currently being made available to them by my Department for guidance and that, in many schools, the service is not adequately targeted at pupils at risk. In these circumstances, my first priority is to ensure that the resources made available to schools for guidance are fully utilised for that purpose.</P>
    <P>In line with the Government's priority to promote social inclusion, my other priority is to ensure that those young people who are most at risk of dropping out of the education system early are a major focus of guidance provision in schools. As a result, any future enhancement of provision to individual schools will be conditional on their making a commitment to providing a service to all their pupils which would reflect Government priorities and their pupils' needs.</P>
    <P>The National Centre for Guidance in Education has provided a wide range of support materials for guidance counsellors and schools generally. It is currently finalising new and detailed guidelines for schools on guidance provision. It is essential that schools should see guidance as an integral part of whole school provision and guidance and counselling should form part of the school development planning process.</P>
    <P>Equally, schools are encouraged to use resources provided under other initiatives, such as the stay at school retention initiative to enhance their guidance provision, especially for those pupils most at risk.</P>
    <P>Ireland is taking part in an international study of guidance provision currently being undertaken by the OECD in 14 countries. The study involves a detailed examination by an expert team from the OECD of all aspects of guidance provision for school pupils and adults. The report of the study will be published by the OECD during 2003.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the lifetime of the Government, my Department has identified a significant range of primary and second level schools where facilities require to be upgraded and put together a record programme of works that comprise new <Col N="968" /> build, extensions to existing buildings and upgrading of existing facilities. This has been possible because of the Government's unprecedented and sustained investment in first and second level educational infrastructure. Last year alone, more than &euro;316 million was expended on schools' infrastructure and in the current year a sum in excess of &euro;335 million has been allocated for school buildings. This is almost four times more than the 1997 allocation.</P>
      <P>There has been a sea change in the level of activity in the building programme. A comparison between 1997 and 2001 demonstrates this. In 1997, only 22 primary schools projects of any significance were under way and only ten of these exceeded &euro;318,000. In contrast, currently there are 79 primary school projects valued at over &euro;318,000 each in construction. At second level, in 1997 only 12 projects were sanctioned compared to a record 125 projects each valued in excess of &euro;635,000 incurring liabilities in 2001.</P>
      <P>Over and above the programme of major works some 1,400 minor primary school projects were sanctioned in 2001 at a cost of &euro;44 million. These are projects each valued at less than &euro;318,000. At post-primary level, in 2001 there were in excess of 650 minor projects incurring over &euro;31 million. These were projects each costing less than &euro;634,000. Hundreds more schools will receive funding for minor works this year to meet urgent needs as they arise.</P>
      <P>To support this expanded building programme going forward and to facilitate the more precise targeting of available funding, my Department has recently commenced a pilot inventory of school accommodation in County Kildare. It is intended to use experience gained in the pilot phase of the project to expand the inventory nationwide. Over the next number of months, each school in the pilot area will be visited by qualified personnel who will assess and report on site conditions, space norms within the schools and the overall condition of each school. Ultimately, all the data accumulated will be stored electronically on a geographic information system database and will be of great value in prioritising capital funding for first and second level projects.</P>

      <P>Each board of management is responsible for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair and efficient code of behaviour. This code should ensure that the individuality of each child is accommodated while acknowledging the right of each child to education in a relatively disruption free environment. It should include provision <Col N="969" /> for dealing with serious breaches of discipline and continuously disruptive pupils.</P>
      <P>My Department has issued guidelines to boards of management to assist them in discharging their obligations in the area of school discipline. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school. These guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of suspensions and expulsions only as a last resort.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have brought forward a comprehensive range of legislative measures in the Education (Welfare) Act to address general issues related to school attendance and discipline in schools. The legislation provides for the establishment of a National Educational Welfare Board with responsibility for monitoring school attendance on a country-wide basis. I have already set up this board on an interim basis and it has begun its work. The board will employ educational welfare officers, who will be deployed locally to assist all recognised primary and second level schools. The Act requires schools to report suspensions for a period of not less than six days to their local educational welfare officer. Schools will also be required to report to their educational welfare officer before expelling any student. In such instances, the role of the educational welfare officer will be to bring together the relevant parties to try to identify a mutually agreeable solution to provide for the education of the student concerned. The automatic involvement of the educational welfare officer in these situations will provide a key means for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of school.</P>

      <Quest>the steps he will take to tackle the growing problem of the increasing number of low grades in maths awarded in the leaving certificate; and his views on the direct correlation between this and students working part-time as reported by the chief examiner.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My first response to the lower than expected results in last year's ordinary level mathematics examination was to have the matter investigated within my Department from the widest possible perspective. This has been done and the report on the findings has been published. This is the report to which the Deputy refers. An immediate benefit of circulating this report widely is that public awareness of issues that influence the performance of students in ordinary level leaving certificate mathematics has been heightened. In particular, a comprehensive set of recommendations towards improvement has been made available to all concerned. Such awareness is important as schools, parents, third level insti<Col N="970" /> tutions, employers and others have parts to play in addressing this problem.</P>
      <P>The difficulties experienced by students in mathematics in the junior cycle are cited in the report, and indeed elsewhere, as one of the main causes of subsequent poor performance. I have taken a number of steps to address this issue. The syllabi for junior certificate mathematics have been revised. The objective of the revision is to ensure that students will be more competent in basic skills and that they will have deeper understandings of fundamental concepts. In addition, my Department is providing an extensive programme of in-career development for teachers. The aim of this is to widen the range of methodologies used by teachers in classrooms and to make the learning of mathematics more relevant and appealing to students. In this academic year so far, some 2,200 teachers have each had one day's in-service training and further opportunities are being made available.</P>
      <P>The investigation also highlighted issues relating to the lack of recognition of foundation level mathematics by third level institutions. As a consequence, it appears that significant numbers of students may opt to take ordinary level mathematics even though the course is ill-suited to their ability levels. In the report, third level institutions and employers are strongly urged to review their entry requirements and in particular, to reconsider the position of students presenting with high grades in foundation level mathematics. My Department intends to establish equivalences between different levels of the subject in the near future with a view to facilitating such work.</P>
      <P>In regard to students working part-time, the report goes no further than to suggest that this may be one of a number of possible explanations for the increase in the low grades. It stresses that concrete evidence to support this assertion is not available. The purpose of the suggestion is to draw attention to the possible negative effects of this growing phenomenon on achievement in leaving certificate mathematics.</P>

      <P>At present, under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, it is open to past victims of abuse in residential institutions to seek records relating to them held by the Department.</P>
      <P>I recognise that there are some concerns with the current system for the release of information from the Department under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act's provisions in relation to requests from former residents of the old industrial and reformatory schools. Such requests for information are currently dealt with directly by the Department under the complex provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. Delays in responding to these requests have arisen due to the complexities of the legal provisions under which the requests are processed and as a result of the large volume of requests. I also consider the current mechanism for dealing with these requests as being too impersonal and legalistic given the sensitive personal information that is at issue here for the former residents.</P>
      <P>For these reasons, I approved funding for the establishment of a new national service for former residents of institutions under the aegis of the Department who wish to trace their personal records and-or families. The intention is to provide a comprehensive and compassionate service to former residents of these institutions. The new information and tracing service will be managed and provided by Barnardos, an organisation that has established competence and experience in the release of similar forms of information to persons in similar circumstances. The new service will primarily provide information to former residents of the institutions but will also offer tracing, intermediary and post-reunion support for those people wishing to follow up on the information they receive through the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of the Barnardos service is well advanced and the recruitment process for the personnel required for the service is currently <Col N="972" /> under way. I am sure the House will appreciate that the development of this professional and independent service will provide a significant addition and enhancement to the State's overall response to the former residents of the industrial and reformatory schools system.</P>

      <P>The criteria for funding an assessment are: that the school is eligible, without a NEPS service and that the school has not exceeded the figure of 2% of pupils assessed. The criteria for funding a school for assessments carried out in the past are: that the assessment took place between 1 July 2000 and 1 July 2001; that the psychologist who carried out the assessment has sent an invoice to the school; that the school principal has certified that the assessment has taken place and that the psychological report has been received in the school.

      <Quest>the number of primary teachers who are expected to graduate from training colleges in each of the next four years; the corresponding numbers of teachers who are expected to retire in that period; and his views on the adequacy on the current level of teacher training.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the next four years it is projected that 1,000 undergraduates will graduate from the training colleges each year. In addition, it is projected that 280 postgraduates will graduate in 2002 and 440 in 2003. It is projected that 280 postgraduates will qualify in 2004 and 2005. However, the projections for postgraduates in 2004 and 2005 will be finalised after further discussions with the colleges of education.</P>
      <P>It is projected that 580 teachers will retire on pension in each of the next four years. These projections include teachers retiring voluntarily, on compulsory grounds, those obtaining early retirement on grounds of ill health or under the early retirement scheme under the PCW agreement. Teachers may retire voluntarily with pension on reaching age 55 provided they have 35 years' service, or retire at any time after reaching age 60. Teachers who remain in teaching to compulsory retirement age must retire at age 65.</P>
      <P>In addition to retirements, there is a range of other factors that affect the demand for teachers at primary level. The Government since taking office has retained the demographic dividend arising at primary level each year and has also created an unprecedented number of new teaching posts. A total of 1,800 new teaching posts have been created at primary level which has enabled the Government to reduce the pupil teacher ratio from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 19:1 in the current school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The creation of this enormous number of additional teaching posts, allied to the fact that there are approximately 850 teachers on career break, 250 on secondment and 320 job sharing has created a huge demand for teachers in the short term. In addition to increasing the output of graduates, this Government has introduced other initiatives to increase the number of trained personnel. B.Ed. graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching <Col N="975" /> qualification are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
    <P>Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers and since September 2000 teachers employed in a temporary capacity holding a degree and the higher diploma in education are paid on the trained basic scale for teachers. Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU trained teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language. In addition, for the period of two years from 1 September 2000, teachers trained outside the EU whose qualifications are accepted by my Department will be granted provisional recognition for five years on the same basis as EU trained teachers.</P>
    <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the full-time course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, or the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full time course in the AMI college, are recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers and are recognised to teach in certain categories of special schools and classes. The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the increase in the number of graduates and the other measures I have implemented as outlined will help to meet the current and future needs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of broader support for PE, the primary schools' sports initiative is an important development. I launched this initiative in January 2001. It is concerned with the promotion of physical education, sport and healthy lifestyles in primary schools. It is being developed in the context of the physical education and social, personal and health education elements of the revised primary curriculum. A task force was appointed to <Col N="976" /> implement the initiative and is being supported by a national co-ordinator and two assistant co-ordinators. Under the initiative, a pilot project has been put in place, which will inform the national in-career support programme for PE, which is scheduled to commence in September 2003.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I introduced an annual physical education grant for all primary schools in 2000. Under the terms of this grant all schools designated as disadvantaged and schools in the rural phase of the Breaking the Cycle scheme receive an annual grant of &euro;1,269.74 or £1,000 per school while all other schools receive a grant of &euro;634.87 or £500. Circular 28/00 that issued from my Department to all schools in October 2000 outlined specific materials or activities on which schools may spend this grant. It is anticipated that this year's grant will issue to schools in March. Last year's grant amounted to &euro;2,359,173 or £1,858,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedures for deciding and approving the number of places on individual courses are generally a matter for the third level institution involved. The exceptions in this regard occur in the case of teacher training, where my Department sets the levels of intake having regard to national levels of supply and demand for teachers and in the case of undergraduate <Col N="977" /> medical training which is the subject of an annual intake quota, which was introduced in 1980-81 following a report of the Higher Education Authority. Furthermore, the Government has taken a number of initiatives to ensure a sufficient supply of skilled personnel in emerging labour market needs areas. An example is the provision of 5,400 IT-related third level places in response to the needs identified in the first report of the expert group on future skills needs. Another example is my recent announcement of the expansion of undergraduate pharmacy places to tackle the shortage of pharmacists.</P>
      <P>On the question of the relationship between the numbers approved for the first year of a course and those for the second and subsequent years of the same course, I am not aware of any practice whereby in certain courses only a certain percentage will be allowed through to the second year of the course. In its study of non-completion in undergraduate university courses, the Educational Research Centre considered data on students who did not progress from their chosen area of study from first to second year in the academic year 1993-94. This is the point at which non-progression from one year of a course to the next is most likely to occur. The data revealed that 2,210 students or 18.8% of the first year cohort did not progress immediately to second year. Of these, 11% had withdrawn from the institution before taking their first year examinations, while 16.2% withdrew having failed their examinations. A further 51.2% failed their first year examinations and were repeating the same course during the following year. Over 10% passed their first year examinations and did not progress to second year.</P>
      <P>The Educational Research Centre undertook a similar analysis of students not progressing from first to second year in the 1995-96 academic year in its study on non-completion in institute of technology courses. In this case, 3,890 students or 34.8% of the first year cohort did not progress immediately to second year. Of these, 34.3% had withdrawn from the institution before taking their first year examinations, while 44.4% withdrew having failed their examinations. A further 14.2% failed their first year examinations and were repeating the same course during the following year. Just under 3% of students who did not progress to second year had passed their examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The studies found major differences between the institutions both in terms of the information available on non-progression and in terms of the reasons for non-progression. The need for qualitative research to be undertaken into the factors influencing non-completion is well recognised and the Educational Research Centre has been requested to undertake qualitative research in both the university and technological sectors to identify the underlying causes of non-completion with a view to developing and improving strategies to deal with the issue. I am committed to tackling the issue of non-completion in third level <Col N="978" /> education and have requested the Higher Education Authority and the council of directors to expedite this qualitative research. In the meantime, a range of strategies and measures has been put in place to tackle non-completion at both national and institutional level.</P>

      <P>The grade of principal is one of a number of education grades currently being examined by the public service benchmarking body. Benchmarking is basically about comparing public service pay and jobs with pay and jobs across the economy with a view to ensuring that public service pay rates compare favourably with comparable employment in the private sector. In reaching its recommendations, the benchmarking body is to have regard to the need to recruit, retain and motivate staff with the qualifications, skills and flexibility required to exercise their responsibilities. The benchmarking body has been asked to produce its report by 30 June 2002.</P>
      <P>Issues in relation to the conditions of service of principals are appropriate for discussion at the Teachers' Conciliation Council. The Deputy will, however, be aware that significant increases in the allowances paid to principals were approved as part of the PCW agreement on the pay and conditions of teachers.</P>
      <P>At primary level, the Government has made significant improvements in the conditions of service of principal teachers since taking office. Administrative principals were previously appointed to primary schools with eight or more mainstream class teachers. They are now appointed to all schools with six mainstream class teachers. I have also introduced an arrangement whereby in schools with principal plus ten or more teachers, including ex-quota posts, the principal may be appointed as an administrative principal.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the release time scheme for principals of smaller primary schools by this Government marked a significant improvement in the conditions of service for the principals in those schools. The release time enables the teaching principal to be released for a specified number of days annually to undertake administrative, leadership and management functions in the school. Substitution cover, paid for by my Department, is provided for the days the principals are on release time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enhanced in-career supports for principals are also being put in place. In this regard, a team has been appointed to develop a school management/leadership programme for principals and deputy principals of primary and second-level schools. It is intended that the preparatory <Col N="979" /> work on the programme will be completed by the end of the current school year, with the delivery of the programme to commence in the coming school year.</P>

      <P>My Department maintains a database of pupils enrolled in post primary schools. However, the database does not hold information in relation to the ethnic status of pupils. Accordingly, verified data in the format requested by the Deputy is not available.</P>
      <P>My Department's national education officer for Travellers conducts an annual survey in relation to the number of Traveller children enrolled in post-primary schools. This survey is carried out using data collected by my Department's visiting teacher service for Travellers and is based on the number of Traveller children enrolled in schools on 30 September. It is estimated that there are approximately 1,400 Traveller children enrolled in post-primary schools in the current school year. It is also estimated that approximately 220 children are enrolled in the third year of the junior cycle and that approximately 65 pupils are enrolled in the final year of the senior cycle or in post leaving certificate courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" />This represents a significant improvement in the level of Traveller participation at all levels of the post-primary sector. However, there is much more work to be done before participation rates and retention to junior certificate and leaving certificate levels is similar to those achieved by other categories of pupils. My Department allocates additional teaching and financial resources to post-primary schools where Traveller children are enrolled.</P>
    <P>The problem of early school leaving requires movement on a number of fronts and that is the approach that my Department is taking. In the first instance it is important that we offer curricular choice which meets the needs of the diversity of pupils, including Travellers, in our second level schools. The junior certificate schools programme and the leaving certificate applied are two programmes which aim to achieve a greater level of inclusiveness in curricular provision.</P>
    <P>An important element in improving school attendance and retention rates in our schools is the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board. The board will play a central role in implementing the provisions of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, with a view to promoting regular attendance at school and discouraging early school leaving.</P>
    <P>Strategies are in place to encourage and support schools in retaining pupils to completion of senior cycle. The focus of two initiatives, the eight to 15 year old early school leavers initiative and the stay in school retention initiative at second level, which form part of the school completion programme, is to target resources at those schools and communities experiencing the greatest difficulties with early school leaving. Traveller pupils will also benefit from these initiatives.</P>
    <P>It is only by sustained action across a number of fronts &ndash; curricular, legislative and direct support &ndash; that we will make progress in relation to increasing Traveller participation and retention at all levels of education.</P>

The Bill will provide clear statutory rights to access to, and benefit from, education for children and adults with disabilities. The Bill is being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. It is my intention that it will be published as soon as possible with a view to early enactment.</P>
      <P>The Education (Disabilities) Bill will add to the significant body of law already enacted by this Government relating to the rights of people with disabilities to employment and to access to a wide range of services, including education. Legislation enacted in the past four years includes the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000. The latter in particular asserted the right of people with disabilities to education without fear of discrimination. The Government has also enacted the Education Act, 1998, and the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, both of which provide strong statements of principle in respect of the education of people with disabilities and provide meaningful protections to ensure access to education for such people. Most recently, my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform published the Disabilities Bill, 2001. To back up those legislative provisions, especially in the education context, the Government during its term has committed very substantial additional resources.</P>

      <P>All vehicles operating under the school transport scheme are required to meet the statutory regulations as laid down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government.

Vehicles nominated for use under the scheme must be suitable for the conveyance of school children and must have complete and current documentation, including proof of insurance cover, in respect of both buses and drivers as required by law. The vehicles have to be kept and maintained in a safe and roadworthy condition and to comply in all respects with the Road Traffic Acts.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann's policy of continuous fleet replacement facilitates the improvement of the quality of vehicles used in the operation of the school transport scheme, and provides a better standard of service for pupils availing of school transport. As part of their ongoing policy of improving the age and condition of the school bus fleet, Bus Éireann introduced a significant number of replacement vehicles in 2001.</P>

      <P>The National Policy Advisory and Development Committee, NPADC, was established in 1998 to advise the Minister for Education and Science on ICT policy for schools. My Department recently published the report of the NPADC in which it evaluates the impact of Schools IT2000 on schools. Comparing the situation to that which existed beforehand, the results are highly encouraging and chart demonstrable and impressive progress in the introduction of ICT into schools. Marked increases have been demonstrated in the areas of increased availability of necessary infrastructure, the use of ICT by the teaching profession across all school functions, its use by pupils and teacher participation in ICT training. Copies of this report are available and I will ensure that one is sent to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In relation to assessment, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is examining the issues related to specifying desirable levels of competence which students should reach in using ICT. At primary level, the NCCA has already piloted guidelines on integrating ICT into the teaching and learning environment. These are being revised, taking account of comprehensive feedback from teachers.</P>
      <P>The next stage of the process of developing provision for ICT will be to identify, in conjunction with the NCCA, the range of skills and conceptual understanding that pupils should attain through their engagement with ICT right across the curriculum at different levels of education, particularly by the end of the period of compulsory education. This will draw on the best of international practice in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At leaving certificate level, the NCCA is in the final stages of preparing advice to me on the advisability of introducing a computer-based subject at leaving certificate level. This advice will draw upon a feasibility study conducted by the University of Limerick. The purpose of the study was to ascertain the desirability of such a subject, its possible delivery format, potential content and the impact introducing it would have on the current programme at leaving certificate level. It is in this context that plans will be developed to <Col N="985" /> evaluate progress as regards computer literacy in schools.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding to primary and second level schools on the basis of <i>per capita</i> grants with additional grants towards ancillary services such as caretaking and secretarial. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under community employment schemes, last year I secured the transfer of £46 million, &euro;58,407,951, per annum to my Department on a phased basis as the FÁS school-based CE schemes came to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million, &euro;40,631,618, in this school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of primary schools, I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from £40, &euro;50.79, per pupil per annum to £100, &euro;126.98, per pupil over this school year and the next. The <Col N="986" /> grant rate that applies from January 2002 is £80, &euro;101.58, per pupil. At second level, the extra funding is being allocated to schools under the school services support fund that was introduced in 2000. The grant, increased from £20, &euro;25.40, per pupil to £50, &euro;63.49, per pupil in September 2001, will further increase to £70, &euro;88.88, per pupil next September and to £78, &euro;99.04, per pupil in January 2003.</P>
    <P>In addition, voluntary secondary schools with secretarial support under the 1978 secretary scheme will also receive an additional services support grant of £15, &euro;19.32, subject to a maximum additional grant of £5,250, &euro;6,666.12, per school. Voluntary secondary schools not embraced by the 1978 secretary scheme will receive an additional services support fund grant of £35, &euro;44.44, subject to a maximum additional grant of £12,250, &euro;15,554.29, per school. My Department has issued circulars to all primary and second level schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements.</P>
    <P>I have set aside £2 million, &euro;2,539,476, to respond to the particular difficulties which may be experienced by some schools. No consultants have been appointed to date. The Deputy may be aware that I also agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years' participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE.</P>
    <P>Schools that used CE participants as classroom assistants to assist with the care of pupils with disabilities should note that my Department has a special needs assistant scheme in place for such purposes. School authorities may apply for the services of a special needs assistant to assist in catering for pupils with special care needs arising from a disability. Further details on the operation of the special needs assistant scheme are available from special education section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, County Westmeath.</P>

      <P>I am aware of a number of surveys where an association between literacy difficulties and involvement in crime has been established. However, my Department has not carried out research into a possible link between dyslexia and juvenile delinquency.</P>
      <P>Dyslexia is thought to cause severe literacy difficulties in about 2% of the population. Since, in studies carried out elsewhere, literacy difficulties in general have been found to be more prevalent among the prison population, it is highly likely that dyslexia is also more prevalent among prison inmates, and among delinquents. However, while there may be a higher incidence of literacy difficulties, including dyslexia, among the prison population and delinquents, it cannot be inferred that there is a causal link between the two. It is likely that criminality and learning difficulties, including reading difficulties and dyslexia, share common causes such as poverty, social exclusion, greater incidence of neurological difficulties and disadvantage.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving accommodation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997.</P>
      <P>Because of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity. My Department currently has over 450 major projects at primary level in architectural planning including many of those referred to by the INTO. Some 79 major projects are currently in construction at a value of &euro;110 million. These projects will proceed to the preparation of tender documents and the invitation of tenders, as soon as it is possible to do so, under the expanded Government's building programme. However, many of the specific issues referred to by the INTO, that is, heating, replacement of windows and doors, water supply, pest control are appropriately addressed through the grant scheme for minor works. Under this scheme, schools receive an annual capital grant of &euro;3,809 per school plus &euro;12.70 per pupil at a cost in excess of &euro;17.7 million per annum.</P>
      <P>My Department cannot accept the argument being advanced that school accommodation which is not in accordance with the current Department of Education and Science design guidelines is necessarily substandard. These guidelines were drawn up and adopted in January 2000 for the use of architectural design teams where new schools or major extensions to existing schools are being planned. The Department is setting new and higher standards and targets as part of a best practice agenda for school design. However, this does not mean that schools which do not meet those standards are deficient. Clearly, it is not possible to wipe out in the lifetime of one Government the cumulative deficit of generations and also to deal with emerging needs at the same time. The Government from the outset has been committed to addressing that historical deficit in educational infrastructure and has set about rectifying the situation by allocating substantial funding in each of its budgets. The Taoiseach has very recently given a categorical assurance about our clear commitment to continuing with the work we have started and to build on the substantial progress that has already been made over the last few years in order to ensure that the needs of schools right across the country are met.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>It is my view and that of the Government that the benchmarking process provides the opportunity for the ASTI to have its pay claim addressed in a comprehensive manner. This view was supported by the recommendations of the Public Service Arbitration Board and the Labour Court. The TUI and INTO, which represent over 30,000 teachers, and all other public service unions are participating in the benchmarking process.</P>
      <P>The Public Service Benchmarking Body has been asked to produce its report by the 30 June 2002. Agreement has been reached between the Government and the trade unions that 25% of any increase recommended by the benchmarking body will be paid with effect from 1 December 2001. This will be paid immediately on receipt of the report.</P>
      <P>The ASTI continues to pursue its pay claim outside of the benchmarking process. It has recently instructed its members to withdraw from co-operation with the implementation of the new curricula, syllabi and programmes and to withdraw from in-service for such new curricula, syllabi and programmes until further notice. While this course of action may present some difficulties with the implementation of the revised leaving certificate syllabi in both biology and home economics and the revised junior certificate syllabi in both religious education and SPHE, I am hopeful that their introduction can proceed as planned. There is no immediate threat to State examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following negotiations under the aegis of the teachers' conciliation council a final formal offer of &euro;34.28 (£27.00) per hour for supervision and substitution was put to the three teacher unions. The Irish National Teachers' Organisation put the offer to ballot and it was accepted by a majority of their members. The Teachers' Union of Ireland put the offer to ballot and it was rejected by a small majority. The Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland recently put to the <Col N="991" /> offer to ballot and a result will be known on Friday, 1 February 2002.</P>

      <P>The report of the task force on autism is a lengthy and complex document which extends to more than 350 pages. The report contains 17 individual chapters, each of which addresses a particular aspect of policy or provision in relation to autistic spectrum disorders and makes recommendations for the future development of services. Overall, the report puts forward in excess of 180 individual recommendations.</P>
      <P>The report of the task force, which is currently being considered in my Department, will make an important contribution to the future development of services for persons with autistic spectrum disorders. Copies of the report can be accessed on my Department's website and arrangements are being made to make printed copies of the report available in the near future.</P>

      <P>There has been no delay in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>On 29 May 2001 I announced the establishment of the new National Educational Welfare Board. The board held its first meeting on 15 June 2001. I have established the board on an interim or designate basis at this stage in order to enable it to carry out the necessary planning and preparation work for phasing in an education welfare service as provided for in the legislation.</P>
      <P>The educational welfare service is a major new national service, which requires the design of a new national organisation and structure together with a staffing requirement analysis and the development of suitable proposals in this regard. The board has engaged the services of a management consultancy firm to assist it in these matters. The first task was to develop proposals for the recruitment of a chief executive. Proposals were finalised and approved by me and the recruitment process is now in train. Meanwhile, the main elements of the consultancy work are now very advanced and will be considered by the board in the course of the next week. Negotiations are also under way in relation to the transfer of the existing school attendance officers to the board, in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</P>
      <P>I will be commencing sections of the Act as soon as possible, taking account of the plans being prepared by the board and the recommendations which they will make to me on the matter. It is my intention and that of the board that the new services will be phased in as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>Section 16 of the Education Act, 1998 provides that the patron may, if satisfied that the functions of a board are not being effectively discharged, dissolve that board, subject to the procedures outlined in that section being followed and subject to the consent of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While my consent to the patron's request to dissolve the board of the school in question was given in November 2001, it now appears that the <Col N="993" /> procedures outlined in section 16, which should have been followed by the patron, may not have been followed in full. In the circumstances, my officials have written to the patron and requested clarification on the matter.</P>
    <P>On receipt of the patron's response, this matter will be further considered within my Department.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the 90% target retention rate in second level schools has not been attained; and his new proposals to improve school attendance and retention levels.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2711/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in 1998 early school leavers survey indicates that approximately 81% of students currently complete second level education. This figure is broadly in line with my Department's analysis of data in this area which indicate a retention rate of some 83% when account is taken of factors such as mortality and movement to private schools. This figure does not take cognisance of those leavers who entered legitimate education and training programmes such as apprenticeships, Youthreach, senior Traveller training centre programmes or other further education opportunities on leaving the second level system.</P>
      <P>While the achievement of a retention rate of 90% has been a long standing policy objective, it is important to stress that early school leaving is not a simple matter to resolve and that by their nature interventions require time to make an impact. It is for this reason that my Department has initiated a programme comprising both legislative measures and special targeted initiatives to combat the problem of non-school attendance and early school leaving.</P>
      <P>School attendance is currently governed by the School Attendance Act, 1926. The recently enacted Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, will replace and reform current school attendance legislation. The Act provides for the establishment of a national educational welfare board and a nation-wide educational welfare service, with a view to ensuring that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives an adequate level of education. The Educational Welfare Board has been established on an interim basis and I have recently given approval for the recruitment of a chief executive officer. The service will be implemented on a phased basis, in line with a plan to be developed by the board. It is my intention that the new educational welfare service will, as soon as possible, cover the entire country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see the problem of early school leaving as requiring movement on a number of fronts and that is the approach that we are taking. In the first instance it is important that we offer curricular choice which meets the needs of the diversity <Col N="994" /> of pupils in our second level schools. The junior certificate schools programme and the leaving certificate applied are two programmes which aim to achieve a greater level of inclusiveness in curricular provision. Other programmes involve the allocation of additional teacher posts and funding to primary and post primary schools serving pupils from disadvantaged families. The home/school/community scheme at both primary and post primary levels aims to build relationships between schools and families that will foster an appreciation of education and encourage greater participation in school.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department currently supports two initiatives aimed at increasing the retention of pupils in school, namely, the eight to 15 Early School Leaver Initiative and the Stay in School Retention Initiative at second level. Significant funding has been made available by this Government under the National Development Plan 2000-06 to address the problem of early school leaving.</P>
    <P>I have provided a total of &euro;22.5 million for these school completion initiatives in 2002. I expect that this will be sufficient to facilitate a significant expansion that will focus on areas with the greatest pupil retention difficulties as identified through my Department's post-primary pupil database. In this regard, proposals are currently under consideration in my Department and I expect to be in a position to make a further announcement in relation to this matter shortly.</P>
    <P>An additional 2000 places were also provided in 1998 across FÁS and the vocational education committees on Youthreach/Traveller programmes for young people who have already left school, allied with guidance counselling, psychological and childcare supports. It is only by sustained action across a number of fronts &ndash; curricular, legislative and direct support &ndash; that we will make progress in relation to this intractable problem.</P>

      <P>The National Policy Advisory and Development Committee was established in 1998 to advise the Minister for Education and Science on ICT policy at first and second level. My Department recently published the report of the NPADC in which they evaluate the impact of Schools IT 2000. Comparing the situation to that which existed beforehand, the results are highly encouraging and chart demonstrable and impressive progress in the introduction of ICT into <Col N="995" /> schools. Marked increases have been demonstrated in the areas of increased availability of necessary infrastructure, the use of ICT by the teaching profession across all school functions, its use by pupils and in teacher participation in ICT training. Copies of this report are available and I will ensure that one is sent to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>A survey carried out by the National Centre for Technology in Education also showed that following Schools IT 2000 the average primary school now has 8.7 computers, up from 3.8 in early 1998; the average second level school now has 42.7 computers, up from 31 in early 1998; at least 34,000 teachers have attended one or more IT training courses since early 1998 and more than 95% of schools state that they are using the Internet, up from only 25% in early 1998.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently launched a new &euro;108 million three year strategic action plan, &ldquo;Blueprint for the Future of ICT in Irish Education 2001-2003&rdquo;, under phase 1 of which &euro;25 million in grants have already issued to schools. Grants under phase 2 will issue in the near future and I am confident, therefore, that when schools are next surveyed there will be further substantial progress to be reported in all these areas.</P>
      <P>In relation to the last point I am pleased to say that every school in the State now has an Internet connection and that Internet usage will continue to be subsidised under the existing arrangements for the current academic year.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving accommodation in primary schools. Because of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
      <P>A building project at Kilnadeema national school is currently in architectural planning as part of the Government's programme. The project will continue to the preparation of tender documents and the invitation of tenders, as soon as it is possible to do so, under the expanded building programme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" />In recent years I have introduced a number of measures aimed at ensuring that the number of errors are kept to a minimum, and that where errors do occur, they are detected and remedied as quickly as possible. In particular, leaving certificate candidates are now afforded the opportunity to view their scripts both before and after the re-marking process. In addition, I have introduced a process whereby a candidate who is unhappy with the outcome of the appeal process may get formal confirmation from an examin<Col N="998" /> ation commissioner that all appeal processes were carried out properly. Examination commissioners are drawn from a panel of persons independent of the Department.</P>
    <P>More recently, I have asked senior officials to convene a working group to conduct a comprehensive review of monitoring procedures and I have determined that this group should involve some inspectors who are chief examiners as well as teachers who have considerable experience as chief advising and advising examiners.</P>

      <P>At my request, following receipt of the Cromien Report, my Department has embarked on a major programme of structural reform which has the following five core elements to it. These include a focused movement of certain functions from the Department; specifically examinations, delivery of special education and transfer of the Department's current role in relation to the institutes of technology to the Higher Education Authority; the establishment of a regional office structure; regulatory reform and appellate processes to underpin key allocation functions; implementation of a wide range of efficiency measures designed to bring the Department's procedures and processes more into line with modern administrative practice and, arising from the above, a greater focus on core functions, with particular emphasis on policy and planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1000" />The Government decided in June 2001 that work should proceed on the establishment of an examinations commission, a special education service, regional offices and the transfer of responsibilities relating to the institutes of technology to the Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently engaged in consultations with trade unions and staff interests with a view to the implementation of these measures at an early date.</P>

      <P>Following this Government's decision to establish a personal injuries assessment board, and in accordance with that decision, an interdepart<Col N="1001" /> mental group was set up to progress the establishment of the new board. The group has had a number of meetings.</P>
      <P>The group is examining the operational issues surrounding the establishment of an assessment board and the legal implications, including what legislative changes, if any, will be necessary to establish the PIAB. The work includes consideration of how the board should actually work in practice and the procedures it should adopt. The group is nearing completion of its examination of these issues and is preparing a report on how the PIAB should be established and operate. I will consider the report of that group as a matter of urgency and bring proposals to Government.</P>
      <P>Sufficient funding is available in the Department's Estimates for 2002, for work related to the establishment of the PIAB. The implementation group is considering what funding will be required in future years.</P>

      <P>I received a report on the operation of the community employment programme in rural areas, drawn up by the Leitrim Community Network, in December 2001. This report was compiled in August 2001 and many of the constructive recommendations and proposals contained in it have already been addressed by the new flexibility arrangements in the operation of CE, which I introduced last year. Following this, FÁS now has discretion to extend an individual's term on CE on a case by case basis, within limits, having regard to that individual's needs and future employment prospects.</P>
      <P>My Department will, in the context of the current overall restructuring of the programme, continue to keep the future operation of CE under review with reference to its primary role as an active labour market programme to assist participants to progress into jobs and/or further education and training. In this regard, as provided for under the PPF, an overall review of active labour market programmes will be undertaken by my Department in the near future under the aegis of the PPF standing committee on the labour market. The future policy direction of CE will be informed by the outcome of this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of a high supports process, as envisaged under the PPF, was concluded at the end of December 2001 following extensive con<Col N="1002" /> sultations with the social partners under the aegis of the PPF standing committee on the labour market chaired by my Department. This process, which also has employment policy implications for people in rural areas, is intended to target and provide appropriate supports for those people, who because of age, literacy or other barriers are unlikely to succeed in getting, and keeping a job in the open labour market. I expect to be in a position to take a decision on the high supports process in the near future, following agreement on certain operational issues between my Department, FÁS, the employment service and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>The Department is pursuing initiatives to address the high cost of insurance, including motor insurance. The Motor Insurance Advisory Board has been charged with advising me on motor insurance costs and in particular, with examining the relationship between the incidence of claims and the premiums charged for various classes of policyholder identified by age and sex. The issue of the high cost of insurance for young drivers is especially being examined by the board. I expect to receive the final report of the board within a matter of weeks. In light of its recommendations, the Government and I will consider what further action is appropriate and necessary.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental implementation group is progressing the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. I am confident that the establishment of the PIAB will achieve a reduction in the delivery costs of personal injury compensation, thus permitting a reduction in insurance costs to consumers.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 73 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Gas Acts, 1976 to 2000, Bord Gáis Éireann has statutory responsibility to develop and maintain an efficient and cost effective gas transmission and distribution system. Extensions to the transmission system require my consent whereas extensions of the distribution network fall exclusively within the day-to-day responsibilities of the board. I have no requests for consent regarding Kerry at this stage.</P>
      <P>The question of whether the use of gas in Tarbert power station would be commercially viable in a competitive electricity market is one for the ESB in the first instance and I am not aware that it has any plans to that end at present. BGÉ's current development programme will bring gas transmission capacity to within approximately 20 miles of the station.</P>
      <P>Previous studies by BGÉ have concluded that the cost of taking gas to Kerry would not be a financially viable project. Any future proposal that would bring gas to Tarbert would clearly stimulate a fresh look at onward extensions from there to any location where significant demand seemed likely. BGÉ continuously monitors areas with potential loads that would justify grid extensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>North-South co-operation on energy matters has been going on for quite some time. The Deputy will be aware that last year my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Belfast jointly commissioned consultants to report on options for the future establishment of an all-island energy market. Following publication of these reports, both Departments organised a high level seminar in December last to discuss the report's recommendations. The seminar was restricted to invitees, that is, energy regulators North and South, system operators in both gas and electricity and renewable energy specialists as well as the Departments themselves. The seminar contributed substantially to the development of a common agenda going forward. The high level group agreed a number of policy areas which will be pursued in working group format over coming months. Much of this work is highly technical and will be led by the regulators with input from other players, including the two Departments. There will be a further meeting of the main group in April 2002 when a review of progress will be made.</P>
      <P>Progress has also been made in other areas. The House will be aware that the Government recently decided to invest &euro;12.7 million in support and development of the gas infrastructure in Northern Ireland. In addition, work is almost completed on upgrading the main electricity interconnector North and South. I am pleased with the ongoing high level of interaction and co-operation between the two Administrations on the issue of energy. I hope the excellent work currently being undertaken will lead to the creation of an all-island energy market which will bring about greater competition and benefits for the two economies and for consumers. I noted in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Tuesday that Sir Reg Empey was very positive about this co-operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main support available to people over 35 years of age to develop a suckler cow herd is the level of payments under the EU premium system. Clearly, a strong commercial market for the steer and heifer beef derived from the offspring of suckler cows is also a major factor in the economics of suckler cow production. This market is also supported by the intervention and export refund systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maximum payment under EU premium system in respect of each suckler cow and her offspring amounts to approximately &euro;720 in the current year. This payment consists of the suckler cow premium plus the supplementary extensification premium; the special beef premium which is payable twice on 50% of the progeny, plus the extensification premium; the slaughter premium of &euro;80 per head for the suckler cow and her male offspring; and the slaughter premium of approximately &euro;100 on beef heifers. In addition, replacements in the suckler cow herd qualify for a top-up of &euro;60 and dry heifers attract a supplementary premium of &euro;75 up to a maximum of 15% of their suckler cow herd. Substantial payments are also made to suckler cow producers under the disadvantaged area compensatory allowances scheme. In addition, aid is available to <Col N="1008" /> farmers who farm in an environmentally manner under REPS.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties facing first time entrants. Land mobility is a particular problem in Ireland and occurs here mainly through inheritance. This is exemplified by the small percentage, 0.2%, of farm land sold each year. Renting, including both leasing and conacre, is an option for these wishing to enter farming and this now accounts for 13% of farm land usage.</P>
    <P>As part of my Department's rural development plan, a new scheme of early retirement from farming was initiated. This scheme provides an annual income for those farmers between 55 and 66 years who decide to discontinue farming. The scheme provides an opportunity for younger farmers to take an active role in the management of the farming enterprise and improve the economic viability of the holding. In addition, the scheme of installation aid assists young people entering farming. Teagasc and the private agricultural colleges provide comprehensive third level and vocational training for young entrants into farming. Some &euro;24 million has been provided to Teagasc and the agricultural colleges for capital investment over a five year period from 2000 to 2004. The statutory agricultural wage payable to trainees farmers during farm placement has been increased substantially recently to &euro;190 per week. There are also a number of tax incentives to encourage the early transfer of farms to young trained farmers, including full relief from stamp duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 81 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under EU regulation, Ireland's suckler cow quota is limited to 1,102,620 premium rights. Apart from about 200 premium rights, all of that quota is presently held by individual farmers. Quota becomes available for distribution when unused quota is returned to the national reserve and through a deduction from the sellers quota when quota is sold. The EU has directed that unused quota in 2002 and 2003 may not be redistributed through the national reserve until 2004. <Col N="1009" /> The only quota available for distribution from the 2003 national reserve will be quota that will accrue as a result of sales. This is estimated at 1,500 premium rights. It is estimated that 3,000 premium rights will be available for distribution from the 2004 national reserve.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to accurately predict how many farmers will not use their quotas in any one year, how much quota will revert to the national reserve as a result of sales or how many farmers will apply to the national reserve. In recent years, demand for suckler cow quota has far exceeded supply. There was only sufficient quota in the 2002 national reserve to allow allocations to be made to 338 of the 3,040 farmers who applied. The categories of farmers who may apply for an allocation of reserve quota are proposed each year by the quota review group, an advisory group which comprises representatives of the major farming organisations, IFA, ICMSA, Macra na Feirme, as well as representatives from Teagasc and my Department. In accepting the group's proposals, I am conscious of the need to give as many farmers as possible the opportunity of applying while, at the same time, I am aware that if the number of categories was too restrictive, the possibility of having unallocated quota in the reserve could arise and this clearly would not be desirable.</P>

      <P>The person named submitted an application under the special beef premium scheme in respect of 15 animals on 2 June 2000, 12 animals for the first age premium and three animals for the second age premium. However, an application for the first age premium had been submitted for five of these animals on 2 February 2000 by the previous owner. The previous owner applied for special beef premium on the five animals but his herd was restricted by disease and therefore the cattle identity cards had not been stamped and punched to indicate that the first age premium had been claimed.</P>
      <P>When the previous owner sold his animals on 30 May 2000, an open announcement was made at the mart declaring that special beef premium had been claimed on the animals. The person named is listed as having purchased the animals from the mart on the day in question. Based on the information supplied by the mart in relation to the declaration announced on the day of sale and the mart docket submitted by the previous owner, it is clear that the previous owner was entitled to receive the special beef premium in respect of the five animals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy relates directly to the final report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions which was published in January 2001. In September 2001, the Government decided to accept the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the commission, and the working group to advise on implementation provided for in the programme for prosperity and fairness has been established. The operational details of the implementation of the commission recommendations will be agreed by the Government following receipt of a report from the implementation working group, which is to be made within six months of the Government decision.</P>
      <P>The commission recommends, <i>inter alia</i>, continuation of pension increases in line with public service earnings and also that serving public servants make an additional explicit contribution towards the cost involved. In a change from the existing form of pay parity, the commission proposes that a single index of public service earnings be used in the future, with pension increases based on changes in the index to be paid automatically on a twice-yearly basis.</P>
      <P>Public service pensioners clearly have a very significant interest in these recommendations. For this reason, the Government has decided to facilitate pensioner group representation in the working group process in relation to the commission's recommendations on pensions increase policy. As a first step, a number of pensioner groups attended a preliminary meeting with officials of my Department on 11 December 2001. This will be followed by a number of information seminars and a process of consultation in relation to the pensions increase index recommended by the commission. In this way pensioners and their representatives groups will have an opportunity in the months ahead to have the commission recommendations explained and examined in more detail and to participate in the consultation process which I have initiated in relation to future pensions increase policy.</P>

      <P>Any assignment made by the Civil Service Commission from this competition would be to Dublin rather than to a provincial location, such as Sligo. In order to seek a position in, for instance, Sligo, the candidate, if and when he is appointed to the Civil Service, may have his name entered on the appropriate transfer lists under the centrally agreed transfer scheme.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the transfer arrangements applicable generally to the clerical officer grade, he would not be eligible for transfer until he has served for a minimum of one year in the location to which he is initially assigned.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they do not maintain statistics of the specific numbers of houses sold on which stamp duty is paid. However, they do maintain statistics of the number of documents in respect of which stamp duty was paid for transfers of residential property. In 2001 this figure was 22,004. First time buyers accounted for 3,659 of these documents. As figures for houses and apartments are not recorded separately by the Revenue Commissioners, the figures provided include both types of property.</P>

      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable &ndash;&euro;114.28, &euro;152.37, &euro;190.46 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high, maximum &ndash; which are eligible for subvention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. Determining the amount to be paid is a matter for each health board as the regulations do not provide for a maximum amount. However, the application of these pro<Col N="1016" /> visions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>In relation to the particular case raised by the Deputy, as responsibility for the provision of health services in the Kilkenny area rests with the South Eastern Health Board, my Department has asked the chief executive officer of the board to have the matter investigated and respond directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Other than for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically entitled to a medical card, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department advised the health board chief <Col N="1018" /> executive officers last year and again this year that medical card holders should not lose their cards because of increases in social welfare rates announced in the budget.</P>

      <P>As I have previously informed the Deputy, the provision of the disabled persons grant to enable housing modifications to be made to the homes of disabled persons is entirely a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local Government and such grants are administered through the relevant local authority. Use of health board staff, occupational therapists, to provide assessments for this scheme is a matter for discussion between the relevant local authorities and health boards.</P>
      <P>It is noted that the Southern Health Board has not responded to the Deputy in this instance. Accordingly, the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has again been requested to investigate this matter and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Adoption Board that further to inquiries from prospective adoptive parents in November, 2001 the Adoption Board wrote to the Vietnamese Minister for Justice, who has responsibility for adoption matters, on 9 November 2001, inquiring if it would be possible to enter into a working arrangement with the board concerning the adoption of Vietnamese children by Irish couples. The board has not yet received a formal reply from the Department of Justice and will keep me informed of any developments on this issue.</P>
      <P>The board has also been in contact with the Irish Embassy in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and has been advised that the Vietnamese authorities will be suspending adoptions, although no definite date has been given. I understand the consular section of the Department of Foreign Affairs has sought an update from the Irish Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. The board is keeping me appraised of developments in this matter.</P>
      <P>In considering working arrangements with other countries it is essential that we are satisfied that these arrangements uphold the spirit of the Hague Convention on intercountry adoption and that all adoptions take place in the best interests of the children concerned.</P>

      <P>In 1998, the Adoption Board and the Chinese authorities agreed on working arrangements to facilitate the adoption of Chinese children by Irish residents. China is one of the most popular countries of choice for applicants wishing to adopt abroad and the experiences of applicants who have adopted there has been very positive. I understand that to date approximately 60 children from China have had their adoptions recognised by the Adoption Board and that over seventy applicants are currently on a waiting list for a referral from China.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The China Centre of Adoption Affairs recently wrote to the Adoption Board advising that it is reviewing procedures for dealing with intercountry adoption applications from all receiving countries, including Ireland. One of the issues raised by the China Centre of Adoption Affairs was the preparation of post-placement reports which is an important part of the adoption process. Sending countries generally use these reports to evaluate how their children are settling into families in receiving countries. The China Centre of Adoption Affairs has informed the Adoption Board that it will suspend adoptions between China and other countries unless it receives all outstanding post-placement reports by 31 March 2002. The Adoption Board has written to the relevant adop<Col N="1020" /> tive parents as well as health boards and agencies and set a deadline of 28 February 2002 for the receipt of completed reports. I have been advised by the board that it has been assured that all reports will be forwarded in time for transmission to China. I have also written to the health boards to secure their co-operation in meeting the deadline. I will continue to monitor the situation in relation to the post-placement reports.</P>
    <P>The Adoption Board and I are satisfied with the very positive working arrangements between ourselves and China. I met the Chinese Ambassador for a working lunch before Christmas to discuss the working arrangements and I also attended a Christmas party at the Embassy for children adopted from China.</P>
    <P>The China Centre of Adoption Affairs has also decided to impose a quota system with regard to the number of adoption applications that will be accepted from each receiving country during 2002. Ireland has been granted an exemption from the quota system for the year 2002 in respect of applications from married couples. However, in relation to sole applicants a quota system is being imposed. The applications from sole applicants in 2002 should only account for five per cent of total applications sent from Ireland.</P>

The Department of Health and Children has no statutory responsibility for the regulations or their operation.</P>
      <P>To qualify, a person must meet the medical criteria specified in the above regulations, which are not set by the Department of Health and Children. The senior area medical officer for the relevant health board area will issue a primary medical certificate if s/he is satisfied that the applicant fulfills the medical criteria set out in the Department of Finance's disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) regulations, 1994. This role is to assist in the operation of the Revenue scheme.</P>

      <P>The domiciliary care allowance was introduced by way of circular 24/73 and is payable under Section 61 of the Health Act, 1970. This is a monthly allowance paid by health boards from date of application up to the age of 16 years. It provides financial support to the carers of eligible children whose disability is so severe that they require care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. The allowance is not paid in respect of children maintained on a full time basis in special-residential institutions. However, the allowance may be paid on a <i>pro-rata</i> basis for the number of nights spent at home, for example, weekends or holidays, by eligible children who attend special/residential institutions.</P>
      <P>To be eligible to receive this allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions; be under 16 years of age; the disability must be present at the time of the application and be likely to last for at least a year; the disability must be so severe that they require from another person constant care or supervision, that is, continual or continuous care or supervision substantially greater than that which would normally be required by a child of the same age; and the constant care or supervision must be provided by the parents themselves or by arrangement by them with another person or persons.</P>
      <P>Only the means of the child should be taken into account in determining eligibility for an allowance &ndash; the means of the parents should not be considered. &lsquo;Means' in this context include payments of compensation, following a court action or otherwise, in respect of injuries or disabilities sustained. Where there is more than one eligible child in a family, a full DCA payment should be made in respect of each eligible child. In some cases, depending on medical condition, eligibility is reviewed at regular intervals, for example, if the child's condition improves, he or she may no longer meet the criteria for eligibility. The maximum rate of DCA is &euro;179.80 per month, effective from 1 January 2002.</P>
      <P>Since August 1999, recipients of a domiciliary care allowance may also be eligible for carer's allowance which comes under the remit of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Since 2000, recipients of DCA are also entitled to receive respite care grant. RCG is a once yearly payment normally paid during June. The current rate of the RCG is &euro;635. The RCG should be doubled to &euro;1270 where there are two or more DCA recipients in a family. The health boards are responsible for paying the RCG to people in receipt of DCA only. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is responsible for paying the RCG to recipients of carer's allowance and DCA and to those in receipt of carer's allowance only.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the board that there are 130 long-stay beds in Saint Ita's Hospital, Newcastle West at present.

    <P>In the board's 2002 service plan it is proposed to increase the rehabilitation beds in the hospital. This is in conjunction with the Mid-Western Health Board's plan to develop a 12 bed ambulant dementia unit and also four palliative care support beds. The board has advised that the <Col N="1025" /> need for beds is kept under review. The board has stated that the development of community supports, day services and voluntary housing schemes will support the care of older people remaining in their homes.</P>

The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme 2000-2002, announced in July 2000. Given the priority rating afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available, it was not possible to include it in the programme at that time.</P>

      <P>The South Eastern Health Board was contacted on behalf of the person concerned and has advised that following a change of address in October 2001 the person concerned applied for a rent supplement. A rent supplement of £22.50, &euro;28.57, per week was put into payment with effect from 8 October. The amount of supplement in payment was reviewed and increased as a result of the recent budget changes. Details of how the amount of rent supplement in payment was calculated on each occasion are shown in the following tabular statement. The board has further advised that as of 14 January 2002 the person concerned was granted a local authority house and accordingly payment of the rent supplement ceased on that date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible in the time available to undertake the type of detailed analysis which would be required to produce an estimate of the proportion of families with incomes within the family income supplement income limits who fail to claim their entitlement.</P>
      <P>Research undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute in 1997, which was based on the results of the Living in Ireland Survey 1994, suggested that, at that time, fewer than one in three of potentially eligible claimants were in receipt of the payment. Since those with a higher entitlement are more likely to avail of the scheme the take-up in expenditure terms was estimated to be somewhat higher at between 35% and 38% of potential expenditure.</P>
      <P>International research on schemes similar to FIS and the ESRI analysis have pointed to misconceptions of the scheme and lack of proper information as factors in low take-up levels. For example, people may not realise that FIS is not taxable and does not affect medical card entitlement.</P>
      <P>In this regard, a number of measures have been actively pursued to ensure that families who may be unaware of their entitlement are identified. Such measures include an active media campaign at local and national level to advise customers of their entitlements. In addition, information on FIS is currently available on child benefit books, is provided to all one-parent families on award of one parent family allowance, is provided to all employers in PRSI mailshots from my Department and entitlement is considered for all applicants for the back to work allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The improvements made to FIS over the years, together with the measures taken to increase awareness of the scheme, resulted in a steady increase in the level of take-up during the 1990s peaking at 14,686 families at the end of 1999. Since then, although income limits have been increased annually to take account of improvements in the rates in other social welfare payments, the numbers in receipt of FIS have <Col N="1031" /> declined somewhat because it probably reflects the fact that fewer people now require the supplement. This should be viewed as a positive trend and highlights the success of a range of Government measures which have improved net take home pay for the low paid.</P>
    <P>As of 28 December 2001 there were a total of 11,840 people availing of the family income supplement.</P>

      <P>In the case of short-term payments, child dependent allowances are currently only paid up to the age of 18. As a first step towards implementing the PPF commitment to raise the age limit to 22 where the child is in full-time education from April 2002 child dependent allowances on short-term payments will be paid to the end of the academic year in which the young person reaches 18.

Therefore, it is protected under the provisions of the National Monuments Acts, 1930-1994. My Department recommended to the county council that a suitably qualified archaeologist be engaged to carry out an archaeological assessment of the bridge. This assessment would address the following and be submitted prior to the commencement of works: a survey and photographic record of King John's bridge; the methodology for the protection of the bridge during works; a conservation plan for the continued protection and restoration of the bridge after the proposed works are complete; and a programme of test excavation, under licence to my department, to be undertaken in the vicinity of the bridge to determine the nature, extent and location of any subsurface archaeological deposits. It will be necessary for the report stemming from the test excavation to contain an impact statement and mitigatory measures should archaeological features be discovered.</P>
    <P>My Department has also made it clear that the archaeologist should monitor all ground disturbance and topsoil removal associated with the proposed development.</P>

      <P>Data from the Garda Síochána annual reports relating to drug possession offences and seizures are but one indicator of the misuse of drugs. Socio-demographic information and demands for treatment by drug users are also regarded as key indicators to provide valid, comparable and objective information. The national advisory committee on drugs was established by the Government to provide a focused and integrated approach in the collection and assimilation of data. The committee is overseeing the delivery of a three year research programme aimed at addressing the priority information gaps in the area of drug misuse.</P>
      <P>The Government has also agreed, for the period 2001-08, that the national drugs strategy will respond to the drugs problem by setting out an integrated series of short, medium and long-term actions. Central to the strategy approach has been the bringing together of key agencies, both statutory and community-voluntary, in a planned and co-ordinated manner. The objectives and actions set out in the strategy involve a range of specific commitments from the various Departments and agencies involved in delivering on drugs policy, not just in relation to the supply of drugs but also in providing treatment and rehabilitation, as well as developing appropriate preventative strategies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Síochána monitors the prevalence <Col N="1036" /> of drug misuse in a number of ways. These include the analysis of drugs seizures and information, both nationally and internationally, in consultation with Europol, Interpol and other international organisations. It also liaises with community and voluntary groups, especially through the local drugs task forces and through the neighbourhood watch, community alert and coastal watch initiatives.</P>
    <P>At an operational level, the Garda Síochána has established specialised drugs units here tasked with addressing drugs distribution at a local level. These units are supported by the Garda national drugs unit and by other national Garda support services such as the Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau. Specific Garda operations such as Dóchas, Cleanstreet and Nightcap have also had a significant impact on street level drug dealing.</P>

      <P>My Department provides a focal point for disability equality policy and legislation development. As such my Department collects data in relation to the 3% target for employment of people with disabilities in the public service, excluding the Civil Service, which is a Government led positive action measure. Although the target has yet to be achieved there has been a degree of progress over the past number of years. The overall statistics are as follows:</P>

    <P>It must be noted that there are over 200 public service bodies, varying in size and diversity of jobs and the range of work involved. Public Service bodies have staff levels ranging from 1 to 10,000 employees.</P>
    <P>It must also be noted that some bodies have exceeded the target &ndash; the highest performer achieved a level of almost 7%. It is recognised that there are other bodies who have performed poorly. The Government is committed to ensuring equal opportunities for people with disabilities in the areas of training and employment and has taken a strategic approach to policy develop<Col N="1037" /> ment involving both legislative and positive action measures to achieve this end.</P>
    <P>Under a Government commitment in the PPF, every Department is required to take appropriate action to ensure that agencies under its aegis achieve the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities in the public service at an early date. In order to answer the statistical information sought by the Deputy I have secured relevant information from the Minister for Health and Children and from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I have appended it in tabular form to this reply.</P>
    <P>Both the Minister of State and I are concerned that the overall level of progress with regard to the target has been unacceptably slow. Recently we published the disability Bill which, when enacted, will put the target on a statutory basis for the first time. The monitoring committee, which we have established and which is chaired by our Department, will continue to monitor and guide progress. It has supported a number of initiatives over the past two years including: approval of a draft code of practice for use in the public service and exploration of the options for common selection procedures for people with disabilities; raising awareness of the 3% target among, and giving information to, chief executives, personnel officers and disability equality officers in the public service through a series of eight regional seminars, and publication of an information brochure; publication of a brochure designed to encourage people with disabilities to consider a career in the public service and promotion of this at the Public Sector Careers Expo in April 2001; commissioned research on the issues and barriers relating to achievement of the target in six public service organisations, the report of which the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, launched on the 22 November 2001. This report provides an insight into some of the issues which hinder progress and includes recommendations to assist future progress. Copies of the report have been circulated to all public sector employers to inform their future strategies.</P>
    <P>While analysing progress on the target, account must be taken of one of the most significant developments to date &ndash; the introduction of mainstreaming disability policy which was launched by An Taoiseach in June 2000. This policy requires that public service bodies which provide services for the public are the same bodies that provide services for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>As a result employment and vocational training policies for people with disabilities are now formulated as part of general labour market policy underlining the move from a medical view of disability to an inclusive economic and social view of disability. With the passing of the disability Bill all of this work will be underpinned with legislation.</P>

      <P>The task force is considering all the factors that impact on the uptake of the physical sciences and related subjects at both second and third level, including the provision of laboratories and equipment. Until I have had an opportunity to consider its proposals in relation to the development of laboratory resources in schools, it would be premature to give a definitive answer in respect of proposed expenditure in this area. In the interim my Department will continue to implement its ongoing school building and refurbishment programme which will, where appropriate, include the provision and-or upgrading of laboratories and equipment.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance to schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million, or &euro;58,407,951, per annum to my Department on a phased basis between 2001 and 2003, as the FÁS school based community employment schemes come to an end.</P>
      <P>The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department received a total of £32 million, or &euro;40,631,618, for the 2001-2002 school year.</P>
      <P>My Department has now issued circulars to all primary schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements. In line with the new arrangements, the level of funding provided by my Department to the school in question has been increased from the £40 or &euro;50.79 per pupil that applied in the 2000-2001 school year to the £80 or &euro;101.58 per pupil that applies in this school year. The school received a total of £6,840 during 2001 in respect of secretarial and caretaking services. The payment at the rate of £80 or &euro;101.58 per pupil will issue to the school in February.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My approach in relation to the value of the maintenance grants has been to increase the level of grants annually at least in line with inflation. Last June, in line with this policy, I approved increases of 6% in the rates of maintenance grant. The reference value for inflation is the annual percentage increase in the consumer price index to mid-February. The increase of 6% in grant rates for 2001-02 was higher than the reference value which was 5.3%.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the practice in recent years has been to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. I approved an increase of 6.5% in the reckonable income limits for the 2001-2002 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1999 to March 2000, which was 5.9%. I also increased by 6.5% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.</P>
      <P>On my initiative a special project team is carrying out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review includes the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of these topics are, of their nature, complex and require detailed research. As part of the review, the Economic and Social Research Institute was commissioned to undertake research on the effect of changes in the income thresholds and on related matters. The report's findings have informed the work of the project <Col N="1044" /> team and drafting of the team's report is now being finalised.</P>
    <P>Issues relating to the implementation of the team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>
    <P>I have already introduced special rates of maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders with effect from the 2000-01 academic year. The rates are &euro;3,809, or £3,000, for students residing over 15 miles from the college attended and &euro;1,535, or £1,200, for students residing less than 15 miles from the college attended. These increased rates of grant will be a powerful incentive to eligible students to enter third level and to complete their studies in the knowledge that additional financial assistance will be available to them.</P>

    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I am committed to addressing educational disadvantage. During my period as Minister I have secured significant <Col N="1045" /> additional resources to assist young people in realising their potential through education.</P>
    <P>At present my Department supports two initiatives aimed at increasing the retention of pupils in school, namely the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative and the stay in school retention initiative at second level. Significant funding has been made available by this Government under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to address the problem of early school leaving.</P>
    <P>I have provided a total of &euro;22.5 million for these school completion initiatives in 2002. I expect that this will be sufficient to facilitate a significant expansion that will focus on areas with the greatest pupil retention difficulties, as identified through my Department's post-primary pupil database. In this regard, proposals are currently under consideration in my Department and I expect to be in a position to make a further announcement in relation to this matter shortly.</P>

When this has been completed my Department will be able to progress this matter further.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy of my commitment to ensuring that adequate educational support services are made available to all students with visual impairment. My commitment in this regard is reflected in the fact that in 2001 I secured additional funding of &euro;634,869 or £500,000 to facilitate the appointment of additional staff at the existing schools for the visually impaired at Drumcondra.</P>

      <P>The teacher allocation in the vocational sector is made on an overall vocational education scheme basis. The teacher allocation to a VEC for a particular school year is determined by the combined enrolment in all of the schools within its scheme at the end of the preceding September having regard to the current pupil teacher ratio and approved <i>ex quota</i> posts. It is a matter for each VEC to plan and provide an appropriate curriculum to meet overall pupil needs and to allocate teaching resources to individual schools in the scheme from within its approved teacher allocation.</P>
      <P>County Cork VEC was granted its normal teacher allocation entitlement for 2001-02. In addition, my Department, following consideration of an appeal made by the VEC, approved a further allocation as a curricular concession for the current school year.

      <P>My Department's design team procedures apply to the building or an extension or new school and a full design team is engaged to address the architectural, structural, services and cost control aspects of the proposal. The design team procedures are in place to ensure that there is a consistent approach to the architectural planning of school buildings, with a view to ensuring quality school buildings built at a cost that represents value for money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These procedures consist of nine stages. The design and planning of the project is covered by stages 1 to 5, during which the project is developed from the assessment of site suitability, <Col N="1049" /> through the detailed design, including the obtaining of planning permission, to the point where detailed bills of quantities are prepared.</P>
    <P>At stage 6 tenders are sought in line with public procurement procedures and subsequently a tender report is prepared and examined. Assuming that the outcome of the tender process is acceptable in terms of procurement procedures, providing value for money and that funds are available to meet construction costs a construction contract is placed at that stage and the construction of the project begins.</P>
    <P>Stages 7 to 9 cover post-contract cost control throughout the construction period, construction and practical completion of the building, including hand-over of the building to the proposed occupiers and the completion of the cost analysis in the form of the final account, ensuring that cost control was maintained.</P>
    <P>The rate of progress of a project to construction depends on factors such as the complexity and size of the project, which may have an impact on the time required to undertake architectural planning. The period of time required for the granting of planning permission and obtaining a fire certificate may also vary from project to project. The volume of other projects being dealt with by the design teams and my Department's building unit may also affect the rate of progress of a project. In every case the decision to award a construction contract is subject to the outcome of the tender process offering value for money and the availability of funding to meet the cost of construction. After the award of a construction contract, a contractor cannot commence work on site until any relevant bonds, insurances and evidence of tax clearance have been produced.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by this Government to the building programme at all levels. The allocation for primary and post primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;335.95 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving the accommodation situation in both primary and post-primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997.</P>
    <P>Due to the greatly increased level of investment in the building area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>

      <P>The Deputy refers to the new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, which I launched in January 2001 to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at-risk pupils will be supported, where necessary, over the three year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes &ndash; infants through second class &ndash; and a pupil-teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes &ndash; third through sixth classes.</P>
      <P>Schools participating in the programme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports, including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. Schools already in receipt of additional resources under the disadvantaged areas scheme, including the school in question, will retain their entitlements under that scheme. Under the disadvantaged areas scheme, the school is benefiting from the services of a disadvantaged concessionary teacher and a shared home-school-community liaison teacher. The school also qualifies for special supplementary capitation funding at the rate of &euro;38.09 per pupil and a refund of the television licence fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" />The school referred to by the Deputy is included in the urban dimension of the new programme. The school is eligible to receive &euro;2,200 in respect of the current school year, towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned. This funding is in addition to the &euro;8,304 that the school received under the disadvantaged areas scheme for the current school year. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at-risk pupils in the schools as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>
    <P>Where schools expressed concern about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they were advised to make representations to my Department outlining their circumstances. Schools were informed that these representations would then be referred to the Educational Research Centre for consideration and my Department would then consider the position of these schools. My Department has now received a report from the Educational Research Centre and the situation of those schools that made representations is currently under consideration.</P>
    <P>There is no record of representations having been received from the school until recently and accordingly, the position of the school was not considered. However, the circumstances of the school may fall to be considered again in the context of any future modifications to the programme.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular year is determined by reference to the number of pupils validly enrolled on 30 September of the previous year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. The staffing schedule is issued to the boards of management of all primary schools by circular letter annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government, since taking office, has created an unprecedented number of new teaching posts at primary level. Some 1,800 new teach<Col N="1055" /> ing posts have been created and all posts which were due to be lost to the demographic dividend have been retained by this Government. These measures have enabled the Government to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 19.0:1 in the current school year.</P>
    <P>Teaching posts are also allocated to second level schools and vocational education committees in accordance with generally applicable criteria. Allocations are determined on the basis of enrolments in the previous school year in accordance with a pupil-teacher ratio of 18:1 for older established programmes and a <i>de facto</i> ratio of 16:1 in respect of the leaving certificate applied, the leaving certificate vocational programme and post-leaving certificate courses. In addition, a number of <i>ex quota</i> posts such as principal, learning support, guidance, disadvantage and home school community liaison are allocated.</P>
    <P>The actual pupil-teacher ratio at second level has been reduced as follows over the past four years:</P>
    <P>1996-9716.0</P>
    <P>1997-9815.6</P>
    <P>1998-9915.4</P>
    <P>1999-0015.1</P>

    <P>The reduction in the ratio was achieved through the creation of an additional 1,225 posts and the retention of posts which would otherwise have been retrenched due to the fall in enrolments in the sector. I have recently announced the creation of a further 400 new second level teaching posts. This increase in posts, combined with an anticipated fall in enrolments, will result in further reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio in the sector.</P>

      <P>The planning group that prepared proposals for the national educational psychological service agency recommended an overall target number of 200 psychologists and 36 administrative and secretarial staff. It also recommended that this target should be achieved in a phased manner over a period of five years, beginning during the school year 1999-2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I launched the NEPS agency in May 2002 with the 43 psychologists already employed in my Department. The recruitment of additional psychologists involved the organisation of competitions through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. Notwithstanding the <Col N="1056" /> time consuming nature of such competitions, there are almost 100 psychologists deployed in the education sector.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Commission is currently at the interview stage of a second competition for the recruitment of additional psychologists. It is envisaged that many of them will be in post by the end of this school year.</P>
    <P>I also announced recently that arrangements are being made to enable the full complement of 200 NEPS psychologists to be appointed within the next 12 months. The process of bringing the NEPS up to full strength has been accelerated and will reach 200 by the end of this year, two years ahead of schedule.</P>
    <P>At present, all post-primary schools and approximately 1,800 primary schools have access to the NEPS service. It is envisaged that all schools will have access before the end of the school year 2002-03 and that most will have access well before that time.</P>
    <P>The NEPS is organised in ten regions, roughly equivalent to the ten health board regions. In the draft development plan that it presented to me early in the year 2000, the management committee of the NEPS proposed that the overall number of psychologists should be shared equitably among the regions, based on the projected student numbers in each.</P>

      <P>Virtually all students take mathematics at one of three levels up to leaving certificate and so the need to encourage greater student uptake of this subject does not arise.</P>
      <P>In relation to the sciences, the uptake of science at junior certificate level has remained relatively constant for a number of years at around 89%, although it has shown a slight fall over the last three years and, in the last school year, stood at 88.4%. At leaving certificate level, take-up rates for the physical sciences had been in decline since the mid-1980s but have stabilised over the last two to three years. The take-up rate for biology, which had remained relatively constant for a number of years at around 50% has declined somewhat in recent years and, in the last school year, stood at 41%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to these trends, my Department is implementing a range of measures that are designed to make science subjects more attractive to students. New leaving certificate syllabi in physics and in chemistry were introduced in September 2000 and will be examined for the first time next June. As well as the addition of new, up-to-date content, these syllabi have an <Col N="1057" /> increased emphasis on student practical work and on the interface between science, technology and society. These changes are intended to highlight for students the relevance of these subjects to their everyday lives. A new syllabus in leaving certificate biology has been circulated to schools and will be introduced next September for first examination in June 2004 and at junior certificate level a course committee of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment will shortly finalise a draft of a new science syllabus.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the three new leaving certificate syllabi has been supported by extensive programmes of in-career development and the provision of support materials for teachers. In addition to these materials, my Department has produced comprehensive reference handbooks in both physics and chemistry and has distributed them to all second level schools. These handbooks have been provided in both printed and CD-ROM formats. In addition to the copies sent to schools, individual teachers are being provided with further copies of the CD as part of the in-career development programme. These materials have a particular emphasis on practical work and on the interface between science, technology and society.</P>
    <P>I have established a task force to examine all matters related to the uptake of the physical sciences and related subjects at both second and third level. I expect to receive the final report of the task force within the next few weeks and I look forward to considering the proposals of the task force in relation to the factors impacting on the uptake of the sciences.</P>

      <P>Training and monitoring procedures are put into operation during the initial marking of the examination material presented by examination candidates in order to ensure that all the personnel involved are operating consistently in accordance with the agreed marking schemes. This quality assurance process continues thereafter and, if the work of any examiner continues to cause concern, the entire work of that examiner may be re-marked before the results are issued to candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our examination system and its marking processes is one of the most transparent in the world. We have led the way internationally, grounding our approach on the publication of the detailed marking schemes that have been used by examiners and by giving candidates the facility to view their marked scripts. Those initiatives in trans<Col N="1058" /> parency underpin the quality agenda as candidates are empowered to examine how their scripts were marked in line with the marking scheme that operated for all candidates. Any candidate who has a concern in relation to an examination result can then make an informed decision in relation to an appeal.</P>
    <P>During the appeals process, the scripts are re-marked in accordance with the agreed marking schemes and while the appeal process is candidate specific it is also used as a further quality assurance measure in relation to the work of examiners generally. The policy therefore is to have robust quality assurance measures in place at all stages of the initial marking and subsequent appeal processes.</P>
    <P>These processes are reviewed and refined on an ongoing basis. However, as I stated in my press release on 20 December 2001, announcing the upgrades resulting from the re-marking of the work of an examiner in leaving certificate business, I considered it timely to request my senior officials to convene a working group, chaired by Dr. Carl Ó Dálaigh, deputy chief inspector, to conduct a comprehensive review of all aspects of the monitoring and quality assurance procedures for the marking of examination components. I also decided that this group should involve some inspectors who are chief examiners as well as teachers who have considerable experience as chief advising and advising examiners.</P>
    <P>The working group will report by the end of March 2002 and will issue recommendations on any further improvements in quality control and assurance procedures that could be put in place to ensure the correct and equitable marking of examination material.</P>

This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997.</P>
      <P>Due to the greatly increased level of activity for school buildings since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182, 183 and 185 together.</P>
      <P>My Department currently allocates teaching posts to special classes in primary schools, to special schools and to support children with special needs in mainstream primary schools. In addition, special needs assistant posts are allocated to assist schools with the care needs of pupils with disabilities.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to view each pupil's special needs on an individual basis. For some pupils the nature of the special need may be such that the child can perform quite successfully in an integrated setting with the support, where necessary, of a remedial or resource teacher. Where more serious cases of difficulties arise, provision is made in special schools or special classes dedicated to such children. Therefore, supports as outlined above are allocated by my Department on a demand-led basis and are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child or children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently three special schools and approximately 26 special classes in County Kildare. The number of resource teachers cur<Col N="1060" /> rently in place in the same area is 76 including full-time and part-time posts. Special needs assistants totalling some 173, including full-time and part-time posts, have also been allocated for the support of special needs pupils in the county. Information relating to the number of special needs pupils in mainstream primary education is not readily available in my Department.</P>
    <P>With regard to second level, my Department allocates resource posts, special needs assistant posts and concessionary teaching hours to second level schools to cater for special needs pupils. Applications for such support are made to my Department by the relevant school authorities. Each case is considered on its merits and determined on the advice of the psychological service.  </P>
    <P>In the current school year, eight special needs assistant posts, four resource posts and approximately 11 whole-time teacher equivalents in concessionary teaching hours have been allocated in respect of 107 special needs pupils in second level schools in County Kildare.</P>

      <P>At present a total of 56 learning support teachers are in place in primary schools in County Kildare.</P>
      <P>All second level schools in the free education scheme have an entitlement to an <i>ex quota</i> teacher allocation in respect of remedial allocation. The allocation to individual schools is determined by the enrolment. Schools with an enrolment of 600 pupils or more are allocated a full post. Schools with an enrolment of less than 600 pupils are allocated 0.5 of a whole-time post in respect of remedial education. In the current school year 21 whole-time teacher equivalents have been allocated to second level schools in County Kildare in respect of remedial education.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 186 and 187 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any recent studies carried out to identify the extent of school bullying at primary and second level schools. Schools are not required to report incidents of bullying to my Department. Therefore, the information requested by the Deputy is not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>Individual school management authorities are responsible for implementing effective policies to counter bullying in schools. In 1993 my Department issued, Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour, to all primary and post-primary schools. The purpose of the guidelines was to assist schools in devising school based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness of the problem among school management authorities, staff, pupils and parents. A further circular in 1994 reminded school authorities of their responsibility in formulating a written code of behaviour and discipline, which should include specific measures to counter bullying behaviour.</P>
      <P>The report on discipline, commissioned by my Department and completed by Dr. Maeve Martin, deals comprehensively with the issue of discipline in schools, and sets out models of best practice in this area. A copy of the report has been made available to all schools.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, where staff within my Department receive telephone calls regarding instances of bullying, advice and assistance are offered by staff to the callers. In addition, my Department will examine specific complaints regarding alleged instances of bullying behaviour, but only after every effort has been made at school level to resolve the matter. In addition the national educational psychological service is available as a support service to schools in relation to individual students who encounter difficulties.</P>

      <P>The enrolment policy of each special school is a matter for the board of management. My Department does not have information on the number of pupils awaiting special school placement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Special schools are established in central locations in response to the level of need <Col N="1062" /> presenting in the general area. I am generally satisfied with the overall capacity of the special schools in the area referred to by the Deputy. My Department will sanction additional teaching and/or special needs assistant support when requested by special schools to accommodate increasing numbers.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that a major new initiative was announced in November 1998 in the area of special education under which all children assessed as having special educational needs would in future be entitled to an automatic response to those needs. The measures involved are aimed at ensuring that all children with special educational needs, irrespective of their location or disability, will receive the support they require to participate fully in education.</P>
    <P>The key measures of this initiative includes the introduction of a formalised system of special teaching and special needs assistant support for all children attending school on a fully integrated basis who have been assessed as having special educational needs. It is necessary to view each pupil's special needs on an individual basis. For some children the nature of the special need may be such that the child can perform quite successfully in an integrated setting with the support, where necessary, of a remedial or resource teacher. Where more serious difficulties arise, provision is made in special schools or special classes dedicated to these children.</P>
    <P>Where special needs are concerned, flexibility of response is essential. Every case needs to be assessed on its individual merit. The level and type of response will reflect the special need involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious of the importance of the role that science and technology play in education and my Department has been very active in implementing initiatives to support teaching and learning in these subjects at all levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a critical first step in supporting the development of science and technology, I have ensured the provision of modern curricula and syllabi in these subjects for both primary and second level schools. A new science curriculum was published as part of social environment and scientific education in the revised primary school curriculum in September 1999. This science curriculum is designed to introduce children to the scientific study of living things, the environment and materials. It provides for the acquisition of scientific working methods and the development of technological skills in designing and making. <Col N="1063" /> Revised syllabi in leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry were introduced in September 2000 for first examination next June. A new biology syllabus has been circulated to schools and will be introduced next September for first examination in June 2004. At junior certificate level a course committee of the NCCA will shortly finalise a draft of a revised science syllabus.</P>
    <P>In the technologies, revised syllabi have been prepared under the aegis of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) for three current leaving certificate subjects and are with my Department for approval. The revised syllabi, in architectural and construction technology, engineering technology and design, and communication graphics, provide for an updating of syllabus content and align these subjects with best modern pedagogical approaches in the technologies. A fourth syllabus has been prepared for a new subject, technology, at leaving certificate level. It is intended that this proposed new subject will offer a direct follow-on for students of the current junior certificate subject technology. Furthermore, under the aegis of the NCCA, a board of studies was established in October 1999 to review technological provision in the curriculum at junior cycle. This review is currently taking place. The subjects under review are: metalwork, materials technology (wood) and technology.</P>
    <P>This comprehensive programme of curriculum development and syllabus review will ensure that primary and second level curricula in science and technology will contain high quality curricula, reflecting the most up-to-date knowledge and skills and will promote best pedagogical practice.</P>
    <P>The review of syllabi at second level has been complemented by developments in the State examinations. A new format of examination paper in ordinary level junior certificate science was introduced in the 2000 examination. New structures for the examination papers in leaving certificate physics and chemistry will be introduced for the first examination of the new syllabi in these subjects next June. These new structures build on improvements introduced in the ordinary level papers in these subjects over the last three years.</P>
    <P>I have also ensured that the revision of curricula and syllabi has been supported by comprehensive in-career development programme for teachers. In the 2000-01 school year a developmental project in primary science was initiated in a representative sample of schools through the primary curriculum support programme, which is charged with the organisation of in-career development programmes to support the implementation of all subjects within the primary school curriculum. This developmental project is designed to familiarise teachers with the approaches, methodologies and materials used in the teaching of science, and to build capacity towards the implementation of science in primary schools. The developmental project has been <Col N="1064" /> expanded in the current school year and in September 2002 a national in-career development programme for all primary teachers will commence. The implementation of science in all primary schools will begin from September 2003. As is the case with all subjects on the revised primary school curriculum, schools may commence the implementation of science in advance of the formal in-career development programme if they so wish.</P>
    <P>At second level, a comprehensive in-career development programme for teachers of physics and chemistry was put in place in September 1999 and is designed to run for three years. An in-career development programme for teachers of biology has been put in place in the current school year.</P>
    <P>I have also supported the implementation of science and technology subjects through the provision of grants for equipment and capital expenditure. During the 1999-2000 school year, a total of £1.7 million in the form of grants was made available for the purchase of science equipment in advance of the implementation of science in primary schools. At second level, additional grants for the purchase of laboratory equipment, including ICT equipment, are being provided and schools that currently have a capital project in architectural planning will have their science laboratories upgraded as an integral element of the capital project. An additional annual <i>per capita</i> grant is being provided to second level schools for pupils taking physical science subjects at leaving certificate level.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned to promote the value of science and technology education in general and to this end I have established a task force to examine all matters impacting on the uptake of the physical sciences and related subjects at both second and third level. I expect to receive the final report of the task force within the next few weeks and I look forward to considering the proposals of the task force in respect of the issues relating to the uptake of the sciences. The work of the task force will inform planning in my Department for the continued development of the science subjects.</P>
    <P>The scientific and technological education (investment) fund was set up to develop technology education at all levels, ranging from primary schools to advanced research. The total provision in the fund is &euro;356 million and investment is being made in the areas if infrastructure developments, skills needs, craft needs in the hotel and catering industry, apprenticeships, equipment renewal, and research and development.</P>
    <P>In the area of information and communication technologies, I have recently launched a new three-year plan Blueprint for the Future of ICT in Irish Education. Under this plan the Government will provide &euro;78.72 million capital investment to 2003 in order to ensure the further integration of ICTs into education. It will ensure that the significant lowering of the computer-pupil ratio achieved already can continue so that every <Col N="1065" /> child will have the opportunity to develop the skills required for their future.</P>
    <P>This Government is similarly committed to ensuring that support structures and teacher training in ICT are in place, and to this end the National Centre for Technology in Education will continue to provide support and guidance for teachers. Its publications and website it will continue to provide up-to-date guidance and assistance on the purchase and best educational use of equipment. In all, a current expenditure of &euro;29 million is available so that the crucial needs of teachers are met over the lifetime of this initiative. The first phase of grants under the new initiative, some &euro;25 million, issued to schools in late 2001. This funding will build on the investment made to date and will focus on the development of ICT infrastructure in schools; providing for internet access to the classroom; and ensuring that all teachers can develop the skill necessary to exploit ICTs in the delivery of the curriculum.</P>
    <P>This Government is committed to ensuring that our third level sector is producing sufficient numbers of highly qualified graduates in the science and technology fields and is responding to the needs identified in the reports of the expert group on future skills needs. A further vital element in the development of scientific and technological education is the role of research in our higher education institutions. A provision of &euro;698 million has been allocated in the national development plan towards research, technical development and innovation in the education sector. This level of investment is facilitating a major capital investment programme to develop the research and development physical infrastructure of the third level institutions in line with national strategic priorities. In this regard, I announced the results of cycle 3 of the joint public-private programme for research in third level institutions in December 2001.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology has been established and will provide support for researchers in science, engineering and technology including new and improved grant schemes for postgraduate scholars and post-doctoral fellows as well as providing funding for research projects.</P>

      <P>My Department currently allocates teaching posts to special classes in primary schools, to special schools and to support children with special needs in mainstream primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to view each pupil's special <Col N="1066" /> needs on an individual basis. For some pupils the nature of the special need may be such that the child can perform quite successfully in an integrated setting with the support, where necessary, of a remedial or resource teacher. Where more serious cases of difficulties arise, provision is made in special schools or special classes dedicated to such children.</P>
    <P>There are currently 109 special schools and approximately 598 special classes in the country. A total of more than 1,000 resource teacher posts are now in place in primary schools nationally and my Department is continuing to allocate additional posts in response to identified need.</P>
    <P>At present a total of 1,485 learning support teachers are currently in place in primary schools nationally. In the event of additional learning support teacher posts becoming available, the needs of all schools will be considered by my Department.</P>
    <P>With regard to second level, my Department allocates resource posts, special needs assistant posts and concessionary teaching hours to second level schools to cater for special needs pupils. Applications for such support are made to my Department by the relevant school authorities. Each case is considered on its merits and determined on the advice of the psychological service. In the current school year my Department has approved 262 resource posts and the equivalent of approximately 277 whole-time teacher equivalents in concessionary teaching hours to assist special needs pupils in second level schools. All second level schools in the free education scheme have an entitlement to an <i>ex quota</i> teacher allocation in respect of remedial allocation. The allocation to individual schools is determined by the enrolment. Schools with an enrolment of 600 pupils or more are allocated a full post. Schools with an enrolment of less than 600 pupils are allocated 0.5 of a whole-time post in respect of remedial education. In the current school year 560 whole-time teacher equivalents have been allocated to second level schools in respect of remedial education.</P>

      <P>The allocation for post-primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;182.309 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving accommodation in post-primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the greatly increased level of investment in the post-primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and <Col N="1067" /> minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
    <P>The required refurbishment work at the school to which the Deputy refers is currently progressing through architectural planning. With regard to the further development of facilities, the planning section of my Department is assessing long-term pupil projections with a view to establishing the school's permanent accommodation requirements. As soon as this process is complete the application to develop further facilities at the school will be examined further.</P>
