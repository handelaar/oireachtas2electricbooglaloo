      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 20, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The British-Irish Council established under the British-Irish Agreement held its third summit meeting in Jersey on Friday, 14 June. The meeting was chaired by Senator Pierre Horsfall, president of the States of Jersey Policy and Resources Committee. I was accompanied by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Hanafin. The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Tony Blair and representatives from Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man and Guernsey. Mr. David Trimble, First Minister, and Mark Durkan, Deputy First Minister, represented the Northern Ireland Executive.</P>
      <P>The main focus of the meeting was a discussion on the knowledge economy, on which Jersey is the lead administration, and plans for taking forward co-operation in this area within the British-Irish Council. The meeting highlighted the range of work being done in this important area and agreed that future work in the sector will include specific projects to address the issue of the digital divide &ndash; projects such as disabled access to ICT facilities and e-government. A group of knowledge economy officials from all administrations has been established to take this forward. Members also agreed to work together on the identification and development of pilot programmes for specific issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the discussion on the knowledge economy, the council was updated by the relevant lead administrations on work being undertaken <Col N="132" /> in the other council sectoral areas including drugs, on which Ireland has the lead, the environment, social inclusion, transport, health and tourism. Following the summit meeting the British-Irish Council website was launched by Senator Horsfall.</P>
    <P>The next summit meeting of the British-Irish Council will be hosted by Scotland in November 2002 and that meeting will focus on the issue of social inclusion. The work we undertook in Jersey as well as the programme of work envisaged for the future are ample demonstrations that the council has an important role to play in developing relations between these islands and in addressing issues of common concern and interest to our peoples.</P>
    <P>Before the council meeting, I had a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Blair. We discussed, in particular, concerns about the peace process and the continuing disturbances in north and east Belfast. The situation in Belfast was also a particular focus of my meetings with First Minister David Trimble and Deputy First Minister Mark Durkan when I met them on 27 May and at my meeting with US Ambassador Haass on 11 June. The Government continues to maintain active contact on an ongoing basis with other Northern Ireland political parties.</P>
    <P>The British-Irish Agreement is the best hope for the future of Northern Ireland and it is important now for both Governments and the pro-Agreement parties to ensure that the Agreement is sustained. I look forward to a further meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council later this month. This will be the council's fourth plenary meeting and will allow the Government and the Executive to review progress in a number of cross-Border areas. The two Governments have also agreed to host a meeting in the near future of representatives of the pro-Agreement parties to ensure that momentum and confidence in the process is maintained and strengthened.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, the situation at interface areas in north and east Belfast over the past number of months has led to violence and increased tension between communities. This violence is also occurring in some of the most deprived areas in Northern Ireland. The situation demands real political and community leadership. It is vital that there is effective policing to ensure that the PSNI attracts the support and confidence of all sections of the community as it seeks to discharge its duties. I am concerned that, if allowed to continue, the violence and disturbances will inevitably increase divisions between communities even further and frustrate and debilitate the wider effort to bring stability and normality to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the course of my meeting with Prime Minister Blair, I again raised with him the importance of the British authorities providing material relevant to the Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk bombings inquiry requested by Mr. Justice Barron. I understand that Mr. Justice Barron intends to submit his report on the bombings in the autumn.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" />On Tuesday, 11 June, I met with former Canadian Supreme Court Judge, Mr. Peter Cory. Judge Cory has been appointed by the two Governments to examine the cases of the murders of Pat Finucane, Robert Hamill, Rosemary Nelson, Chief Superintendent Harry Breen, Superintendent Bob Buchanan, Lord Justice and Lady Gibson and Billy Wright. I thanked Judge Cory for agreeing to take on this important work which he is anxious to begin and intends to carry out as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I expect to meet with Prime Minister Blair again during the EU Council in Seville on 20-21 June. I have no immediate plans to visit the United States.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply to the 20 questions grouped together. Will the Taoiseach summarise what his new Government intends to do to maintain the momentum within the peace process and the British-Irish Agreement? In particular, what steps has he taken, together with the British Government, the Prime Minister and the Northern Ireland Executive, to deal with the continuing sectarian divide that has spilled over into communal violence in Belfast? Will the Taoiseach outline what proposals he has, as one of the major co-signatories of the British-Irish Agreement, to restore a sense of commitment to the benefits which were supposed to flow from that agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have, through the North-South Ministerial Councils and in direct meetings with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, looked at the main sectoral parts of the Agreement to see what progress has been made and what progress is necessary. There is ongoing progress in most of these areas, which are working well, but in others there is not as much progress as we would like and we will try to come to an agreement over the next 12 months or sooner on the action we need to take and the targets that need to be met in those particular areas. We have gone through the Agreement and I am glad to report to the House that progress is ongoing in most areas. The work within the Executive, with which we are not directly involved, is progressing and initiatives like the regeneration programme, which were launched some weeks ago, are designed to help target the areas of most disadvantage. Work in the North-South bodies, which slowed down for a while during the election here, has resumed and a range of meetings will be held before the summer break.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the difficulties at the interface areas, our people in the Secretariat have remained involved and closely in touch with the parties. I have personally had a number of meetings and the Minister for Foreign Affairs or officials have remained closely involved with the parties I have not met. Arguments can be made about who is to blame for what happened in various areas and the actions of the Police Service of Northern Ireland in different circumstances, and we can go through <Col N="134" /> them one by one if necessary, but there is active engagement in communities across the divide to try to de-escalate some of these tensions.</P>
    <P>The new term being used in relation to some of the protests in Northern Ireland is &ldquo;recreational rioting&rdquo;. I do not like the term because &ldquo;recreational rioting&rdquo; can easily move on to other rioting but for what it is worth, a distinction is being drawn between recreational rioting and more serious rioting. My own view is that it all has to be taken together and an effort made to encourage real liaison between the communities in whatever way possible. We have seen what happened in Ardoyne and in some areas where that has been facilitated by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, and good progress has been made in that area. Last week the Minister, Martin McGuinness, offered the view that his colleagues would engage directly with loyalist leaders in other areas and the Loyalist Commission has issued its petition. If direct dialogue could be built up in these areas, there would be far less hassle this summer. Our part in that is to directly assist the sides in getting into that type of dialogue and we can play a useful role in encouraging them to do that.</P>
    <P>The other specific point I would like to mention concerns the Police Service of Northern Ireland which has done a very good job in some areas but has been highly criticised in others. We have been endeavouring, through Ambassador Haass, the Secretary of State, Dr. John Reid, and directly through Prime Minister Blair and others, to indicate in a fair way how the concerns expressed to us can be addressed on the ground and the new Chief Constable, Mr. Orde, can help in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Has he been made aware of the reports and comments by various politicians, including the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. John Reid, that following the completion of the Good Friday Agreement and its ratification over the past number of years there is a sense that some sections of the loyalist community believe they are continuing to lose out and that their support for the Agreement has been diminished and is continuing to fall? Does the Taoiseach share that analysis, which is in part an explanation for the reaction of some sections of the loyalist community in the inter-communal areas of Belfast to which he refers? Does he agree with the analysis that in some way the Unionist-loyalist community feels under threat as a result of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement? What steps, if any, does he see the Government taking to reassure that section of the island's population that its place is secure and that the parity of esteem, to which the Agreement refers, will extend to all sections of the people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are constantly being told that support for the Agreement is being eroded, but I believe, from all the many meetings I have <Col N="135" /> had in recent weeks, that underlying support for it and what we have been trying to achieve through it remains fundamentally sound. Difficulties have been highlighted and there may be a sense among considerable sections of the Unionist and loyalist community that they are losing out. However, reports of discussions with them indicate that they accept that an enormous amount is being achieved and, while there is some violence, it is sporadic and a level of reconstruction, regeneration and improvement with a positive approach is also present. The job of both Governments is to continue to give confidence and support in practical ways. I accept that there are some elements within the Unionist-loyalist community which have the view that things are not as good for them. I equally accept that the people of the Short Strand, who have seen their community dwindle considerably because of the difficulties over years, also feel that they are under huge threat. Such feelings are not mutually exclusive.</P>
      <P>The key issue is that we must maintain momentum in the process and do all we can by working closely with the pro-Agreement parties and other parties where possible to ensure that the implementation is fair and to the letter of the Agreement. There should be no advantage for one side over the other; it should be done fairly. Parity of esteem, equality and equity are all fundamental parts of the Agreement, just like demilitarisation and other issues, and should benefit the entire community. We are trying to ensure that every segment of the Agreement is fairly implemented and, in the next few weeks, we hope to have a summit of pro-Agreement parties to gauge where they are disappointed, where they want more progress and to see what can be done. We want a clear understanding of where the Agreement is four years on and how much can be done before the elections next May in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the leader of the Labour Party raising the issue of parity of esteem, does the Taoiseach accept that the Government has a role in maintaining that parity in the eyes of all concerned? Does he accept that it is less than wise, as reported in the newspapers, for discussions to take place about possible links between the SDLP and Fianna Fáil and that talking up such reports does not serve well the sensitivities of the situation? As leader of Fianna Fáil, will he respond?</P>
      <P>Is the Government able to stand its own ground on intelligence, particularly in relation to the situation in Colombia? There were a number of British statements indicating that there was more to the Colombian mission than meets the eye. Is he able to work from Irish intelligence on this matter or is he depending on a pool of intelligence which may be British dominated? Is there Irish intelligence on this matter and, if so, is the Taoiseach able to tell us anything about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to parity of esteem, did the Taoi<Col N="136" /> seach receive an invitation to the Jubilee celebrations for Queen Elizabeth II hosted recently by the British Ambassador? If not, was he represented at the celebrations or did he make a formal communication with the British Ambassador on the matter?</P>
    <P>Has the Taoiseach received an invitation to attend, or has the Government been asked to send observers, to any of the Northern marching events in the summer by way of ensuring flashpoints do not recur?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first matter raised by the Deputy, which is a party political one, I am not here to answer on that, but I read the reports with interest. The reporters probably had more information than I had as president of my party. That is all I can say on that matter. There have been no meetings. Perhaps it was the Greens who talked to them.</P>

      <P>On the question of building confidence and parity of esteem, I will repeat what I said to Deputy Quinn. We can help in a number of ways. We can demonstrate in a competent manner that where there are issues creating difficulties on either side of the divide, we can usefully assist. My view is that this should be done in an even-handed and fair way, always communicating to both sides where we stand on what we can achieve and, where necessary, stating our concerns directly to the British Government or to the parties involved. It is my honest view that the Executive is working well and hard to help each other. I do not think there is tension or unfairness. People are anxious to help and, hopefully, at the meeting we will have with the pro-Agreement parties we will be able to achieve that.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Jubilee celebrations, I think all Ministers were asked. I did not attend, but some of my colleagues did.</P>
      <P>On the matter of intelligence in Colombia, I have heard many reports from people about their views on the position in Colombia, but we have no intelligence on the ground there. I am dependent on reports &ndash; conflicting ones &ndash; from others.</P>

      <P>I met the President of Colombia quite recently. The views were not only British. I have heard many views on this matter, but I have no particular view on it. I am more concerned about what is happening now and what will happen into the future. I cannot influence or change what happened in the past. While there are concerns and will continue to be concerns, the position as of now and going forward is what <Col N="137" /> really concerns the people in Northern Ireland who have raised this matter with me time and time again.</P>
      <P>In regard to building confidence, on some aspects of the Good Friday Agreement we have not achieved as much progress as we would have wished. Those are the areas on which we hope to get agreement. We hope to get a road map agreed at the next meeting. I have had a number of discussions with Mr. Trimble and Mr. Durkan, both separately and together, in the past few weeks and there is a determination that we agree these issues and then move forward. I have discussed that with most of the other pro-Agreement parties. I have discussed it with Sinn Féin and colleagues have discussed it with other parties and I think we can get an agreement to try to make progress at that meeting.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his replies. The Taoiseach will recall that the Good Friday Agreement envisaged the completion of the decommissioning of illegal arms within two years of the referendum being held. Can he give the House any estimate of when the process will be completed? In view of the appalling lack of co-operation by the British Government with Mr. Justice Barron's commission of inquiry, does the Taoiseach share the concern of the families of the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings? Does he feel that the British foot-dragging adds credence to the belief concerning involvement of British agencies in these tragedies?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is aware of the massive support in the country for the recent postcard campaign to pressurise the British Government to shut down Sellafield. Has he used any of the opportunities at his disposal to speak to the British Prime Minister about this?</P>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach spoken to the British Prime Minister about the Stevens report into alleged collusion between security forces and loyalist paramilitaries, part of which report was leaked to a British newspaper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Decommissioning and the work of the International Commission on Decommissioning is ongoing. There have been substantive and extensive acts of decommissioning as reported by General de Chastelain and they are ongoing. There is no completion date as such but the extension made by the British Government and supported by me is the summer of next year. The process will be incremental and hopefully ongoing. There is no question of a deadline, which is never helpful, but what was set down is being delivered on and there is confidence in the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Mr. Justice Barron, I passed on a memo last week from him to Prime Minister Blair and his officials reiterating what is required. He received an amount of information previously but has not got all the information he requires or answers to some of the issues he raised. Whether that information is available or will be handed <Col N="138" /> over is uncertain. We have had a commitment from the Prime Minister and from the Secretary of State, Mr. Reid, that they would provide everything they had through their own intelligence agencies. Mr. Justice Barron is still unsatisfied and that is the position.</P>
    <P>We continually raise the matter of Sellafield and ministerial colleagues are dealing with it. We look forward to the report on the Stevens inquiry. I do not want to comment on leaks of the report as, frankly, I do not know about it. We look forward to the report of Judge Cory, a competent, international and renowned judge, who has given his time to examine the papers in this area and to speak to the families and groups involved. He will spend much of the summer in Northern Ireland working on this which will be helpful. From my meeting with him last Tuesday I do not think he will spend an undue length of time on the work. He is determined to put in enormous effort to bring it to completion as quickly as possible. We have called many times for a public inquiry into these issues and we still hold that view. We will go through the process and wait for the report of the Stevens inquiry and the work of Judge Cory. If, at the end of that, there is still evidence of collusion in some of these cases we look forward to having a full public inquiry on these issues.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach get serious with the British Prime Minister and Government, two and a half years after the independent commission was set up to inquire into the Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk bombings, about the continuing deficit of critical information, which they are clearly refusing to hand over? It beggars belief that the Taoiseach can say he still does not know whether information exists or is available. What does he talk about to the British Prime Minister when he raises this issue? Instead of passing over polite memos, will the Taoiseach take the gloves off and demand that the information is provided forthwith? It is months since a fresh request was sent by the commission for specific information but that information has not been received.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach realise he is dealing with a Prime Minister who seems to be more concerned about where he came in the pecking order around the late Queen Mother's coffin than about matters of substantial social policy and justice? This is an issue of fundamental justice for the bereaved families and the victims. Since the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, apparently puts so much store by his public standing in the media, will the Taoiseach use the media to shame him into giving this information? This is the prime minister who has scurried around the world to be President Bush's outrider in a so-called war on terror yet, with regard to the single worst act of terror on this island&mdash;</P>

      <P>Mr. Justice Barron has received an enormous amount of material from a range of sources, including the British Administration. It is important, in order to have as full and accurate a report as possible, that everyone with relevant information co-operates fully. As I pointed out to the last Dáil, Mr. Justice Barron has received some of the information he sought but not everything. It will be a matter for him to assess and comment in his report on the co-operation he has received from the various authorities with which he has been in contact. My role has been to endeavour, as best I can, to get that information.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the security information, which would be in the security sections of the British Government, is available. I do not have access to that information. All I can do is make the case that we require it. Whether it is available to be handed over or is handed over, we will read in due course in Mr. Justice Barron's report, which will come before a committee of the House for public scrutiny. In the meantime, we will put our full efforts into seeking the information Mr. Justice Barron still requires. However, it is not a question of the information being in this Prime Minister's or the previous Prime Minister's office. That is not the type of information about which we are talking.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his earlier reply. Does he accept that the priority now for the First Minister and all Ministers in the Executive is to get on with the job they were elected to do in their respective Departments? Does he accept that Sinn Féin is fulfilling its mandate and responsibilities in the Executive and that there is no basis for the ongoing threat of the First Minister to bring down the Executive, which he repeated in the past week?</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the Taoiseach's reference to the situation in the Short Strand. Is he fully conversant with the conditions of daily life for that small community of some 3,000 souls who continue to suffer daily attempts by loyalist paramilitaries to carry out worse ravages of sectarian attack? What steps has the Taoiseach taken to have this matter raised with the British Prime Minister? Has the Taoiseach &ndash; he alluded to this matter in his earlier responses &ndash; raised the ongoing, very questionable activity of the RUC-PSNI, which has in some instances participated directly in some of these attacks upon defenceless communities already under attack from loyalist quarters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" />The Taoiseach said he did not like the term &ldquo;recreational rioting&rdquo;, but while joining him in this, I would go further. We should not at any time give currency to the notion of recreational rioting. It is an absurdity and is absolutely offensive. I ask the Taoiseach, therefore, to join me in roundly rejecting all acts of sectarianism, as I did in my address last Sunday at Bodenstown, and to record appropriately whatever source such attacks might emanate from.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty joining anybody in wholeheartedly acknowledging and condemning all acts of violence, whatever source they emanate from, including any attempt to murder a recruit to the Police Service of Northern Ireland or intimidate Nationalists from joining the force. Whatever the level of violence, I roundly condemn it, and I hope everybody else in this House takes the same view.</P>
      <P>I am very well versed on the plight of the people of Short Strand and have enormous sympathy for the community there, which has dwindled from 10,000 people down to 3,000. They have suffered an enormous amount of hardship and intimidation on an ongoing basis. I have made the views of the Government known on the activities of the loyalists and the way the situation was policed by the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The Government believes the handling of the situation left a lot to be desired, and we hope our representations will lead to some improvement. We made those representations directly to Secretary of State John Reid and to Ambassador Haass. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen has expressed our views in other meetings also, and I expressed them to Prime Minister Blair last Friday.</P>
      <P>In the interests of balance and fairness, I also congratulate the Police Service of Northern Ireland on the way it handled difficulties on the same weekend in other areas of Belfast, including Donegall Square, with great professionalism. The same police service operated under different commanders in those instances, and I have heard people who criticised the events in Short Strand also praised police activities elsewhere. This must be made clear for the purposes of even-handed debate.</P>
      <P>I have asked that we seek to achieve consistency in policing because that is how confidence can be developed in the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Hopefully we can move on to a situation where everybody can be supportive of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, that all communities can join it and that we achieve a truly community-wide policing system like that of any other democracy. I am sure Deputy O'Caoláin does not agree with me totally on that but will come around to agreeing with me because it is the best way of dealing with these issues in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ó Caoláin for reminding me of the question as I had forgotten it. As I said to Deputy Quinn, the Executive is working well and I do not see any reasons for a motion of exclusion. I gave my views on the matter last week and, thankfully, the meetings at the weekend went well. We should view all elements of the Good Friday Agreement and the normal day to day issues in the North in a positive manner. I remind those listening to this debate that things are calm among the vast majority of the citizens of the North. Investment, which has increased substantially, will be further considered at a conference in the United States in a few months. All members of the Executive are working on a regeneration programme, involving the investment of large amounts of capital in deprived areas, such as west and east Belfast, which need restoration, reinvigoration, investment and employment. I could mention many such good programmes and other positive aspects of the peace process.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy Ó Caoláin, if I were to make a criticism it would be that positive developments in the North are not publicised. Last Friday, for example, some of the best employment figures in the history of the North were announced, but it was difficult to find a politician of any persuasion to talk about them as they preferred to reflect on certain negative matters. I would like to hear those inside and outside the Executive talking positively as many good things are happening in areas such as health, education, enterprise, energy and transport. If we are to be balanced in our comments on the North, we should mention such matters. As I said to Deputy Quinn earlier, all political parties in the North should talk up the enormously improved situation there if we want to develop confidence in the Good Friday Agreement.</P>

      <P>During his discussions with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and the First Minister, Mr. Trimble, did the Taoiseach raise the current and future roles of the British-Irish Parliamentary Body? I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that the body has contributed significantly to understanding and co-operation between the two peoples and the Parliaments. Members of the Government, including the Taoiseach who is a former joint chairman of the body, have served with great distinction on it. Does the Taoiseach envisage an enhancement of the body's powers? During his discussions with the First Minister, did the Taoiseach ask if Unionist politicians will take their places on the body? The effectiveness of the body would greatly increase if Unionists were present.</P>

Most of the young people to whom I refer do not remember the violence during the armed conflict in the North.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy McGinley's queries about the important matter of the future of the British-Irish Parliamentary Body, it was discussed at the recent meeting of the British-Irish Council. We were unable to come to an agreement at the previous council meeting. Deputy McGinley alluded to the fact that it was agreed some time ago that changes would be made to allow members from other Administrations to sit on the body, but Unionists did not take up that option. What was agreed last Friday was that over the next few months an effort will be made to make whatever institutional changes are necessary to bring everyone on side. Given the brief flavour of the discussions and the comments I had afterwards with some of the leaders I think that will be possible. It may be the end of the year &ndash; perhaps following the November meeting &ndash; before the matter is formally concluded. I asked recently that this should happen more quickly so that the committees here can be set up and it was agreed the issue would be looked at. There is now movement on the issue which, I hope, will be resolved later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not have discussions on the issue raised by Deputy Quinn. Obviously the sectarianism which exists at the interface and in communities is a matter of major concern. It is a concern that there are still efforts on both sides to drive communities out of areas. The major emphasis is to continue to support cross-community programmes, promote the efforts being made in regard to education and build up confidence in these communi<Col N="143" /> ties. However, as the Deputy pointed out, there are still major difficulties. Even though progress is being made and community leaders and political parties are working very hard to try to gain control there are still difficulties. There is not as much progress as one would like and we must continue to work on these problems. It is true of any city that where there is deprivation and social difficulties it is easier for such problems to exist. Rejuvenation and regeneration programmes would help to put an end to these activities. It is worrying that people are still being intimidated and forced out of communities.</P>

      <P>I will begin by congratulating Deputy Hogan on his much deserved elevation to the Fine Gael Front Bench. I look forward to working with him over the next five years.</P>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>The High Court inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited presented their report to the High Court on Monday, 10 June 2002. I have received a copy of the report. The court has ordered that the report not be published or its contents disclosed. The matter was adjourned for further consideration on 24 June 2002.</P>
      <P>The question of the disposition of the report is entirely a matter for the High Court. As I have made publicly clear on a number of occasions, it is my stated wish that the contents of the report should be published in full. It is my intention to seek to be represented at the proceedings on 24 June where I propose to set out the reasons it would be in the public interest that the report be published in full and as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the event that the court feels that further consideration needs to be given to the question of publication of the report, I intend seeking to <Col N="144" /> have the report made available immediately to all relevant competent authorities so that action can be initiated on foot of the material gathered by the inspectors. It is a matter for the relevant competent authorities to follow up on issues raised in the report.</P>
    <P>The investigation and prosecution of company law matters, for which I formerly had statutory responsibility, is now the sole responsibility of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, who has received a copy of the report. The director has indicated publicly that his immediate task will be to study the report and determine the appropriate response for his office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for her kind opening remarks.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the position of Director of Corporate Enforcement and allowing the Ansbacher report, when published, to be given to that individual is an opportunity for the Tánaiste to side-step the issue and to let some quango or agency deal with a very important matter. The Tánaiste promised some time ago that she was going to clean up business and financial malpractice and appointed an inspector in her Department to get to the bottom of the various matters that will be referred to in this report. She expressed surprise at the extent and wide variety of irregular dealings in the financial and business sectors and she expressed surprise at the names she found coming up in relation to different dealings which were deemed to be irregular. Why then does she not take responsibility for her inspector's report and for the work that has been done in her Department, rather than side-step it and pass it to another inspector of corporate enforcement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The law does not entitle me to take any immediate action. This House passed the legislation to establish the independent office with the enthusiastic support of Fine Gael. It is appropriate that company law be enforced on a fair and independent basis, not at the whim of the Minister of the day. In planning appeals, public prosecutions and corporate enforcement, we have all seen that offices should act totally independently, without fear or favour and without political influence.</P>
      <P>The office is appropriately resourced and is staffed by members of the Garda, barristers and accountants, whereas company law heretofore was enforced by one and a half officials in my Department who also had other responsibilities. Quite honestly, company law enforcement was not taken seriously and this only began to change when Deputy Rabbitte was in the Department and the Company Registrations Office was put on a new footing. Over the past 12 months it has been taken seriously for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the report and to company law inquiries, nobody ever initiated 13 inquiries into allegations of breaches of company law. It is very significant and hopefully it will be a watershed, <Col N="145" /> but the most significant outcome from all of this is that we have an independent office. I did not wait until this report was to hand to establish that. It was evident to me in 1999 that a new direction and a new way of enforcing the law was necessary and that is why we proceeded with the establishment of the office, which has been well received in most quarters. Its establishment was supported by everybody in this House.</P>

      <P>Has the Tánaiste established if she will be heard on 24 June? I presume that if her <i>locus standi</i> is established she will argue that the report be brought into the public domain.</P>
      <P>In terms of her previous references to these investigations and to the fact that she was shocked and alarmed at some of the discoveries that came to her attention, now that she has read the report has she changed her mind with regard to her previous characterisation of the players in this drama?</P>
      <P>In the context of some of the comment one occasionally reads, is it possible that some of the players whose names will come into the public domain may be entirely innocent of wrongdoing?</P>

      <P>I cannot comment on the report. The Deputy will appreciate that the President of the High Court ordered that the report be given to the Director of Corporate Enforcement and to me and that we are not at liberty to disclose its contents to anybody or to make comment on it. In fairness, if I make any comment I could be on very thin ice and I do not want to go there. It is far to serious. The matter will be before the Court on Monday and I understand I will be heard. The fact that the President of the High Court facilitated the making available of a copy to me leads me to believe, from legal advice, that we will be heard then.</P>

      <P>I am not surprised that the Tánaiste mentioned 13 inquiries. They never had to be done before and there was good reason that they had to be undertaken over the last number of years. Hopefully, this will not be repeated ever again to the extent that there was political involvement in these matters apart from individuals outside the political domain.</P>
      <P>I do not know why the Tánaiste will not give us a flavour of the course of action she will be taking on 24 June. In view of her strongly held views about the issues involved and the access to information which she has had for a considerable period of time through her own inspector's report, will she confirm that she carried out her own report and that she had information at her disposal which she could have acted on? Why did she do nothing to deal with these issues, allowing them instead to go the High Court, as opposed to acting on her own inspector's report, which was carried out some years ago?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did take action and there were several prosecutions. If the Deputy is familiar <Col N="146" /> with some of the other reports he will know that people were successfully prosecuted under various provisions of the Companies Acts. I set up the new office, but I was not at liberty to act in relation to the Ansbacher report until the inspectors had completed their inquiry. The initial section 8 inquiry, carried out by the authorised officer, Gerard Ryan, was preliminary and his findings warranted the appointment of High Court inspectors which the court acceded to. In my affidavit to the court I stated the reasons I believed such inspectors were appropriate as they have substantially more powers than a section 8 inquiry. In particular, they have powers to take evidence on oath and to compel people to attend and give evidence. That is a very substantial power.</P>
      <P>I am not going to say what the flavour of my remarks will be, but the report has cost &euro;3 million to date. We know from the Revenue Commissioners that they have collected &euro;17 million on account from 50 of the people involved, which is public information given in this House some time ago by the Minister for Finance. These are the figures to the end of March. If a report has cost &euro;3 million, it should be provided to the public and I will argue the reasons I believe that in court next Monday, subject to legal advice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, CE, participation levels are gradually being reduced reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of the long-term unemployed, and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. The PPF contains a commitment to reduce overall place numbers on CE to 28,000 by 2003 through a reallocation of funding equivalent to 5,000 places to the social economy, together with the reduction of 4,500 places required by the Government's decision of 21 July 1999.</P>
      <P>The mainstreaming of school services currently under way and the proposed mainstreaming of other essential services, including the health and environmental sectors, will further reduce the numbers employed on the programme. This has been confirmed by my Department in detail on a number of occasions in the context of discussions with the social partners on the PPF standing committee on labour market matters. I have also made this position clear in my responses to a number of previous parliamentary questions on the restructuring of CE.</P>
      <P>There were 30,809 participants on CE at the beginning of 2002 and it is anticipated that the year-end participation rate will be in the region of 24,000 to 25,000 places depending on the rate of inflows and outflows on the scheme. This phased reduction in place numbers is part of a strategic shift in policy in favour of greater investment in training and other supports, for example, social economy and the new high supports process, which I will launch shortly.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the concerns of sponsors from community organisations regarding the implications of the reduction in CE places for the provision of community services. In this regard I emphasise that FÁS prioritises projects according to the types of services provided and levels of unemployment in the locality and will co-ordinate reductions to minimise the negative effects on groups and services most in need of CE. Priority groups include the drugs task forces, child care service provision and designated disadvantaged areas covered by the new RAPID programme and the BMW region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the social economy programme is available to support the development of social economy enterprises that will benefit the economic and social regeneration of communities. Local social economy working groups have been established in the 38 designated disadvantaged partnership areas and in 16 non-partnership <Col N="148" /> areas. In this way, the social economy is targeted at areas which traditionally have had high dependence on services provided under CE.</P>
    <P>A review of active labour market programmes, as provided for under the PPF, has recently commenced under the standing committee on the labour market, which is chaired by my Department. The committee includes representatives of the community pillar, employers and trade unions, as well as other Departments and FÁS. Consultants have recently been appointed by my Department to facilitate a rigorous assessment of the effectiveness of existing programmes, which will help to inform the deliberations of the standing committee. Terms of reference for the consultants' work were agreed by a steering group representing the standing committee, which included all the social partners.</P>
    <P>I fully recognise the range of valued services across communities which have been provided with the support of CE. The mainstreaming initiative recognises that certain key support services, such as in the education and health areas, can best be provided through the Department with functional responsibility in the relevant area. This is why the appropriate funding transfers from FÁS to the Departments in question are taking place. FÁS is undertaking its own internal review of the scheme, which should further inform the prioritising of activity within CE, taking account of the needs of disadvantaged groups and the provision of services to areas experiencing severe social and economic disadvantage. The future policy direction of active labour market programmes, including CE, will be informed by the outcome of these processes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying the cause of concern of all the people who marched on her advice centres and press conferences during the election and all the deputations that sought to meet her was ill-founded? Is she denying that there is confusion at the heart of the operation of these schemes now; that people are being disemployed as we speak; that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is up in arms about not having been consulted; that the terms of reference as agreed in the social contract, the PPF, are not being adhered to on the side of the Government; and that there is widespread concern about the impact on badly needed community services of the cutbacks that are being implemented operationally, irrespective of her protestations that this is not happening? Is it not fair for this side of the House to inquire of the Minister to make clear whether these cuts are taking place with her authority and that of the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I know my reply was long but I said there were 30,800 places on CE schemes at the start of the year and by year end there will be between 24,000 and 25,000. In addition, a number of places has been mainstreamed and transferred to the Department of Education and Science. However, I will put this in perspective for the <Col N="149" /> Deputy. Five years ago, 72,500 people were involved in community employment and various other training initiatives while today there are 74,000. We are spending more than &euro;200 million more per year on training and community employment than five years ago. At that time the unemployment rate was 11% while it is now 4%, the long-term unemployment rate was almost 6% and this has reduced to 1.3% and there was one CE place for every 2.5 long-term unemployed person and that has been reduced to one place per 0.7 long-term unemployed persons. There has been improvement on three fronts. The emphasis, including by the social partners, has been to try to get people into training so that they can be equipped with the skills for a real job in the labour market.</P>
      <P>Two issues concern me. The first relates to individuals involved in CE schemes who, for whatever reason, are not in a position to take up a job when they complete the scheme. That is a huge concern and I will announce a new process shortly for dealing with these hard cases. These individuals require much more intensive assistance and mediation from FÁS. The second issue relates to the services and activities that would not exist were it not for CE such as those provided in schools, in the areas of health, the environment and so on. The process of mainstreaming services began in schools last year and will continue shortly in regard to health and environmental services because we must get away from the notion of stop-start support for worthwhile activities.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 70,000 foreign workers in Ireland. Employers are seeking work permits on their behalf and so far this year 18,000 have been granted. This is in addition to those who come here from the European economic area who do not require work permits. It would be irresponsible of me as Minister with responsibility for employment and training not to respond to the significant changes taking place in the labour market. There is a number of separate issues that must be dealt with in a different context. The social economy is part of that. The Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, has been given responsibility for community services and I shortly hope to discuss the role that mainstreaming CE can play in supporting worthwhile activities on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could have saved herself a great deal of trouble in dealing with the co-ordination of the new initiatives that she proposes to take in the near future if she had done so in more thoughtful fashion months ago when individuals and community groups contacted Members regarding their concerns about continuing their programmes through FÁS over the next few years under the CE scheme. The Minister referred to a stop-go approach but communities have been engaged in such an approach because the Minister and FÁS have not ensured there is planned and co-ordinated implementation of FÁS social economy schemes, which are essential <Col N="150" /> to fill gaps in the labour market in the areas of health, education and the environment.</P>
      <P>What analysis has been carried out by the Department to verify that CE schemes are not operating to the standard it wishes and that another scheme which the Minister is about to announce will be better? Is she aware that FÁS has no problem spending money on job creation at its headquarters through the provision of directorships and supervisory positions while the number of places on employment schemes is being reduced at local level where the real work is being done?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of places is a function of two factors, one of which is the level of unemployment. Let us be honest. Community employment and its forerunner, social employment, were introduced at a time of high unemployment to reduce the numbers on the live register. That is a fact. At a time in the 1990s when the economy was growing we still had a growth in joblessness and high levels of unemployment as a result of which the numbers on CE schemes were extended. Since then there has been a dramatic transformation in this economy, particularly in the area of employment, and we have ended forced emigration. We must respond to that and there are two things we could do. We could reduce the number of people in mainstream training and maintain the high numbers in community employment, something I do not believe would be sensible. I believe it is preferable to equip very young people with a skill for a real job which will see them through their entire working lives and provide higher incomes and greater prosperity than to maintain them on community employment. A number of years ago, we decided to increase the age threshold for participation in community employment to encourage those young people into mainstream training and this is working extremely well.</P>
      <P>We are not introducing new schemes; the social economy came out of a consultation process under the PPF and is working well. Although only in its infancy, it is developing a new model for the creation of enterprises in the community particularly in disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <P>An agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to implement the recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. The implementation group which was set up at the end of April 2002, is making good progress on the preparation of an action plan to give effect to the 67 recommendations.

      <P>It took the previous Government five years to notice that there was a problem with insurance. I know that the Tánaiste and other Members were being regularly lobbied by young people and business interests. Lo and behold, the report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, which took three years to compile, was published a couple of weeks before the general election. The timing could not have been better from a political point of view but young people and business people must suffer on due to the failure to face up to the vested interests. Is the Tánaiste aware that in 2001 the annual insurance premium for a typical grocery and electrical shop rose from &euro;21,000 to &euro;31,000? Is she aware that small businesses in the construction sector must pay enormous increases in premia from &euro;14,000 in 2001 to &euro;38,000, for employer's and public liability insurance? Is she aware that a 20 year old male driver seeking insurance for the first time could pay up to &euro;6,000 for third party, fire and theft cover? These are the realities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste aware that there is a 35% increase in premia for household insurance although cover is being reduced? What timescale is the Tánaiste setting for the implementation of this report's key recommendations? She stated recently that she intends to tackle some of the professional groups, particularly the legal profession, which are contributing to the high cost of insurance. Can the Tánaiste give some hope to <Col N="152" /> young people seeking their first motor insurance cover?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the interesting statistics quoted by Deputy Hogan but the subject of the question is motor insurance. Nobody who lives in this country could be unaware of the prohibitively high cost of motor insurance for all drivers but particularly for young people. It is a fact that the number of fatalities on the roads relative to the number of cars halved in the period 1990 to 2000 but insurance increased by 57% and rose by 18% in 2001 alone. Notwithstanding some of the changes made in the past such as the abolition of the two senior counsel rule and jury trials, there was still no visible effect on the cost of premiums.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that this issue is my political priority in the Department and, in so far as I can drive this agenda politically, I intend to do so over the coming months. I had a long meeting yesterday with all the relevant officials in my Department and I hope to be in a position to publish the targeted timeframe in September or October after I have presented it to Government in early September.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan is correct that this is not just an issue of motor insurance; there are wider implications and huge changes which must be made across various Departments. Of the report's 67 recommendations, 17 relate to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, so this agenda must be driven across Government if we are to achieve fundamental change. I expect to see the long-promised <i>quid pro quo</i> from the insurance companies when we introduce the changes. I hope to establish the PIAB on an interim basis very quickly, pending the passing of the legislation in the House. The companies must then provide a clear and visible <i>quid pro quo </i>for consumers.</P>

      <P>There is a rumour that general insurance companies are no longer happy to trade in the Irish market and could decide to pull out if action is not taken by the Government to deal with the issues elucidated by the Tánaiste. Does the Tánaiste believe that a cartel is operating in the insurance business in Ireland, particularly in motor insurance, because of the small number of companies willing to quote in this jurisdiction? What measures would the Tánaiste be happy to see implemented in the motor insurance industry by the end of her term of office?</P>

      <P>The Government can do a number of things but societal changes are also required. The compensation culture is extraordinary. We all know that the person who can get an easy &euro;5,000 or &euro; 10,000 compensation is regarded as a hero in the workplace. We must root out the &ldquo;compo culture&rdquo;. There are some immediate steps which can be taken. I have been in contact with the Office of the Attorney General in order to draft regulations which will require insurance companies to give customers at least 15 days <Col N="153" /> notice of the cost of their premium and details of the no claims bonus so that the consumer can then shop around. If notice of the premium cost is given on a Friday and the insurance is due on a Saturday or Sunday, then clearly the consumer does not have many options.</P>

It is probably taken as read that the Minister will be seeking to have the report made public. Will she be seeking any other orders from the court next Monday arising from this report? Any such approach to the court on her behalf would be made in public so it is not a question of her commenting on the report in any way. What is her attitude to those who claim that they have been innocently maligned by being included in the report?

      <P>The answer to that is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. It is open to the presiding judge to inquire of the inspectors and to make a decision based on what they say as to where costs should be levied, for example. This is something in which I have an interest, but it will be a matter for the presiding judge after hearing what the inspectors might say in relation to it. Following up is clearly a matter for the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Revenue Commissioners and other competent authorities. If there are names of innocent people who might be maligned, it is a matter for the presiding judge. I am certain that given that Mr. Justice Finnegan took some time before he made a decision on this matter, these issues will all be reflected on appropriately by the court. It will be purely a matter for the court.</P>

      <P>I would be very foolish if I was to say that there would never be tax evasion again. It is in the nature of a human being to try to avoid paying tax if he or she can get away with it, but hopefully, with greater vigilance from the Revenue Commissioners, which we have seen in recent years, and reports like this, there can be a new culture and a new regime. Thankfully, lower tax rates may help as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding other measures, the new regime we are about to put on a statutory basis for the auditing profession, which will require auditors to report any wrongdoing or breaches in the Companies Acts to the Director of Corporate Enforcement, will be very significant. It will place a huge onus on members of the auditing profession to bring to the attention of the relevant authorities cases where they have reason to believe the law has been broken. That is significant. Auditors have huge powers and it is appropriate that they should have responsibilities.

      <P>I suppose that in the past we were always very good at avoiding what one would broadly call political hot potatoes. That is why it is significant that we have a new independent office where these issues will be handled on a purely independent basis. Everyone here accepts that the Director of Public Prosecutions, An Bord Pleanála and bodies of that kind act totally independently and that is how it should be in relation to such matters. The people who carried out this investigation, including the authorised officer of my Department and the inspectors, including Mr. Justice Costello, who unfortunately had to stand down, are very honourable people and they have done a very good job.

      <P>It is reasonable for this side of the House to inquire of the Tánaiste if it is a reasonable inference to take from her replies so far that representations were made either to her and-or other members of the Government about the subject matter of this report. We ought to hear from her without drawing any judgment about what the nature of the response was to such representations &ndash; if those representations were made &ndash; if she can say by whom they were made. If she cannot tell us that, she ought to be able to tell us to whom they were made.

I have spoken to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance as the competent authority about previous reports but if the Deputy is asking me if anyone made representations to me to back off, if that is the intention of the question, the answer to that is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of Deputy Rabbitte's question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. In regard to the second part of his question, invariably the lawyers would say on whose behalf they were writing. Clearly, the Attorney General would respond on my behalf and the authorised officer would be made aware of any legal issues raised by individuals concerned. It is fair to say that the Minister of the day in the context of the former law, before we moved it to an independent process, had discretion about whether to have any of these inquiries. To recap, these inquiries came about after the McCracken report. Nobody called for them either in this House or elsewhere. I initiated those inquiries on foot of the McCracken report and on foot of the report from Gerard Ryan. I went one step further. That is always a matter of discretion.

That the law will be enforced, without fear or favour, is <Col N="158" /> the greatest deterrent to ensuring we do not have tax evasion on the same scale as in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>FÁS has a comprehensive approach and support system for workers who are threatened with, or affected by, redundancy.</P>
      <P>Where people lose their jobs by way of redundancy, FÁS has a procedure for putting supports in place prior to the date of redundancy to enable employers and employees to prepare for exit planning related to retraining or alternative job-seeking. Where such redundancies affect large numbers, then other agencies are involved, for example, the IDA, Forfás, local enterprise boards, partnerships, LES and Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>Appropriate supports include individual interviews, career evaluation, career planning, retraining or training upgrades and job matching with local vacancies that may exist. Where appropriate, specific training courses are set up.</P>
      <P>Where the job losses are of a different nature and people register with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs as unemployed there is a standard procedure in place between both FÁS and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to point such people towards the variety of FÁS services available to their particular needs.</P>
      <P>In both scenarios, the supports are delivered by FÁS throughout its network and are processed on an integrated basis through employment offices, training centres, community offices and services to employers. These interventions were a key component of the successful strategy pursued by the last Government that delivered economic and social progress through job creation with the resultant low unemployment rates.</P>
      <P>The new Government recently reaffirmed its commitment in the programme for Government which stated &ldquo;FÁS will engage with redundant workers and people facing the prospect of long-term unemployment to ensure that the period out of work for a substantial number of people is kept to a minimum.&rdquo;  I assure the House it is a commitment that will be delivered upon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>When particular companies close or make a large number of workers redundant, FÁS tends to come in with a customised initiative. We have seen great success in this area. For example, former textile workers have been equipped with IT skills for new jobs which in many cases pay substantially more money. That tends to be the response. There are substantially more people in training now than ever before. It is important in particular that those who have been in traditional employment have the opportunity to access a new skill to enable them obtain a job in a different sector. That is a priority for FÁS. Given that the number of redundancies this year is higher than last year it is becoming a greater problem. I have no evidence to suggest that a significant number of current redundant workers are not in a position to access appropriate training within a reasonable timeframe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respect, the question was whether adequate resources are available to FÁS to cater for those job losses and retraining places required while at the same time continuing to support the various social employment schemes, referred to in previous parliamentary questions, which have been the cause of some concern throughout the country by various voluntary groups and those involved in organising social employment schemes during the past 12 months. That part of the question is still unanswered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in reply to an earlier question that there are two issues in regard to community employment, namely, the individuals involved and the cutbacks and reductions. Clearly one has to remain concerned about individuals who may not be able to access a job in the economy. That is the reason we will ensure some more intensive work is done with people who, for whatever reason, do not seem able to make that progression. There is a wide range of activity supports. There are about 3,000 community employment schemes. A large number of services is provided through community employment. The intention is to mainstream community employment because there cannot be the stop-start approach for many of these organisations which find it difficult to provide the service and in many cases would not be able to provide the service without support from the State.</P>

I do not think many people would argue against the mainstreaming of some community employment jobs. It makes sense for the Department of Education and Science rather than FÁS to decide where resources go. The same could be said in regard to the Department of Health and Children and the Department of the Environment and Local Government in terms of community employment schemes. The position is unclear regarding the transfer from community employment schemes to other areas. Deputy Rabbitte was correct when he made the point&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we have made some changes. We have made it somewhat more difficult for employers to get a work permit. The fee has been substantially increased. It is a requirement that they must first go to FÁS who must be satisfied that there is no Irish person or European citizen available to do the work before a recommendation for a permit is granted. We probably need to do more. It is the intention to put the work permit regime on a statutory footing and, perhaps, to introduce the concept of a green card but that is a separate issue. Clearly we have been more vigilant in areas where there have been substantial job losses. FÁS has been vigilant in trying to ensure employers access the local available labour before a permit is issued.</P>

      <P>In the midst of the general election campaign, an old political soldier passed away in his native Clare at the age of 76. The late Sylvester Barrett was held in high esteem by the community and people of County Clare whom he served in public life as a member of Dáil Éireann and the European Parliament. He inherited a rich tradition of public service and patriotism from his father, Frank, who had been commandant in the mid-Clare brigade of the Old IRA, and as a member of Clare County Council. Sylvester Barrett entered politics in 1968 on the occasion of a by-election caused by the death of Deputy Bill Murphy. He was elected in the general election of the following year and topped the poll for the revised constituency of Clare-South Galway. In 1977, he was appointed Minister for the Environment by Jack Lynch and among the decisions he took was to make the wearing of seat belts compulsory, the introduction of the breathalyser test and many others related to safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He subsequently served as Minister for Defence and Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works under Mr. Haughey. It was in the latter capacity that he declared the Burren a national park. In 1984, he was elected to the European Parliament. He did not seek re-election in 1987 and retired from the European Parliament in 1989. Throughout his <Col N="166" /> life, Sylvester Barrett was a committed member of the Fianna Fáil Party and as a mark of the esteem in which he was held, he was appointed honorary president of the Fianna Fáil organisation in County Clare.</P>
    <P>Sylvester Barrett was a keen sportsperson. He had a particular passion for greyhounds and horse racing. He would be known to many people in this House and continued to have an enormous interest in the work of the House. He was a man who had wide interests and many friends and he worked hard for the people he represented. He believed in public service and whether in Dublin or Brussels, he never forgot the people he was elected to serve in Clare.</P>
    <P>I want to take the opportunity to express my sincere sympathies and the sincere sympathies of the Fianna Fáil Party to Sylvester's wife, Mary, his sons, Frank, Joe, Syl and Tom, his brother, Frank, and his sisters, Anna and Sister Gertrude. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom ómós a thabhairt don iar-Theachta, Sylvester Barrett, a fuair bás le déanaí. Ba iad mhuintir Chondae an Chláir a bhí mar phríomh chúram aige agus é ina Theachta Dála.</P>
      <P>Sylvester Barrett was born on the same day as the foundation of Fianna Fáil in 1926. He was first elected to Dáil Éireann in a by-election in 1968 following the death of the then Fine Gael Member, Deputy Bill Murphy, and he served as Minister for Local Government in the 1977 Fianna Fáil Government. He is remembered particularly for awarding a general amnesty giving full driving licences to provisional drivers, one of whom is sitting beside me. He was the first person to oversee the running of the newly created Department of the Environment, putting in place environmental policies which provided a platform for successive Governments. He also served as Minister for Defence between 1979 and 1981 and Minister of State at the Department of Finance in 1982 before running for the European Parliament in 1984, where he served with distinction until 1989. He retired from Dáil Éireann in 1987 when he did not seek re-election.</P>
      <P>He was regarded, first and foremost, as being a real Clare man and as a Deputy between 1968 and 1987. He sought principally to promote the interests of his native county and the mid-west region. He was the Fianna Fáil spokesman on energy in the mid-1970s when he was recognised as an authority on the subject during the world oil crisis at that time. I regret that he suffered a debilitating stroke in December 1997. He is survived by his wife, Mary, his sons, Frank, Joe, Syl and Tom, his brother, Frank, and his sisters, Sister Anna and Sister Gertrude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that there was an extremely strong Fianna Fáil tradition in the Barrett household. A famous incident in County Clare was when his aunt Peg threw herself in front of the armed forces who were there to arrest de Valera <Col N="167" /> in the square in Ennis, a much remarked upon event in political life in Clare.</P>
    <P>Sylvester Barrett will be remembered for being a kind and generous spirit, a true Clare man who sought at all times to promote the welfare of his county. In so far as this House is concerned, he left a mark that probably has been the cause of Governments being either taken out or put together because he was responsible for the reconstruction and renovation of the Dáil bar.

      <P>On my behalf and on behalf of the Labour Party, I would like to extend our sympathies to the Fianna Fáil Party on the death of the former Deputy, Minister and MEP, Sylvester Barrett, and also to his family who are known to me personally, in particular his brother Frank. I recall in 1977 when Sylvester Barrett was the man appointed to be the first Minister for the Environment by Jack Lynch and the many actions he took in that job, which he relished, until 1979 when he was moved to another Department following a change of leadership in Fianna Fáil, a change he did not support. Nevertheless, he continued to serve his party with loyalty and distinction and, as has already been said, he went on to represent the province of Munster in the European Parliament in 1984. At all times he was a courteous and gentle but strong and tough individual. He was very conscious of his position and very courteous to young Deputies like myself and others and very true to the Fianna Fáil Party into which he had been born, both literally and spiritually. He will be missed by many of the people who knew him here. Many of us learned with sadness of the very severe stroke he suffered which took away the quality of his life for his remaining years. I would like to extend our sympathy to his wife, his children, his extended family and the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to join the Taoiseach and the other party leaders in offering my sympathy to Mary Barrett and to the late Sylvester Barrett's four sons and his family. Perhaps I should not admit it but, like Deputy Hogan, I was a beneficiary of his amnesty also and he always had a special place in my heart. Given the long waiting lists for driving tests on that occasion, he felt the most appropriate, effective and pragmatic decision to make was to have a general amnesty. I was not aware that any other Member of the House was a beneficiary. I would not have been so willing to admit that I was one had I known that my counterpart in the Fine Gael Party was also a beneficiary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Quinn said, Sylvester Barrett was the first Minister for the Environment when the post was created in 1977. He went on subsequently to become Minister for Defence. He was in every sense a gentleman. He was gen<Col N="168" /> uinely popular on all sides of this House. He was quiet spoken but very effective. He was also a member of another group in the early 1980s known as the Gang of 22 which, given his Clare roots and his Fianna Fáil tradition, about which Deputy Kenny spoke, took a lot of courage. He was a person of the utmost integrity. It is sad that in recent years he suffered such ill health. I am aware in particular that he enjoyed, as the Taoiseach said, the dogs, horses and sport generally. He particularly enjoyed his membership of the European Parliament and it is significant that his son is now working with the Fianna Fáil group in Europe.</P>
    <P>To the Fianna Fáil Party, I offer my sympathy but especially to his wife, Mary, his family and the people of Clare.</P>

I extend the sympathy of the Sinn Féin team in the House to Fianna Fáil on its loss at this time. Many of the Members on the Fianna Fáil benches served with Deputy Barrett over a number of years. I did not have that pleasure and opportunity as he retired in the year I was elected to the House, but from everything I have known and heard of Deputy Barrett, he was undoubtedly, as the Taoiseach described him, and I concur with that view. I sincerely express, on behalf of myself and my party colleagues, our sympathy to his grieving widow and family in their loss.</P>

      <P>It is with regret that my first contribution in the Dáil as a new Member for County Clare is tainted with sadness as we pay tribute to the late Sylvie Barrett who died last month. As a young fellow, I knew Sylvie before he entered politics. He was a rate collector in my district and on many occasions he gave me a lift home from national school. He was a friend of my father and my family. He became a Deputy in 1968 and served as a Minister in a number of Departments. He is best remembered as the first Minister for the Environment in 1977, replacing the old Department of Local Government. He was a successful Minister. He was a plain, shy, genuine person and popular on all sides of the political divide. He became an MEP in 1984 and remained one until 1989. I am sure he was delighted to retire then to get away from the Brussels Eurocrats as he was very much a rural person at heart. He was delighted to return to his native parish where he concentrated on his great love of sports, particularly greyhounds and horses. One of his greatest moments of triumph was in 1995 when Clare won the all-Ireland hurling final, which he attended in Croke Park.</P>
      <P>When he became ill in December 1997, he bore his illness with great courage and dignity. It was very sad that he died during the general election campaign last month. I sympathise with his wife, Mary, and sons, Joe, Syl, Thomas and Frank, who maintains the political connection as head of the Fianna Fáil group in the European Parliament.

      <P>As I indicated earlier, I am taking up Deputy Quinn's suggestion. Everyone in the country still feels sad about last Sunday's match, but 48 hours on, it gets a little better with the team's homecoming. I thank them individually and collectively for the enormous satisfaction and pride they gave to the country over the past <Col N="170" /> four weeks in their preparations for the games and their performance in the four matches. To the officials of the FAI, and particularly Mick McCarthy, the entire panel and everyone on the staff associated with the team's well-being, I give credit, and everyone in the House thanks them. They gave a huge lift to the country and, from the youngest person to the oldest, everyone was a World Cup expert.</P>
      <P>Their manner of exiting was heart-breaking, but at the same time, it gave everyone great pride in their achievements. They were not given much chance by the experts of qualifying from their group in the first place. They had to knock out either Portugal or the Netherlands which was not going to be easy, but they knocked out the Dutch, which was a huge achievement. To get through the first round after dealing with the controversy within the panel, about which much has been said, they had to steady themselves and then go into a tough group beginning with Cameroon, a team that was both African and Olympic champions. They had then to face Germany, one of the perennial great teams of the World Cup, and they got a spectacular draw. They were successful against Saudi Arabia before going on to meet Spain, still one of the fancied teams, although it did not look so great on Sunday, but that might change.</P>
      <P>I thank them all for what they have done for the country. They did the country proud. They did not get the step up that we all thought they deserved, but that is for the history books. We can celebrate today that we had a team in the World Cup that reached the second round. They were unlucky to go out. They did the country proud.</P>

      <P>I join the Taoiseach, who is an acknowledged expert in the area of sport, in paying tribute to the Ireland team, the manager, the FAI and the supporters. They brought a sense of excitement, passion and courage to their games in the World Cup. The television shots of the supporters in the stadium after the match was a glorious personification of Ireland's personality. They also did the country proud and got us enormous credit internationally by showing the kind of people we are.</P>
      <P>On behalf of my party, I join the Taoiseach in paying due tribute to a wonderful squad, wonderful supporters and a great team management system, despite all the difficulties. The squad represented a small country against the might of international football giants, and acquitted themselves with honour, valour and credit. For that, we will never forget them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the comments that have been made. In particular, I salute Mick McCarthy, the entire panel and the officials from the FAI for giving this nation a sense of joy and celebration in a manner that has brought together many people of diverse backgrounds to celebrate a sporting event. The composition of the team <Col N="171" /> and the many accents that make up its composition is an indication of how widespread the Irish nation truly is and reinforces for us the necessity to recognise that diversity. It is appropriate that some type of formal recognition be conveyed in due course, following consultation with the relevant people.</P>
      <P>I want to make one observation because I heard the Taoiseach and others speak on radio in relation to this. It is sad that the people of Dublin and of Ireland cannot celebrate the homecoming of the team on the streets of Dublin. It is also sad that the gardaí feel incapable of providing the necessary security to ensure people's safety. We saw our neighbours celebrate the Jubilee of the Head of their State recently with close to one million people out on the streets. Perhaps the new Minister for Justice and the Government could make inquiries as to why this celebration cannot be done safely, properly and joyfully on our streets as well. If it was safe for former President Clinton to address the people of Dublin from College Green and not pose a security risk, surely it would have been equally as safe for Mick McCarthy and the lads to come through the streets of Dublin rather than be obliged to go to the Phoenix Park for reasons that unfortunately reflect not too well on our collective efforts to provide security on what is a happy and joyful occasion.</P>

      <P>I join the Taoiseach and the other party leaders in paying tribute to the team. It gave us all an enormous amount of pleasure in the past few weeks. We hoped it would never end. In particular, it was a great source of inspiration for young people. Notwithstanding the controversies and the difficulties at the start, Mick McCarthy showed tremendous leadership and the team remained focused on the job in hand. I know it will get an appropriate welcome this evening, but it deserves much more. Deputy Quinn made a good suggestion, which I know the Taoiseach will consider.</P>
      <P>For the future we can all look forward to that terrific group of Irish supporters from Australia, Japan and Korea whom we saw at the matches. I do not know where they all came from, but it was terrific to see the spirit in which they backed the team. Everybody who watched the matches in other countries must have been talking about the wonderful Irish fans. As Deputy Kenny said, they represented the spirit and personality of Ireland.</P>

I thank Mick McCarthy and the Irish soccer team for bringing such a sense of enjoyment, pride and solidarity to people from all backgrounds who, irrespective of their political affiliations, regard themselves as Irish. From that point of view, a great feat has been achieved, even if we did not win the World Cup.</P>
      <P>It is important to reflect on the challenges the Irish team faced, to which they rose against enormous odds in the four games they played. That shows up in poor light the fact that the officials, in terms of the welcoming home celebrations, could not rise to the challenges they faced. While safety fears may be been expressed in 1990, a dozen years have passed in the meantime in which we could have come up with solutions.</P>
      <P>It would have been a great achievement, for example, to bring the Irish team by helicopter to Dublin Castle, for the squad to walk down Dame Street to College Green and to have the celebrations in the city which is crying out as the capital of the country to host these celebrations. That challenge remains for another time. It should be possible to overcome the logistical problems and to give the people of Ireland the opportunity to say thanks for what was an amazing achievement.</P>

      <P>We recognise the team's tenacity, which was strong, prevalent and very much in evidence in all the games it played. It united almost all opinion throughout the land behind it. That was apparent on each day the games were played. The island as a whole almost came to a standstill. The team has done us all proud and is deserving of the celebratory nature of its welcome home to Ireland this evening.</P>
      <P>Like Deputies Quinn and Sargent, I also wish, in a constructive tone, to encourage a visitation of the difficulties that have been referred to as leading to the almost herding of the welcome home event out to the Phoenix Park. The city of Dublin, the capital of Ireland, and its centre city area was the appropriate location for this welcome home, one that would have accorded the opportunity for a great deal more people to see firsthand the returning Irish team. That is something that needs to be addressed. I hope the situation we will see this evening will not be repeated on future occasions. I have no doubt the Taoiseach will take on board the sentiments of the nation as expressed on the airwaves in the past 48 hours.</P>

      <P>In keeping with the theme of the arrival of the Irish team back home today, will the Taoiseach clarify whether, in the words of another, a seismic shift has been brought about in Government policy by the Minister for Justice? Will he clarify if a decision has been taken to move the proposed stadium from Abbotstown to Ringsend? There has been great media speculation about this. This is obviously important for the team arriving here this evening. The younger members of the squad might be able to play there in the European Championships. Will the Taoiseach clarify whether a decision has been made to move from Abbotstown to Ringsend and when can we expect an announcement on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach indicate when the Government will publish the interim report outlining what the options are since according to the programme for Government Abbotstown is no longer on the agenda? Has the Government decided in principle on a smaller scale national stadium than the 80,000 seater stadium originally proposed? Will he also state whether the stadium will be completed in time to host the European Cup championships in 2008?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The first decision made is that we will build a world class stadium and I will be pleased with that. Many views have been put forward about where the stadium should be. My view, that we need a national stadium, is well known. We have agreed in the programme for Government that there will be communication between the CSID board, the national sporting bodies and the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, about the precise size of the stadium. The size of the stadium should be agreed by these bodies, particularly those who will use the stadium. That matter will be finalised in a matter of <Col N="174" /> weeks and the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, will bring the matter to Cabinet for the final decision. Hopefully the stadium will be built in time for the European Cup in 2008.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am slightly confused with the Taoiseach's reference to a national stadium and to a world class stadium. It appears to me that he is consistent in his own view and that there is no change in the provision of a national stadium and the world class stadium and that it will be in Abbotstown. Will the Taoiseach confirm that is the position as of today and that it is still on course and will be built in Abbotstown?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To clarify so that there is no doubt, we are going to build a world class stadium. As soon as the deliberations are over it will be decided where. The fact is that the Abbotstown site is in the hands of the State. People have put other options and some of the national sporting bodies have put forward views. The Minister will take all of this into account before reporting back and the decision is made. I remain consistent in my word that the national sporting bodies and the CSID board which has worked hard on this over the last number of years should be able to express their views to the new Minister. Then the options will go forward and the decision will be made by the Cabinet.</P>

      <P>On 6 May Fianna Fáil, in its manifesto, pledged to eliminate and permanently end waiting lists in our hospitals within two years through a combination of bed capacity, primary care, secondary care and targeted reform initiatives. Yet, in the programme for Government published subsequent to the outcome of the election, the same commitment that was made so clearly and prominently was watered down to the following: &ldquo;we will treat people within new national guidelines for maximum waiting times set out in the national health strategy.&rdquo;  What happened between 6 May and the publication of the national programme that resulted in the reneging by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats on that commitment to eliminate hospital waiting lists within two years?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme for Government reflects what has been agreed by all the stakeholders in the health service. We can dramatically improve the waiting lists and aim to get everybody seen within three months. We will continue to build on what has been specified in the national health strategy and to resource that is the number one area of priority in the life of this Government. We have built on that and in certain areas targeted by the last Government we <Col N="175" /> have reduced the waiting list to one month in some cases. It is a challenge to get the list down to three months in other specialities and areas. The effort of this Government will be to follow what is in the national health strategy and we will try to achieve our targets across all aspects of health.</P>

      <P>I have two questions for the Taoiseach on promised legislation. The Labour Party's Private Members' Bill, the European Union Bill, is due to be restored to the Order Paper later today. This Bill was accepted by the Government last year. When is it intended to deal with this Bill, as it is central to ensuring a successful outcome to a second referendum on the Nice treaty? My second question relates to necessary, if not promised, legislation on housing. There is a category of private tenants covered by the 1982 landlord and tenant legislation which expires this July. As a result, these tenants will lose all legal protections. These people were previously covered by the controlled tenants legislation that was overturned by the Supreme Court. Representations have been made to the relevant Department. Is there any proposal to introduce temporary legislation, before the end of this parliamentary session, to extend the operation of this legislation to give protection to the approximately 800 people who will lose all security of tenure?</P>

Deputy Quinn has pointed out that other aspects of the Bill should also be taken on board. I will ask the Minister to look at this. He had previously agreed to accept some of the suggestions and recommendation of the Bill so I will ask him to look again at the up to date position in that regard.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It seems to me to be appropriate that we are considering a major financial services regulation Bill this year &ndash; the 60th anniversary of the passage of the Central Bank Act, 1942, which established the Central Bank of Ireland. Let me hasten to add that in the intervening years there have been several major Acts bearing on the banking and financial services sector and on the Central Bank's functions.</P>
      <P>The world in which the Central Bank of Ireland operates has changed enormously since 1942. The Deputies of that time would not recognise the modern Irish financial industry. At the end of December, 2001 there were 55 holders of banking licences and 32 branches of EU banks operating in this country. These include the most important financial institutions in the world. In addition to the banks, there are literally thousands of investment firms and financial and investment intermediaries supervised by the Central Bank which the Oireachtas established 60 years ago. Outside the realm of current Central Bank supervision there are insurance companies, credit unions and so forth, adding to the complexity and sophistication of the financial services industry. The financial services industry plays a major role in the economy, as it provides direct employment to about 50,000 people and supplies a wide range of services and products that are vital in a modern economy. As this industry has changed and grown over the years, there have been considerable changes in the legal and regulatory framework.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the unseen and largely unknown guardians of the public interest in the Central Bank, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Office of the Registrar of Friendly Societies. It is a tribute to their effectiveness that they are so rarely in the public eye. Failure of a financial institution has been a rare event in this country, although it is important that Deputies are aware that high standards of regulation do not provide an absolute assurance that difficulties will not arise in individual financial institutions. High quality regulation seeks to minimise the risk of serious problems in individual firms and, more widely, in the financial sector, while maintaining a climate in which the industry can continue to innovate and develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="185" />The main purposes of this Bill are to provide for the establishment of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority &ndash; IFSRA &ndash; within the overall new structure of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland; to assign functions to the IFSRA as the single regulator for the financial services sector, thereby providing a one stop shop by having the regulation of insurance, banking and credit unions under one roof; to strengthen the consumer focus of regulation by giving the authority specific responsibilities in this regard and creating a statutory position of consumer director; and to establish the financial services appeals tribunal.</P>
    <P>In this Bill I seek to improve on the solid foundation that exists in relation to the State's oversight of financial services. I wish to respond to the demand for a better service for consumers of financial services and greater accountability by financial institutions and the new regulatory authorities. A key objective of the Bill is to give a strong mandate to the regulatory authority with regard to the regulation of the conduct of financial services business while also providing a stronger framework for regulating the manner in which financial institutions deal with their customers &ndash; so-called &ldquo;conduct of business&rdquo; regulation &ndash; and also on consumer protection. While talking about protecting consumers of financial services, we should not forget that the most basic protection sought by consumers is a reasonable assurance that the institution to which they entrust their money is financially sound and that the financial system of which it is a part is fundamentally solid.</P>
    <P>A second objective of the Bill is to redesign the structure of regulation to reflect changes in the market and the legislation governing it which have taken place during the last ten years. As different sectors of the wider financial services increasingly offer similar products, it makes sense that they be regulated by a single institution. It makes sense, especially for a small country like Ireland, that we make best use of the necessarily limited pool of regulatory expertise at our disposal. This approach has wide-ranging support and its case has been made by the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. It has been accepted by Government and it has been reviewed and approved by the McDowell group.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity to point out another advantage of the integration of financial services regulation. Not only is there increased integration of financial services within Ireland, but there is increased integration of financial services internationally, which leads to consolidation of services centres, administration, asset management and dealing activities. We compete internationally to be the location for such activities and one of the major factors in determining where such centres are located is the reputation and expertise of the regulator. I expect that a single integrated regulator and continued high standards will be positive elements in the context of attracting such investment to Ireland. These argu<Col N="186" /> ments support the integration of prudential, consumer and conduct of business regulation for all sectors of financial services providers under one regulator.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that the McDowell group recommended that the single regulatory authority should be an entirely new independent organisation. After long deliberation and discussion, I present in this Bill an arrangement which has been approved by the Government and which is fully in the spirit of the McDowell report. It accommodates the different views of the minority on the group in relation to the ideal structure for regulation of financial services in Ireland. The structure provided for in the Bill differs somewhat from the structure announced by the Government in February 2001. It provides for a monetary committee of the board, rather than a separate monetary authority, within the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland. Following informal discussions with ECB officials last year, it was deemed desirable to make clear that there is no attempt to circumvent the institutional independence of the Central Bank or the Governor in carrying out European System of Central Banks related tasks. It has been agreed that the Governor will have a more direct role in relation to the budget and regulatory activities of the IFSRA to ensure that financial stability issues and ESCB tasks are dealt with in a co-ordinated fashion.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a new entity, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, as a constituent part of a new bank structure is at the heart of this Bill's proposals. The authority will manage the regulation of financial institutions in Ireland. The IFSRA will take on and develop the financial services supervisory functions of the bank, as well as handling the regulation of credit unions and the insurance sector. The regulatory authority is to be established under section 33B of the principal Act and will operate as a constituent part of the new bank. It will have its own chairperson, chief executive and consumer director and will have independent functions. The chairperson, chief executive and some authority members will also be members of the board of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland. The post of consumer director is specifically provided for in the Bill and a separate statutory post of registrar of credit unions is also provided for, in recognition of the unique role played by credit unions in Irish society.</P>
    <P>The regulatory authority will have two main sets of functions. It will be responsible for the licensing and prudential regulation of all financial services providers and for consumer protection across the sectors. It will consist of a chairperson, the chief executive, the consumer director and no fewer than six and no more than eight persons appointed by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The chairperson of the authority will be appointed by the Minister for Finance. Deputies will be aware I appointed an <Col N="187" /> interim board, on a non-statutory basis, on 16 April 2002. The chairperson of the interim board is Mr. Brian Patterson. The role of the interim board will include selecting a chief executive for the IFSRA and assisting the chief executive-designate, the Ministers and the Central Bank in preparing for the establishment of the IFSRA. The appointment of the interim board will help ensure that a smooth transition to the new regulatory arrangements takes place as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>A steering committee and a support group have been established, drawn from officials of the Central Bank, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and my Department, to ensure that the chairperson and the interim board are assisted and supported to enable them to perform the tasks which the interim board was set up to do. I intend that the interim board will become the regulatory authority once it has been established under this legislation. It is essential that the regulatory authority is properly and adequately funded if it is to exercise fully its powers and functions. The McDowell group considered this issue and favoured funding by the industry. Accordingly, the Bill gives the chief executive of the authority, with the agreement of the authority, power to make regulations to impose levies. These regulations only come into effect, however, if they have been approved by the Minister for Finance. If the funds raised from the fees and levies imposed prove inadequate for the authority to perform its functions, the bank may provide the authority with funds to meet a shortfall.</P>
    <P>Consumer protection is a vital issue. The McDowell group gave detailed consideration to the questions of prudential regulation and consumer protection. It recommended that the single regulatory authority &ndash; SRA &ndash; be given statutory responsibility for prudential regulation and for consumer issues relating to financial institutions. The group also recommended that responsibility for approval of bank charges be transferred to the SRA and that a statutory position of consumer protection director be established within the SRA.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the consumer director will have a leading role in the exercise by the IFSRA of the consumer functions transferring from the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs. The provisions contained in the Bill reflect this intention, particularly the requirement that the consumer director will be on the regulatory authority. The responsibilities of the consumer director are provided for in the Bill. In essence, they are to monitor the provision of financial services to consumers and to exercise important consumer protection powers under the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, the Stock Exchange Act, 1995, and other legislation relating to the Central Bank and the insurance industry. The Bill also sets the reporting arrangements, etc, of the consumer director. In this regard, I draw the attention of <Col N="188" /> Deputies to section 33V(6) of the Bill which provides that the consumer director can report directly to the regulatory authority on any matter.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the post of Registrar of Credit Unions. At the moment the Registrar of Friendly Societies has responsibility, <i>inter alia</i>, for the general regulation and financial supervision of credit unions. The McDowell group recognised the valuable contribution and the unique role of credit unions in society, with which I fully agree. The credit union movement is characterised by a large number of quite small, community-based credit unions providing fairly limited services to their members. However, some have grown into quite large operations which are now significant providers of services of a financial nature.</P>
    <P>The McDowell group considered that all financial service providers should, in principle, be dealt with by a single regulatory authority, and that a compelling case would have to be made for the exclusion of any provider from its remit. In regard to the credit unions, the group recommended that the approach which would best address the unique characteristics of the credit union movement would be to have the existing functions of the Registrar of Friendly Societies in relation to credit unions brought into the single regulatory authority. The group considered that this should be done in a manner that would recognise and be supportive of the uniqueness of credit unions and also give comfort that their voluntary character would not be threatened by the establishment of a single regulatory authority while still addressing the appropriate regulatory and consumer protection requirements that arise. The McDowell group recommended that these concerns should be addressed by the establishment of a statutory position of credit unions within the single regulatory authority. The Bill provides for the implementation of the recommendations contained in the McDowell report.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to another significant element of the package of recommendations contained in the McDowell report. The group agreed that where functions are being transferred to the single regulatory authority, relevant enforcement powers which relate to those functions should also be vested in the authority. The group considered that the ability of the single regulatory authority to regulate any financial market without it being able to impose civil sanction to enforce the same would result in ineffective regulation.</P>
    <P>The group recommended that, in the first instance, the single regulatory authority should have power to impose sanctions on a financial services provider for breach of the relevant regulatory code. The group also identified a need to set up an appeals system for financial institutions which wished to appeal against the imposition of such sanctions. The group recommended that the tribunal should be established at the outset of the new regulatory arrangements and that this should be facilitated by the inclusion of the necessary <Col N="189" /> provisions for the establishment of the tribunal in the legislation providing for the establishment of the SRA. Accordingly, the Bill contains provisions for the establishment and operation of the Financial Services Appeals Tribunal. The Bill provides also for procedures for hearing and determining appeals, for references and appeals to the High Court and for other miscellaneous matters relating to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to staffing. It is intended that IFSRA will draw most of its initial staff from the regulatory departments of the Central Bank, which account for the great majority of the people currently engaged in supervision. Staff will also be drawn from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, including the offices of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Registrar of Friendly Societies. The Bill includes provision for the permanent transfer of those staff, subject to their agreement, to the new authority. All the staff of the entity, whether working in IFSRA or elsewhere, will be employees of the re-organised bank, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland CBFSAI. At the same time the board is required, with the agreement of the chief executive of the regulatory authority, to arrange for employees of the bank to be assigned to the regulatory authority and to any divisions, branches or offices of the bank.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the mobility of staff, both existing and newly appointed, within the CBFSAI. The board of the CBFSAI is required to establish and operate a policy under which provision is made for employees of the CBFSAI to be given opportunities for training and experience in the various activities, and in the different constituent parts, of the overall organisation. These provisions should ensure that the regulatory authority will operate effectively and efficiently from the outset.</P>
    <P>The broad structure of the Bill is as follows. Part I on page 5 of the Bill as initiated contains a Short Title and provisions for the commencement of the Act. Part II, which commences on page 5, provides for the amendment of the Central Bank Act, 1942 for the purposes of re-organising and renaming the Central Bank of Ireland. This part, in addition to amending and repealing the text of the 1942 Act, as appropriate, inserts additional parts and schedules into the 1942 Act.</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to the IFSRA are set out in a new Part IIIA of the 1942 Act, to be inserted by section 27 of the Bill on page 26. Chapter 1 of this new part provides for the constitution, functions and powers of the authority. Chapter 2, which commences on page 38, provides for the establishment of the statutory position of Consumer Director and Chapter 3, on page 44, provides for the appointment of the Registrar of Credit Unions.</P>
    <P>A new Part IIIB of the 1942 Act contains certain provisions relating to the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland and its constituent parts. Part VIIA of the 1942 Act, as <Col N="190" /> inserted by section 29 of the Bill on page 60, is divided into five chapters and deals with the Financial Services Appeals Tribunal. Section 30 on page 86 inserts a new Part VIIIA into the 1942 Act and sets out the provisions for making regulations and orders under the 1942 Act. As I said earlier, Part II of the Bill amends the 1942 Act by amending and inserting additional schedules. There are also three Schedules to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to refer to a number of procedural matters. Under European law, the Government is required to consult the European Central Bank on legislation of this type. Once this Bill was published, the ECB was formally consulted. It welcomed the proposed structure, while making some detailed comments on it. These will be examined before Committee Stage but I do not consider that any fundamental issues in relation to the new arrangements arise from the ECB views. It is my intention to lay the opinion of the ECB before both Houses, subject to any confidentiality issues, after the Government has considered the matter and before consideration of the Bill on Committee Stage. I will be bringing forward amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage. Some are technical and others arise from the ongoing consideration of this complex legislation. I will give Deputies details of these amendments in advance of Committee Stage and my officials will be available to brief Deputies on them if they so wish.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the McDowell report contained a package of recommendations in regard to financial regulation. This Bill deals mainly with the establishment of IFSRA. I intend to publish a second Bill later this year to implement the remainder of the recommendations contained in the McDowell report. The main provisions to be included in the second Bill are to establish a statutory financial services ombudsman; establish consultative panels of the financial services industry and of consumers; address issues arising from the recommendations contained in the report of the review group on auditing; and make provisions arising from a review of section 16 of the Central Bank Act, 1989 dealing with confidentiality of Central Bank information.</P>
    <P>I must stress, therefore, that this Bill is, first, concerned essentially with structures and, second, is part of a package of measures rather than stand-alone legislation. As regards the basic structures for regulation, I am confident that the new structure provided for in this Bill gives us the best of all worlds. On the one hand, there is a new regulatory authority, IFSRA, with a clear consumer mandate and on the other there is an organic linkage to the authority responsible for stability and monetary issues. There is also a structure in the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland which facilitates efficient use of resources and mobility of staff. The Bill also provides for clear accountability, both within the new structure and to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" />The measures incorporated in this Bill and the proposed second Bill will together lead to more efficient regulation, with a stronger consumer focus than heretofore. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I wish to congratulate you on your appointment. I enjoyed your rulings as Ceann Comhairle and look forward to equally enjoying them in your position as Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill, 2002, a Second Reading for at least three months until</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) a full assessment of best practice in regulatory supervision has been undertaken, which takes into account the lessons of recent regulatory failures (including the lessons of Enron and Allfirst); and</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) a full assessment of best practice in providing consumer protection in relation to financial services has been undertaken;</P>
      <P>and the proposed merger of consumer protection and prudential regulation into a single Regulatory Agency can be viewed against best practice requirements identified by those assessments&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason I am doing this is that essentially the Bill has come from very whimsical origins. The decision to merge consumer protection and prudential regulation has not been justified in the documentation by any Minister. It was not justified adequately by the group chaired by Mr. McDowell. It was opposed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service when it reported on the issue in July 1998. There was no significant analysis of any merit as to whether merging consumer protection with prudential regulation would improve either of those functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decided four years ago, in October 1998, that in principle it would establish a single regulatory authority for the supervision of financial services. Many people would welcome that if what it involved was simply moving the supervision of insurance from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to a new regulatory authority. It was quite clear that the Department was not at the world's cutting edge in relation to supervision and no one would have suggested that the idea was not a good one. Equally, everyone realised that the Central Bank was not the receptacle for consumer protection. It had and continues to have a poor record and it has clear conflicts in respect of the objectives <Col N="192" /> which it pursues and the objective of consumer protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no proper attempt to deal with this issue and when the Government decision was made, the McDowell group was set up to implement it. The group never went back to first principles to ask whether merging consumer protection and prudential regulation was a good thing, it solely dealt with the implementation. In fact the word &ldquo;implementation&rdquo; was in the advisory group's name. It did not have a mandate to look at this. An ill thought out decision made in 1998 prejudiced the whole debate that evolved. The result has been that the McDowell group did not look at first principles to see whether we have a good regulatory regime. It did not look to see if we have best practice in relation to consumer protection in financial services and we see the product of that in today's Bill. It is a massive bulldog clip put around the existing regulatory functions and transferred holus bolus to this new authority. There was no discernment or assessment as to whether those functions were up to speed and that is why I say we should not go ahead with this until we do that very important work.</P>
      <P>If the importance of finding out if we have best practice needed underlining, Enron and Allfirst provide ample evidence. I hope the Minister will accept that we have not had the sort of debate we need to go ahead with this. The advisory group was holed below the waterline before it started its work and the really important questions were ducked because the Government had already made its mind up on these issues. That is not a criticism of Deputy McDowell and his group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This decision also spawned a very barren turf war which the Minister knows all about. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment sought to remove the regulatory authority from the Central Bank, no doubt motivated by its record of little enough interest in consumer protection. Furthermore, the Central Bank was very pleased, as the Oireachtas committee report suggested, to move consumer protection to a dedicated independent directorate of consumer affairs. I recall, as will Deputy Rabbitte, that the Central Bank agreed, in respect of consumer credit, that all the functions it previously had would be given to the Director of Consumer Affairs. It recognised that it had not been and did not see itself as primarily a consumer protection body. For the past 20 years public policy has been to go in the opposite direction and that has been endorsed by several policy initiatives, but no apparent justification was offered by the Minister today as to why he is reversing that position. I did not see it in his speech, which was totally devoid of any argument as to why we ought to be pleased with the Bill being presented to us. In this barren turf war quite clearly the Department of Finance and the Central Bank won out and the consumer <Col N="193" /> lost. The consumer has lost out in this debate and anyone who championed the consumer interest will see this as a defeat. I agree with them. The Central Bank has a poor record in dealing with consumer protection issues and it has now absorbed these responsibilities from the independent and fearless Director of Consumer Affairs, who has rattled many cages over the years, unlike the bank which does not see itself as having that role.</P>
    <P>Probably the greatest defeat to consumers came with the earlier decision of the Government that it would merge consumer protection with prudential regulation, which has very different objectives. We have simply brought together in one place all of these regulatory provisions, none of which has been vetted or scrutinised to see if it is good. There is ample evidence that consumer protection regulations and legislation are not up to speed. Transparency of information about financial products is poor and we do not have good legislation in that area. Undoubtedly, the Director of Consumer Affairs has begun to get to grips with that, but we are clearly a long way from best practice. Opportunities for consumers to shop around are easily and openly curtailed. Very rarely when one's insurance is coming up for renewal does one get advance notice that gives time to shop around and there is actually a conspiracy to prevent people from doing that, which could be addressed through legislation. There is clearly no vigorous competition within many sections of the financial services industry and Deputy Rabbitte earlier spoke about the insurance industry which is one element that is being brought into this. It is obvious that consumer interests are not being adequately protected.</P>
    <P>I notice that the advisory group made the interesting observation that one of the roles the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment saw itself as having related to cost competitiveness. It believed in bringing down the cost of insurance. None of the other agencies, one being the Central Bank, has ever seen competitiveness as being part of its core mandate. The bank has simply been interested in solvency and by the merger of consumer interest with the regulatory authority we are losing this strong thrust in the Department in the direction of vigorous competition. Many cosy practices are being tolerated in the insurance industry that should not be and there is much for it to clean up. The cost of key financial services is much higher here than in other countries. The interest rates spread is much higher and profits in the banking sector are double the return on capital afforded in other countries. Very clearly, the Central Bank has had an approach to competitiveness issues that is not sympathetic to consumers or users of financial services, but these issues are being entrusted to it.</P>
    <P>There is real conflict here. Prudential interests demand that the security of an institution is protected by large profit margins and they are not <Col N="194" /> too fussy about tax issues or consumer interests as we have seen in the past. This Bill does not address tax issues, which I thought it would. Consumer protection interests are very different. They want to see lower profit margins, high efficiency, very contestable markets with lots of turnover and much activity. Very different objectives are being pursued by the two bodies the Minister is trying to thrust together and there is a conflict of interest. This is not bogus, which even the Central Bank would recognise. I would have expected the McDowell group to find out if the merging of consumer protection with regulatory provision was best practice. There is an appendix to its report which reviews what happens in other countries and it is staggering. The group came up with evidence that in 16 of 19 countries looked at no significant element of consumer protection law was given to the authority responsible for prudential regulation. The other three countries provided for a small element of consumer protection in that way, but none of the 19 has adopted the model the Minister is proposing today. The committee recommended against the approach taken in this legislation a few months prior to the Government decision.</P>
    <P>I refer to prudential supervision. It is not advisable to proceed quickly with the passage of the legislation, which is the Minister's intention, without first asking whether our regulatory system is up to world best practice. The advisory group and the authors of this Bill are not totally silent on this issue. It is again assumed that by simply relocating some powers to a new institution, best practice is achieved. Such faith is not well placed and I gravely doubt that is the case.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt the performance of regulators, auditors and internal controls has suffered a seismic shock in recent months and I am amazed that we are pushing forward with this legislation without examining the reports of the experts evaluating the various collapses in supervision that occurred. I will not be surprised if these reports recommend changes in our regulatory regime. Why should we push ahead with this legislation until the reports on Enron and Allfirst, for example, have been examined? The Central Bank of Ireland and the Federal Reserve in the US are both examining the Allfirst case, but the Government is intent on proceeding with this Bill regardless. New risks have not been considered. The Central Bank even conducted stress tests recently to ascertain whether contagion could catch on. While the bank has provided a little reassurance, it has also said it cannot be certain the procedures in place make it robust against new risks. The recommendations of the groups that are examining recent financial collapses should be awaited before proceeding with legislation.</P>
    <P>The advisory group offered flimsy arguments as to why consumer protection and regulation should be merged. One argument was that it would facilitate the transfer of information. The Minister plans to amend the legislation relating <Col N="195" /> to the transfer of information and that issue could have been overcome by amending existing legislation but it has not been considered as an option.</P>
    <P>The second argument offered by the McDowell group was that it would be nice to have a one-stop-shop. That is great provided one is not trying to merge high grade surgery with the sale of nuts and bolts, which is what is being attempted. The Minister is trying to merge two areas that are incompatible. Creating a one-stop-shop would be valid only if there was genuine synergy between the two tasks that are undertaken. Such synergy does not exist and others share my view in that regard. Professor Kinsella, a colleague of the Minister, has argued trenchantly that there is no such synergy. There are conflicting regulatory objectives between consumer and prudential protection; limited synergy in terms of the skills that are needed; moral hazards and impediments; and different timescales to which both work. He made a persuasive case that the merger of regulation with consumer protection damages both and does not enhance them. That argument should be assessed in a manner that has not occurred to date.</P>
    <P>An attempt was made when these financial authorities were structured to give responsibility for different functions that were incompatible to one institution and that has resulted in the enormous complexity of the structure before us. It bears all the hallmarks of a cobbled together compromise resulting from a policy that was ill-thought out in the first place. The Central Bank succeeded in scuppering the concept of a stand alone regulatory authority, separate from the bank, but instead there will be an authority which will be a subsidiary of the bank. This structure is uneasy and the delegated authority to the financial regulator is not entirely clear. It must act with an eye continually over its shoulder as to the views of the Central Bank and an uneasy compromise is contained in the sections relating to how the structure will work.</P>
    <P>There is also evidence of incompatible elements being forced together within the subsidiary. A makeshift firewall is being constructed to prevent the consumer interest being overwhelmed by prudential concerns. The firewall will take the form of the appointment of a consumer director, who will be a member of board of the authority. However, this again is an effort to compensate for something that the Minister, in his heart, knows will go wrong. He is trying to create a counterbalance in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely happy with the provisions relating to accountability to the House. For example, the Committee of Public Accounts will not have a say in regard to the role of the regulator and the Comptroller and Auditor General's remit will not be extended to cover the office. Oireachtas committees will be able to summon the regulator to appear before them but there should be more stringent accountability to the <Col N="196" /> Dáil. The traditional independence of the Central Bank means that it should be more accountable.</P>
    <P>When I approached the legislation initially I had certain ideas about what it would contain. It was extremely difficult to make sense of it and before I read it I jotted down what I thought the Minister would try to achieve in it. I was amazed when I re-examined the list I made how few of the issues in it had been addressed. The first issue I noted was that the Bill would deal with the perception that tax compliance has not been properly overseen in the context of regulation. There is no reference in the legislation to improved oversight of tax compliance in terms of regulatory functions. I thought it would address the belief that competitiveness concerns have unnecessarily succumbed to prudential interests. To the contrary, the legislation will further erode the belief that competitiveness will be a major concern of the regulatory authorities. The Bill, in dealing with the belief that consumer protection is a poor relation in terms of Central Bank supervision, has made the position worse because the solution to the turf war is that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has lost out to the Department of Finance and the Central Bank in this area.</P>
    <P>The legislation places similar supervisory requirements on all regulatory bodies, which I commend. It is correct that brokers, tied agents, banks, credit unions, building societies, insurance agents and so on should be supervised on a level playing pitch and that has been achieved. However, I thought the most important issue the legislation would address was the sense that many of our scattered regulatory bodies were not up to best practice and that issue has been entirely ignored by the Minister. We do not know if best practice is observed and there are considerable reasons to believe it is not.</P>
    <P>I am also amazed that when a Bill of such density and depth is introduced, the issues that would have made a difference to consumers and business have been omitted. The Minister intends to address them later in the year. Why not address these issues now if they are to be at the heart of an authority that will be responsive to consumer and business interests and give them a say under the new structure? Why are these issues being deferred until after the horse has bolted? It also has been brought to my attention that this legislation means that we are marching to a very different drum to the rest of Europe. No other country in Europe has sought to merge consumer protection with prudential regulation. I understand that the Minister has proposed at ECOFIN that there should be a single European regulatory authority. If that is so, what is the future for this legislation if in time we move to a single regulatory authority in Europe which will have no consumer protection role?</P>

      <P>I will conclude my speech. This Bill has been put before the House without proper thought being given to it. The attempt to merge two functions that are really quite different has resulted in the loss of key elements of good governance &ndash; simplicity, transparency and accountability. It has numerous interlocking and overlapping structures that give neither simplicity, transparency nor accountability. We will live to regret that we took this road and we will spend some time unpicking this omelette. We will wonder what happened to consumer protection and why we ever thought that consumer protection would be adequately dealt with in an authority whose primary concern is with solvency. Consumer protection will be sacrificed on the <Col N="198" /> altar of solvency if a choice has to be made. The issue of solvency and regulatory control will of necessity be foremost in their minds.

      <P>The Bill arises from a decision taken in principle by the Government on 20 October 1998 to establish a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector &ldquo;at the earliest possible date.&rdquo;  That is now almost four years ago and to some extent it highlights the difficulty and tardiness in implementing a decision taken by Government. It is relevant to Deputy Bruton's amendment which seeks to delay the conclusion of Second Stage of the Bill for three months for the reasons which he has eloquently argued at the outset of his contribution. We have already waited four years so I do not think it would be unreasonable to have the examination conducted as Deputy Bruton argues.</P>
      <P>The events at Allfirst and Enron have been unprecedented shocks to the system. A system of regulation cannot prevent what happened in the case of Allfirst because when somebody is dedicated to fraud that will happen; however it seems to the layman that it could have been picked up earlier. I am always bemused by the attention to duty in some cases by members of the Minister's profession in their capacity as auditors. I have always found it amazing that accounts can be signed off when there is a hole beneath the water line. My party will support the amendment that we provide time to assess whether we are following best practice in making this decision in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to the Government decision of 20 October 1998 was the unprecedented public outcry at the time due to a number of events that had taken place and the perception that the Central Bank in particular and the regulatory authorities generally were not concerned so much with consumer protection as with prudential supervision. That is manifestly the case and the Central Bank does not argue that it is otherwise. There were a number of examples to show that consumer protection did not feature as a priority within the Central Bank. That conviction has been highlighted by the widespread public perception that the financial institutions have unjustifiably high profits within this jurisdiction, have imposed unconscionably high charges and levy interest rates that are frequently higher than elsewhere in the OECD countries. At the same time the marketplace is not characterised by vigorous competition in the sector. The view abroad is that there was a relatively cosy arrangement for a long time between the banks and financial institutions and the ordinary high street consumer was paying the price. When the events happened, the Government made this decision. I do not know how much thought went into the Government decision of 20 October 1998. There is no argument in the Minister's script to explain the ration<Col N="199" /> ale that led to that decision; he merely takes it as a given.</P>
    <P>The McDowell report was given its riding instructions and there is a view in some quarters that the McDowell group actually came up with the notion of a single financial regulatory authority that would fuse both the consumer and the prudential requirements. That is not the case, of course, and I do not think I am doing Deputy McDowell any injustice when I say that the instruction they received was to implement the Government decision and not to examine whether or not it was a good idea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point was made repeatedly in replies to parliamentary questions, time after time, that the job of the McDowell group was implementation of the Government decision but I might as well have been beating my head against a stone wall. Very few Deputies and few outside commentators listened to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That may well be so, though I do not know if that amounts to an <i>apologia</i> for introducing the Bill in this shape. If only the Minister had been confronted by Deputy Bruton and I, he would have thought otherwise; that is what he seems to be saying. I am putting on the record that I do not have my mind made up on this issue. I would like to see the comparison with best practice Deputy Bruton refers to being subjected to scrutiny in the context of our regulatory requirements. To my knowledge that has not been done and the McDowell report, which is the genesis of this Bill with some tweaking here and there, did not address that question at all. It merely took the Government decision as a given and set about implementing it.</P>
      <P>I am interested in this from my experience with the DIRT inquiry, where the public hearings obviously preceded the legislation; the controversy preceded the Government decision but not the hearings into tax evasion and DIRT, which for the first time subjected the State and its agencies, including the Central Bank and the Department of Finance, to a kind of scrutiny not previously experienced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first report of the DIRT inquiry found that the Central Bank did know about the deposit accounts problem before 1986 and knew about the DIRT problem after 1986. In the words of the then governor, &ldquo;We had no legislative authority to go in and quantify it.&rdquo; The DIRT inquiry itself was persuaded that there was, &ldquo;. . . no doubt that the bank knew of the problem going back before 1986 and that it discussed the matter with the Department of Finance.&rdquo; It further emerged that the bank felt constrained by the confidential protocol and that even if it had stumbled across particular cases of tax evasion it was prevented from bringing those to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners. The first report of the DIRT inquiry traces the evidence given by the Central Bank and puts on record the fact that this pretty <Col N="200" /> extensive tax evasion was known to the Central Bank and that it discussed it at the time with the Department of Finance, though I am not saying the precise scale of it was known. The then Governor said they had no legislative authority to go in and quantify it. I refer here to the distinguished former Governor of the Central Bank, Maurice O'Connell, and his evidence to the committee. For example, he stated:</P>
    <P>Chairman, the Central Bank participated at various times in discussions about the taxation of interest on deposits and non-resident accounts. The bank believed there was a problem regarding false statements on non-resident status but it had no direct knowledge of the amounts that might have been involved, however, because the focus of its inspection is prudential and it does not embrace taxation.</P>
    <P>Again, Mr. O'Connell said:</P>
    <P>I have made it quite clear that we were aware &ndash; I repeat, we were aware of this problem. We had no way of quantifying it, no way at all. We were unhappy about it. I said that already. I said we discussed this with the Department of Finance and that's all recorded here and so on. And I said it's a tax matter, to be solved by the tax system and all the parties involved were agreed on this.</P>
    <P>The point I am trying to make is that the weaknesses perceived in public in terms of whether it was tax compliance or the consumer dimension are admitted by the Central Bank in so much as its primary concern was prudential supervision. The Minister said the greatest comfort the consumer can get is the fact that his or her money is safe in the bank. He stated: </P>
    <P>When talking about protection of consumers of financial services, we must of course never forget that the most basic protection sought by the consumer is a reasonable assurance that the institution to which he or she entrusts his or her money is financially sound and that the financial system of which it is a part is fundamentally solid.</P>
    <P>That goes without saying and is obviously true. We take that as read, just as we take as read that the Central Bank has a good record in prudential supervision. There have been some lapses. Regarding the bank in the news at the moment, Ansbacher, one must ask how that bank seemed to function outside the system. If one looks at the manner in which the Ansbacher bank functioned one can only conclude that effectively it was functioning outside the system. However, generally speaking I accept that the bank has a good record in prudential supervision and I accept that it should be the first comfort for any consumer that there is not likely to be a run on his or her bank or that the bank is not likely to go under. Taking that as read, however, the issue of consumer protection was never to the fore of consideration <Col N="201" /> within the Central Bank, nor was the question of tax compliance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the question of tax compliance and to his surprise that there is no provision in the Bill for better oversight of tax compliance. On page 53, provision is made in section 33(<i>a</i>)(<i>k</i>) to restate all the existing restrictive positions that prevented the Governor or the bank previously from bringing tax evasion to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners, though the Minister's officials are looking again at section 33(<i>a</i>)(<i>k</i>) in terms of the overriding confidentiality provision. It is beyond belief to most compliant taxpayers that they can hear senior personnel in the Central Bank say they were aware there was tax evasion going on but that they were so restricted by the confidentiality protocol that they could not even bring that to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners. That does not make any sense to the people in the street doing their best to pay their taxes. I do not know what the Minister's officials have in mind in terms of dealing with this section &ndash; one need only read it to see how restrictive it is. The interpretation put on it by senior officials during the DIRT inquiry was that they were prevented from taking the steps one would think should be required of or normally expected from an authority.</P>
    <P>That is still there in what is effectively a consolidated Bill. I look forward to seeing what changes the Minister's officials are contemplating, given that they said they would consider that again.</P>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister promised a second Bill. He drew attention to the fact that he will introduce a second Bill, which will do things that are long over due in my opinion, such as establish the financial services ombudsman and implement recommendations of the review group on auditing. It is an additional compelling argument to support Deputy Bruton's amendment that if that Bill is coming within a matter of months and it is so central to confidence in the consumer protection role of the authority, or whoever has that responsibility &ndash; the role of a financial services ombudsman, the implementation of the recommendations of the review group on auditing and other matters &ndash; I do not know why we cannot wait to measure those against a review of what we now propose to do against best practice.</P>
    <P>The review group on auditing made certain recommendations which I thought were cautious and conservative given what the DIRT inquiry, the beef tribunal and the tribunals currently under way have shown about auditors. I could never understand why in the Goodman case, a £500 million deficiency was discovered two or three months after the auditors signed off on the accounts. I cannot understand how Arthur Andersen conducted themselves <i>vis-à-vis</i> Enron. I cannot understand why senior personnel in Allied Irish Banks are so anxious to protect the auditors in the case of the Allfirst debacle. They do not seem to want auditors to have any whistleblowing <Col N="202" /> dimension imposed on them in terms of their responsibilities. The Minister, I suspect, will argue that this second Bill is essential in terms of judging the first Bill which is before the House. There is the additional argument as to why we should wait having regard to the momentous events that have recently happened and having regard to our own experience before proceeding as now proposed in terms of merging the two different responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I repeat that the Minister made no arguments. He seems to cede that there is merit in the argument being made on this side of the House that by all means the responsibility for regulation ought to rest with the Central Bank. I accept the arguments made about expertise in that regard, about experience, reputation, record, the influence it would have outside the country and its significance in terms of development here of the financial services sector. The development of the financial services sector ought to be distinct from the consumer protection dimension because inevitably there will be compromises if the developmental role is in any way confused with the consumer protection role. They are quite different. I do not argue and I have never argued, although I had the opportunity to put many questions on this matter to the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and others during the DIRT inquiry but I am persuaded, for the reasons I have just given, in terms of the competence and experience of staff and the signal it would send abroad, that the Central Bank is probably the place for regulation. The jury is still out on whether one can create a new authority that purports to give balanced consideration to the consumer dimension because consumers in this economy believe they have been ripped off by the banks and the financial institutions. They believe that a proliferation of charges were created in the past that were not merited. They believe excessive profits are being taken in this jurisdiction and we are now being asked to believe it is possible to meld into one organisation the consumer and the prudential responsibility. I do not know if it is. We are going to create a consumer director within this authority. Is he<i> primus inter pares </i>with the regulatory responsibility? How is the balance that ought to exist to be worked out between them?</P>
    <P>I have no argument with treating the financial services sector as a single industry. That makes sense. I had the experience of having to live with the aftermath of the Tony Taylor affair. I am not sure any regulation would necessarily prevent that kind of thing happening but at the time it brought a sharp focus on the resources devoted by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to regulation of financial intermediaries. The decision I made at the time was that that responsibility ought to be transferred to the Central Bank. That is right. The Taylor affair was not the first time that people who invested their money were defrauded in various circumstances. <Col N="203" /> The expertise and resources rested with the Central Bank to do that.</P>
    <P>Under the Consumer Credit Act I had the opportunity to bring in requirements that obliged the financial institutions in future that if they contemplated any new bank charge a case would have to be set out to the Director of Consumer Affairs together with a fee. The Director of Consumer Affairs had the power to prevent such an additional charge. That power is imported into this Bill and will go to the single regulatory authority together with a decision to implement the McDowell conclusion that funding generally ought to be levied from the industry. I would like to discuss that issue in the House. I can see the arguments for it. I can also see the dangers of regulatory capture. Many ordinary taxpayers believe the Central Bank traditionally has been overly sensitive to the requirements of bankers. It is not often that a housewife, a trade unionist or a consumer representative is on the board of the Central Bank. I do not know if we have any reason to believe that will necessarily change.</P>
    <P>We are going to have an authority that will have the onerous responsibility of regulation, prudential supervision on the one hand, consumer protection on the other hand. The argument obviously is why not beef up the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs? Why not give the director the statutory power that she and her predecessor argued is necessary? The Central Bank could deal with the regulation aspect and the Director of Consumer Affairs could deal with the consumer aspect, provided it is statutorily based and the resources are forthcoming. I would like to have heard the Minister argue why that cannot be done. He simply shooed all arguments, accepted the McDowell report and said we must implement the decision.</P>
    <P>Should credit unions be encompassed by this authority? We must have that debate. Had I been asked that question when I introduced the Credit Union Act I would have said no. There was never a Bill upon which so many Members spoke. In acknowledging an upcoming general election they wished to praise their local credit union. It was, nonetheless, a genuine statement by so many Members of the distinctive contribution of the credit union movement. Events since then do no more than reflect on the quality of supervision by the board &ndash; not by the registrar &ndash; and the quality of management, issues that are a cause of concern to thousands of credit union members. Mistakes have been made, as they have been made in the private, in the credit union movement resulting in divisions. Different unions see the world differently; local community based credit unions see things differently than big employment based ones.</P>
    <P>If credit unions are to come under the remit of the regulatory authority, I cannot see an ongoing role for the Registrar of Friendly Societies as this is the greater part of his responsibilities. I have an open mind on whether a director for the credit <Col N="204" /> unions can do the job. I do not suppose there is any reason they could not. This provision raises questions about the future role of the Registrar of Friendly Societies. I accept in principle that there is no reason the financial services sector ought not to be unified. The merits of merging the consumer interest and the question of prudential supervision is a different matter. Hopefully we will have more time, separate from Committee Stage, to go into some of the very detailed and complex questions which are given rise to here. I presume we will be taking a vote on the Fine Gael amendment at the end of this debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give greater consideration to this very major decision. The House will rise in three or four weeks time. I do not decry the competence or record of the Central Bank generally but Irish consumers are tired of being ripped off. We need to be confident that we are not compromising the consumer interest in the interests of an organisation which lends itself to the description that a camel is a horse made by a committee. We have devised a very complex structure and I would like to see it tested before we legislate to put it into law.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Dan Boyle.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment. I have no doubt with the upcoming debate on the re-run of the Nice Treaty that we will have various opportunities to engage.</P>
      <P>This Bill is, interestingly, partly the result of the report of the implementation advisory group on the establishment of a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector, an expert group chaired by Deputy Michael McDowell now Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The original proposals for a single financial regulator have been watered down because of EU Commission directives and requirements. This is yet another example of the legislative authority of this Dáil and the sovereignty of this State being undermined by the over-centralised European Union. I hope the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Finance will address this issue when they reply to the debate.</P>
      <P>It has been clear for some time that the Central Bank was failing in many aspects of its role. The report of the Committee of Public Accounts on DIRT fraud showed just how bad these failings were. Partly due to Central Bank policy, the taxpayer was out of pocket as the bank deliberately overlooked the fraudulent activities of Ireland's top banks, private and public, allowing them to open illegal bank accounts for up to 50,000 customers. Not only did the bank's authorities allow this environment of fraud to flourish, they lobbied the Government not to intervene as they claimed it would cause the flight of money out of the economy, or so they told us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Central Bank was prepared to turn a blind eye to this, what other failings existed in its operations? More importantly, what does this Bill do to redress those failings? The Central Bank <Col N="205" /> was only failing to protect the customer. One of the positive aspects of this Bill is the inclusion of a Commissioner for Consumer Protection. The authority will have its work cut out for it in that regard. Irish banks enjoy a return on their equity that is double the EU average. We have the most profitable banks in Europe. Where are these profits coming from? They are, of course, coming from ordinary customers who are being ruthlessly exploited.</P>
    <P>Irish banks are charging customers for a range of services that their directly comparable counterparts in Britain do not. These services include the setting up an overdraft or a direct debit, account maintenance charges, ATM withdrawals and lodgements. Ulster Bank, in this State, charges &euro;25 a year for setting up an overdraft, yet offers this service free elsewhere. It charges customers here just over &euro;3 for setting up a direct debit and &euro;5 per annum for account maintenance yet it does not apply these charges elsewhere. There is no charge for ATM withdrawals, lodgements or for writing a cheque for this bank's customers elsewhere yet there are such charges here. The primary reason this is allowed to continue is weak regulators. If the new authority does not tackle this exploitation, the legislation will be futile.</P>
    <P>Part of the failing of the existing Central Bank was that it refused to use the powers it had. Much is made of the fact that in the modern market economies we need powerful regulators, but to whom will they be accountable? It is clear that the Central Bank was effectively above Government or any democratic control of its activities. We need to ensure the regulator is accountable to the Dáil, the voters and, more importantly, bank customers. In my view, there is not enough commitment in the Bill to these important clients. It is notable that there is more emphasis on outlining our responsibilities in an EU context than there is on the rights of Irish consumers.</P>
    <P>Access to banking services has become an important issue in parts of rural and urban Ireland where banks have been closing branches and withdrawing services. A real regulator would have the power to ensure a universal access to financial services regardless of where one lives. The Bill overlooks any responsibility in this matter.</P>
    <P>I worked in the commercial banking sector for 12 years and I recall the number of postings I had in different parts of the jurisdiction. Some of those smaller branches no longer exist and I am aware of the devastating consequences for those small rural communities which have suffered as a result. I make this point as somebody who has been at the coalface of the delivery of that service in the past and who appreciates the problems and the difficulties that such contraction has presented to bank customers in different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The recent report into motor insurance costs only underlined what all of us in this House must have already known. Once again, Irish customers are being ripped off by those who sell them finan<Col N="206" /> cial services. All of this happened while the regulators did nothing. Clearly, as in the case of the banks, customers of insurance companies are being exploited.</P>
    <P>We want to see a regulator with powers of inspection, visiting financial institutions, investigating their practices and forcing them to repay the moneys they have siphoned out of Irish customers over the years. In case people think that is a step beyond the potential reality, let us examine the situation north of the Border in relation to the electricity regulator who successfully squeezed money from overcharging power companies and paid it back to the customers. We need to see the same happening here and on a much wider scale in the whole area of insurance.</P>
    <P>This evening, within a short time of my concluding this contribution, I will meet representatives of a manufacturing company in my constituency who are here to meet Deputies from the Cavan-Monaghan constituency and others pressing their concerns whereby, due to the practices of the insurance industry, their company is now at risk and the jobs it provides are now in jeopardy. That is serious and that concern which I have to face and address before this day is out is reflected in constituencies represented by Deputies throughout this Chamber. We have to seriously grasp the nettle in regard to the insurance company sector.</P>
    <P>The DIRT debacle and the overcharging scandal at NIB in recent years have shown failures at the highest level of management in financial services in Ireland. How many of the executives and directors who preside over this failure are still at work? The regulator should have the power to ban any director from office who is found to have broken tax or banking law or enabled their customers or employees to break these laws. It is laughable that the very people who let the DIRT fraud happen escaped without censure.</P>
    <P>Money does not acknowledge borders and the debacle at Ansbacher and Allfirst began in the Irish financial system. It is important we recognise that. We need to act on this issue and empower our regulator to be able to act to find not just tax defrauders but the financial institutions which, either through laxity or malice, are allowing fraud be perpetrated. Fraud costs money and this money is always borne by the taxpayer and the banking customer.</P>
    <P>Why has it taken nearly five years to get to the point where we can only now name the holders of illegal Ansbacher accounts? Does this Bill take up any of the lessons learned from the Flood, McCracken and Moriarty tribunals when it comes to ensuring proper management of financial institutions?</P>
    <P>We need to recognise that with all these failures in the private banking and financial services sector there is an obvious role for a State bank and insurance company. These would be State banks or companies that would be efficiently and properly run, not exploitatively, as is obviously <Col N="207" /> the case in the private sector currently. Once upon a time there was a Labour Party which supported such a bank. Where does it stand on this important proposal today?</P>
    <P>For our part, we in Sinn Féin will continue to campaign for the establishment of both a State bank and State insurance company as we believe such State institutions would be of real national benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ó Caoláin for agreeing to share time with me.</P>
      <P>What is proposed in the Bill appears to ignore the central tenet of the McDowell report in terms of having a stand alone, independent financial services authority and I am not sure if we will get the opportunity to hear Deputy McDowell, now a full member of the Government, express his opinions on that central recommendation. Even if he does not, I accept what the Government is proposing in relation to the Central Bank because it is the best way to proceed in terms of this type of regulatory authority, not least because there is a need for greater justification for the Central Bank which, after the onset of the euro, no longer has the responsibilities of a central bank in terms of the control of money supply and seeking to control the rate of inflation.</P>
      <P>What is proposed in the Bill is subject to question and is a half-hearted attempt to deal with the issues involved in the lack of proper regulation of the financial services sector in general. The Central Bank already has significant regulatory powers in terms of the banking system and real questions have to be asked as to how those powers have been applied in the past ten years at least in terms of financial scandals that have occurred. Is that because the regulatory controls given to the Central Bank have not been adequate or is it a more central question of either an inability or an unwillingness to practice those regulatory controls? If it is the second area and if the Central Bank is being expanded to take on these new powers, does the confidence exist that such new regulatory powers will be applied to ensure that what happened in the past will not happen again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill tries to address many of the concerns about financial services and the Green Party welcomes the renewed emphasis on consumer protection. It is amusing to see, however, that the Minister agrees with the McDowell group in recognising the valuable contribution and unique role of the credit unions in Irish society. That is certainly a new departure for the Minister because during the lifetime of the previous Dáil he appeared to take every opportunity to demean and denigrate the whole system of community financing that is the credit union movement. Given what is taking place in the Phoenix Park at the moment, the role of the credit unions in adding to the gaiety of the nation is something that should be recognised even if the Construction Industry Federation might not be too happy <Col N="208" /> that the money allocated to people was not used for its intended purpose.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects in terms of controls that are to be welcomed, for example, the appeals tribunal and the establishment of a commissioner but the real problems are not being addressed. They have to do mainly with the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>Other speakers referred to the recent report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board and the colossal profit margins being imposed in relation to people's necessity, that is, the statutory obligation to have motor insurance. This affects mainly young people and their ability not only to meet their transport needs but also to become fully functioning members of society in an economic as much as a social sense. Many young people who have been affected by the sharp practices operating in motor insurance have been prevented from acquiring the means to achieve an economic livelihood because of the stranglehold of what passes for competition in the motor insurance sector which is a cartel. The hope is that regulatory authorities that come into being in the insurance industry will tackle these matters.</P>
    <P>There is a more important area that I have not heard discussed in this Chamber, in which a regulatory authority can play an important role, and it also concerns the insurance industry. It is the issue of public liability insurance and how it affects the voluntary and community sector. Such insurance for voluntary and community groups is, in effect, a tax, even if it does not go to Government agencies. It is collected by the private sector through insurance and compromises the ability and willingness of people to contribute to society by providing social services that the Government is unwilling or unable to provide. I hope that what is being proposed will address the central issues concerning the type of requirements placed on such groups in the first instance, the liability that exists in the event of accident or mishap, the premia charged to meet such liabilities and the unwillingness of insurance companies to deal properly with the effects on the country of undermining voluntary and community activity.</P>
    <P>Of concern in this Bill is the extent to which the Minister, the Department and the Government need to seek sanction for regulating the financial services by having recourse to the European Central Bank, a consequence of involvement in the European monetary system. It compromises our ability more than we imagined on joining the euro. It involves more than not being able to set our interest rates, control inflation or the money supply in and out of the country. Such decisions are being made elsewhere and we are hostages to fortune. When the extent of that control comes to this level, where we have to seek permission to change our legislation &ndash; even the degree to which we can move legislation regarding the regulation of financial services &ndash; we should be concerned. I hope the House will reflect that concern as this Bill progresses. I put on record the Green Party's reservations about <Col N="209" /> this Bill and we will put forward a number of amendments to improve it. While in a general sense it meets a need, we hope the Central Bank and the new financial services authority will use their powers to avoid the type of problems we saw in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill because I recall on numerous occasions in this House, with Deputy Rabbitte, questioning the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Finance on who was going to take responsibility for the single financial regulator. Four years ago the Government made the decision to proceed with this regulator, but subsequently there was a turf war between the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Finance about which Department would have the responsibility and bring forward this legislation. It is evident from this Bill's publication that those who championed the consumer's interests have lost out in this turf war.</P>
      <P>Chapter One of the authority's establishment states that it is to take the financial services supervisory function of the Central Bank of Ireland and the new Director of Consumer Affairs will be subservient to the authority's chief executive whose main remit will be the supervisory role in relation to those functions it is taking over from the Central Bank. The Central Bank's main concern has always been solvency, not consumer protection. Sadly, that will lose out in this legislation. We should have seriously considered additional powers to give teeth to the Director of Consumer Affairs so that the director could act independently of this authority in protecting the rights of the consumer because the Central Bank has persistently and consistently failed to protect these rights.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ó Caoláin highlighted some of these problems in relation to bank charges which over many years were hidden in the documentation distributed by the banks to the consumer. Only recently have they had access to the breakdown of those charges. It was recently highlighted, and many journalists have published articles on it, that the consumers have been charged much more than was advertised by the banks. The other element is the closure of many bank branches in which the Central Bank is not prepared to get involved. Throughout the country the closure of many rural bank branches, especially in the west, has ensured that the consumer has no access to banking facilities. The former Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, stated that she was going to introduce a type of universal system through the AIB but that has yet to come to pass and many parts of the country have banks closing and basic facilities unavailable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael will table an amendment calling for a full assessment of best practice in regulatory supervision to take into account the Enron and Allfirst debacles and how they should influence how we go forward from here with regulation in <Col N="210" /> this legislation. We must remember that in the Allfirst case, as in others, it was the small investor who bore the brunt of the debacle, the small investor that puts a few euros away in a bank, the AIB in this case. We could have a similar situation in relation to other major banking systems. Many investors, who were encouraged by the banks not to put money on deposit but into shares or equities, have found that the price of these has collapsed because of the lack of controls within the banks. What control will this new regulator have of these offshore spurs of major banks because it can have a dramatic impact on many small investors? Yet to date that type of protection has not been in place. We also need a full assessment of the consumer protection element of this legislation.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on his re-election and reappointment and wish him well during his term in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael believes that the programme for Government is an important document and should be treated as such. It should set the agenda for the nation, identify priorities and chart clear timetables for delivery. The current pro<Col N="211" /> gramme for Government was negotiated from two very detailed and, in some respects, very different election manifestos, both of which contained specific promises over a wide range of public policy areas. The merger of the two manifestos could have produced a thick volume of policy initiatives to be undertaken within specific periods during the Government's term in office.</P>
    <P>Both Government parties spent the first half of the recent general election campaign demanding detailed forecasts on the economy and costings from every other party except themselves. They maintained this barrage of accountability throughout the campaign.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Times</i> of 2 May reporting on the failed attempt by Fianna Fáil to introduce the Spanish Inquisition in the shape of dubiously titled &ldquo;independent economic assessment&rdquo; of the party's manifestos said that Fianna Fáil remained determined to keep the issue of fiscal responsibility centre stage. On that day, the new Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, then Chief Whip and number cruncher extraordinaire accused Fine Gael of &ldquo;refusing to produce specific costings for specific proposals&rdquo; and vowed that he and his party would &ldquo;continue to argue that the other parties are promising the public more than they can or will fund&rdquo;. It is obvious that after 17 May that same champion of fiscal accountability suffered what may become terminal memory loss when he metamorphosed into chief negotiator on the programme for Government. He managed to negotiate a programme so devoid of specific costings or specific proposals that the page numbers on the printed copy are the most significant numerical statistics now available.</P>
    <P>To remind the Fianna Fáil members and the one and only of its members present what their obsession was during the campaign, I quote from the Minister, Deputy Brennan's words of wisdom, &ldquo;You can't have a health service or an education service if there isn't a sound economy.&rdquo;  He may live to regret that. We may live to regret that he is right, but the Government is wrong. It is obvious the Minister has lost both his memory and his calculator.</P>
    <P>True to form in the programme for Government the old maxim of &ldquo;do as I say, not as I do&rdquo; applies. Instead of a torrent of specifics, the programme contains only the froth and bubble of aspiration. If the programme is notable for anything, it is its elasticity, its lack of any measurable timeframe for delivery and of targets. The programme for Government is a catch all document, a sort of political &ldquo;whatever you're having yourself&rdquo;. This document is politically cute and its vagueness is designed to make Ministers less rather than more accountable when new challenges lie ahead in every Department.</P>
    <P>There are, however, a few hostages to fortune in the programme. First, it clearly promotes itself as the second in a series of two &ndash; the plan for the second half of a Government, not a new beginning in very different economic circum<Col N="212" /> stances. The Government admits that it should be judged on its record since 1997, not on what it can achieve from 2002 onwards. That will leave it somewhat exposed when reality bites, as it will. Second, the document pledges to build a fair society of equal opportunity in a period of unique and unprecedented growth. It admits that the quality of infrastructure and the standard of our public services are not what we should expect after five years of unparalleled prosperity. Third, it commits to transforming Ireland completely in the next five years. These are vague enough aspirations, but they are targets of a kind.</P>
    <P>In attempting to deliver on its pledges, the Government faces a number of serious challenges, many of which are of its own making: public spending is out of control, up 27% in the first five months of this year alone; income tax revenues in the same period were down 15%; the inflation rate is 4.8%, twice the European average; a deteriorating competitiveness, which is threatening jobs in the multinational sector; a reluctance among some of the social partners to enter into a new national agreement; Third World transport, energy and telecommunications infrastructures which are hampering economic activity; continuing regional imbalances which see growth choking the eastern seaboard at the expense of the other regions; and growing dissatisfaction with the quality, delivery and accessibility of the key public services.</P>
    <P>During the past five years of economic growth and prosperity the Government managed to throw huge amounts of taxpayers' money at problems, but it failed to bring about any real change in the way in which services are provided or plans are implemented. Never was as much money thrown at each Department as during the past five years, yet we have ended up with worse public services. The health services are an excellent example of this failure. Having waited over four years to produce a national health strategy, what eventually emerged was a list of spending commitments rather than a strategy for reforming the way in which health care should be provided to our people.</P>
    <P>During the general election campaign the Minister for Health and Children got over-excited at one stage and gave the latest in a series of further false promises, that of permanently ending hospital waiting lists by the end of 2004. I note from the programme for Government that it contains no such commitment.</P>
    <P>In terms of delivery, we must judge Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats on their record. In 1997 and again in 2002 the Government promised to tackle waiting lists, yet today there are 26,126 people waiting for a hospital bed, more than half of them in the Dublin area. In 1997 and again in 2002 the Government promised that no adult would have to wait longer than 12 months for a hip replacement, but today five out of every ten have waited well over a year. In 1997 and again in 2002 the Government promised that no child would have to wait longer than six months <Col N="213" /> to have his or her tonsils out, but today seven out of every ten children wait much longer.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste's party, the Progressive Democrats, only discovered patients in 2002 in the context of the publication of the national health strategy. Their remedy was to fly them out of the country as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There are many thousands of people in the queue to join a queue waiting for initial assessment by a consultant who are not part of these statistics and some of those people will wait years for treatment. Only 78 of the 709 hospital beds promised this year have so far been opened &ndash; none of them in the Dublin area where waiting lists are highest.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of ground to be made up and certainly a lot more to do because the previous Government failed to do anything other than fling cash at the health service for five years. That negligence has slowed everything down. The health section of the programme for Government relies heavily and exclusively on the implementation of the health strategy, but there is no indication of how this can be realised or how much of it will be dependent on the depleted Exchequer resources. Will there be further recrimination in the Cabinet between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health and Children in relation to resourcing this essential part of our programme for Government?</P>
    <P>Another example of the Government failing to grasp the nettle is the much delayed national development plan. After five years we have no national spatial strategy and no public private partnerships and there are no new road projects starting this year.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government is proof that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats conned the people with their election manifestos. They bought the electorate over a period of economic prosperity with tax cuts and child benefit. Instead of solid economic foundations, we have shifting sands. Instead of the economic calculator of the Minister, Deputy Brennan, we have the shifting sands of depleted resources. So much for the Progressive Democrats watchdog at the Cabinet table. So much for the party of fiscal rectitude and so much for an aspirational programme for Government.</P>
    <P>This programme is nothing but a wish list with no clear direction and this Administration has no idea how, or if, it will be implemented. It claims: &ldquo;We will ensure that every school building attains set modern standards.&rdquo;  What modern standards does the programme refer to and by when will this be done? What guarantee is there for children of this country who are sitting in crumbling, cold, wet and dangerous school buildings that their lot will be improved before the next election? Will we get another published list of schools that are about to be improved but which will never happen?</P>
    <P>The programme for Government is an exercise in deception of the people because it claims &ldquo;we will significantly improve transport services in the <Col N="214" /> regions&rdquo;. How will they be improved and how many more buses does the Government promise? What kind of improvement is planned for rail transport? What kind of guarantee is the Government offering to people in rural Ireland who have no choice other than to drive cars that are expensive to insure on roads which continue to deteriorate? Most important of all, how will the Government pay for any improvement?</P>
    <P>The programme for Government also envisages &ldquo;the promotion of integrated ticketing and smart card technologies which will allow a differential pricing system to be introduced&rdquo;. This is a reheated promise drawn from the 1997 Fianna Fáil manifesto which stated: &ldquo;Tickets between Luas, DART and buses will be fully interchangeable&rdquo;. Then there is Luas itself. Five years ago, Fianna Fáil went to the people claiming the party would build &ldquo;all three Dublin light rail lines&rdquo;. Where do we stand today? We stand waiting for a tram, with the next one not due for at least two years. The only tram we got from the last Government was the phantom tram produced by the former Minister for Public Enterprise for exhibition purposes at Merrion Square some months ago.</P>
    <P>On tourism, there is bluster and waffle but nowhere near the kind of dynamic, urgent and far-reaching policies that are needed to reinvigorate the sector. Fine Gael proposed to provide some relief from local rates for tourism businesses suffering a decline in turnover of 15% or more in 2001 and 2002. As Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh knows the devastating impact foot and mouth disease had in relation to the tourism sector. The Government did nothing to help the sector and does not propose to help the hard-pressed tourism sector in 2002.</P>
    <P>The Government also claims: &ldquo;We will vigorously pursue actions to ensure that that everyone is tax compliant.&rdquo;  The Government will forgive me, and forgive the country, if I am sceptical of such promises coming from this Administration. The fact that there is no timescale, no package of measures and no detail on how this will be done suggests this is little more than a vague nod in the direction of the conscience of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>On the national development plan, there is no mention whatsoever of the current difficulties with the plan and instead simply states that the various measures will be completed. The whole nation knows the dire financial restrictions that are facing the implementation of the NDP &ndash; mainly due to the lack of competence of the Ministers opposite to do the business and get the programme in place. There is no plan to reverse the situation where 33 road developments are on hold, there is no plan to address the gaping economic holes that are evident in future projected start-ups and there is no hope of Ireland getting the infrastructure it deserves under this Government.</P>
    <P>Many people, particularly landowners, have <Col N="215" /> had to endure over the last number of years the spectre of Government big brother descending on them in order to build motorways and major road infrastructural projects throughout the country. They have had great patience. They did not get much understanding but they knew improvements in our road infrastructure were essential from an economic point of view. What will happen the landowners when they discover there will be long delays and they will be in limbo wondering if the projects will ever go ahead. Will the lines that are sterilised now be allowed for development? Will they be allowed for the cut-off points envisaged or for planning permission? There are huge problems in relation to planning and development due to the negligence of this Government in speeding up the national development plan and implementing it on schedule.</P>
    <P>How will the Government safeguard the future of our young people, the elderly and the sick? How will it cope with benchmarking? I believe many of the vague aspirations in this programme for Government will fall off the end of its wish list. I regret to say that the programme for Government is nothing more than a compilation of vague aspiration which regrettably is not costed, but will be the hallmark of the Government's ineptitude over the next number of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The last five years of Government can be defined as the congestion years. As the Tánaiste put it, we have a First World economy but a Third World infrastructure. Traffic congestion is one of the biggest impediments to business in the capital functioning efficiently. The lack of basic infrastructure and access is the single biggest bar to developing the regions.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a single Department of Transport is welcome and will ensure, we hope, a co-ordinated approach to the planning and implementation of the national development plan and other infrastructural developments. While the establishment of a new Department is positive, the specifics in the programme for Government are few. The lack of any detail on how infrastructural projects are to be funded raises serious questions about the ability to deliver on these projects on time. The timescale for many projects under the NDP has already been pushed back. For example, last January the Government set a date of 2006 for the completion of the rail link to Dublin Airport, yet under the programme for Government this has already been pushed out to 2007. We are more likely to see this project completed by 2010 rather than 2007.</P>
      <P>In a recent interview the Minister stated that he had been given no guarantees that the funding required would be forthcoming. There remains a serious question mark over the ability of this Government to adequately fund the major infrastructural projects required to prevent the country grinding to a halt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme for Government makes bland commitments regarding a number of proposals <Col N="216" /> such as &ldquo;the capital development programme for regional airports will be pushed through&rdquo;. When? It says: &ldquo;We will significantly improve transport services to the regions&rdquo;, but no detail is provided. It says: &ldquo;We recognise the importance of maintaining a national airline&rdquo;, but how will that be done? It states: &ldquo;We will ensure that access to public transport is one of the criteria taken into consideration by the planning process.&rdquo;  Do we have to wait another five years for another planning Bill for that?</P>
    <P>There is no mention of the timescale involved. Will the Government introduce measures to address these issues in the short-term, which is what is required, or will it continue the policy of the previous Administration by introducing major policy initiatives at the end of its term in office without providing adequate resources to achieve the goals as set out in its glitzy launches?</P>
    <P>Other proposals raise more questions than they answer. For example, the programmes states: &ldquo;We will put in place a new five year plan to ensure non-national roads are properly signposted.&rdquo;  Where was the old plan? There was none. The programme also states: &ldquo;We will allocate a portion of the budget on road improvement projects to the provision of new footpaths and allow pedestrians to walk with greater safety and comfort.&rdquo;  It is local roads which need footpaths and there is no budget for the improvement of these. The Government plans to establish a traffic corps following a six month consultation process. When will this commence? Will it be like the review of the school bus safety programme which was promised in 1998 but has not taken place yet?</P>
    <P>The programme commits the new Minister to replacing the Road Transport Act, 1932, to allow for new services in the bus market. This is not a simplistic solution to bus competition. The aircoach service in Dublin, one of the biggest competitors to the State sector, lost over &euro;300,000 in the last financial year. Even a service which is perceived to be commercially viable needs some element of State subvention. This will not be an easy problem to solve.</P>
    <P>Projects which have been given the green light will have to be reviewed. The Dublin Port tunnel is not high enough to cater for heavy goods vehicles using the port. IBEC believes it is not too late to change the height of this tunnel, yet there is no mention of it in the plan. The decision by Irish Rail to wind down its freight service must be overturned. It also requires major investment and incentives to take freight off our congested road network. A small level of investment in this area could result in huge benefits as a result of heavy vehicles being taken off the roads. That would not only impact on congestion but also on road safety and harmful emissions in many of our smaller towns. The programme gives a commitment to the improvement of rail services and rolling stock but investment in rolling stock will not necessarily achieve an incremental increase in the level of service. It is planned to introduce an <Col N="217" /> additional 80 diesel cars into the service in 2002 and 2003 yet there is no indication of the number of cars taken out of the system which they will replace.</P>
    <P>The roads programme raises a number of serious questions, including the level of funding available to deliver the projects. A further bottleneck in the system will be the impact the Planning and Development Act, 2000 will have on the supply of aggregates. Under this Act, all existing quarries will have to apply for a new licence under a new licensing regime. That problem has not been addressed.</P>
    <P>The programme outlines what will be done over five years but it is weak on specifics, deadlines and the funding that will be required to achieve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to discuss the programme for Government. It contains some fine thoughts and aspirations but when one examines its content in detail, many questions arise about its various aspects. The most striking issue is the deficit in infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Look at the programme implemented by this Government over the last five years. It brought forward a national development plan which everybody agreed contained many worthwhile projects. However, over the years the Government did not put in place the finances to develop that infrastructure. Throughout the country, roads and bypasses for various towns have been promised but few of them have commenced. I am aware of one case where planning of the bypass started more than nine years ago but work on the project still has not started. It was given the green light earlier this year but there was not enough money allocated to the county council involved to buy the land to start work on the project.</P>
      <P>What is happening on the ground is a complete contrast to what is contained in the Government's programme. This applies across all infrastructure. Let us look at what is happening to the railways. I believe we could have one of the finest railway systems in the world if it was properly developed but we have not done that or developed the huge potential of our railways. The programme only refers to the railways in Dublin and what will be done over the next few years in Dublin. There is nothing about the rail line from Dublin to Cork or the line along the western coast or the huge potential they have. Trucks regularly break down on our major roads but that transport could be transferred to the rail network if it was properly planned. That is not mentioned in the programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme is Dublin orientated; it is only concerned with what will be done in Dublin. This is the problem. The eastern side of the country has been developed so that it is jammed with people and traffic while the western and southern parts of the country are underdeveloped. The next generation will look back on what is happening now and see that we allowed this country to develop on only one side. That will lead to a <Col N="218" /> major problem and we will come to regret it. We have particularly neglected the road and rail elements of infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The programme outlines what will be done for agriculture, food and rural development. I was struck by one comment in this section in which the Government says it will seek to develop the agricultural colleges as wider rural development takes place. What happened in the past under this Government? It closed five agricultural colleges throughout the country. It is a failure on the part of Government to neglect the education of young farmers and this Government has done that. The structure of agriculture is falling asunder simply because the Government is not educating young farmers but closing agricultural colleges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh. He got the credit for keeping foot and mouth disease out of the country last year. He is now in that Department longer than the photographs on the wall and is keeping everybody else out of Agriculture House. I am disappointed he could not find a place for my colleague in Mayo. There are many junior Ministers but, for the first time since the foundation of the State, there is neither a senior nor junior Minister from Mayo. If the Minister could take the wall down in Agriculture House, he could let one of my colleagues into the Department as Minister of State.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister is possessive about the Department and that many people are concerned that he remain there. However, it is not the working class or the poor farmers in the west of Ireland on the farm assist scheme who are concerned but the stock farmers and breeders. I have nothing against the Minister but I was hoping there would be a change, a new direction or new beginning to give the farmers of this country a chance. I am disappointed that the Minister has not already put forward a package for farmers. They are in disarray. They cannot cut silage or survive due to the terrible weather. The weather broke when the Government got into office. I blame the Government for it because it has taken credit for everything else. It would even take the credit if the weather was good. The Taoiseach is probably in the Phoenix Park tonight telling the people he was on the substitutes bench if he was needed. That is the type of Taoiseach we have.</P>
      <P>There was a serious warning tonight from the Minister for Finance. When one sees the Minister for Finance on the television saying that we might be talking ourselves into a recession one can be sure there are bad days ahead and that there is bad news for the country. The Minister gave that warning tonight. The good news came out before the election when all the announcements were made. It was only in the last week of the election campaign that Fianna Fáil started pulling back when it knew it might have a chance to return to Government. It was typical Fianna Fáil; it thought it would not be in Government to deliver. Now it is caught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="219" />The Government has put forward its programme and we will monitor it weekly, monthly and annually. In health, the Government promised that in two years nobody in the country will have to wait for any type of medical procedure. Thank God because there are hundreds of people in my constituency and thousands throughout the country waiting for medical procedures. I will be waiting to see if the Minister, Deputy Martin, can deliver in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Government was not back in power a week before it turned its attention to the FÁS schemes. We know what the Progressive Democrats stand for and it is not for the weak, the poor or the sick. They represent the strongest sector in society, the rich. Their motto is &ldquo;get rich as fast as you can and do not care about the poor&rdquo;. They have already attacked the FÁS schemes. The Minister said today that she intends to introduce a new scheme to replace them. The FÁS schemes have worked but that is the reason the Government is now tampering with them. The schemes helped people who were not in employment to be retrained and to be brought back into society. The schemes gave them self respect.</P>
    <P>Of course, the rich in this country do not want that. They want to keep the poor down and in their place. A man once said to me that the rich, regardless of whether they are Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, will always look after the rich but the Progressive Democrats are there to look after the rich. The Minister represents agriculture in this programme for Government, but there is very little mention of agriculture in the document. The former man from the IFA, Deputy Parlon, used to be up there in the gallery telling us down here what we were doing wrong for agriculture, but what did he do for agriculture when he had such an opportunity, when he was virtually writing the programme for Government?</P>
    <P>I went through the document and could not find a lot for agriculture, and I will be passing on that message to my good friends in the IFA. I lost some of their support in this election. They went with the Independents, but no harm, I may get their support back again. They will be glad to have me now, given that their Independent man did not get elected.</P>
    <P>All I can say to the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and the Government is that it is time to stop picking on the poor, the weak and the sick. The rich are well able to look after themselves, and I will be depending upon the Minister to do something for the hard-pressed farmers over the coming weeks. We do not want to wait until there is a disaster, we want action now. The Minister must go to the Minister for Finance and tell him he wants a package for the farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to raise a number of issues, particularly in regard to health, agriculture and infrastructure. The Government obviously finds itself in a very different economic situation from that outlined by it only a few short <Col N="220" /> weeks ago. It is clear from the media coverage that there has been a major drop in tax receipts, together with a major increase in costs. The two factors simply do not add up. When one takes into account all the promises made in the manifestos before the election and then looks at the programme for Government, it is evident that even in the few intervening weeks, the Government parties realised that what they promised in their manifestos was unrealistic.</P>
      <P>I wish to bring one small issue to the Minister's attention. The programme for Government states that appointments for treatment within three months, or referral, will be achieved. I wonder what has changed so dramatically that this can happen. I would like to highlight some of the correspondence I have had from people in the past few weeks. A consultant ENT surgeon wrote: &ldquo;As you may be aware, my waiting list for my outpatient clinic in Monaghan is now approximately 2 years.&rdquo;  There is no word of three months there. He stated: &ldquo;I cannot at this stage give any indication when the patient will have her surgery until after she has been assessed.&rdquo;  We have a long way to go. In the case of a lady in Cappagh Hospital, the waiting time for a hip operation is 12 to 18 months. Then we turn to the North-Eastern Health Board's hospital for orthopaedics, where 718 patients were on the waiting list in March 2002. I have been issued with a record of how that shortfall has come about. The current staffing level is three permanent consultants, two temporary consultants and one vacancy. The hospital is currently advertising for additional staff, but there is no hope of getting them. This is a long way off the three months that has been promised. One of the consultant orthopaedic surgeons wrote to me and begged me, as a TD for Monaghan, to try to get something done about the serious problems afflicting orthopaedic and other surgery in the area.</P>
      <P>I turn to the general hospital in my own area of Monaghan. The Minister for Health and Children promised that five junior doctors would be appointed to ensure that the treatment room could continue in Monaghan General Hospital. Those five junior doctors have not been appointed. The positions have not even been advertised. I warn the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, and the Minister for Health and Children if he is listening, that unless something is done quickly, the treatment room in Monaghan General Hospital will close down under this great administration on 1 July. I beg, at this last minute, that something be done about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moving on to infrastructure, we were promised on numerous occasions that if only we had the projects ready for operation, all three bypasses on the national road from Dublin to Derry &ndash; Derry being the third biggest city in the country &ndash; would be dealt with immediately. Two of those are now ready, but in 2002 there is not one penny of funding. The provision of EU money for the BMW region will end in 2006. I ask the Minister <Col N="221" /> for Finance whether money will be spent in the BMW region, as promised when this region was established, or will all the money be spent on the pale?</P>
    <P>I will finish on a cross-Border issue. I was at a meeting last week in Monaghan town regarding the Ulster canal and letters were read out from absent colleagues that they all support the reopening of the Ulster canal. Is the Minister for Finance giving his commitment to that? It is vital, if anything is to be done with the Ulster canal as a cross-Border project, that it is done now while there is still some EU money available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The opening sentence in the crime section of this programme for Government states: &ldquo;We stand for a society where all people can feel safe in their communities.&rdquo;  There is not one mention of rural communities in the document. I read it a couple of times but it seems to have been omitted. Crime is increasing throughout this country. There are more murders and rapes and there is more street violence, but street violence is not something that just happens in cities, it also occurs in villages throughout rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>What the Government seems to have done over the past five years is begin the centralisation of Garda stations around the country. What we are left with is a number of rural communities without a garda. Many of these places, years back, would have a garda sergeant and four regular gardaí, now they are left with nothing. Vast tracts of countryside are left unmanned by the Garda Síochána as a result.</P>
      <P>It is not just the public who are telling me this, the gardaí are complaining that it is very unfair for the general populace to be subjected to this. My biggest concern in this regard is for elderly people living in rural Ireland, having been left totally unprotected and unsafe in their homes. Many of them in my constituency of Waterford have been badly affected in the past three years, and you can pinpoint those places from where gardaí have been removed. There is a direct correlation between taking gardaí out of a small village and what happens afterwards.</P>
      <P>There are part-time gardaí living in other counties and they go home at 6 p.m. In many parts of Waterford where crime is committed, people have to go 30 miles before they get to Garda headquarters. That is simply unacceptable. To my mind, policing has a lot to do with intelligence gathering. It is about information, talking to the locals and figuring out what is going on. What we have done is left these areas without gardaí so they do not know what is going on. The locals have no opportunity to tell a policeman what exactly is going on as far as crime is concerned in the locality, and the problem just gets worse and worse. I know what I am talking about because my grandfather was a garda sergeant for years, and 40 years later they are still talking about him. It may not all be complimentary, but he had a presence, which is a very important factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many cases in rural Ireland banks have been <Col N="222" /> shut down, there is talk about shutting down post offices, teachers are leaving schools and now we are talking about shutting down Garda stations. Young gardaí are becoming managers. They are not encouraged to mix in local communities or to discover what is going on. Programmes are needed to encouraged young gardaí to live in the rural communities they serve, regardless of whether such schemes lead to pay increases or more promotion opportunities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ndash;welcomes and supports the clear and specific Programme for Government agreed by the parties in Government, based on the manifestos endorsed by the electorate, which create the framework for the continued development and enhancement of economic and social progress over the next five years.</P>
      <P>I am happy to respond to this motion on behalf of the Government and to ask the House to make clear its support for the programme for Government agreed by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, based on the parties' manifestos which were endorsed by the electorate last month. Contrary to what those opposite seek to portray, the programme is a comprehensive programme for action with several key aspects. It is clear, specific and targeted and sets out the priorities for action. It is grounded on the firm basis of seeking to maintain a balanced budgetary position and it reflects the wishes and aspirations of the electorate as recently expressed. Its delivery is supported by the previous Government's record of delivering on its targets during its five years in office. Those who read the programme can see at a glance that it is comprehensive. It covers all aspects of Government from economic and budgetary policy to building a caring society, ensuring balanced regional development, supporting civic life and building peace and justice within and outside the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to see how a charge of no clear targets or timeframes can be made. The Government has committed in the programme to improving the quality of public services in the specific areas with which I deal. We will deliver further real improvements to pensioners and those on low incomes and we will meet our targets on major capital and investment programmes. We have committed to establishing the National Development Finance Agency, an innovative concept to address our infrastructural deficit. We will use once-off revenues to create a national transformation fund to enhance capital investment. We will assist enterprise and employment with specific cuts in business taxes in the area of corporation tax and capital gains tax and we will direct resources at those on low pay by removing earners on the minimum wage from the income tax <Col N="223" /> net, putting 80% of tax payers on the standard rate of income tax and using tax credits to better target tax resources to achieve key policy objectives.</P>
    <P>The Government's social welfare policies include a target for reducing consistent poverty. It has established a benchmark of &euro;150 per week, in 2002 terms, for social welfare payments and it has set a goal of achieving a State pension of at least &euro;200 per week by 2007. The new programme re-emphasises the Government's commitment to key aspects of the health strategy, including increasing bed capacity by a specific amount, reducing waiting lists, reforming primary care to provide extended coverage and developing community based services for the elderly. The level of investment in the health services since 1997 has been very significant and spending is no longer below the EU average.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noted a report from the Economic and Social Research Institute, commissioned by <i>The Irish Times</i> before the election. The report stated that the amount of money spent by Ireland on health is above the European Union average, including the amount in the United Kingdom following recent spending increases by the Chancellor, Mr. Brown. Furthermore, the ESRI's research, conducted by Professor John FitzGerald, showed that Irish spending on health will be above that of almost all EU countries as a percentage of GNP by the time the health strategy has been implemented. This refutes the accusation made over the years that the Government has not spent money on health. I have agreed on many occasions with the argument made inside and outside the House that many reforms are needed in the health service, but the independent research conducted for <i>The Irish Times</i> by Professor FitzGerald clearly shows that additional funding is not such a necessary reform. The accusation that sufficient resources are not being allocated in the health sector does not stand up to scrutiny. The report was not widely mentioned during the election campaign, but it was noted in the Department of Finance as it re-emphasised what I have been saying for some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESRI has a good record and provides an independent voice. Deputy Higgins will agree that the newspaper to which I referred is not a noted supporter of this Government. It has not supported me as Minister for Finance during the past five years and I do not expect that I will be treated differently in the next five years. The research which was reported must <Col N="224" /> be at least taken on board in this discussion. As we must ensure that a quality health product is delivered as a result of the extra resources, I decided in the last budget to establish a commission on health service funding to review, evaluate and make recommendations. I will return to the theme of value for money and its implications.</P>
      <P>The previous Government prioritised education and science during its term of office and provided an unprecedented level of funding to develop and improve services. Under the new programme, the Government will continue to pursue policies aimed at ensuring that children can achieve their potential and that the standards of education and facilities are maintained and improved. Policies will have particular regard to children with special needs and children and adults from disadvantaged areas. Where is the lack of targets or clarity in this? I could go through other parts of the programme in a similar vein, but I will leave that to my colleagues who will be speaking on the motion.</P>
      <P>Delivery of targets ultimately requires resources. We must generate these resources, use them prudently and seek maximum value for money. I view this last criterion as crucial in all cases but especially where the capacity to generate funding is more limited going forward than it has been in the recent past. It is not a matter of saving for saving's sake or efficiency for narrow business reasons, but of fairness all round. If an extra &euro;1 of value can be realised, for example in health delivery, that yields an extra &euro;1 for those areas of the health service which might otherwise lose out. It is not a matter of merely saving money; it is a public duty to see that the huge resources put into public service delivery meet as many real needs of the people as possible.</P>
      <P>I have made clear on many occasions that we can only spend the resources we have. We cannot spend funds we have not got or cannot reasonably generate. The most secure way to sustain the public finances is to keep a balance in the finances of Government. I took particular pains to include this underlying framework in my party's election manifesto and it can also be found in plain terms in the programme for Government. The programme makes it clear that this is part of our commitments under the EU growth and stability pact, which we signed up to before I became Minister for Finance. As a nation, we have given a sovereign commitment to keep Government finances close to balanced or in surplus and to take corrective action if there is an actual or expected divergence from the objective. The Government will respect this commitment. I can hardly see how such a budgetary framework could be clearer or more measurable. It is not only the Dáil that can judge actions in this area but the Commission and all other member states at ECOFIN. I am not aware of any such previous clear budgetary commitment put and endorsed in any election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view the critical issue is that the contents <Col N="225" /> of the programme for Government were endorsed by the electorate. The Opposition may not welcome the result but they cannot credibly ask the House to condemn the recently expressed choice of voters, as to do so would be perverse. All parties set out detailed proposals in the election; they sought to cost them and to set them in a budgetary framework. We had our differences on how coherent those costings and frameworks were in some cases, but the decision has been made and the Government's task now is to deliver.</P>
    <P>We spent a number of years talking about joining the euro. During the run up to the introduction of the euro I heard people say that this question was not put to the Irish people. As Members will be aware, the question was put to the people during the Maastricht referendum, even though much attention was not paid to it. The terms of the EU stability and growth pact were negotiated and clearly spelt out when we held the Presidency in 1996. As I have stated on a number of occasions and <i>ad nauseam</i> during the election campaign, irrespective of who occupies the position of Minister for Finance and irrespective of what party that individual is drawn from, we are bound by these commitments.</P>
    <P>There was some discussion in the House on the finance aspects of European matters arising from the recommendation by myself and Mr. Solbes that the deal was to be outside the broad economic policy guidelines. I pointed out at the time, whatever about the broad economic policy guidelines, the serious matter was the terms of the stability and growth pact. In recent months two member states have had some difficulties in this regard. The ECOFIN Council recently adjudicated on the German stability programme and the Portuguese programme. People will also be aware that an ECOFIN meeting is scheduled for this week in advance of the Seville European Council to finalise the position regarding the French proposals. It has been possible post the French elections to adjudicate on this matter in a more sober light. Therefore, the terms of the stability and growth pact are not of academic importance or something we can pick and choose. The rules were laid down in line with all the countries joining up to the euro.</P>
    <P>We will be in a privileged position in years to come. Perhaps in future Deputy Michael D. Higgins will be the Minister for Finance. Who knows what the electorate will throw up in the future. Deputy Joe Higgins may be Minister for Finance. There may be a majority of Sinn Féin Deputies in the House. They may form the Government and some of their illustrious group may occupy the position of Minister for Finance. Irrespective of what party is in office it will be bound by the rules of the euro. The Government and future Governments may make adjustments in micro areas and in terms of taxation or spending.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>During the election campaign, despite answering parliamentary questions in advance regarding the broad economic policy guidelines and talking about the stability and growth pact, some parties, including parties one would expect, made commitments in various Government programmes about what could or could not be done and what could or could not be counted. For example, under the terms of the stability and growth pact, the amount of money we sent to the pension reserve fund does not count. It is as if it never left the Government coffers. One is not penalised in terms of the stability and growth pact. On the other hand, one does not get credit for privatisation of State assets, except in terms of reducing the interest on the national debt. These issues must also be taken into account.</P>
      <P>The terms of the stability and growth pact are such, irrespective of who is Minister for Finance, that they will have to be adhered to. That aspect was highlighted more clearly during the election campaign despite all the talk during the previous five years. In the end, all parties regarded this as the main issue. In my view, this is the critical issue. What is in the programme is what was endorsed by the electorate. The Opposition may not welcome the result but it cannot ask the House to condemn the recently expressed choice of the electorate. That would be perverse. During the election campaign all the parties set out detailed proposals. All sought the costings of the said proposals in the budgetary framework. There were differences on how coherent those costings and frameworks were in some cases. However, the decision has been made and the Government must now deliver. I suggest that as a student of politics and a participant in the art of politics, Deputy Michael D. Higgins would be interested in this aspect from an academic viewpoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note since the election that some commentators more or less blame themselves for letting the Fianna Fáil Party in particular dominate a lot of the election coverage regarding the economy and that the Opposition fell into the trap also, as if we might otherwise have had a different election result. I recall some of the blame being attributed to me as if there should have been a greater debate on other aspects of the Government's programme such as the public finances. It was suggested that the Opposition got caught in the trap set by Fianna Fáil of having to discuss the economy during at least half the election campaign, as if it was the job of Fianna Fáil to plan how there could be a greater debate to help the other par<Col N="227" /> ties get elected. There is a new kind of principle of falling on one's sword which I have not heard enunciated during a campaign for a number of years.</P>
    <P>Economics were discussed during much of the campaign. The terms of the stability and growth pact were discussed which highlighted the problems going forward, irrespective of what party is in power. That has been the one positive aspect of the election campaign.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>One sound way to judge whether someone can deliver is to look at what they have done when given the chance in the past. In the case of the parties forming the Government, the record shows that we can meet the targets. At the risk of making those opposite feel uncomfortable, I believe it is worthwhile to go over this record. Since taking office in 1997, both parties in Government presided over one of the best economic performances in the world. During that period of office economic growth in GDP terms averaged around 10% per annum; real living standards and take home pay increased substantially; we put an end to forced emigration; over 300,000 new jobs were created; unemployment fell from over 10% to 4% in 2000; the long-term unemployment rate was cut by 80%; the economy became one of the most open and competitive in the world; and the public indebtedness dropped sharply from 74% of GDP in 1996 to around 34% now, giving us the second lowest national debt in Europe.</P>
      <P>In the area for which I am responsible, I undertook a series of major reforms and restructuring of the tax system. The first five budgets I introduced reduced both the standard rate and the top rate of income tax by six percentage points and replaced the personal and PAYE allowances with tax credits, making the system more equitable. Increases in those credits have ensured that 37% of income earners are now outside the tax net and 90% of the value of the current minimum wage is exempt from tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On top of that, the budgets progressively widened the standard rate band, thereby reducing the numbers paying tax at the top rate; increased the incentive to work by reducing average tax rates, thus reducing the tax wedge which is now the lowest in the EU for those who are on average or low pay; increased the wage exemption limits for those aged 65 or over, thereby removing significant numbers of older citizens from the tax net; <Col N="228" /> reduced the rate of capital gains tax from 40% to 20%, thereby encouraging people to release assets into the market and greatly increasing the tax yield; reformed the taxation of inheritance and gifts by introducing a single 20% CAT rate across the board, introducing a shared home exemption which was widely welcomed, simplifying the aggregation rules and abolishing probate tax; simplified the health expenses scheme, disposing of the need for complicated covenant arrangements and extended the relief to cover a wider range of family members as well as others such as those aged 65 and over and the incapacitated; amalgamated the existing tax reliefs for donations into one new simplified and expanded scheme, which now covers charities in general, second level schools and third level educational institutions as well as capital sports projects.</P>
    <P>It has rationalised and expanded the tax relief for third level fees and introduced relief at source for mortgage interest and medical insurance, aligned the income tax year with the calendar year and brought forward related benefit for budget day tax on social welfare changes. New pension arrangements for the self-employed have been introduced and other categories to give a person more control over their own pensions on retirement removing the obligation on them to purchase retirement annuities in all cases. Provision has been made for a phased reduction in corporation tax to 12.5% across the board for all corporate trading income by 2003.</P>
    <P>The Government ensured in its term of office that the Revenue Commissioners were provided with adequate resources to carry out their duties, both in terms of manpower and statutory powers. Specifically, in regard to powers, the Government introduced a number of measures to enhance the Revenue Commissioners' powers to enable them to obtain a greater range of information from third parties, to access bank accounts and to audit records of financial institutions. We have committed in the programme for Government to further address tax evasion and we will also deliver on that. I plan to further overhaul, reform and rationalise various aspects of the tax and revenue systems where that helps to simplify tax administration, assist the taxpayer in dealing with taxation, enable resources to be used more effectively and to better target tax resources towards achieving Government priorities.</P>
    <P>No matter how good the record of achievement is, there will always be challenges for the future. A key challenge to address is investment in infrastructure which we need to do to secure future growth. We need to invest to meet the demographic challenge of ageing and the implications this has for the cost, provision and structure of the public services going forward. Over the last five years the Government committed significant resources to capital investment, especially to roads, public transport and housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a huge shortfall.</P>

      <P>Capital spending will have increased from just &euro;2 billion in 1997 to just over &euro;5.7 billion in 2002. Even with such a high level of investment in our infrastructure, more is needed to meet the growing needs of the economy and the new Government is committed to this.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hayes should note that pumping too many resources into the capital programme will have an effect, which we can point to over the last number of years. All one does is drive up inflation in that particular sector and one gets less return for one's buck, which is what has happened regarding some of the capital programme over two years. Resources were pumped in, but only the same pool was there to do the work and tender prices went up. There is another myth out there that needs to be exploded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Accordingly, the programme for Government sets out ambitious and specific targets in areas such as transport and environmental services. Achievement of these targets will be assisted through the implementation of the infrastructure investment programme of the national development plan. Despite some misinformed commentary to the contrary, progress in rolling out the NDP infrastructure programme has been satisfactory. In particular, good progress has been made under the economic and social infrastructure programme of the plan with financial outturn well on target and significant physical output being recorded. In financial terms over the first three years of the plan, total investment under the economic and social infrastructure programme will amount to &euro;10.2 billion, which is &euro;140 million more than originally planned. The Exchequer and EU contribution over the same period will amount to &euro;8.5 billion or &euro;740 million more than originally planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particular attention was paid by the previous Government to the delivery on the ground of the NDP programme and a major innovation was the creation of the Cabinet committee on infrastructural development, including public private partnerships, chaired by the Taoiseach and supported by an interdepartmental team of senior officials. <Col N="230" /> This institutional structure, which will be continued by the new Administration, provides a powerful framework to address institutional, administrative, legal and other factors which impact on infrastructural delivery. In addition, the establishment of a Department of Transport responsible for major roads and public transport investment will enable a better and more integrated focus on delivery of investment in this key area.</P>
    <P>The roll out of the NDP infrastructural programme has resulted in projects of an unprecedented scale and size being constructed throughout the country, even with a number of factors which have intervened to limit progress. Construction industry inflation has been higher than anticipated at the outset of the plan and these higher costs have absorbed resources. Additional costs have also arisen in some cases as a result of respecification of projects as they moved from conception to planning, design and construction. Finally, delays have been encountered as a result of disruption due to foot and mouth disease and compensation of land owners. The programme for Government and the NDP are predicated on the continuation of stable macroeconomic policies and sound public finances. I am confident that if we adhere to this policy the resources will be delivered to enable the Government accord the necessary priority to progressing the infrastructure investment programme in the plan and in the programme for Government.</P>
    <P>I am proud to have established the National Pensions Reserve Fund and I welcome the positive support given to this initiative by the Fine Gael Party. In common with other industrialised countries, Ireland is set to experience a significant ageing of its population over the coming decades and this will give rise to a serious financial burden on the State. It will put a severe strain on the capacity of all Governments to fund social welfare and public service pension liabilities on a &ldquo;pay-as-you-go&rdquo; basis. The purpose of the National Pensions Reserve Fund is to move from sole reliance on &ldquo;pay-as-you-go&rdquo; and to introduce part prefunding of our future liabilities. It is a long-term project from which we should not be deflected in the early years. The establishment fund will help to smooth the Exchequer burden arising from our additional pension commitments and introduces a new strategic long-term element into budgetary planning. This is our nest egg for the future and we should not deploy it to meet short-term priorities. The ageing burden is an inevitable cost, not something we can avoid or dispel or over which we have any real measure of discretion, which is why the Government in its programme will continue to provide for it. That is a clear and firm commitment.</P>
    <P>The new programme for Government regards the delivery of improved public services as a priority. In particular, over the next five years the Government will focus its attention on health, education and social inclusion within the context of an effective public expenditure management <Col N="231" /> regime. To achieve these goals will require delivery of key results and a close look at the amount of input required to secure the desired outcome. The single biggest input in the public sector is staff and the cost of such staff resources. Obviously, we need a balanced way of relating output to input and pay systems in the public sector are not noted for such rationality and have exhibited many rigidities.</P>
    <P>Over the years Government sought ways of getting away from the rigidities of this system and at the time of the negotiation of the current Programme for Prosperity and Fairness the Government was determined that we could not continue with a system of dealing with pay claims on a piecemeal basis with groups attempting to leapfrog each other. A more orderly way of determining public service pay was needed. Arising out of these concerns the Public Service Benchmarking Body was established as an independent body to examine public service pay and to place the rates for the job in the public service within the context of the private sector and the economy as a whole. Importantly, from our perspective, the parties concerned agreed that historical, cross-sectoral relativities were incompatible with this initiative. This process represents a totally new approach. It is an independent examination and has been the most extensive examination of its kind ever carried out in this country and, indeed, would be regarded as comprehensive by international standards.</P>
    <P>When the Public Service Benchmarking Body was established in July 2000 it was asked to report by end-June 2002. The report, I understand, will be delivered on time. The implementation of the report is to be the subject of negotiations between the public service employers and trade unions. These discussions will take place in the context of whatever arrangements emerge to succeed the PPF. The Government will also have to consider the cost implications of the recommendations in the report in determining its approach to those discussions. At this stage we do not know what these will be. Benchmarking will establish appropriate levels of pay and the budgetary outcome will determine the levels of increase we can afford in any one year.</P>
    <P>If the public is to get maximum value from their taxes which pay for the increases, ongoing modern work practices and flexibilities must be part of the resultant package. We have to proceed on the basis that a euro devoted to higher pay rates is a euro not available otherwise to improve services. Unless public servants can deliver greater efficiency and effectiveness, the taxpaying public will rightly ask why should they pay more unless they get more in terms of the quality of public services.</P>
    <P>Any five year programme is dependent on the medium term outlook for the economy. We have the capacity to deliver healthy growth rates provided we continue to secure our competitiveness. This will be an important challenge, made all the <Col N="232" /> more relevant by the recent appreciation of the euro. As a small open economy with a very large reliance on trade and foreign investment, our fortunes depend very much on the international outlook. They also depend on us maintaining a competitive economy in terms of wage costs, productivity, quality of goods and reliability of services. It also means having a competitive and efficient domestic sector providing services and inputs for the more internationally exposed sector of the economy. One important area of that domestic sector is insurance costs and the programme for government proposes specific measures to address the problems that have arisen, which can affect our growth performance. I expect that growth this year will live up to expectations after a slow start in the first half of the year. Achieving this relies on sustained expansion in major international economies. Despite the continuing uncertainty on the part of some commentators, the consensus view is the US economy is in recovery and first quarter US GDP data supports this.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis the Government will be judged on its record. The programme for Government will provide the means to make this judgment and the electorate will once again in five years time have a clear basis on which to exercise its judgment, the only one that counts in the end. I urge the House to support the amended motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion and to comment on the Government's programme. I listened with great interest to the Minister's contribution and he was wrong on most things. He began by invoking a mandate he claims he got from the people. The public gave Fianna Fáil 81 seats while half a dozen independent Fianna Fáil Members were available to form a Fianna Fáil Government but the Taoiseach decided to surrender that mandate from the people to a small group known as the Progressive Democrats and offer its members positions at Cabinet and junior ministerial level. It is a curious version of a mandate to go to the people, secure enough seats to form a Government and then decide to give them away unless one is like Deputy McCreevy, the Trojan horse for centre right thinking in the outgoing Administration, who was able to deliver Fianna Fáil, the republican party, once again to the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>There is nothing very republican about the programme that has been published and it does not refer to the concept of citizenship. The Minister referred to his five previous budgets, which he is hoping to publish together as a personal testament of his contribution to society, and in each one he deepened the inequalities in society. He gave as much to those at the top of the tax net as he did to those at the bottom. There was an interesting little omission in his contribution as he never referred to housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After five years during which the country <Col N="233" /> experienced the largest budget surpluses in its history, the health service has moved into crisis, not solely for financial reasons but for administrative reasons as well, while in regard to housing the combined income of a couple who both earn the average industrial wage, and who are forced to enter the economy and cannot stay at home to become involved in child rearing, is still not sufficient to purchase a house. When the final statistics are published by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the total number of people on housing lists will probably be between 50,000 and 60,000.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting scenario in the private rented sector where tenants seek the same rights that Michael Davitt sought at the end of the nineteenth century, including security of tenure, fairness in rent and the right to pass on a tenancy. Two years ago a report on the housing market was published, which dealt with the issue of tenants but it was not addressed by the previous Government. The legislation promised in the new programme has not been brought forward. However, the Minister adopted the first Bacon report, which addressed the issue of speculation in housing to an extent. Outside opinion suggests it was a factor in house price inflation but the Minister decided to reduce capital gains tax on speculative gains on house sales, the most crucial area of all. Wave them off in one report and then wave them back again.</P>
    <P>I have spent 24 years as an academic but what I have to say is not academic at all. It is a scandal in a republic to have allowed the heart to be torn out of the economy by allowing speculators to destroy the housing market. I am not elected to the House to stand up and make a contribution that is a cross between a racing analysis and a weather forecast on the economy. I am asked to speak about political economy and I challenge the Minister on the assumptions that guide his thinking and that of the Government.</P>
    <P>Are all matters to be decided by supply and demand in the marketplace through a commodified and depeopled version of the economy, such as in health where public private partnerships fill gaps the State cannot or where people are permitted to enter one sector of the housing market and write off their tax liability because of the number of houses they own? The Minister introduced these measures and it is not something of which to be proud. People who owned ten or 12 houses when the previous Government took office now own 20 and 30 and on it goes. Is that something of which to be proud? Is it very republican? What does it tell us about citizenship?</P>
    <P>It tells us something interesting about the Government's approach to housing and health, which is its antipathy to a rights-based approach to legislation. Centre right Ministers believe everything can be commodified. It is a case of the commodified version of the economy ruled by the marketplace in terms of supply and demand. Is there anything that is not a matter of such commodification and laws of the marketplace?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="234" />For example, Ireland signed up to various United Nations covenants and in some there is a discussion on the forward movement of human rights thinking, which is to add social and economic rights to civil and political rights. Ireland's performance in this area was discussed recently at a UN verifying committee meeting in Geneva. The Government was asked to report on its view about such thinking. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution reported negatively in 1996 on the inclusion of social and economic rights beyond the right to shelter, housing, health and so on and argued that such rights interfered with the property provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party attempted to introduce a Bill in 1998 which would have merged social and economic rights with civil and political rights. When Ireland was asked to report in Geneva recently the UN verifying committee flatly rejected the Government's case against social and economic rights. The Government repeated the argument it used in 1999 for the second periodic report this year and this was bluntly rejected by the committee, which &ldquo;took pains in its concluding observations to point out that when a state voluntarily ratifies an international human rights instrument it, thereby, assumes the legal obligation to give the relevant international law full effect in the domestic legal order&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government, therefore, does not accept rights in terms of housing, health, disability and international covenants to which Ireland has appended its name. In 1999 and 2002 the verifying committee of the UN in Geneva criticised Ireland for its approach in this regard. The programme of Government for the next five years does not accept rights and, therefore, is not based on a theory of citizenship but on a depeopled version of the economy. According to the Government anything good that has happened is an achievement on the part of the Minister while anything negative is the achievement of the international trade winds that are blowing.</P>
    <P>I have heard of all of this previously and there is nothing new or original in the programme. However, the agreed programme does not have a title. It has a little demented harp with the republican party written underneath on one side of the cover while the Pairtí Daonlathach is printed on the other side. It has been described by the Minister as a model of clarity. However, for example, on page six it contains aspirational &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;, as a younger generation would call it. The programme states &ldquo;Within the next 12 months we will publish a specific programme to ensure the expansion of social, cultural and economic co-operation with all the countries that are joining the European Union&rdquo;. This is coming from a Government that abolished the post of Minister for culture, is unable to say which Minister of State responsible for mushrooms or fish will attend the Culture Ministers Council in Brussels and was so committed to opposing the very concept of culture that it regarded broadcasting as a commodity as well. It takes neck, with which I have always credited <Col N="235" /> Fianna Fáil and for which I admired it. When I think of the &ldquo;McDowellisms&rdquo; that will now be at the heart of the Fianna Fáil thinking, many decent Fianna Fáil people should be asking questions.</P>
    <P>Another piece of clarity appears on page seven: &ldquo;We will vigorously pursue actions to ensure that everyone is tax compliant.&rdquo;  That is about on the level of saying we will take steps that will astonish you. The language in this programme, this mish-mash thing of bits and pieces, gets worse. It blatantly tells untruths on page eight where it suggests &ldquo;we support the positive role of the community employment scheme&rdquo;, when the Tánaiste already abolished more community employment scheme places by 2002 than was agreed in the cutback for 2004. It moves on to the question of the statutory redundancy scheme in relation to conditions of employment. It states: &ldquo;they will be examined with a view to implementation.&rdquo;  Why else would they be examined? What does that mean? I do not wish to bore the House but on insurance and road safety it states: &ldquo;Work on the penalty points system will be completed to ensure its implementation at an early date.&rdquo;  Like hens laying eggs, they are hoping that some day it will happen.</P>
    <P>There are very interesting points in relation to Iarnród Éireann. It states: &ldquo;We will establish Iarnród Éireann as an independent State company in its own right with full management autonomy.&rdquo;  There is no reference to the disposal of the assets of CIE. This can be deconstructed to mean &ldquo;We will break up CIE.&rdquo;  On the issue of the sale of State assets, the sale of what the people own, to private speculators who have always known to which party to go, there is obvious disagreement. There is a curious statement that: &ldquo;It will be considered on a non-ideological basis&rdquo;, but what could be more ideological than grabbing what you do not own and selling it, which is the Progressive Democrats view? Then, in order to keep the Fianna Fáil punters happy and to keep the common blushes, if there is such a thing, from reaching a dangerous level, &ldquo;Each proposal will be examined on a case-by-case basis.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Incineration is in. I love the idea on litter. The programme states: &ldquo;We will ensure that all Government and other State agencies fulfil their obligations under the Litter Pollution Act.&rdquo;  What else would they be expected to do? Break it? This is like saying Wednesday usually follows Tuesday with a good expectation that Friday will be two days later. This was described by the Minister for Finance as clear, specific and targeted.</P>

      <P>I like that. On page 17, there is a commitment to the up-to-date nuclear emergency plans, and I believe the iodine tablets have arrived so I suppose that should be noted as an instant success. It states: &ldquo;We will implement a <Col N="236" /> full package of reforms in rented accommodation arising from the report of the Commission on the Private Rented Sector.&rdquo;  Where is the legislation in relation to any of the certainties that people were looking for?</P>
      <P>There is a kind of seediness in relation to other areas, including education. On page 23 the programme states: &ldquo;We will ensure that every pupil participates in a programme designed to increase understanding of the value and role of enterprise.&rdquo;  This is in a 34-page document that does not contain the word &ldquo;music&rdquo; once. It offers a prospect of that kind of mentality that children could not be safe from the notion that everything had to be commodified. There is no reference to the huge need for music education. It would have been a simple old Fianna Fáil value in the past. It would have said something such as that every child would have an opportunity to learn to swim or to play a musical instrument. That is all gone. It is a huckster's charter rather than a programme for Government. There is the grandiosity of the line such as, &ldquo;We are committed to moving forward on the basis of implementing our highly ambitious children strategy.&rdquo;  I ask the Lord to save us from their ambitions.</P>
      <P>I imagine the Minister for Finance is very happy because there is not a single commitment in this that could mean anything or that could embarrass him in the slightest. The Department of Finance will be happy. He will be well able to say that there was nothing in the programme that was not delivered because it was not included from the beginning.</P>
      <P>It is time we debated economics and the assumptions that are underlying these policies and programmes. It is becoming more urgent as there has been a shift in the political spectrum in France to a centre right Government. What have centre right Governments to offer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I accept the will of the people and the Minister knows that at least I have said he has always held the same kind of populist views. He knows where I stand on this. I challenge him to say if he is accepting a basis of universal access or rights in any area &ndash; education, health, environment, safety or participation. If he does not accept the rights-based approach, how will the Government implement the Good Friday Agreement when that agreement will carry many of the rights from the British legislation which are flowing directly from a rights base?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does he really believe in the commodification of everything in relation to the housing market? Is the Government not concerned at what is happening in relation to housing ? A recent housing survey from the Department of the Environment and Local Government produced figures on the number of people who would be regarded as not qualifying for affordable housing. In Carlow, the figure was as high as 27% to 28.9%; Cork, 33.9% <Col N="237" /> to 36%; and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, 53% to 57%. In a case where speculation has been allowed to put more than half the population in a particular area out of the category of earning affordable housing, how can the Minister say that he is running the economy properly? Housing is a social good and is a critical element in human community and social development.</P>
    <P>An assessment of housing needs should be carried out by an independent multi-disciplinary body. Land is the central resource required for housing and the State should move through public land banks and give constitutional support to that if necessary. Housing policies should be tenure-neutral rather than biased in favour of single options. Legislation should be enacted to ensure that housing is a universal right without qualification. If we had an acceptance of a rights-based approach in health and housing and in the basic matters of citizenship from a republican party, I would be perfectly willing to debate with the Minister to what his conversations with the Minister, Deputy McDowell, had led him. I believe that the arrival of this rump in the Government represents a disaster for the next five years. It will be disastrous in several different areas. The way in which they can turn their faces against social need is something that fills me with horror. How can the Minister keep describing the economy in terms of European performance and GDP when the economy can appear to be doing well at a superficial level while people are doing badly? Even those whose tax burden has been reduced, which I acknowledge, have been put into a prison from early morning until night in which they must find child care. They are leading deeply unhappy lives in a depeopled economy. That is why this programme for Government is a disastrous mishmash and a continuation of previous policies.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for selecting this matter. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport made a recommendation prior to the general election that maintenance should be carried out on the River Shannon. If that took place it would be the first major maintenance carried out on the river since the early 1900s when the country was still under British rule. Since that time Bord na Móna has put silt into the Shannon from its peat extraction, while Coillte has put silt into the river from forestry developments and drainage on land it has planted. Local authorities have silted the Shannon because untreated sewage was and still is going into the river and its tributaries. The Office of Public Works, for which the Minister for Finance has direct responsibility, has put further debris into the Shannon through its arterial drain<Col N="238" /> age programme. Over the last 100 years we have seen continual silting of the Shannon to such an extent that land now exists between Shannonbridge and Meelick which did not exist 40 or 50 years ago. This poses a huge threat to agriculture and tourism.</P>
      <P>As everyone is aware, the Shannon is one of the major tourist assets in the country but continual silting threatens the viability of cruisers on the river. There are also thousands of acres in the Shannon basin which are under three to four feet of water due to the lack of release of water and the heavy rainfall of recent weeks.</P>
      <P>I seek an allocation of funding to be set aside to carry out annual maintenance of the River Shannon. The Minister will say it is not his Department's responsibility but at the end of the day he is the one with the money and he can call the shots. Funding must be set aside for this and a commitment must be made to allocate that funding on an annual basis; then we can decide who will carry out the work. It is vital that someone takes responsibility for the maintenance and control of the Shannon. At this point 20 different agencies have responsibility for the Shannon in one form or another. The buck must stop with one individual and one Department, but that is not happening at present. The only way it will happen is if the Minister takes the bull by the horns and puts the funding in place. Then we will get this sorted out.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>The other issue is compensation. A number of farmers in the Shannon basin are in severe difficulties at present because much of the land where they get fodder for wintering cattle has been destroyed and there is no way they will get a crop later this summer. They will be in severe financial difficulty come the end of the year and I ask the Minister for Finance, through the Minister for Agriculture and Food, to put a package in place specifically for that small number of farmers in the Shannon basin. I urge the Minister to set aside funding to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister can find a mechanism to ensure that at last there will be some kind of maintenance. We are not talking about draining the Shannon but carrying out regular maintenance on the river. As that is not happening, the viability of both family farms and tourism assets in the region are threatened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Leas-Cheann Comhairle well in his new position. I did not congratulate him earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While some tributaries of the Shannon have been drained, a drainage scheme has not been undertaken on the River Shannon itself. I regret, therefore, that the Commissioners of Public <Col N="239" /> Works have no powers to undertake maintenance of the river.</P>
    <P>Flooding of the Shannon basin is a long-standing problem and is due primarily to natural causes. The gradient of the river is very flat and it has inadequate depth and width in critical areas. This results in a slow-flowing river which is not capable of discharging all the water flowing through it at times of particularly heavy rainfall with the result that flooding occurs. There is some evidence that rainfall has been increasing in intensity in recent years.</P>
    <P>There have been several studies aimed at finding a solution to this flooding problem. It is generally accepted that the report presented by Mr. L.E. Rydell of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is the definitive study of the problem. This report advanced a number of possible options for alleviation of Shannon flooding and recommended that further study be given to what it considered the most promising approaches. These were a so-called summer relief scheme and a full scheme. The summer relief scheme would aim to eliminate summer flooding and reduce the extent and duration of winter flooding. It is estimated that the present day cost of such a scheme would be &euro;750 million. The full scheme would have a present day cost of &euro;1 billion. Both schemes would also have significant negative environmental implications. Unfortunately, against this background, the likelihood is that the solution to the flooding problems in the Shannon basin will not be found in arterial drainage works.</P>
    <P>The last Dáil requested the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport to consider &ldquo;issues relating to the management of the River Shannon&rdquo;. The committee in its final report in March recommended that the task of co-ordinating the management of the Shannon river catchment be assigned to the Western Development Commission and that the necessary legislative and other changes to give effect to this be implemented. As I indicated in response to a parliamentary question from the Deputy earlier today, I am arranging to bring the report to the attention of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. I assure the House that the Office of Public Works will co-operate fully with the Western Development Commission or any other agency in any effort to alleviate the Shannon river flooding problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Mayo branch of the Arthritis Foundation of Ireland has been campaigning for the last eight years on this issue. I congratulate Mary Healy, Helen McGrath, Rachel Tolan and the hardworking committee for campaigning for the last eight years for a rheumatology service for Mayo. There <Col N="240" /> is one rheumatologist in the Western Health Board area and he also covers Clare. It is outrageous that one person is expected to cover that area, given that thousands of people are waiting to be assessed and there are 14,500 people with arthritis in Mayo alone. Does the Minister think it is fair that people from Achill in north Mayo must travel to Galway &ndash; a 200 mile round trip &ndash; to see a man who is overworked and overloaded? He cannot deal with all the patients because he cannot cover Mayo, Roscommon, Galway and parts of Clare. I have contacted the health board and the Minister about this, but the health board tells me it is awaiting funding and approval from the Department. The consultant himself is overworked and patients are coming to see me about this.</P>
    <P>The Minister should think about people with arthritis. They have pains in their arms and legs and their families are left to look after them. We should put ourselves in that position, although it is fine for us because we can afford VHI and get instant service. These people are depending on the health services and they are waiting in pain. Their families come to me and ask what I, the Government and the health board are doing about this. It is wrong that 14,500 people in Mayo alone must depend on one individual; that is impossible for any person. I compliment the consultant, as he is under stress. He has contacted the committee and said he is looking for further appointments. I seek a rheumatologist for Mayo General Hospital to deal with the Mayo problem. I realise the Western Health Board is in crisis because the chief executive had a recent meeting with the health board where it was pointed out that it is four months over budget. I am sure the Minister and his Department are putting tremendous pressure on the health board to bring its budget into line. If it does so, this matter will not be a priority with the health board.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister, the Department and the Western Health Board to immediately appoint for the Western Health Board region three rheumatologists, one of whom should be for Mayo General Hospital alone. We do not want to share that person. Given that there are 14,500 people in Mayo suffering from arthritis there is a need for such an appointment.</P>
    <P>Recently I attended a public meeting at which outrage was expressed. One horror story followed another about people waiting for appointments and waiting three or four hours to be seen by a consultant. Those people may get only five minutes with a consultant because that person is under pressure given the number of people he has to see in one day. I ask the Minister to resolve this problem once and for all. It can be resolved. What we seek is a commitment from the Minister and the Department of Health and Children to provide funding. We seek a commitment from the Western Health Board to make these appointments immediately with the permission of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The committee which has worked hard over <Col N="241" /> the years is frustrated and upset. At the public meeting I saw the people who are affected. Yet they are out there fighting to get the necessary service for everybody else in rural areas. Why can some of these services not be brought to rural areas? Why should our people always have to go to the cities? Why not make this a specialty in Mayo General Hospital rather than ask 100 people to travel from Belmullet or Aghleam to Galway, which is 120 miles away, or 240 miles round trip. Those people travel home in the evening with pain in their hands and arms without having got the service they needed from the consultant who is overworked. It is not possible for one human being to look after Mayo, Roscommon, Galway and parts of Clare, given that there are 14,500 people affected by arthritis in County Mayo alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I avail of this opportunity to wish you all the best in your position as Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I thank Deputy Ring for raising this matter on the adjournment. As the Deputy is aware, the provision of health services at Mayo General Hospital is the statutory responsibility in the first instance of the Western Health Board. The board has informed me that there is one consultant rheumatologist at present in the Western Health Board based at Merlin Park Regional Hospital and services for patients from the Mayo area are provided by this consultant.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Western Health Board that the provision of a consultant rheumatologist at Mayo General Hospital is being considered in the context of the development of the orthopaedic services in Mayo. The board is preparing a strategic plan for the development of rheumatology services. This strategic plan is at a a very advanced stage and will be placed before the Western Health Board for consideration and adoption within the next two to three months. The further development of rheumatology services in the Western Health Board region will be considered in the context of additional funding available for acute hospital service developments in 2003 and the associated competing priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years there has been a significant investment in the development of Mayo General Hospital, both in developing its infrastructure and in the provision of additional services. There are now 800 staff working at the hospital and its annual expenditure is approximately &euro;50 million. Phase II of the hospital's development was completed recently and includes: a new accident and emergency department, a medical assessment unit, a geriatric assessment unit, an obstetric and delivery suite, CT scanning facilities, a new helicopter landing facility, an improved mortuary and post-mortem room, a new information technology system, and a new administration and medical records department. Overall the phase II development of the hospital cost $48 million. Before phase II started there were 240 in-patient beds at the hospital. The total in-patient beds is <Col N="242" /> now 317, including the 12 additional beds I funded under the bed capacity initiative which I understand opened earlier this year. This represents an increase of over 30% in bed capacity.</P>
    <P>Specific funding of $2.9 million has been provided this year to allow for the opening of the new orthopaedic beds at the hospital. This new 33 bed orthopaedic unit will be a particularly valuable addition to the hospital and will be of great benefit to the people of County Mayo. The development of orthopaedic services in Mayo is an important addition to the Western Health Board's regional orthopaedic service.</P>
    <P>An Agreed Programme for Government provides for significant new developments in acute hospital services. I am fully committed to implementing such improvements in services over the coming years.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to you for allowing me raise this matter which is of great urgency, causing an enormous amount of distress to parents. I am glad the Minister is present. I wish him well in his new period of office. I hope he can respond to two essential points. The first is that waiting lists now exist, for the first time in 21 years, for services at the Brothers of Charity in Galway for new born infants. When the election campaign began there were 19 families affected, now there are 21 or, perhaps, more. Many more are obviously holding back because they know about the waiting list.</P>
      <P>We all agree that for new born infants with intellectual disabilities the earliest intervention achieves the best results. One can appreciate the anxiety of parents who are uncertain or unsure about the prognosis of their child. Unfortunately, what has happened is that the demand has expanded and the staff has not increased. When all 17 of us standing for election in Galway West attended meetings we were asked questions. Members of the Government parties, both Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, accepted a rights-based approach, but such an approach is not being implemented where one divides funding for such services on a county basis proportionately between, for example, Galway, Mayo and Roscommon. If the Minister wishes to implement a rights-based approach it must be done on a needs basis within a rights model. That means there is an immediate need for resources. A compromise, such as has been suggested to those on the waiting list that they will be dealt with in September, simply adds to the delay, given that there will be another waiting list in September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point, which is very important, <Col N="243" /> relates to legislation in the courts and the Government's Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill. That refers to the case of young adults, perhaps three sharing a bungalow, as reported in <i>The Irish Times </i>yesterday. The Brothers of Charity have provided a purpose-built day care recreational centre which would enable them to leave the bungalows and be active during the day. These are young adults approaching their early 20s. The facility is built but no funding has been made available for either its equipment or staffing. This means that the 22 young adults involved, 12 of whom are autistic, are confined, three to a bungalow of 1,200 square feet. Yet there is a building available which could be used and would be of assistance to them. I ask the Minister to intervene immediately to ensure these issues are resolved.</P>
    <P>The argument that this is a matter primarily for the Western Health Board is unacceptable. I have advocated a rights-based approach based on the needs of the person. If it is a competition between services provided within the health board area and on a geographic basis, this severely damages any rights basis for one's policy. I ask the Minister to address these two issues as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>It will be perceived as cynical for all candidates standing for election to attend very emotional meetings, listen, in the first instance, to all the parents and promise to be of assistance and, on the second issue, visit the facility which is built but not equipped or staffed and make commitments. The time has come to put these matters right. I hope the Minister will respond positively to the case I have made on the two issues.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to outline the position in this regard.</P>
      <P>Significant additional funding has, in recent years, been invested in services for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Between 1997 and 2002, the previous Government provided additional revenue and capital funding amounting to nearly &euro;312 million. Specific funding has been targeted to enhance the level of health related support services available to children with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Between 1998 and 2002, &euro;14.6 million in additional funding was provided to expand these services. This includes assessment and diagnostic services, early intervention, pre-school and outreach support for school children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While significant additional resources have been made available to the health boards in recent years to enhance the level of health related support services available to children with disabilities, the boards and other service providers have been encountering difficulties in recruiting and retaining the allied health professionals necessary to deliver the various therapy services. In acknowledgement of these difficulties, my Department asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to explore other <Col N="244" /> possibilities with a view to facilitating as many children as possible to access the necessary support services. It is a matter, however, for each health board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to determine what additional measures the service in their region might undertake to facilitate this access.</P>
    <P>In response to my concern regarding the current labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide, my Department commissioned a report on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists. The study, published in July 2001, concluded that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of each of the therapy grades requiring a significant increase in training places. The HEA, following a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions, has allocated additional training places for speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy. In addition, the Northern Area Health Board will shortly be undertaking a concerted overseas recruitment drive for allied health professionals on behalf of the health boards. These measures, together with continued investment in the services, will greatly assist in delivering an enhanced level of support in these areas to children with an intellectual disability and those with autism and their families.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the provision of health related support services including early intervention services to children with special needs in County Galway is a matter in the first instance for the Western Health Board. Between 1998 and 2002 additional revenue funding amounting to &euro;1.664 million was allocated to the Western Health Board for the enhancement of health related support services for children with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed by families in the County Galway area. A senior official from my Department met with representatives of the board and the families to discuss those concerns. The Western Health Board has informed my Department that the 21 children who are waiting on services will be placed in September. I also understand that it is the board's intention to undertake a review of all the early childhood services in the region.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I will take a personal interest in this and my Department will continue to work closely with the board regarding ongoing development of these and other support services for persons with disabilities in the western region to bring about an enhanced level of support for those availing of these services. I will follow up the issue regarding young adults to see what additional measures we can take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for attending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an urgent need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to protest to the British Govern<Col N="245" /> ment and to strongly oppose the shipping, by way of the Irish Sea, of a cargo of reprocessed MOX fuel in two ships from Japan in the coming months. The grave nature of this development cannot be underestimated. I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue in the Dáil by way of matter on the Adjournment. I urge the Minister and the Government to consider other ways in which this House can express our unanimous rejection of this latest outrage from British Nuclear Fuels and the British Government. We should create this opportunity before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>The seeds of this debacle were sown three years ago. The highly dangerous and radioactive MOX fuel in question was transported from Sellafield to Japan in 1999. Upon its arrival in the Far East, staff at BNFL admitted they had faked the materials safety records. The Japanese Minister for Trade and Industry described the affair as deplorable and said &ldquo;Confidence in BNFL has been destroyed.&rdquo;  The end result was that the Japanese authorities ordered the British authorities to take back the deadly cargo. I would like to emphasise that this is a deadly cargo. It contains enough plutonium to create 50 nuclear bombs. Governments are protesting all along this cargo's likely route on its 18,000 mile journey from the port of Takahama to Barrow in Furness. The two vessels carrying the nuclear cargo, the <i>Pacific Pintail </i>and the <i>Pacific Teal</i> have been armed but will not have an armed escort. The danger of attack is obvious.</P>
    <P>The British Government has argued quite absurdly and outrageously that this shipment has nothing to do with operations at the MOX plant at Sellafield. This latest lie is an attempt by the British Government to slip out of its legal commitment under the United Nations International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea made last November in Hamburg. However, the return of the MOX fuel is one of five conditions set by the Japanese Government and Electrical Utilities for new MOX contracts with Britain. This deadly transport is, therefore, vital for the future of British Nuclear Fuels and if successful could lead to tens of thousands of kilos of plutonium being shipped out of Sellafield over the next ten to 20 years.</P>
    <P>This shipment must be stopped not only for its own sake but in order to thwart the future of the MOX plant which the Irish Government and people have rejected. This is an act of international piracy and sabotage by the British Government and we in this House must vehemently and unanimously oppose it. We must join with other Governments around the world to stop what is a grave danger and what will be but the herald of even greater dangers to come.</P>
    <P>I would like to pose a couple of questions. Why in the face of the unanimous opposition of the Irish people as represented by the Irish Government and significant opposition in Britain did BNFL proceed with its MOX plant? Is it not the case that the plant processes nuclear fuel from all <Col N="246" /> over the world thus creating greater traffic of this material on the Irish Sea? Why did BNFL falsify its quality control standards for MOX fuel leading to the sending back of this cargo of fuel from Japan? How can anyone trust BNFL when a State like Japan, which uses nuclear power, cannot do so? I strongly urge the Minister and his colleagues in Government to significantly increase their efforts and to join with an ever widening international community in concerted action in opposition to this planned transportation of deadly cargo into Irish waters and all the dangers that presents for us in the immediate future and years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Successive Irish Governments have protested to the British Government about Sellafield and these protests and contacts are well documented in the House. The Government will maintain opposition to the continued operation and any expansion of Sellafield and will continue to pursue its campaign to bring about the closure of the plant.</P>
      <P>The shipment of nuclear material to and from Sellafield, which is principally associated with Sellafield reprocessing activities, is among the many concerns of the Government about Sellafield, as is the recently commissioned MOX plant. The Government has strongly and consistently opposed the MOX plant. As the House will be aware, our concerns are now being pursued at a higher level; in this regard, the Government has initiated legal action against the United Kingdom under the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment and under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.</P>
      <P>The commissioning of the MOX plant will add further to the multiplicity of operations at Sellafield. It will also result in an increase in the movement of radioactive materials and of plutonium in particular. The shipment of such materials through the Irish Sea represents an unacceptable risk to the environment of Ireland and the health and economic well-being of its population. There is now also the enhanced risk of the shipments being the target of a terrorist attack or the materials being diverted into the hands of terrorists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concerns of the Government and the public regarding the use of the Irish Sea for shipments of nuclear materials have been made known on many occasions to the UK. My colleague, the Minister for Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who is primarily responsible for the marine environment and safety at sea, is concerned to ensure that the vessels carrying such cargo do not pass through waters under Irish jurisdiction. Currently there are assurances from the UK authorities that they will not do so. The UK authorities have previously stressed that voyages by such vessels through waters solely under UK jurisdiction are kept to a minimum and are already limited to one or two per year to ensure <Col N="247" /> that the highest possible levels of safety are applied both in terms of the vessels employed and the operational requirements applied to them.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are in place with both the UK and France that Ireland will be notified in advance of shipment dates in regard to transport of nuclear materials, the nature of cargoes and all other relevant details. The Department of Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources has also been advised that, in the event that a shipping route involves passage through the territorial waters of any State, the State involved would be notified in advance.</P>
    <P>In relation to the possible shipment of nuclear materials in the coming months, the outcome to date of the legal proceedings against the UK, under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, imposed, by order, obligations of co-operation on the UK. This order places on the UK a requirement for the exchange of information and construction of appropriate measures to prevent pollution of the marine environment, pending the hearing of the substantive case by an arbitration <Col N="248" /> tribunal early next year. This tribunal will consider a number of issues that Ireland regards as essential to protecting the marine environment of the Irish Sea, including the increase in the transportation of nuclear materials arising from commissioning of the MOX plant.</P>
    <P>The order was an important achievement for Ireland. It requires the UK to co-operate with Ireland to construct measures for a safe environment in the Irish Sea. My Department has continued to press the UK in particular on the shipment of MOX fuel from Japan. Assurances have also been sought that the precautions taken for such a shipment uphold the UK's obligations under the 1980 Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials and the various codes of the International Maritime Organisation regarding the shipment of radioactive materials.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy and the House that we are continuing to monitor developments and are in constant contact with UK authorities on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 19 June 2002.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 116 together.</P>
      <P>Sixteen investigations into company law related matters have been initiated by me since I came into office in my previous term as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>In respect of three of these, the High Court appointed, on an application by me, inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990. The High Court inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited presented their report to the High Court on Monday, 10 June.</P>
      <P>The National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited section 8 inquiries are continuing. These reports are expected to be submitted to the High Court in the near future. As in the case of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, the question of whether the reports are published is entirely a matter for the High Court.</P>
      <P>One investigation under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990, was completed in 1998. The report on this has been passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eleven investigations were initiated by me under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990. Four of these have been concluded. Of the four investigations completed, two of the reports were passed to the DPP. The file in one case was returned and a number of summary prosecutions have since been successfully concluded. One <Col N="250" /> report provided an input into the successful application to the High Court for the appointment of inspectors under section 8 while the fourth report was passed to the relevant High Court inspectors.</P>
    <P>Five investigations under section 19 are ongoing. Reports in respect of three of these five investigations are at a very advanced stage of completion. Two investigations were held up in legal appeals, on which a judgment was delivered on 5 June. The High Court ruled on certain constitutional issues which had been referred back to it by the Supreme Court. It is a matter for the Director of Corporate Enforcement to decide how to proceed on these latter investigations. One investigation was undertaken under section 59 of the Insurance Act, 1989. This report has been completed and referred to the DPP as well as to the inspectors undertaking the section 8 investigation into that company.</P>
    <P>The costs incurred since 1997 on company investigations initiated by or on behalf of my Department currently amount to &euro;9 million. This amount does not include the salary costs of Civil Service staff working on a number of these investigations. Similarly, the major proportion of the legal costs relating to the investigations is being borne by the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor. Most of this &euro;9 million derives from the costs to date of the High Court inspectors appointed under section 8 &ndash; National Irish Bank 4.6 million and Ansbacher &euro;3.1 million.</P>
    <P>The question of recovering costs from the section 8 investigations does not arise until such time as the inspectors complete their investigations. This is one of the issues that the High Court will have to address when it comes to consider the Ansbacher report in detail. Section 19, as originally enacted, did not provide for the recoupment of costs. This has now changed with the enactment of the Company Law Enforcement Act, 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93, 96, 99, 100, 128, 131, 141, 145, 146, 153, 154, 156 and 159 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, participation levels are gradually being reduced reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of the long-term unemployed, and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment.</P>
      <P>The PPF contains a commitment to reduce overall place numbers on CE to 28,000 by 2003 through a reallocation of funding equivalent to 5,000 places to the social economy, together with the reduction of 4,500 places required by the Government's decision of 21 July 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mainstreaming of schools services currently under way and the proposed mainstreaming of other essential services, including the health and environmental sectors, will further reduce the numbers employed on the programme. This has been confirmed by my Department in detail on a number of occasions in the context of discussions with the social partner representatives in the PPF Standing Committee on the Labour Market. I have also made this posi<Col N="253" /> tion clear in my responses to a number of previous parliamentary questions on the restructuring of CE.</P>
    <P>There were 36,027 participants on CE in November 1999 at the commencement of the PPF and 30,308 in December 2001. There were 30,809 participants on CE at the beginning of 2002 and 28,246 at May. It is anticipated that the year end participation rate will be in the region of 24,000 to 25,000 places, depending on the rate of inflows and outflows on the scheme. The level of participation in 2003 will be determined by the degree to which optimal numbers of CE places suitable for mainstreaming are identified, and by the outcome of discussions and consultations with key stakeholders and members of the PPF Standing Committee on the Labour Market.</P>
    <P>This phased reduction in place numbers is part of a strategic shift in policy in favour of greater investment in training and other supports, e.g. social economy and the new high supports process, which I hope can be launched in the near future.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the concerns of sponsors from community organisations regarding the implications of the reduction in CE places for the provision of community services. FÁS prioritises projects according to the types of services provided and levels of unemployment in the locality. It will co-ordinate reductions so as to minimise the negative effects on groups and services most in need of CE. Priority groups include the drugs task forces, child care service provision and designated disadvantaged areas covered by the new RAPID programme and BMW regions.</P>
    <P>In addition, the social economy programme is available to support the development of social economy enterprises that will benefit the economic and social regeneration of communities. Local social economy working groups have been established in the 38 designated disadvantaged partnership areas and in 16 non-partnership areas. In this way the social economy is targeted at areas which traditionally have had high dependence on services provided under CE.</P>
    <P>A review of active labour market programmes as provided for under the PPF has recently commenced under the aegis of the Standing Committee on the Labour Market, which is chaired by my Department. This committee includes representatives of the community pillar, employers and trade unions, as well as other Departments and FÁS. Recently consultants were appointed by my Department to facilitate a rigorous assessment of the effectiveness of existing programmes which will help to inform the deliberations of the standing committee. Terms of reference for the consultants' work were agreed by a steering group representing the standing committee, which includes the social partners.</P>
    <P>I recognise the range of valued services across communities which have been provided with the support of CE schemes. The mainstreaming initiative recognises that certain key support services, such as in the education and health areas <Col N="254" /> can best be provided through the Department with functional responsibility in the relevant area. This is why the appropriate funding transfers from FÁS to the Departments in question.</P>
    <P>FÁS is undertaking its own internal review of CE, which should further inform the prioritising of activity within CE, taking account of the needs of disadvantaged groups and the provision of services to areas experiencing severe social and economic disadvantage. In addition, FÁS also intends to carry out a fundamental review of the community training programme in consultation with sponsors, participants, employers and relevant Departments. The future policy direction of active labour market programmes, including CE, will be informed by the outcome of these processes.</P>
    <P>FÁS employment services continue to be available to assist persons who have completed their term on CE and are now ready to progress to work in the open labour market. It is worth noting that the continuing strong demand for work permits for low skilled positions suggests that persons finishing their contractual term on CE are facing into a buoyant labour market.</P>
    <P>The numbers of persons availing of local training initiatives, community training and job initiatives programmes at December, 2001 were 1,514, 1,131 and 2,649 respectively. Participation levels anticipated for October are 1,590, 900 and 2,700 respectively.</P>
    <P>CE supervisors are employed by their sponsor organisations. As a direct result of the overall restructuring of CE and of the mainstreaming of schools services a number of supervisor positions are becoming redundant. FÁS employment services will ensure that such supervisors are made aware of employment opportunities arising in the social economy programme or other CE schemes. With their consent, redundant supervisors will also be placed on the FÁS regional database of CE supervisors for future prospective supervisors.</P>

      <P>The issue of job creation through the attraction of foreign direct investment is statutorily charged to IDA Ireland, for which it is a day-to-day operational issue.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities. I have impressed on IDA Ireland the crucial importance of making even greater efforts to provide employment throughout the country. The day-to-day work of promoting Ireland as an investment location continues apace.</P>
      <P>The focus of IDA Ireland over the coming months and years will be on high quality new investment that is in keeping with the competitive characteristics of the Irish economy. In addition, IDA will continue to work closely with existing clients to upgrade the value of their products and services into higher order functions such as research and development. Many recent job losses are part of an ongoing process of adjustment, whereby activities and hence jobs at the lower end of the value added scale are being phased out, as these activities become uneconomic in an Irish context. In 2000 IDA Ireland negotiated nearly 40% of all new jobs in salary ranges above &euro;31,700. The agency is working to ensure that overseas companies in Ireland are engaged in the kind of high value activity which is sustainable in the long-term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the IDA's policy in this regard is to focus a major part of its efforts on embedding the existing overseas owned companies here. Through development programmes which IDA operate, it is aimed to have capable companies moving systematically up the value chain, from being subsidiary operations to becoming strategically independent operations within their corporate structures worldwide. The essential ingredient in <Col N="256" /> this programme is to ensure that these companies continuously adapt to the changing nature of the economy and have an operation in Ireland that fits with the competitive characteristics of the Irish economy. Second, the IDA continues to work in attracting the kind of high value new projects which are sustainable in this economy and to focus on those business sectors which offer the best opportunities for success in the future.</P>
    <P>With regard to these objectives, IDA Ireland has taken a number of key steps over the past year, including the setting up of two new divisions within the agency, the education, skills and research unit and the strategic business group, the regionalisation of a number of key divisions to regional offices in Athlone, Sligo and Waterford, and the introduction of a new research and development capability scheme.</P>
    <P>The provision of quality office and industrial premises on high quality business parks in key centres is being undertaken by IDA Ireland working in partnership with local authorities and the private sector. This is recognised as being essential to attracting new greenfield investment to the regions.</P>
    <P>In addition, the National Development Plan 2000-2006 outlines the improvements to the physical and educational infrastructure that need to be fully implemented to ensure improved access to the regions and increased availability of third level graduates which are a prerequisite for modern industry. These issues are being addressed both at local and Government levels to ensure complete implementation.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures outlined above, which are currently being adopted by IDA Ireland, as well as the continuing commitment of the Government to regional development will bring positive results to the country. I will continue, along with the industrial development agencies, to promote Ireland with international firms for suitable industrial development projects.</P>

      <P>The figure of 200,000 workers from overseas being needed in the period 1999-2000 originated in an economic study which used the working assumption that the relationship of employment growth to economic growth in the first half of this decade would remain the same as that in the second half of the 1990s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Based on patterns of migration in the late 1990s about half of those coming in would be returning <Col N="257" /> Irish, another 25% to 30% would come from the wider EU and only perhaps 20% were likely to come from elsewhere in the world.</P>
    <P>Given that the rates of economic growth, employment growth and immigration were higher than expected in the early years of the NDP, my Department has been re-assessing the likely demand for labour from overseas in the period to 2007. This work is continuing and recent experience and projected flows are being considered in the context of the ESRI's most recent medium-term review.</P>
    <P>Present indications are that we will have a continuing need for personnel from overseas throughout the period to 2007 but at a reduced level to that experienced in recent years. I hope to be in a position to draw firmer conclusions in this area shortly.</P>

      <P>Following the initial announcement of closure last February, the Labour Relations Commission invited unions and management to discussions with a view to securing the future of the plant. After intense negotiations, a proposal was agreed involving significant changes in work practices and voluntary redundancy for 50 people. There was reason to believe that this agreement would secure the survival of the plant.</P>
      <P>When the company failed to secure sufficient orders from customers at satisfactory prices a final decision to close the plant was taken. I described the announcement at the time as a blow to all concerned, all the more so as there was reason to believe that the plant would survive after agreement on the restructuring plan. At the time I also acknowledged the determined efforts of the LRC to facilitate the survival of the plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent days the workers at the plant in question voted in favour of Labour Court recommendations on a redundancy deal in excess of the minimum statutory requirements. The deal provides for five weeks pay per year of service, inclusive of statutory requirements, and takes into account length of service and other related matters. While the recommendations are not binding it would be expected that all the parties <Col N="258" /> concerned would give serious consideration to the court's recommendations.</P>
    <P>In the light of the interventions made by the LRC and the Labour Court, both under the aegis of my Department, I did not consider it appropriate to invoke section 15 of the Protection of Employment Act, 1977.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government approved the draft scheme of a Bill to implement the recommendations of the review group on auditing last December. This legislation will include provisions to reform the regulation of and rules governing the accounting and auditing profession. Most significantly it will establish the Irish auditing and accounting supervisory authority on a statutory basis to supervise the regulation of the accountancy profession by the professional accountancy bodies.</P>
      <P>The collapse of Enron in the US lead to fundamental questioning of the practices of the auditing and accounting profession, auditor independence, the quality of accounting standards and corporate governance structures within companies. The Bill, which is at advanced stage of drafting by the parliamentary counsel, contains provisions relating to all of these concerns.</P>
      <P>In the light of the Enron affair my Department, in consultation with the interim board of IAASA, revisited the provisions in the draft Bill to ensure that the auditing and corporate governance failures associated with the Enron case are adequately dealt with in it. I am satisfied that this is the case in the light of information available on the collapse of Enron at this stage.</P>
      <P>As well as the specific provisions in the legislation that will bring much greater transparency to the relationship between auditors and their clients, IAASA will also have specific powers to monitor the rules and standards of the professional accountancy bodies in relation to auditor independence to ensure that they are achieving their stated objectives and that they continue to be at the forefront of best international practice. For example, IAASA, if it considers it appropriate, will be able to compel accountancy bodies to amend their rules and standards in the light of the findings of the ongoing investigations in the US in relation to the role of Enron's auditors or any other developments at national or international level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to bring this Bill to Government in the <Col N="259" /> near future to seek its approval to publish it in advance of the autumn session.</P>
    <P>Recent EU ECOFIN Councils have also discussed issues relating to the collapse of Enron. The EU Commission plans to bring forward a communication on auditing and corporate governance matters later this year. It is envisaged that this communication will cover issues discussed by the Review Group on Auditing and provisions included in the audit legislation currently being prepared. The work we have already undertaken here is contributing to the debate at EU level, in particular on the public oversight of the accountancy profession and corporate governance structures within companies.</P>

      <P>As regards the agencies under my Department, IDA Ireland the industrial agency which deals with inward investment is continuing to promote County Louth for new inward investment. It has begun site development works at its new business and technology park in Drogheda where it has secured planning permission for a number of new buildings.

In 2002 Enterprise Ireland aims to commit in excess of 30% of its financial supports to projects in the BMW region including County Louth: approximately 25% of EI clients are currently located in the BMW region.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="262" />Enterprise Ireland's efforts to encourage and assist industry development is focused on export promotion, assisting the development of innovative products, encouraging new business start-ups with significant development potential, identifying deficits in the operating environment and promoting the north east as an excellent location for Irish mobile investment. In its efforts to promote County Louth, Enterprise Ireland engages in the following activities: a new community enterprise scheme, launched in April; this scheme replaces the Enterprise Ireland community enterprise centre scheme 1989-2001 under which centres were established in Dundalk and Ardee; the proposed establishment of a number of technology hubs, termed Webworks; the investment of &euro;95 million in 12 venture capital funds which will have a dedicated regional focus delivered through four of the funds; Enterprise Ireland continues to work closely with the Ardee Community Development Company Limited, in the community's efforts to develop a significant business park in the town, with the potential to house ICT based business.</P>
    <P>Under the micro-enterprise measure of the Regional Operational Programme, the Louth County Enterprise Board continues, with EU funding, to support micro-enterprises employing under ten people, with financial intervention and entrepreneurial development of management and e-commerce skills, and enterprise education in second level schools. To date 356 enterprises have been approved by Louth County Enterprise Board with 25% in a rural location and 75% in urban areas.</P>
    <P>With a remit to foster trade between north and south, InterTradeIreland is operating across all sections of industry, and with every conceivable shape and size of business; complimenting the activities of its sister development agencies on the island. Key programmes cover graduate placement, equity awareness, business fora and public procurement and a number of businesses in County Louth have participated in some of these.</P>
    <P>Data compiled by Forfás for the past five years, 1997 to 2001 inclusive, shows that new full-time jobs created in firms supported by development agencies in County Louth, that is IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, amounted to 4,309. Jobs lost in these firms in County Louth for the same period amount to 4,785. This gives an overall reduction in jobs of 476. In addition, 683 jobs were created by Louth County Enterprise Board in the same period.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110, 126 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>I am very much aware of the substantial increases in insurance premiums that many businesses are facing and that it is undermining enterprise and job creation.</P>
      <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for insurance companies. EU law prevents me from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks these companies are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of risk.</P>
      <P>The Agreed Programme for Government contains a series of measures aimed at tackling the high cost of insurance, particularly motor and employer liability insurance. These measures include the implementation of the 67 recommendations of the MIAB report, many of which have the potential to impact favourably on employer liability insurance as well; and the establishment of the personal injuries assessment board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social partners have committed themselves <Col N="265" /> in recent partnership proposals to improving health and safety standards in the workplace. As part of this commitment, the workplace safety group, which enjoys the support of the HSA and social partners, is promoting a workplace safety code on safe working and accident prevention. The objectives are to reduce workplace accidents, to encourage injured workers to return at the earliest possible date to the workplace and to improve claims handling procedures, thus reducing insurance costs. The establishment of an office to promote workplace safety with a chief executive and administrative assistant has been proposed. My Department will be involved in providing financial and other assistance towards getting this initiative off the ground.</P>
    <P>Complementary to the measures foreseen by the Government, discussions have taken place with ISME, IBEC, the Irish Insurance Federation and other bodies and enterprises concerning the availability and cost of insurance. I encourage them to develop, in consultation with their clients, innovative strategies for controlling risk.</P>

      <P>Substantial progress has been made in relation to securing new investment in north Dublin.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has been actively engaged in this work and the marketing of vacated premises in Clonshaugh is continuing. IDA Ireland has advised me that three new investment projects are at the final stages of negotiations. These projects will, over a short time, deliver very significant new quality jobs in the area and I hope that announcements can be made in the near future.</P>
      <P>Some significant recruitment has taken place in other north Dublin IDA Ireland assisted companies. For example, Hertz in Swords has just completed recruitment of 250 people, Forest Laboratories has increased its levels of employment by 36 in Clonshaugh and Swords Laboratories (Bristol Myers Squibb) is well advanced in recruiting 350 staff for their expansion project in Swords and their new &euro;400 million pharmaceutical facility at Blanchardstown. Bayer Diagnostics has agreed to invest in a new development centre at Swords with the prospect of up to 50 additional positions being created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland continues to work closely with indigenous businesses in the area to develop their productivity, competitiveness and export potential. It has also been involved in the development of two new community enterprise <Col N="266" /> centres in the area. At present the 20,000 sq. ft. Coolock Community Enterprise Centre is under construction and will provide incubator space for start-up projects. The Balbriggan Enterprise Centre, measuring 20,000 sq. ft., was officially opened on 29 April.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is currently evaluating all applications, including some proposals from Fingal County and North County Dublin, received under the new community enterprise support scheme to support community based small business initiatives. The new funding replaces the existing Enterprise Ireland Community Enterprise Centre support established in 1989.</P>

      <P>Discussions on a proposal for a directive on working conditions for temporary agency workers between the social partners at European Level, ETUC and UNICE, under the provisions of the Social Protocol, began in June 2000. After 11 months of discussion agreement could not be reached due to the inability to agree on how agency workers pay and conditions should be established. Employers' representatives wanted them to be determined in comparison to other agency workers while the unions' representatives wanted such comparisons to be made with the permanent employees in the place of work in which the agency worker was placed.</P>
      <P>The initiative then fell to Commissioner Diamantopoulou &ndash; EU Commissioner for Social Affairs and Employment &ndash; to attempt to move the agenda forward. The European Commission published its formal proposal on 20 March and provided that after a period of six weeks an agency worker could compare himself-herself with the employee in the end-user company.</P>
      <P>At a meeting of the Social Affairs Questions Group held in Brussels on 11 June an initial discussion took place on the Commission's proposal. All member states presented their views. The majority expressed a willingness to find a balance between the need for protection of temporary workers and flexibility for enterprises. Member states sought clarification on a number of Articles contained in the proposal. Ireland raised its objection to the six week period and proposed that a longer period should apply before an agency worker could compare himself-herself with the employee in the end-user company. It is expected that discussion on the draft proposal will continue throughout the second half of this year both in the social affairs questions group and the European Parliament, under the EU co-decision process.</P>
      <P>A further meeting is scheduled for 25 June when detailed scrutiny of each article will get under way.</P>

      <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for insurance companies. EU law prevents me and my Department from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors, both domestic and international, to explain these increases. These include the high cost of settling claims, the general reduction in investment returns, recent court decisions regarding the calculation of compensation losses in per<Col N="269" /> sonal injury cases and the affects of 11 September attacks in the United States. The problem has not been helped by the failure of the UK authorised insurer, Independent Insurance Company Limited, who had a significant presence in the Irish market.</P>
    <P>The Government intends to tackle the high costs of insurance by way of the comprehensive set of measures we have put forward in our Agreed Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>The Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to quickly implement the recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board.</P>
    <P>The implementation group, set up at the end of April, is making good progress on preparation of an action plan to give effect to the 67 recommendations.

    <P>The Agreed Programme for Government also contains a commitment to establish the personal injuries assessment board. Towards that end, I expect to present to Government, in accordance with the usual procedures, the report of the interdepartmental implementation group in the near future. I also confirm that I received the report recently. I intend to make the report public after it has been considered by Government.</P>
    <P>I encourage consumers and insurers to consider ways of reducing the worst effects of the current circumstances. For example, by better management of risks, examination of excess covers and whether the full extent of the covers included in policies is actually required.</P>

      <P>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, also known as the Health and Safety Authority, is the State body charged with overall responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace safety and health. Matters arising from this responsibility are a day-to-day function of the authority.</P>
      <P>Statistical information concerning the number of fatalities and injuries in any work sector is collected by and obtainable from the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" />I have been informed by the authority that there were 22 construction related fatalities in 2001, of which 14 were workers in the construction sector, four were workers in other sectors involved in construction activities and four were members of the public. The number of accidents in the construction sector, resulting in more than three days absence from work, reported to the authority for 2001 is 1,272.</P>
    <P>The number of construction related fatalities reported to date for the period January to mid-June is 11 of which nine were workers in the construction sector, one was a worker in another sector involved in construction activities and one was a member of the public. The number of accidents, resulting in more than three days absence from work, reported to date for the period January to mid-June is 318. In this context it should be noted that there is often a time-lag in the reporting of such accidents.</P>
    <P>The number of reported construction related fatalities for the period January to mid-June 2001 was seven. All of these fatalities were workers in the construction sector. The number of reported accidents resulting in more than three days absence from work for the same period was 618.</P>
    <P>The management of health and safety standards in the construction sector, as in all sectors of employment, requires the fulfilment of their respective responsibilities and duties by all parties concerned. There is already in existence a strong occupational health and safety legislative code, including detailed regulations dealing specifically with the construction sector.</P>
    <P>The partnership approach to safety, as embodied by the Construction Safety Partnership, is crucial in underpinning ongoing improvements in safety standards in the construction sector. The CSP is working to a detailed three year plan to improve safety, health and welfare standards in the construction industry. The plan contains a range of measures to improve safety consultation and safety representation, safety training and the introduction of safety management systems.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment the CSP has overseen significant progress in a number of areas including, most recently, the development of amendments to the construction regulations.</P>
    <P>These legislative amendments took effect on a phased basis from 1 January. They are extremely significant in that they introduce, for the first time, the concepts of mandatory safety training and mandatory safety representation, while also providing for better on-site welfare facilities. A further full review of the construction regulations is taking place under the auspices of the CSP.</P>
    <P>In addition, legislative proposals to amend the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, with particular reference to the issues of offences, penalties, safety representation, safety training and safety management, have been developed at departmental level.</P>
    <P>These proposals have recently received Government approval and, following legal draft<Col N="271" /> ing, it is expected that a safety, health and welfare at work Bill will be published later this year. A strengthened and updated Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, will of course be of benefit to all sectors of employment, including the construction sector.</P>

      <P>The commitment in the programme for Government to encourage a better spread of jobs throughout the country is underpinned by the provisions also contained in the programme relating to ensuring balanced regional development. This chapter sets out an extensive list of policy initiatives which will be pursued in the coming period.</P>
      <P>The relative position of regions, in terms of employment and other variables such as GDP per head, is a very significant determinant of policy, both at EU and national level. These factors determine the focus of policy on matters such as EU Structural Funds and State Aid to enterprise. For example, the maximum approved rate of grants to support new investment in manufacturing and internationally traded service industry in the period 2000 to 2006 for large firms is 40% in the Border, midland and western region and 17.5% in Dublin. The rate in the other four regions in Ireland is currently around 30% and will be around 20% for the period 2004 to 2006.</P>
      <P>Regional emphasis is a strong feature of the various programmes adopted under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and carried out through the Structural Fund Operational Programmes for that period. It is underpinned by the stronger regional emphasis which has been introduced into the work of agencies such as IDA and Enterprise Ireland. The IDA is committed to delivering half of all new greenfield jobs into the BMW region in the coming years, an objective which it is on target to achieve in the period to 2003.</P>
      <P>In 2002 Enterprise Ireland aims to commit in excess of 30% of its financial supports to projects in the BMW region. In supporting the provision of incubator space in the institutes of technology, Enterprise Ireland has recently committed over &euro;14 million to six colleges in the southern and eastern region and &euro;7.9 million to four in the BMW area. Both agencies have re-focused their resources on regions outside Dublin, and particular account is taken of the needs of the regions in matters such as transport, roads and telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="272" />Regional development will continue to be a strong focus of policy. This will be facilitated by the completion of the national spatial strategy which is under way at present. Regional impact will also be one of the main factors to be considered in the mid-term review of the Operational Programmes for 2000 to 2006, to be carried out in 2003.</P>

      <P>The insurance and competition sides in my Department are giving active consideration to having a consultancy study undertaken with a view to a vigorous examination of the competitiveness of the Irish insurance market. Such a study would be reflective of the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to remove unwarranted constraints on competition in all sectors of the economy.</P>
      <P>In the specific case of motor insurance, the MIAB report made it clear that the market for private motor insurance was not competitive. The MIAB was of the view that the imperfect state of the market was such that consumers' concerns were unlikely to be allayed without an investigation by the Competition Authority. The then Minister of State at my Department with responsibility in the area of insurance, Deputy Noel Treacy, referred the MIAB report to the Competition Authority in April. The chairperson and a senior member of the authority met the MIAB last week to discuss the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should point out, at the outset, that the provision of jobs is a <Col N="274" /> day-to-day matter for the development agencies and not one in which I as Minister have a direct function.</P>
      <P>As regards the agencies under my Department, and in particular Enterprise Ireland, projects in the BMW regions can attract more favourable funding across a range of financial supports from Enterprise Ireland than projects in other parts of Ireland. In 2002 it is EI's aim to commit in excess of 30% of its financial supports to projects in the BMW regions. Approximately 25% of EI clients are located in the BMW region.</P>
      <P>Since January 2002 EI has paid a total of &euro;160,184 in funding for projects in the north-west region, with a total of &euro;535,603 having been approved in that same period. An example of a recent success, which EI supported, is the expansion of Transware Plc which will result in the creation of 290 jobs over the next five years, 60 of which are already in place at its Sligo base.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland has also been involved in a wide range of activities which will have a considerable impact on the economy in the north-west, for example: a new community enterprise scheme, launched in April 2002; the proposed establishment of a number of technology hubs, termed &ldquo;webworks&rdquo;; and the investment of &euro;95 million in 12 venture capital funds which will have a dedicated regional focus delivered through four of the funds.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, IDA Ireland has radically changed its policy with a commitment to delivering half of all new greenfield jobs into the Objective One regions in the coming years. IDA Ireland confirmed its commitment to the north-west region in January 2002 when Sligo became one of three towns nationally to be recognised as growth centres for inward investment.</P>
      <P>A number of positive initiatives by IDA Ireland have resulted, the development of which continues in 2002, as follows:</P>
      <P>The two major projects recently announced by Abbott Ireland for the north-west region are progressing. The projects involve the re-development of the company's facility in Donegal Town with an investment of &euro;65 million and also the development of a new Pharma project in Sligo with the creation of 190 new jobs.</P>
      <P>Ongoing investment at other IDA Ireland client companies such as Prumerica Systems Ireland Limited, PacifiCare Health Systems Ireland, MBNA, Kirchhoff Ireland, Boston Scientific Interventional Technologies and Claddagh Resources will all result in additional employment being created in the region.</P>
      <P>On the development of property in the region, the Letterkenny Business Park has been completed and plans are well advanced to extend this park. The Finisklin Business Park has been extended and plans are well advanced also for new lands in Sligo. IDA Ireland is currently marketing two vacant facilities in Sligo, together with a vacant advance building in Carrick-on-Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning permission has been sought for a new <Col N="275" /> facility at Ballyshannon: additional land has been purchased in Buncrana and planning permission has been sought for a 20,000 sq. ft. factory. IDA Ireland is also actively marketing the factories vacated by Fruit of the Loom in Milford, Raphoe and Buncrana.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Voted allocations to the county enterprise boards in Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo for the payment of grants to micro-enterprises has been increased by a total of 10.5% for 2002 over the 2001 figure to assist this important sector to continue to develop and grow in 2002.</P>
    <P>Information on the numbers of jobs created in the north-west region since the start of 2002 to date is not yet available: this information is collected on an annual basis by Forfás and is normally carried out in November of each year.</P>

A total of 5,104 collective redundancies were notified in the first five months of 2002. The equivalent figure for the same period in 2001 was 4,429.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish economy continues to be affected by the deterioration in the international economic environment over the past year which resulted in a weakening of demand growth in our main trading partners. The adverse impact of this was felt especially in sectors which are significant for us, such as the information, communication and technology sector. The signs of recovery in the marketplace, particularly in the US, are a welcome <Col N="279" /> development but industry here will continue to face strong competitive pressures.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to encouraging and supporting foreign-owned and indigenous companies to develop higher productivity and knowledge-based activities, which would be likely to be retained in periods of global rationalisation.</P>
    <P>The agencies of my Department continue to work closely with foreign owned and indigenous companies in enhancing competitiveness and in addressing difficulties arising from job losses, including assistance from FÁS in securing alternative employment or training for workers affected.</P>
    <P>In responding to the current difficult environment, IDA Ireland is focusing, in particular, on achieving a more even geographical distribution of new greenfield investment, increasing the quality of foreign direct investment in existing and new enterprises, and promoting developments in key areas such as infrastructure and skills in order to enhance the business environment.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is implementing measures aimed especially at the retention and the creation of employment in existing indigenous companies, including enhancing the innovation capability through support of research and development in companies and third level institutions, market development supports, the provision of venture capital funds and job creation by entrepreneurs in high potential start-up projects.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 is putting in place the infrastructure required to support enterprise development. Considerable investment in infrastructure in key areas has already taken place, for example, roads, public transport, telecommunications, environment services and energy. This programme of investment is essential to the creation of a competitive environment favourable to the development of enterprise and employment.</P>

      <P>The company was established in 1978 to manufacture heat exchanger coil assemblies for air conditioning and refrigeration equipment. Last year the company agreed to work with Enterprise Ireland to draw up a short list of buyers or equity investors for the business.

    <P>Enterprise Ireland, in conjunction with the other development agencies, will continue to try and source new initiatives in relation to replacement employment for County Louth. Indeed, IDA Ireland has begun site development work at its new business and technology park in Drogheda where it has secured planning permission for a number of new buildings.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is envisaged that a significant information and communications technology and knowledge-based industry sector will be established in the north-east.

      <P>The insurance compensation fund levy was introduced by the Government on 1 January 1984, following the collapse of PMPA in 1983. The levy ceased to apply from 1 January 1993 as it was felt that sufficient funds had been collected to enable the successful completion of the administration of Primor plc &ndash; formerly known as PMPA Insurance plc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Levies were paid by all non-life insurers at a rate of 2% of gross premium income, until 31 <Col N="283" /> December 1991. The rate was reduced to 1% from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1992. Approximately &euro;186 million was collected by way of the levy, which is used to finance the administration of Primor plc. The administrator is continuing to run off claims incurred prior to that date under the name Primor plc.</P>
    <P>The Government levy, which at present applies to insurance policies, is a general stamp duty, the proceeds of which go to the exchequer and not to the Insurance Compensation Fund. Any information in relation to this levy is therefore a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>All persons coming to work in Ireland under the work permit or working visa/work authorisation facilities have the same rights in Irish law as Irish employees in similar circumstances. Furthermore, there is no nationality distinction in our social security framework and workers from overseas have the same entitlements as Irish employees in similar circumstances.</P>
      <P>While persons from non-EEA countries given permission to work in Ireland may be joined by family members after a specific period, this is not accompanied by an automatic permission to work as the persons coming here do so as dependants of a person authorised to work. This is generally in line with international practice. Any proposal to admit potentially large numbers of persons to the labour market by virtue of their family ties rather than on the basis of their skills would obviously require careful consideration.

      <P>I am very much aware of the substantial increases in insurance premiums that many businesses and individuals are facing and of the problems this is creating for them.</P>
      <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is, however, a matter for individual insurance companies. EU law prevents me and the Department from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk.</P>
      <P>The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors, both domestic and international, to explain these increases. These include the high cost of settling claims, the general reduction in investment returns, recent court decisions regarding the calculation of compensation losses in personal injury cases and the effects of the attacks of 11 September in the United States. The situation has not been helped by the failure of the UK authorised insurer, Independent Insurance Company Limited, which had a significant presence in the Irish market.</P>

FÁS will continue to interact with concerned groups involved in the CTP.</P>
      <P>The community training programme, CTP, operated by FÁS incorporates activity previously undertaken as part of the community youth training programme, CYTP, and local training initiatives and has played a useful role in providing training for unemployed people, particularly in locations distant from FÁS training centres.</P>

    <P>There has been a concern that many of the participants on this programme have not been from priority disadvantaged groups. To reflect priority <Col N="286" /> needs, as identified in the FÁS statement of strategy 2002-2005, FÁS has decided to reduce the overall budget of the community training programme by 11% this year. This can be expected to lead to a gradual reduction in the number of individuals participating in the programme.</P>
    <P>However, FÁS proposes to carry out a more fundamental review of the CTP, in consultation with the sponsors, participants, employers and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The review process will address the need for an examination of the operation and purpose of CTP in the current labour market.

      <P>Price control as a policy mechanism has not been pursued by Governments here since the 1980s. It is not effective or appropriate in a modern market economy. Successive Governments have recognised that the promotion of a competitive environment, with greater price transparency coupled with consumer awareness and vigilance, are the best ways of ensuring value for money.</P>
      <P>Regulations are in place that require suppliers of goods and services, including retail outlets, to properly display prices. The European Communities (Requirements to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations, 2001 require retailers to indicate both the final selling price and the unit price for foodstuffs and non-foodstuffs. The objective of these regulations is to facilitate consumers in comparing prices between different brands and sizes of products in any given outlet, and between different outlets.</P>
      <P>Any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour by suppliers of goods or services, including concerted price fixing, should be brought to the attention of the Competition Authority. It is responsible for monitoring and enforcing competition legislation.</P>

      <P>The inter-agency task force was established in August 2001 in response to the impending closure of the Tellabs manufacturing operation in Drogheda. The main focus of the task force is on attracting a replacement industry and the provision of assistance to the Tellabs employees to secure alternative employment. I understand that the vast majority of the former staff of Tellabs have now obtained alternative employment.</P>
      <P>The IDA has introduced a number of potential investors to the town and, in particular, to the vacant Tellabs facility. The IDA is continuing to market the facility for a replacement industry.</P>
      <P>I understand also that Enterprise Ireland is presently in discussions with a number of companies in respect of projects for the town of Drogheda.</P>
      <P>The work of the task force is continuing and I expect to receive its final report in the next few months.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is continuing to promote County Louth for new inward investment. In this regard, it has begun site development works at its new business and technology park in Drogheda where it has secured planning permission for a number of new buildings. The agency has also applied for planning permission for five new advance buildings at Finnabair Business Park in Dundalk. The IDA has advised that a company in Ardee is awaiting the outcome of a third party planning appeal, to begin construction of a new facility.</P>

    <P>Enterprise Ireland's efforts to encourage and <Col N="289" /> assist industry development is focused on export promotion, assisting the development of innovative products, encouraging new business start-ups with significant development potential.

    <P>Louth County Enterprise Board is actively encouraging investment by small enterprises in County Louth.</P>

      <P>I propose to make regulations shortly under the European Communities Act, 1972 to implement Directive 2000/35/EEC of the European Parliament and of the Council on combating late payment in commercial transactions. The deadline for implementation of the directive is 8 August 2002 and the regulations will come into operation on that date. Late payment of debt is harmful to companies and the intention of this legislation is to promote a culture of prompt payment.</P>
      <P>Ireland was one of the first countries in the EU to introduce legislation in this area in 1997. The Prompt Payment of Accounts Act which applies to the public sector only has been in operation for the past five years. The new regulations will apply to all commercial transactions in the public and private sectors. Under the provisions of this new legislation a payment will be regarded as being late if it is unpaid 30 days after the receipt of an invoice or goods unless otherwise specified in a contract. Penalty interest will be payable on debts paid after the relevant payment period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">

      <P>The most recent publication of the Quarterly National Household Survey, (QNHS) for the first quarter of 2002, indicates that unemployment is currently running at 80,000 persons. This represents an increase of 7,400 in the quarter and 14,400 in the year. Those in short-term unemployment &ndash; less than 12 months &ndash; accounted for almost all of the annual increase where the numbers increased by over 13,000. In the first quarter of 2002, the unemployment rate was 4.4%. This compares with 4.0% in the fourth quarter of 2001, and 3.7% in the first quarter of 2001.</P>
      <P>Any increasing trend in the level of unemployment is disappointing but must be viewed in the context of a number of factors. These include the continuing increases in employment, albeit at a less dramatic rate than experienced in the recent past. There were 1,745,500 persons in employment in the first quarter 2002, over 35,600 higher than the first quarter of 2001. On average, employment grew by 2.1% in the year to the first quarter of 2002, compared with an annual increase of 3.6% in the first quarter of 2001.</P>
      <P>As one of the most open economies in Europe and the world, Ireland has been particularly exposed to the downturn in the world economy, most notably in the United States, over the past 18 months. This has manifested itself most notably in the high-tech sector. Despite this exposure Ireland has remained relatively unscathed and the most recent cross-country comparable figures show that our rate of unemployment for 2001, at 3.8%, was exactly half that of the European Union average.</P>
      <P>While there is still uncertainty about the short-term, economists are forecasting that a recovery in the global economy will be under way by later this year. EU forecasts predict that unemployment will rise to 4.5% this year and will remain at similar levels in the medium term. The ESRI forecast an annual average unemployment rate of  4.6% on an ILO basis for 2002 with a forecast of 4.4% for 2003.</P>
      <P>The fundamentals necessary for Ireland to take advantage of any prospective future recovery are in place. Enterprise Ireland and the IDA will continue to explore all avenues with regard to attracting foreign direct investment and stimulating indigenous job creation. FÁS, in tandem with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, will continue with its systematic engagement with those crossing thresholds of duration in unemployment, &ndash; six months for under 25s, and nine months for 25 to 55 year olds &ndash; to establish their suitability for job vacancies, training or other supports. This systematic approach has been very successful in facilitating the speedy reintegration of persons into the labour market, and in preventing the flow from short-term to long-term unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>A wide range of factors impact upon our competitiveness. At international level, the European Union produces a series of competitiveness comparisons such as the European competitiveness report, the enterprise policy scoreboard and the innovation scoreboard in which Irish performance has been top-ranking in terms of GDP growth (first), labour productivity (first), total factor productivity growth (first), lowest administrative burdens for small business, net birth rates for small business (first) etc.</P>
      <P>The World Competitiveness Yearbook 2002, which uses over 300 criteria to measure competitiveness, currently ranks Ireland in tenth place in the international competitiveness league. This is a drop of three places from last year's seventh placing.</P>
      <P>Our own National Competitiveness Council, in its most recent Competitiveness Report (2001), ranked Ireland in first and second place respectively under the headings of economic performance and internationalisation. But the Council also identified areas of concern, which it further elaborated upon in its Competitiveness Challenge Report, such as the rapid acceleration in wages growth and unit labour costs. It also ranked Ireland in 11th place out of 16 in relation to non-labour enterprise costs.</P>
      <P>The recently published data from the CSO, indicating a prevailing inflation level of some 4.7%, is also a shot across the bows which can impact upon our cost base. All of this means that the competitiveness agenda must again come centre stage. But the drivers of our competitiveness in the past, which derived from low wages and taxation as well as a plentiful supply of labour, will not be the same for the period ahead. We certainly have to moderate our costs, but this must be accompanied by a commitment to investment in those factors which enhance our productivity, including a shift to higher added-value knowledge-based activities, capitalising on the application of new technologies, investing in skills and research and development, promoting greater competition and addressing the infrastructural deficits. The measures the Government will be taking to meet these imperatives and secure the success we have attained in recent years are set out in the recently agreed Government programme, particularly under the heading of &ldquo;Sustaining a Strong Economy&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Independent Insurance Company Limited is a UK authorised insurer currently in provisional liquidation. The liquidation process will be dealt with under UK law.</P>
      <P>With regard to Irish policyholders of IICL, my Department has been in contact with the provisional liquidators of IICL and has sought information from them on a number of matters, including the amount of premiums paid to IICL, the overall value of claims made and details in relation to claims still outstanding against companies. Information has been received from them, most of it only in the very recent past and my Department is currently examining it in detail. It is not clear at this stage if the information is complete or whether it can be relied on to give the full picture. Indeed, it may be extremely difficult to obtain final comprehensive information in view of the timescale that can be involved in claims actually being made and in settlement amounts being arrived at.</P>
      <P>My Department has also been in contact with the UK Insurance Supervisory Authority &ndash; the Financial Services Commission &ndash; and with the UK Treasury Department in relation to our concerns regarding Irish policyholders with IICL. Irish policyholders with claims outstanding against IICL are creditors of that insurance company and should pursue their case with the provisional liquidators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that some Irish businesses are fac<Col N="293" /> ing difficulties as a result of the failure of IICL and I would be very concerned that any jobs would be lost as a result. However, I do not consider it acceptable to burden Irish taxpayers with the inevitable cost that would be involved in meeting insurance claims, resulting from the failure of this UK company.</P>

      <P>The Insurance Compensation Fund levy was introduced on 1 January 1984 following the collapse of PMPA in 1983. The levy ceased to apply from 1 January 1993 as it was felt that sufficient funds had been collected to enable the successful completion of the administration of Primor plc (formerly known as PMPA Insurance plc).</P>
      <P>The administrator is continuing to run off claims incurred prior to that date under the name Primor plc. Approximately &euro;23 million remains in the fund. The insurance compensation fund is under the control of the High Court. It may only be drawn down in the event of a liquidation of an Irish-authorised non-life insurance company. Should such an event occur, affected policyholders would of course be made aware of the arrangements.</P>

They advised him that the records sought did not come within the scope of relevant provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, except in so far as the request related to personal information, as provided for in the Act. In this regard, he was advised that he could have access to all personal information contained in his file for the period in question.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the FOI Act, the individual, through his legal representatives, exercised his right to appeal the decision to the designated FOI internal appeals officer in the Defence Forces. The appeal was considered by the relevant officer, who upheld the initial decision. This decision was issued in writing to the applicant's legal representatives on 20 July 1998. Copies of the records which were deemed by the military decision makers to come within the scope of the FOI Act were forwarded to his then legal representatives in July 1998. When conveying his decision in relation to the internal review of the decision, the internal appeals officer advised the applicant of his statutory right of further appeal to the Information Commissioner, who is an independent officer with statutory powers to review decisions made by public bodies in relation to FOI applications. I understand that in July 1998, such an appeal was lodged in this case with the Office of the Information Commissioner. Such appeals are a matter for the Office of the Information Commissioner. However, I understand that the case was suspended in July, 1998 at the request of the applicant's then legal representatives and was subsequently discontinued by the Information Commissioner's Office in 1999, due to the subsequent non-pursuance of the matter by the individual concerned and his legal representatives at that time.</P>

      <P>Arising from a recommendation made in 1990 by the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces (the Gleeson Commission), military service allowance was made pensionable in the case of personnel retiring on or after August 1990. This approach was fully consistent with settled public service pensions policy which provides that the benefit of an allowance being made pensionable for serving personnel does not extend to existing pensioners.</P>
      <P>More recently, the Commission on Public Service Pensions specifically addressed the issue of the pensionability of allowances, including the MSA, and the consequences for public service pensioners generally in its final report which was published in January 2001. However, having considered the arguments advanced by the groups affected, together with long-standing public service pensions policy in that context and the substantial cost implications involved, the Commission did not recommend any increase for the pensioners concerned. No change in existing policy on this matter has been authorised.</P>
      <P>I should say that the Commission, whose report is the first comprehensive examination of public service pension arrangements since the foundation of the State, was an independent body. It had invited submissions from interested parties through an advertisement in the national press in September 1996 and I understand that groups representative of military pensioners were among those who made submissions and were met by the Commission.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 172, 177, 196 and 204 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international market situation for milk <Col N="298" /> products entered a period of decline in the third quarter of 2001 and this decline has deepened since then. Demand is weak for all products in all markets, primarily due to the economic slowdown in key international economies.</P>
    <P>In an effort to stimulate renewed demand I have pressed the EU Commission continuously for decisive action utilising all the market mechanisms available at EU level for this purpose. In the past month I have exerted particularly strong pressure on the Commission and I have put a range of proposals to Commissioner Fischler. These included the need to adopt a more aggressive export refunds policy, to prolong intervention for skim milk powder &ndash; SMP &ndash; and to encourage greater utilisation of internal supports. I am pleased that the Commission has responded to my proposals by increasing export refunds for cheese by 15%, further increasing SMP and whole milk powder &ndash; WMP &ndash; export refunds by 10% and 5% respectively, increasing aid for the manufacture of casein by 52% and agreeing to continue intervention for SMP in excess of the threshold of 109,000 tonnes by means of a tendering system.</P>
    <P>These initiatives, taken in the past few weeks, follow a number of actions taken at EU level since the current market deterioration became evident last November. Export refunds for SMP and WMP were increased on five separate occasions, and together with the latest increase now stand at &euro;715 and &euro;1,078 per tonne respectively. Export refunds for butter were increased twice to their current level of &euro;1,750 per tonne and private storage aid was introduced for both butter and cheese.</P>
    <P>In addition, the main internal support measures such as aids for the use of butter in the ice cream and pastry sector and aid for the use of SMP in animal feed continue to take up significant quantities. I am fully aware of the situation and I will continue to closely monitor the market for dairy products in order to ensure that every possible action is taken at community level to stimulate demand and to protect the incomes of dairy farmers.</P>

      <P>My Department does not have responsibility for the cleansing, maintenance, repair or restoration of river banks or embankments. However, arising from the acquisition of certain estates, the former Irish Land Commission retained a portion of the purchase money for the ongoing maintenance and upkeep of embankments and sluices on those estates. These retained funds were entrusted to the Public <Col N="299" /> Trustee, who is now an officer of my Department. The Public Trustee has responsibility for the investment of these funds and the income earned may be applied for the specific purposes described in the trust deed for each estate. In the context of an ongoing or perpetual trust, it is established practice that the capital sum should not be used for general repairs except in exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>In relation to the site in question, a small trust fund was set up for the upkeep of embankments and other works on the E. H. Davies Estate. Local trustees were appointed and they may apply to the Public Trustee to release funds to cover maintenance work. Over the years funds have been released, as appropriate. This fund covers a large area of embankments and my Department is attempting to get local agreement as to the proportion of the fund that should be used in any particular location.</P>

      <P>The animal health requirements for dairy cows are set out in Directive 92/46/EEC and in the Statutory Instrument No. 9 of 1996 and the certificate reflects this. Individual veterinarians must, of course, use their own professional judgment when certifying individual herds. Inspection and certification of dairy herds has already been carried out on a countrywide basis.</P>
      <P>As regards the national beef assurance scheme, the position is that the traceability elements have been fully operational since January 2000. It was envisaged that other elements of this scheme would be undertaken this year in tandem with the annual round of testing. In this regard, detailed discussions took place with Veterinary Ireland and its predecessor organisation over a long period concerning the arrangements for the inspection of farms. A Protocol for the conduct of the inspections was agreed with both Veterinary Ireland and the representative farming organisations late last year. There was also agreement that the inspections should be carried out by the testing veterinary surgeon at the time of the annual herd test. However while arrangements were put in place to have inspections under the scheme commenced in March in tandem with the 2002 annual round of testing, only a small number of inspections have taken place to date because of resistance to implementation of the scheme mainly by veterinarians whose union is seeking a centralised payment system the costs involved.</P>
      <P>In this context, the legislation passed by the Oireachtas establishing the scheme clearly provides that the cost of securing a certificate of approval is the responsibility of the applicant. In addition, the Exchequer has already invested some &euro;43 million in developing the cattle identification and tracing system that underpins the scheme, and costs continue to be incurred under this heading.</P>
      <P>The national beef assurance scheme was designed to provide additional assurances to consumers and customers of Irish beef by demonstrating strict implementation of high standards across the production chain. The scheme is an important element in the drive to maintain marketplace in a sector recovering from serious difficulty. I am disappointed with the attitude of Veterinary Ireland and I would strongly urge them again to lend their full support to the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a requirement of the Council regulations governing both the 1994 early retirement scheme and the scheme introduced in 2000 that the early retirement pension is paid as a supplement to any national retirement pension to which the participant in the scheme is, or becomes, entitled. Consequently the amount of any national retirement pension must be deducted from the early retirement pension. This requirement was set out in both schemes. The attention of applicants was further drawn to it in the guidelines which my Department published to accompany the 1994 scheme, and it is also highlighted in the introduction to the new scheme document. As the matter is the subject of a specific provision in the relevant EU Council Regulations, it is not one in which my Department has discretion.</P>
      <P>The rate of pension payable under the 1994 early retirement scheme is the maximum provided for in the EU Council Regulation under which the scheme was introduced. As regards the current scheme which commenced in November 2000, and which forms part of the CAP rural development plan for the period 2000-2006, my Department's proposals to the EU Commission included provision for annual increases in pension over the period of the plan. The Commission rejected this proposal and insisted that a fixed rate be set instead. My Department then proposed a rate that was the average of the scale initially proposed. This was acceptable to the Commission and is the rate provided for in the new scheme.</P>

      <P>The owners of sheep flocks which were depopulated as a result of scrapie prior to Christmas 2001 have been paid compensation on the basis of an agreement reached at that time between my Department and IFA, representing the farmers concerned. There were particular circumstances which gave rise to an adjustment in compensation for one flockowner whose sheep were depopulated in the period in question.</P>
      <P>As regards the remaining flockowners, the terms of the agreement and the amount of compensation involved were clearly understood and accepted by all concerned at the time of depopulation. It is not proposed to vary the terms of payment applicable to particular categories of animals depopulated under the agreement.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for an allocation of suckler cow quota from the 2002 national reserve under category D. This category, which ranked fourth in priority after category A for young farmers under 35 years of age, category B &ndash; farmers with holdings on off-shore islands and category C &ndash; organic farmers, was reserved for farmers who were regular applicants for the suckler cow premium scheme but who required additional quota to ensure the viability of their holdings.</P>
      <P>The amount of quota available for distribution was 2,598 premium rights and all of this was distributed to eligible farmers under categories A, B and C. Because of the scarcity of quota, not all eligible applicants under category C received an allocation. There was, therefore, no quota available for distribution to any eligible applicants under category D.</P>
      <P>The person named may apply for an allocation of quota from the 2003 national reserve and I have arranged to have an application form sent to him when the forms become available in late July.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Commission Decision 2001/9/EC of 22 May 2001 permits the movement of such processed animal proteins between member states and to <Col N="307" /> third countries once certain conditions are fulfilled and provided they are not destined for uses prohibited by Article 3(1)(a) of Council Decision 2000/766/EC, which forbids the trade of processed animal proteins intended for the feeding of farmed animals which are kept, fattened or bred for the production of food.</P>
    <P>Stocks of meat and bone meal are currently stored under my Department's supervision and control. Some of these stocks are being exported to the continent for incineration, as provided for by Commission Decision 97/735/EC of 21 October 1997.

    <P>In view of the expense involved, my Department is keeping under review all possible other means of disposal, and a number of possibilities including its use in industry and energy production are being examined.</P>

This resulted in this animal being rejected from the claim with a consequential reduction penalty to be applied on the 38 remaining animals.

      <P>The person named has received full slaughter premium payments in respect of four animals slaughtered under the herd number quoted, which is held in joint ownership, during 2001. The person named also received a national envelope top-up payment in respect of one heifer under that herd number.</P>
      <P>The person named had nine other animals slaughtered during the period July to September 2001 under a separate herd number that was cancelled in March 2001. The person named was requested to have the herd number details at the slaughter plant amended to reflect the correct herd number. To date this has not been done and it is therefore necessary for the Department to transfer the details to the new herd number. Slaughter premium payment will issue on eight of these nine animals as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>There is an outstanding query on one animal, the tag number of which has been notified to the person named, in relation to the slaughter status of the animal on the CMMS, cattle movement monitoring system. Payment will issue on this animal as soon as the slaughter of this animal has been confirmed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Recent data indicates that aggregate farm income has recovered following a number of difficult years in the late 1990s. Aggregate farm income rose by 5.8% in 2001 with an increase of 7.5% being recorded in 2000. Based on the Central Statistics Office national quarterly household survey, my Department estimates that the average income per person employed in agriculture increased by 16% in 2001.</P>
      <P>Farm incomes are of central concern to me as Minister. My Department operates a range of policies including market supports under the Common Agricultural Policy and EU direct payments formed 56% of aggregate income in the year 2001 totalling &euro;1.4b. The Agri-Food 2010 plan of action sets out the Government's vision for the future of the sector. The plan of action envisages a dynamic agri-food sector in 2010 offering farm families attractive and sustainable livelihood options, thus maintaining the maximum number of people on the land.</P>
      <P>I am aware that low income remains a difficulty for some farm families. The revised National Anti-Poverty Strategy, NAPS, launched by the Government in February 2002, includes a specific focus on addressing rural poverty and disadvantage. Its objective is to tackle social exclusion in rural areas in a comprehensive and sustained manner by ensuring the provision of an adequate income, through employment and income support, access to adequate services and infrastructure on a timely basis, co-ordination of responses and empowerment of local people and communities.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the necessary policy framework, underpinned by both national and EU funding, is in place, together with appropriate monitoring and review arrangements, to ensure viability of the maximum number of farm households. I do not therefore consider that the establishment of a commission on farm income is required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current situation is that bed and breakfast establishments charge VAT at the reduced rate of 12.5%. There is provision within the EU Sixth VAT Directive to apply a reduced rate of VAT which could be as low as 5% for &ldquo;accommodation provided by hotels and similar establishments including provision of holiday accommodation and the letting of camping sites and caravan parks&rdquo;. If there was a change in the current VAT treatment of bed and breakfast accommodation, this would have to be extended to all tourist rented accommodation, such as hotels, since a different rate of VAT for bed and breakfast as opposed to other forms of tourist accommodation would create a tax-based comparative advantage for one part of the tourism rented sector.</P>
      <P>I believe that the introduction of a lower rate of VAT for bed and breakfast accommodation would also lead to pressure for the rate to apply to all activities which could benefit from such a second reduced rate, such as housing, some foods, certain pharmaceuticals and newspapers. If all activities which could be taxed at a reduced rate were taxed at 5%, this would mean a loss of revenue for the Government of at least &euro;500 million. In view of the potential Exchequer costs of introducing any new reduced rate, I cannot agree to make any change to the rate of VAT on bed and breakfast accommodation. As the Deputy will appreciate, every year I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new rates or the extension of existing ones. However, tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and funding available for other projects.</P>

      <P>Charities and non-profit groups are exempt under the EU Sixth VAT Directive with which Irish VAT law must comply. This means they do not charge VAT on their services and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase. Essentially only VAT registered businesses which charge VAT are able to recover VAT. There are no provisions in the EU Sixth VAT Directive which would allow for any refund of VAT to exempt bodies. I would point out, however, that charities already enjoy relief from most taxes. Furthermore, in the Finance Act, 2001, I provided for a new scheme of tax relief for donations to charities. This is a generous scheme which has, I understand, already been of significant benefit to them.</P>

      <Quest>the steps which were taken to identify all contributory factors in the flooding at East Wall-North Strand areas of Dublin 3 on 1 February 2002; and the counter measures being taken to reduce future risk of flooding in this area.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Deputy's information I would like to state that the Office of Public Works has an ongoing programme of flood relief schemes which are carried out under the Arterial Drainage Acts, 1945 and 1995. There is a detailed planning and consultation process set out in the Acts and it can take several years for a scheme to move from initiation to completion. The current programme does not include any schemes in the areas referred to by the Deputy. Apart from schemes carried out under the Acts, the Office of Public Works does, in some cases, provide technical advice, assistance and funding to local authorities who wish to carry out flood relief works under their own authority.</P>
      <P>The flooding referred to by the Deputy was due to abnormal and exceptionally high tides. The tide levels in Dublin were higher than the floods of 1924, when the previous highest tide in Dublin Port was recorded. Rainfall was not a significant influencing factor. The tidal surge was caused by a combination of wind and low atmospheric pressure and it has been calculated that, statistically, the event had a return period of 750 years. I understand that city council staff prepared an interim assessment report which was presented to Dublin City Council, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Office of Public Works in February 2002. This report outlined the impact which resulted in the flooding of 1000 houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The City Council's analysis indicated that flooding in the East Wall-North Strand area was primarily occasioned by escape of water from the Royal Canal in its inter-tidal area. The protection of the area from future flooding has been raised by the city council with Waterways Ireland, who have responsibility for the Royal Canal. The impact of the flooding appears to have been <Col N="315" /> exacerbated by the collapse of boundary walls on CIE marshalling yards and a new rail bridge constructed by CIE over the Royal Canal.</P>
    <P>I understand that to reduce further risk of flooding in this area, the city council is pursuing the following matters:</P>
    <P>&ndash;Strategic Coastal Zone Risk Assessment Study:</P>
    <P>The process of procuring a consultant to prepare an overall risk assessment study for the city has commenced. This will include the East Wall-North Strand area. Funding for the study has been requested by the city council from the Office of Public Works. This, together with the question of funding of other works and studies in the Ringsend area, is under consideration by my Department.</P>
    <P>&ndash;River Tolka Flood Study:</P>
    <P>A separate study is currently under way, funded by the Office of Public Works, on the River Tolka to identify areas at risk. The output from this study will identify any risks and mitigation measures. The study will be completed towards the end of this year.</P>
    <P>&ndash;Major Emergency Plan Review:</P>
    <P>A review of the activation of the major emergency plan for the city was carried out with all the statutory agencies to streamline deployment of resources and personnel in any future emergency.</P>

      <P>An agreement entered into with a union negotiating on behalf of the secretarial assistant grades in 1997 contains provisions that enable Deputies to enter into a contract of employment with their secretarial assistants for the duration of a Dáil. Arrangements were recently instituted under <Col N="316" /> which persons employed as secretarial assistants, administrative assistants, or administrators who cease to be so employed as a result of post-electoral changes, or persons choosing to leave such employment, would be offered a payment of a lump-sum based on length of service. Such a payment would be conditional on the person ceasing to be paid not later than 28 June 2002 and subject to certain other conditions. The scheme will not continue beyond the date specified in the case of staff working for Deputies and political parties or, in the case of their counterparts employed by or on behalf of Senators, two weeks after the Seanad elections. Eligibility for payments under the Redundancy Payment Acts, 1967 to 2001, is determined by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I have no function in the matter.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the inspector of taxes has carried out a review of the taxpayer's liability. According to the information available to the inspector of taxes, the taxpayer did not pay income tax in the 1998/99 or 1999/00 tax years. As a result of a review of the taxpayer's liability for the 2000/01 tax year, a repayment of £395.71, &euro;502.45, was made to the taxpayer on 5 October 2001. A review of the taxpayer's liability for the 2001 short tax year resulted in repayments of £103.32, &euro;131.19, on 15 November 2001 and &euro;129.78, £102.21, on 22 January 2002. There are no further refunds due to the taxpayer at present.</P>

      <P>The imposition of VAT is governed by EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, member states may retain the zero rates they had in place on 1 January 1991, but they are prohibited from introducing new zero rates. Broadly speaking, the zero rate covers children's clothing of sizes up to and including 32&rdquo; chest or 26&rdquo; waist; other sizes are liable for VAT at the standard rate of 21%. The standard rate of VAT applies to all adult clothing including protective clothing for motorcyclists.</P>
      <P>Due to the requirement of EU VAT law, which prohibits the introduction of any new zero rates, it is not possible to extend existing zero rates to adult clothing. Therefore, it would not be possible to exempt protective clothing for motorcyclists from VAT.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayers are jointly assessed for income tax purposes. The inspector of taxes has reviewed their income tax liability for the 1998/99 tax year. The review established that the taxpayers' total income for the year, which consisted of their employment income and the second-named taxpayer's unemployment benefit, a taxable payment, and redundancy payment, was liable to tax at the standard rate of 24%. As the taxpayer's redundancy payment was taxed at the higher rate of 46%, a refund of &euro;857.85 is due. A cheque for this amount will be issued shortly.</P>
      <P>Top slicing relief ensures that a lump sum payment is not taxed at a rate higher than the average rate of tax paid by the taxpayer in the previous five years. As the second-named taxpayer's redundancy payment was liable only at the standard rate of tax, which rate was lower than the average rate of tax in the previous five years, top-slicing relief does not arise in this case.</P>

No 353 of 1994), copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The six types of disablement are as follows:</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;persons who are wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to movement of their lower limbs;</P>

      <P>(<i>f</i>)&nbsp;persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
      <P>The total number of beneficiaries under the scheme is currently in the region of 7,500. The cost of the reliefs, excluding the annual road tax costs, in 2001 was approximately &euro;30.5 million, compared to &euro;5.1 million in 1994. The cost of the scheme, again excluding the annual road tax costs, is estimated to be in the region of &euro;38 million in 2002. Beneficiaries, once qualified, are eligible for life. A review of the scheme by an interdepartmental review group which is chaired by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is ongoing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 221 to 223, inclusive, and 225 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that, in accordance with section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, an individual can claim tax relief for un-reimbursed expenses incurred in the provision of health care. The first &euro;125 of expenses incurred in respect of a claim in respect of an individual and the first &euro;250 of expenses incurred in respect of a claim relating to two or more individuals are excluded from the scope of the relief. The relief is available at the claimant's marginal rate of tax. An individual may apply for the relief by submitting a completed Med 1 form to the inspector of taxes after 31 December in the year in which the expenditure occurred.</P>
      <P>Claims may be made by an individual in respect of his/her own expenses, expenses met for a spouse, dependant and certain other relatives or a child who is not a relative, but is in the custody of and is maintained by the individual, or an individual whether they are a relative or not who is aged 65 or over or who is permanently incapacitated.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the following qualifies for relief:</P>
      <P>services of a doctor/consultant; drugs or medicines prescribed by a doctor on prescription; maintenance or treatment in a hospital or an approved nursing home; routine maternity care; educational psychological assessment for a qualifying child; speech and language therapy carried out by a speech and language therapist for a qualifying child; transport by ambulance; orthoptic or similar treatment prescribed by a doctor; physiotherapy or similar treatment prescribed by a practitioner; diagnostic procedures prescribed by a practitioner; expenses incurred on any medical, surgical or nursing appliance on the advice of a practitioner; and in the case of kidney patients, expenses up to a maximum amount for individuals on the use of hospital dialysis, home dialysis or CAPD.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to dental expenses, relief is not avail<Col N="320" /> able on expenditure incurred on routine dental expenses such as the scaling, extraction and filling of teeth or the provision of artificial teeth or dentures. Where an individual wishes to submit a claim in respect of dental treatment a form Med 2 should be completed by a dentist and submitted together with the Med 1. However, the following non-routine dental expenses are allowable:</P>
    <P>crowns; veneers/rembrant type etched fillings; tip replacing; gold posts; gold inlays; endodontics (root canal treatment); periodontal treatment; orthodontic treatment; surgical extraction of impacted wisdom teeth in hospital and by a dentist in a dentist's surgery and bridgework.</P>
    <P>The cost of rent or purchase of a medical appliance used on the advice of a medical practitioner is an allowable expense. Support clothing used on the advice of a medical practitioner would, in general, be considered an appliance for the purposes of section 469. A qualifying appliance must be used to prevent, alleviate or treat the &lsquo;ailment, injury, defect or disability' from which the individual is suffering.</P>
    <P>On the question of whether payments made to general practitioners in all cases may be claimed against tax on the MED1 form, the position is that to the extent that payments made to general practitioners fall within the scope of section 469, then they may be claimed against tax using the MED1 form. In effect, while payments to general practitioners for most of the usual diagnostic or treatment services which they provide can, generally speaking, be claimed against income tax, it is not possible to say that payments to general practitioners in all cases can be so claimed.</P>
    <P>A general practitioner is taxable on the profits or gains from his or her profession. No system of norms or averaging is used in calculating income or tax. A general practitioner is obliged to make an annual return of income. These returns are subject to the self-assessment regime and are subject to revenue audit in selected cases.</P>
    <P>The services provided by a general practitioner come within the definition of &lsquo;professional services' for the purpose of professional services withholding tax. Therefore, payments made to a general practitioner by an accountable person will be made net of professional services withholding tax at the standard rate (currently 20%). Accountable persons are public bodies including the GMS, and health insurers, including VHI and BUPA.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in the Finance Act, 2001, the various tax reliefs for third level education were merged into a single relief and the relief was considerably widened. Generally speaking, the new relief now covers fees paid by undergraduate students in Ireland and elsewhere in the EU. It also applies to fees paid by postgraduate students both here and abroad. Undergraduate courses, which may be full or part-time, must be of at least two academic years duration while postgraduate courses must be of at least one, but not more than four, academic years duration. Tax relief is also available in respect of fees paid for training courses, of less than two years duration, in the areas of information technology and EU languages.</P>
      <P>Tuition fees paid by an individual on his or her own behalf or on behalf of a spouse, child or person for whom the individual is the legal guardian all qualify for relief, which is available at the standard rate of tax. No relief is available for any part of fees which are met directly or indirectly by grants, scholarships, an employer or otherwise.</P>
      <P>The maximum relief that can be claimed is set by the Minister for Education and Science. It is currently &euro;3,175 per year in respect of third level fees. In the case of fees for training courses in EU languages and information technology, the maximum relief is set at &euro;1,270 per annum and no relief is due where the fees for the course are less than &euro;315. Given the recent improvements made to the scheme, I have no plans at this stage to make any further changes.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the campaign currently being run by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group. The current VAT treatment of charitable organisations is based on EU VAT law, with which Irish law must comply. Under the Sixth VAT Directive, a wide range of charitable and voluntary activities are deemed to be exempt for VAT purposes. This means that the organisations involved do not charge VAT on their services but, as a necessary corollary, they are unable to recover the VAT they bear on the goods and services that they purchase in the course of their activities. There is no provision in EU VAT law for any refund of VAT to exempt bodies such as those represented by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has been actively responding to the unfolding food crisis in southern Africa which has already had a severe impact on the vulnerable people of Malawi. It continues to threaten millions of others across Lesotho, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe and is set to worsen in the weeks ahead. An initial allocation of &euro;1.2 million has already been made to help cover immediate needs in Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The Government is working closely with its Irish NGO and other implementing partners in building on this initial response. We are also monitoring the situation closely through our missions in Zambia, Mozambique, Lesotho and South Africa. The Government's overall response is, therefore, set to deepen considerably during the critical weeks ahead.</P>
      <P>This latest food crisis is the outcome of unusually dry climatic conditions which have resulted in crop failure and low crop yields over consecutive growing seasons. It is also being attributed to bad governance and the mismanagement of grain reserves. We are now in a situation where regional grain stocks in southern Africa are exceptionally low, having already been drawn upon to meet last year's shortages. The situation is worsened by the heavy impact which the HIV-AIDS pandemic and recent conflict are already having in the region. A joint assessment mission by the World Food Programme and the Food and Agricultural Organisation estimates that 7.7 million people will require food aid during June to August while 12.8 million will need assistance by March of next year, almost half of them in Zimbabwe. The immediate corn deficit for southern Africa is expected to be in excess of two million tonnes. Ireland is paying particular attention to the situation in Zimbabwe which is expected to account for 56% of the total emergency food aid requirement. That country is particularly ill-equipped to cope with the food emergency due to its protracted political and economic crises. For its part, the European Commission has granted &euro;6.5 million in food aid to Zimbabwe along with an additional 95,000 tonnes of food aid worth &euro;29 million to Malawi.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is working closely with other members of the international community in an effort to adopt clear strategies on how best immediate food needs can be addressed at both the national and regional levels. An EU declaration on the food crisis in southern Africa was successfully tabled by Ireland and unanimously adopted at the EU Development Council in Brussels on 30 May. Ireland also took part in the special regional meeting on humanitarian needs in southern Africa hosted jointly by the WFP and the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Johannesburg on 6-7 June. We have urged a strong and early international response to the crisis at the recent World Food <Col N="326" /> Summit in Rome. I have personally raised the matter with other EU Ministers at the meeting of the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 17 June.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to advance the necessary humanitarian responses to this crisis and will support the regional emergency appeal being prepared by the WFP following the special meeting in Johannesburg. We will substantially deepen our support for the vulnerable populations of Zimbabwe and other countries of southern Africa in the critical weeks and months ahead. At the same time, we will seek to ensure that the necessary sectoral, management and other reforms are put in place to address the underlying causes of food insecurity in southern Africa with lasting effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of an additional 175 professional therapy training places to tackle the shortage of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists was announced on 29 May 2002. These places are being provided in response to the recommendations set out in the report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists, which was launched in July 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent announcement follows on the work of an interagency group comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Higher Education Authority, which was established to ensure the provision of the additional places and which considered proposals from third level institutions for the expansion of existing courses and/or the introduction of new courses, including graduate entry programmes, in response to the training needs identified in the Bacon report. The distribution <Col N="327" /> of the additional places in speech and language therapy is as follows: University College Cork, National University of Ireland, Cork, 25 places, Bachelor of Science in Speech and Language Therapy; National University of Ireland, Galway, 25 places, Bachelor of Science in Speech and Language Therapy; and University of Limerick, 25 places, Master of Science in Speech and Language Therapy.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the first intake to these courses will commence in the 2002-03 academic year. While responsibility for the provision of speech therapy services to school going pupils is a matter for the relevant health board, such services are an essential part of the support programme required in schools for pupils with specific speech and language disorders.</P>
    <P>The sanctioning of speech and language units is contingent on the availability of speech and language therapists. There are currently in the region of 56 speech and language units attached to mainstream schools nationwide and additional units will be provided on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>Architectural planning for school building projects in County Meath where design teams have been appointed and where building work has not yet commenced will continue until the relevant projects are ready to proceed to tender.</P>
      <P>Decisions on projects proceeding to tender and construction are taken in the light of the annual allocation for primary school buildings, the financial commitments to be met and the priority to be afforded to individual projects. As the rate of progress of school building projects to the point where tenders can be invited varies considerably depending on the size and complexity of the work envisaged, it is not possible to give precise dates for the commencement of work on site.</P>
      <P>Later this year, when a financial allocation has been made for the primary school building programme in the 2003 Estimates, I will be framing a further comprehensive programme of works that will proceed to construction. It is also my intention to bring greater transparency to the operation of the school building programme and I intend to publish the programme annually.</P>

      <P>The new disadvantage programme, Giving Children An Even Break, was launched last year to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils are being supported, where necessary, over the three-year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes &ndash; infants through second class &ndash; and a pupil teacher ratio of 27:1 in senior classes &ndash; third through sixth classes.</P>
      <P>Schools participating in Giving Children An Even Break are eligible to receive a range of additional supports, including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. Schools already in receipt of additional resources under the disadvantaged areas scheme, including the school in question, will retain their entitlements under that scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the disadvantaged areas scheme, the school in question is benefiting from the services of a shared disadvantaged concessionary teacher and a shared home-school-community liaison teacher. The school also qualifies for special supplementary capitation funding at the rate of &euro;38.09 per pupil and a refund of the television licence fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is also <Col N="329" /> included in the urban dimension of Giving Children An Even Break. The school is eligible to receive &euro;3,230 in respect of the current school year, towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned. This funding is in addition to the &euro;7,047 that the school received under the disadvantaged areas scheme for the current school year.</P>
    <P>In line with normal staffing arrangements for national schools, teacher post allocations for the purpose of Giving Children An Even Break in respect of the 2002-03 school year will be determined by reference to enrolments in junior and senior classes at 30 September 2001. In order to enable the school in question to adhere to the maximum class size guidelines for all junior and senior classes in selected schools under the urban dimension of Giving Children An Even Break, the school's current complement of one Giving Children An Even Break teaching post will remain in place for the 2002-03 school year. For the selected schools to adhere to the maximum class size guidelines under Giving Children An Even Break it may necessitate the formation of classes from mixed standards.</P>
    <P>The school referred to by the Deputy has been reminded that my Department allocates adequate staffing to schools to ensure that the maximum class size guidelines are implemented in both the junior and senior classes. If the school in question is unable to operate within the maximum class size guidelines in the 2002-03 school year they may make a submission on the matter to my Department.</P>

      <P>The mainstream staffing of a national school for a particular school year is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year. This is in accordance with an agreement on staffing entered into between the Government and the education partners. The enrolment of this school on 30 September 2001 was 212 pupils. This figure was incorrectly returned earlier as 208 pupils leading to some confusion with regard to the loss of the eighth mainstream class teacher. I wish to confirm that the staffing at St. Joseph's national school for the 2002-03 school year will remain unchanged from the 2001-02 school year.</P>

      <P>Part-time special needs assistants are contracted to deliver a specified number of hours service per week in the schools in which they are employed and are paid accordingly. The duration of the service provided is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual children in respect of whom the special needs assistant support is allocated. Special needs assistants employed on a part-time basis are paid at an hourly rate. Under current legislation, 8% of total earnings are paid to each part-time special needs assistant in respect of holiday pay.</P>
      <P>I am very much aware of the vital role which special needs assistants play in the special education system. My Department has no plans at present to pay part-time special needs assistants through the holiday periods.</P>

      <P>The authorities of Scoil Mhuire, Kilsheelan, have applied for grant aid towards an extension to their existing building. My Department has an extensive primary school building programme under way at present and this includes a large number of projects at various stages of architectural planning.

      <P>Later this year, when a financial allocation has been made for the primary school building programme in the 2003 Estimates, I will be framing a further comprehensive programme of works and this will involve putting more projects into architectural planning. The accommodation needs of the school in question will be considered at that time. In the meantime, the primary building unit of my Department has given approval to the school authorities to appoint a consultant architect to report on essential works required at the school. When this report is received the matter will be progressed further.</P>

This is in accordance with an agreement on staffing entered into between the Government and the education partners.

      <P>The revised programme for basic pre-registration nurse education and training which was introduced in October 1994 and fully oper<Col N="345" /> ational since 1998, is at present funded by the Department of Health and Children. Successful completion of the three-year programme leads to a diploma in nursing studies and students are eligible to register with An Bord Altranais for employment as a nurse. While undertaking the diploma programme, the students' fees are paid by the relevant health agency.</P>
      <P>In 2001 the Government approved the implementation of a new four-year undergraduate pre-registration nursing degree programme commencing in the academic year 2002-03. Accordingly, with effect from the 2002-03 academic year, students pursuing the bachelor of science degree in nursing will be eligible to benefit under the free fees initiative, whereby the State meets the tuition fees of students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, subject to the terms and conditions of that initiative.</P>
      <P>With effect from the 2002-03 academic year, the bachelor of science degree in nursing will also be an approved course for the purposes of the higher education maintenance grants scheme and the vocational education scholarship scheme. Under the terms of the grants schemes, a mature student is defined as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course.</P>
      <P>Mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his/her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
      <P>When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not a mature student.</P>

      <P>As previously outlined in the reply given by my predecessor, Deputy Woods, to Parliamentary Question No. 737 of 17 April 2002, the terms of the third level maintenance grant scheme for trainees, 2001, the TLT scheme, allow for the payment of registration fees up to &euro;396 where a student qualifies for a maintenance grant by reference to the prescribed upper income limits. There is no provision within the terms of the existing scheme to allow for the refund of the registration charge where a student does not qualify for a maintenance grant and, accordingly, the student referred to by the Deputy is not eligible for grant assistance towards the cost of his registration fee.</P>
      <P>The schemes of student support are reviewed by my Department annually and revised as necessary. The question of amending the terms of the TLT scheme to allow, subject to a prescribed upper income limit, for the payment of the registration fee in cases where a maintenance grant is not payable is being considered in the context of the review of the 2002 scheme.</P>

      <P>Recognised third level qualifications, together with the higher diploma in education, would normally allow the holders to be appointed <Col N="347" /> to full-time positions in second level schools. However, these qualifications are not accepted for the purpose of recognition to teach in a permanent capacity in mainstream primary schools. Therefore, a person who holds a bachelor of arts and higher diploma would not be qualified to teach in a permanent capacity in mainstream primary schools.</P>
      <P>However, my Department will grant restricted recognition to qualified second level teachers to teach in a permanent capacity in special schools, where a proportion of the pupils attending the school are of post-primary age &ndash; 12 years or older &ndash; and where second level programmes are being provided by the school. This recognition applies to all suitably qualified second level teachers and not just to holders of a bachelor of arts and higher diploma.</P>

      <P>The new disadvantage programme, Giving Children an Even Break, which was launched last year to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level, replaced the previous process of the designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage. My Department's approach is now refined to ensure that the individual &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; pupils are targeted. Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, my Department now provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving.</P>
      <P>The schools targeted under Giving Children an Even Break were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. All primary schools were invited to complete the survey questionnaire and over 75% of primary schools participated and returned completed survey forms to the ERC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Educational Research Centre's records indicate that a questionnaire to apply for inclusion in Giving Children an Even Break was not received at that time from the school in question. In the absence of a completed survey form from the school, the ERC was unable to assess the level of concentration of pupils in the school <Col N="348" /> with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Where schools expressed concern about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they were advised to make representations to my Department outlining their circumstances. Schools were informed that these representations would then be referred to the Educational Research Centre for consideration and my Department would then consider the position of these schools.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the approach outlined, representations from the school in question were forwarded to the Educational Research Centre. My Department has now received a report from the Educational Research Centre and the situation of such schools, including the school in question, seeking inclusion in Giving Children an Even Break is currently under consideration. The school authorities will be informed of the outcome of this process in the near future.</P>

      <P>The compulsory school starting age in a national school is six years of age and rule 64 (1) of the rules for national schools provides that a child must be at least four years of age before she/he may be enrolled in a national school. Children of compulsory school-going age must have a place in a national school and overall there are more than enough places available.</P>
      <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Acts. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school for a particular school year is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year. This is in accordance with an agreement on staffing entered into between the Government and the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of this school on 30 September 2001 was 74 pupils which warrants a staffing of a principal and two mainstream class teachers for the 2002-03 school year.</P>
      <P>As the agreed appointment figure for the third mainstream class teacher is 82 pupils, I regret that the appointment of the third mainstream class teacher cannot be sanctioned for the 2002-03 school year.</P>
      <P>The above staffing agreement can only be deviated from in instances where schools have rapid growth in enrolment numbers. Should Brannockstown national school achieve an enrolment of 99 or more pupils by September 2002, its board of management may apply to the primary payments section of my Department for a developing school post.</P>

      <P>Very significant additional resources were provided during the term of office of the last Government for the education of children who have special educational needs arising from disabilities. I acknowledge, however, that there was an historic deficit in funding such education resources and further progress is needed in the special education system before we can be satisfied that every child has access to the kind of education resources, which he or she needs and to which he or she is entitled. I am committed to making that progress. I also acknowledge that because of resourcing and organisational issues there are parents who feel it necessary in the interests of their child to seek redress in the courts. That is their right. It is entirely misleading, however, for the Deputy to imply that my Department takes cases &ldquo;against&rdquo; such families. My Department responds to cases brought against the State, as it is obliged to do, and most are settled on agreed terms without a court hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legal costs incurred by the State in defending <Col N="365" /> those cases, which are brought to court, are not met directly by my Department but in accordance with financial procedures in cases involving damages or compensation against the State. Costs are generally charged to the Chief State Solicitor's office Vote as sanctioned by the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>My Department meets the legal costs of plaintiffs where there is a settlement or an order for costs against the State. In the past five years the following amounts have been expended for these purposes from the funds voted for special needs education: </P>

      <P>As part of the contingency arrangements, which were drawn up by the representative management groups, the Joint Managerial Body &ndash; JMB, the Irish Vocational Education Association &ndash; IVEA &ndash; and the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools &ndash; ACS, following detailed discussions with officials of my Department, my Department undertook to resource schools in order that they could employ staff to provide supervision and thereby remain open. Payments amounting to &euro;17.8 million have issued under the plan.</P>
      <P>The contingency plan acknowledges that supplementary allocations may need to be made to some schools at a later date if their approved outgoings are greater than the amount of the grant. Accordingly final costs are not yet available.</P>
      <P>Agreement has recently been reached with the Teacher's Union of Ireland &ndash; TUI &ndash; and the Irish National Teachers Organisation &ndash; INTO &ndash; that the pensionability of the substitution and supervision payment is acceptable in principle subject to compliance with the requirements of the existing superannuation scheme. Discussions will take place between my Department and the trades unions concerned during the summer months in order to resolve the pension issues before the commencement of the next school year.</P>

This is subject to there being spare accommodation available on the service and provided no additional State cost is incurred.</P>
      <P>The pupils in question are attending school outside of their appropriate catchment area, accordingly, they are entitled to school transport from the nearest pick-up point in that catchment area only.

      <P>My Department's policy is to ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special needs into ordinary mainstream schools. However, the nature and level of the special educational response provided is largely based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child. The national educational psychological service, which was established in 1999, <Col N="369" /> employs qualified educational psychologists to provide the assessment service.</P>
      <P>Students who have been assessed as having special educational needs have access to a range of special support services. The services range from special schools dedicated to particular disability groups, through special classes/units attached to ordinary schools, to placement on an integrated basis in ordinary schools, with special back-up supports. Children attending on a fully integrated basis are supported by the resource teacher service and the special needs assistant service. At present, there are more than 1,700 resource teachers and 3,300 special needs assistants in place in primary schools supporting children with special educational needs on an integrated basis.</P>
      <P>Children with more severe levels of disability may require placement in a special school or special class attached to an ordinary school. Each such facility is dedicated to a particular disability group and each operates at a specially reduced pupil-teacher ratio. Pupils attending such facilities attract special rates of capitation funding and are entitled to avail of the special school transport service and the school bus escort service.</P>
      <P>Under a Government decision of October 1998, all children assessed as having special educational needs in primary schools have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs, irrespective of their level of need or location. All schools have been advised of the procedures through which they may gain access to the above range of services.</P>

Each such class operates at a maximum pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1 and each class also has the support of at least two special needs assistants.

      <P>Children who have special needs, including children with autism attending mainstream schools, are generally catered for with the support of a resource teacher and special needs assistant services.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 366 and 399 together.</P>
      <P>Within the State funded education sector alone, at least 180,000 students annually pursue part-time courses varying from hobby and leisure courses to basic education, personal development, vocational training and formally certified further and higher education programmes. Additional expenditure on free fees has to be considered in the light of other demands in the education system in increasing lifelong learning opportunities, tackling educational disadvantage at all levels, addressing capital and equipment needs and improving support services across the system.

      <P>Children who are deaf or who have hearing impairment are not a homogenous group either in terms of their hearing loss or of a wide range of other key factors. Therefore, no single response is appropriate or adequate when addressing the communication needs of this particular category of children. Educational provision is made for the individual child, in consultation with their parents, on the basis of the assessed needs of each child.</P>
      <P>In this context, and in relation to the choice of communication system, the fundamental decision is whether the most appropriate first language for the child is Irish sign language or spoken English. If the option is for spoken English, which it will be in a significant number of cases, then a predominantly oral method of teaching is employed. In this oral approach, signed English is sometimes also used as a teaching device.</P>
      <P>If the option is for Irish signed language, then the child is taught in a linguistic environment that is predominantly or exclusively based on the use of Irish sign language. There is a growing request for this approach by some parents on behalf of their children. The policy of my Department is to facilitate access to this approach so that the assessed needs of pupils and parental wishes are taken into account.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I have allocated additional resources to the two special schools in Dublin to allow them to establish a number of classes in which sign language is the medium of communication and teaching. Special needs assistants, who are proficient in sign language, have also been provided for these schools in order to facilitate the development and use of Irish sign language as required. My Department has also provided support for a number of families with deaf children to allow them to employ tutors of Irish sign language in their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to further developments in this area, my Department will continue its consultations with representatives of the deaf community and with other relevant bodies and indi<Col N="374" /> viduals, including individual parents of deaf children. The increased use of Irish sign language in the education of deaf children has also been acknowledged in the Education Act, 1998.</P>
    <P>My predecessor established an advisory committee on the education of the deaf and hard of hearing late last year to advise my Department on the range of key issues relating to the future education of deaf children including the issues raised by the Deputy in relation to Irish sign language and communication with non deaf children. I understand that the committee has invited submissions from those who have a particular interest in and-or personal experience of the services already in place and have recommendations to make for improving them. I look forward to receiving the report of the advisory committee which will provide a valuable basis for the further development of education services for deaf and hard of hearing pupils.</P>

      <P>Participation is generally free on adult literacy programmes, and on all full-time further and higher level recognised, nationally certified, education courses up to and including under-graduate level. Third level and PLC students may also avail of means-tested maintenance grants. In addition, adults over 21 who are unemployed at least six months, or dependent spouses, lone parents and people with disabilities who satisfy these criteria and are pursuing recognised full time courses in further or higher education may either receive a training allowance under the vocational training opportunities scheme or a payment from the Department of Social and Family Affairs under the back to education allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>Tax relief at standard rates is available up to a fee limit of &euro;3,175 for fees paid in respect of nationally certified post graduate courses, and nationally certified full-time or part-time third level courses of at least two years duration. Tax relief is also available on fees, ranging from &euro;315 to &euro;1,270, paid in respect of FÁS IT and foreign language courses.</P>
      <P>Under the recently announced back to education initiative, under which part time options are being introduced in the further education sector, tuition will be free for medical card holders, means-tested welfare recipients and those with unemployment payments or family income supplement, and their dependants. A reduced fee will apply to other unwaged categories with less than upper secondary education, and fees will be charged for the remainder. The impact of this on the participation of specific groups will be monitored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main issue highlighted in consultations in <Col N="378" /> relation to those in the workplace is the question of fees payable on part time courses. Within the State funded education sector alone, at least 180,000 students annually pursue part time courses varying from hobby and leisure courses to basic education, personal development, vocational training and formally certified higher education programmes. Additional expenditure on free fees has to be considered in the light of other demands in the education system in increasing lifelong learning opportunities, tackling educational disadvantage at all levels, addressing capital and equipment needs and improving support services across the system. To abolish fees for all part time students would be extremely costly and there are no plans at present to do so.</P>
    <P>However, the importance and impact of funding arrangements are recognised in the light of the challenges facing education institutions in regard to issues such as equity, flexibility, competitiveness, workplace learning and demographic change.

The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students aged 23 and over.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that she-he must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants. My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post leaving certificate courses: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; and the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate, PLC, courses. All four schemes have similar provisions, relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
      <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, she-he may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy. If an individual applicant considers that she-he has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, she-he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view <Col N="381" /> that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his-her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant are being reviewed with a view to extending eligibility. The coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in the first year of operation forms part of the review.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. The provision for this fund was increased significantly from &euro;2.49 million, £1.964 million, in respect of the 2000-01 academic year to &euro;7.49 million, £5.9 million, in respect of the 2001-02 academic year.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school for a particular school year is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year. This is in accordance with an agreement on staffing entered into between the Government and the education partners. The enrolment of this school on 30 September, 2001 was 11 pupils which warrants a staffing of a principal teacher for the 2002-03 school year. As the agreed retention figure for the first mainstream class teacher is 12 pupils, I regret that there is no basis on which I may sanction a continuation of this post at Leaffoney national school for the 2002-03 school year. Should this school achieve a valid enrolment of 12 or more pupils by the 30 September 2002 the post of first mainstream class teacher will be restored to the school for the 2003-04 school year.</P>

      <P>The provision of an additional 175 professional therapy training places to tackle the shortage of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists was announced on 29 May 2002. These places are being provided in response to the recommendations set out in the report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists, which was launched in July 2001. The recent announcement follows on the work of an inter-agency group, comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Higher Education Authority, which was established to ensure the provision of the additional places and which considered proposals from third level institutions for the expansion of existing courses and-or the introduction of new courses, including graduate entry programmes, in response to the training needs identified in the Bacon report.</P>

      <P>All second level schools in the free education scheme have an entitlement to an ex-quota allocation in respect of remedial education. The allocation to an individual school for a particular school year is determined by the enrolment at the end of the preceding September. Schools with an enrolment of 600 or more are entitled to a full post and those with an enrolment below 600 are entitled to the equivalent of one half of a post for remedial education.</P>
      <P>My Department also makes a specific ex-quota allocation of teaching posts in respect of guidance in second level schools. The allocation ranges from 0.36 of a post &ndash; eight hours per week &ndash; in schools in the free education scheme with an enrolment of less than 200 pupils to two posts in the case of schools with an enrolment of 1,000 pupils or more.</P>
      <P>With regard to the school referred to by the Deputy, the enrolment warrants an allocation of 0.5 of a post in respect of remedial education and 0.5 of a post in respect of guidance and provision for this has been made in the approved teacher allocation for the school for the 2002-03 school year.</P>
      <P>The question of allocating additional resources to second level schools in respect of remedial education and guidance will be considered in the context of available resources and having regard to the recommendations of the expert group on the allocation of teachers to second level schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Third level education in the south-east region is provided by the Waterford and Carlow institutes of technology and by the Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute. There are no proposals at present in developing a university of the south-east. The question of a university for the south-east has been raised previously in the context of the development of Waterford Institute of Technology. There are no plans to change the status of Waterford Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>In July 1996, the Government approved in principle the recommendations in the report of the steering committee on the future development of higher education as a benchmark for future planning in the sector. The steering committee concluded that an upgrading and expansion of Waterford Regional Technical College, now Waterford Institute of Technology, represented the most appropriate response to the higher education needs of the south-east region. The committee's report recommended an increase in student places from 3,500 to 5,000 in the Regional Technical College, an increase in degree level awards and a change of title. The report also recommended that the major focus of expansion be at degree level. It stated that such provision would place the college at the top end of the spectrum by comparison with other Regional Technical Colleges in terms of provision of degree places and would enable the region to reach the national average participation in degree programmes.</P>
      <P>The Government accepted these recommendations and the provision, in both the total number of places and in degree level courses, in what is now Waterford Institute of Technology has been expanded annually and incrementally in line with available resources. In this regard, figures supplied to my Department by Waterford Institute of Technology indicate that over 40% of the 5,443 students enrolled on full-time certificate, diploma, degree and postgraduate courses, in the 2000-01 academic year, were pursuing degree courses. These measures, combined with the change of title of the college to institute of technology, provide the necessary status and capacity for the institute to meet the identified higher education needs of the region over the coming years. Consistent with this approach WIT is among the first institutes of technology to be given authority to make their own educational awards under the terms of the Qualification (Education and Training) Act, 1999.</P>

      <P>My Department has an extensive primary school building programme under way at present and this includes a large number of projects at various stages of architectural planning. Decisions on additional projects proceeding to architectural planning are taken in the light of the annual allocation for capital projects, the financial commitments to be met and the priority to be afforded to individual projects. The programme for 2002 is in place and the schools concerned have been notified.</P>
      <P>Later this year when a financial allocation has been made for the primary school building programme in the 2003 Estimates I will be framing a further comprehensive programme of works and this will involve putting more projects into architectural planning. The needs of the school in question will be considered at that time.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to bring greater transparency to the operation of the school building programme and I intend to publish the programme annually.

      <P> The enrolment of this school on 30 September 2001 was 468 pupils which warrants a staffing of a principal and 16 mainstream class teachers for the 2002-03 school year.

      <P>The educational needs of pupils with dyslexia of primary school age are generally capable of being met within the mainstream school system with the support, where necessary, of the learning support teacher service or the resource teacher service.

      <P>For some children, the severity of the condition can be such as to require placement in a special school or a special class attached to an ordinary school. At present, there are four special schools and 21 special classes dedicated to children with dyslexia. Funding is also provided to meet any special equipment needs of the children in question.</P>
      <P>My predecessor recently announced a number of important new measures to enhance the education of children with dyslexia following recommendations of the task force on dyslexia. These include the introduction of the first ever on-line training for teachers catering for pupils with dyslexia; the appointment of ten new learning support trainers; and the reduction in the pupil teacher ratio in special classes for dyslexia from 11: 1 to 9:1  </P>

      <P>The statutory framework for the higher education grants schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. It is the local authorities which, on behalf of my Department, administer the schemes, which are reviewed annually by my Department. The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered, on behalf of my Department, by the vocational education committees. All three schemes have similar provisions, relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes that issue <Col N="396" /> from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. It is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</P>

      <P>The teacher allocation to voluntary secondary, community and comprehensive schools and to vocational education committees for a particular school year consists of the allocation warranted by the recognised pupil enrolment at the end of the preceding September, as determined by the current pupil teacher ratio, together with approved ex-quota or concessionary posts as appropriate. Ex-quota posts include principal, deputy principal, learning support/remedial, career guidance and resource teaching posts.</P>
      <P>The current PTR for appointment purposes at second level is 18:1. A <i>de facto</i> PTR of 16:1 applies in respect of certain programmes, for example, leaving certificate applied, leaving certificate vocational programme, junior certificate school programme and post-leaving certificate courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. I am arrang<Col N="397" /> ing to have a copy of the staffing schedule for the 2002-3 school year forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>At primary level in Naas, provisional recognition has been recently granted to Gaelscoil Nás na Ríogh to commence operating from 1 September 2002. During the period of provisional recognition, the operation of the school and the growth of pupil numbers will be monitored by the Department and it will be the responsibility of the school patron to provide interim accommodation. This accommodation must be capable of fully meeting the needs of the developing school until permanent recognition has been secured and the Department is in a position to acquire a site and provide a permanent school building.</P>
      <P>At post-primary level, following consultation with the Department's planning section, the trustees of Meánscoil Iognáid Rís and St. Mary's Convent of Mercy have each indicated that they do not wish to exceed a maximum of 900 pupils.</P>
      <P>In connection with the individual building projects, the position on each of the post primary schools is as follows. The stage 2, outline sketch scheme, submission for the extension project at Méanscoil Iognáid Rís to cater for a long-term enrolment of 900 pupils is currently being considered within my Department's post-primary building unit. On completion of this examination and subject to all being satisfactory, the question of allowing the project to proceed to stage 3 (developed sketch scheme) of architectural planning will be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An extension project has recently been completed at St. Mary's Convent of Mercy, Naas, County Kildare, which caters for an enrolment of 800 pupils. The school authorities have submitted an application for further additional accommodation. This accommodation will be based on the <Col N="399" /> projected long-term enrolment figure of 900 pupils with which the trustees of the school agree, as indicated above.</P>
    <P>My Department has an extensive schools building programme under way at present. The programme includes a very substantial programme of works scheduled to go to site in the course of the year as well as a large number of projects at various stages of planning.</P>
    <P>Decisions relating to additional projects proceeding to planning are taken having regard to the annual allocation for capital projects, existing commitments and priority afforded to each individual project. It is not envisaged at this stage that planning for a building project at St. Mary's College, Naas, will be initiated prior to the publication of the Estimates later this year. When the financial allocation has been made for the second level schools' building programme for 2003, this school's application will be reviewed and officials of my Department will be in direct contact with the school's management authority.</P>
    <P>A proposal submitted by the chief executive officer of County Kildare VEC to relocate St. Patrick's community college to a new site, including the possible sale of the existing school, is currently being considered by my Department's post-primary and administration units.</P>
    <P>A letter has issued to County Kildare VEC requesting clarification on a number of issues. A response is currently awaited. Upon receipt of a response, this matter will receive further attention. In the meantime planning section is currently assessing the impact of additional housing developments in the Naas area on the long-term accommodation requirements of St. Patrick's post-primary school.</P>
    <P>Architectural planning is at an advanced stage in relation to primary school building projects in Naas and Sallins. My Department has requested the Office of Public Works to explore the possibility of acquiring a site in Kill. The relevant school authorities will be kept advised of developments.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school for a particular school year is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year. This is in accordance with an agreement on staffing entered into between the Government and the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of this school on 30 September 2001 was 527 pupils, which warrants a staffing of a principal and 18 mainstream class teachers for the 2002-03 school year. In addition, the school has the services of a resource teacher and two learning support teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of concerns that have been expressed in relation to the 2002 leaving certificate biology higher level examination paper. The examination paper was designed to test candidates' knowledge across the range of the syllabus. The current biology syllabus is presented in ten sections and no section of the syllabus was omitted from the examination paper. There is a significant element of choice within the examination paper whereby candidates are required to answer four questions from eight questions provided in part 2 of the paper. Candidates are required to answer six from seven short questions in part 1 of the paper. If there is evidence that the diagram in question 6 was blurred on some examination papers, the marking conference will take that into consideration. The questions relating to the other two diagrams for question 5 and question 14 are very clear and precise.</P>
      <P>There was no question in relation to the dissection of frogs. Candidates were asked to describe an experiment that involved frog tadpoles. This experiment is specified in the syllabus. The Department has a licence &ndash; No. C9/2002 &ndash; from Dúchas to collect frogspawn and this licence permits teachers of science subjects to collect frogspawn for educational purposes. It has been established practice for many years in biology examination papers to require candidates to draw diagrams of a variety of objects including tissues and organs. The published marking schemes and published chief examiners' reports have indicated that marks are awarded for diagrams and teachers are aware of this practice.</P>
      <P>My Department does not intend to set an alternative examination paper. All correspondence from individuals and organisations should be forwarded to the examinations branch. They then will be brought to the attention of the chief examiner and the examining team in the context of developing a marking scheme that will take into account any valid issues raised. The marking scheme for this paper will be published along with those in all other subjects in advance of the viewing of scripts in late August. In that way, examination candidates who view their scripts will have the opportunity to see in detail precisely how marks were allocated.</P>

      <P>On 8 March 2002 the Minister for Public Enterprise announced a major drive to bring high speed broadband access to 67 priority towns around the country. On 8 March, phase one and two of a regional broadband programme was launched and will ultimately see investment of up to 160 million euro in delivering town fibre <Col N="414" /> optic networks in key locations regionally. A further phase of investment in broadband will involve each of the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
      <P>Phase one of the broadband programme will see 19 towns, many in the Border, midlands and west, BMW, region targeted immediately. Metropolitan area fibre optic networks will be built in these towns to link up with the existing backbone network in the country. The town links will facilitate consumers, educational establishments, industry and business and provide &ldquo;always on&rdquo; low cost and high speed Internet access which will drive the Government's e-commerce agenda. The relevant local authorities have been asked to enter procurement to establish firm prices for their proposals. Once procurement is completed, and subject to satisfactory pricing, contracts will be offered for these projects. It is anticipated that this will take place over the next two months. The first phase is being conducted in association with local and regional authorities which will receive 90% funding from the Exchequer. The launch of the second phase of the broadband programme will be contingent on the success of the first phase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 430 and 431 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that Directive 94/25/EC, which became fully operational on 16 June 1998 and has been transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Recreational Craft) Regulations, 1998, S.I. No. 40 of 1998, <Col N="416" /> requires that recreational craft between 2.5 metres and 24 metres hull length must be constructed in compliance with safety standards outlined in the directive. The directive as it stands, however, does not require the construction of such craft to comply with specified standards relating to engine exhaust or sound emissions, nor does it apply in any way to personal watercraft, more commonly known as jet skis or water bikes.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Council of the European Union has recently adopted a common position with a view to amending Directive 94/25/EC to include harmonised provisions, including limits, on exhaust and noise emissions from engines intended to be installed on recreational craft. Significantly, these amendments will also see the inclusion for the first time in the directive of a harmonised approach in the EU towards the construction standards, including exhaust and noise emission requirements, for personal watercraft. My Department has worked closely with the Department of the Environment and Local Government in fully supporting the amending directive on its progress through the EU Council and Parliament, and I particularly welcome the inclusion of jet skis in the types of recreational craft which are now to be covered by the scope of the directive.</P>
    <P>These new measures, which I understand are intended to come into effect in 2004, will tie in with the new legislative framework currently being developed by my Department to regulate the use of recreational watercraft, including jet skis and fast power craft, in line with the recommendations made in the report of the action group on small powered recreational craft, including personal watercraft, which was presented to my predecessor as Minister, Deputy Fahey, in April 2000. On foot of that report, the Minister introduced new regulations governing the safe use of personal watercraft &ndash; jet skis &ndash; fast power craft and other mechanically propelled pleasure craft. These regulations, which apply in all Irish waters and not just in coastal areas, are an initial phase of regulations which have been developed by my Department as a result of the recommendations made in that report. Specifically, the new regulations implement the recommendations which had been made in relation to the carriage and use of appropriate lifejackets, the minimum age under which persons should not be allowed to operate personal watercraft and fast power craft and restrictions on the use of alcohol and drugs. In addition, the regulations provide that persons who operate personal watercraft &ndash; jet skis &ndash;  and fast power craft in a dangerous or careless manner can be prosecuted for such behaviour.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that under the Local Government Act, 1994, local authorities are empowered to introduce bye laws to regulate the usage of waters in areas under their jurisdiction. I believe these powers, which can include prohibiting the use of personal watercraft, with the new regulations which have been introduced, will <Col N="417" /> see a significant improvement in the safety, not only of those using jet skis and fast power craft, but also of bathers and other water users whose safety may have been threathened by such craft in the past. The ministerial action group made other recommendations relating to issues such as insurance and registration of pleasure craft as well as training and competence of users. It is my intention that work on these issues will be progressed, in full consultation with those in the sector, under the Maritime Safety Directorate which has recently been established within my Department. The purpose of this new directorate is to undertake the State's marine regulatory safety services, including the co-ordination of all aspects of safety at sea. The Maritime Safety Directorate will incorporate the current functions of my Department's marine survey office and its maritime safety and marine environment divisions as well as the safety functions in relation to pleasure craft.</P>

      <P>My Department has received correspondence from the person referred to by the Deputy regarding set-aside of commercial salmon fishing engines. In October 2000, my Department requested the seven regional fisheries boards to encourage the development of measures at catchment level to incentivise the reduction of the commercial salmon fishing effort based on consensus and local contribution and to forward such proposals to my Department and the National Salmon Commission. The person referred to by the Deputy, who I understand is a member of the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board, was advocating a set aside of commercial salmon fishing engines in the Boyne estuary, which is situated in the fisheries region of the board. However, to date my Department has received no substantive proposal for a set-aside in the Boyne estuary from the eastern board or any other group.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the report of the consultancy study carried out by <Col N="418" /> AIB Capital Markets and Merrill Lynch to assess the options for the corporate development of Coillte Teoranta was published in 2000. The consultants concluded, <i>inter alia</i>, that until the challenges facing the forest sector had been resolved, a change in the ownership structure of Coillte should not be considered. Various options outlined, including outright or partial sale and IPO, were regarded by the consultants as realistic options for consideration in the longer term. The consultants recommended no change in the ownership of Coillte for the forseeable future &ndash; probably the subsequent five years or so. My predecessor accepted the recommendations of the consultants and I see no reason to review the position at this juncture.</P>
      <P>As to joint ventures, the Deputy may wish to note that, with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, my predecessor gave approval last month to Coillte to enter into a joint venture with an Austrian company, GriffnerHaus GmbH, in relation to the building of modular timber houses. No proposals in respect of further joint ventures have been submitted by Coillte.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 438 and 439 together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the House that support was recently announced for 38 new vessels under the fishing fleet development measure of the NDP, which is administered under delegated authority by an Board Iascaigh Mhara, BIM. The new vessel initiative involved a total investment of &euro;56 million, including &euro;15.7 million in grant aid. This is the largest single investment in the fishing sector since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>Seventy four applications were initially received under the new vessel scheme of which eight were subsequently withdrawn. All remaining 66 applications were rigorously assessed by BIM in accordance with published selection criteria. Thirty eight projects were approved by BIM for grant aid. BIM's approval of the 38 projects was in line with the available funding for new vessels as published in the financial programme for the measure. BIM did not, on this basis, compile a &ldquo;reserve list&rdquo; of projects. Accordingly, I do not have the scope to expand the new vessel scheme. However, other elements of the current programme provide our fishermen with significant opportunities to apply for support for investment projects. These elements include support for the modernisation of existing vessels and for the purchase and installation of vital safety equipment. In addition, special assistance is available for young fishermen and women acquiring their first vessel.</P>

      <P>The harbour at Clogherhead is owned by Louth County Council and responsibility for its maintenance and development lies with the local authority. Funding of &euro;247,969.30 was provided over the past two years for safety works, minor improvements and surfacing. A portion of the funding provided in 2001 was in respect of a cost benefit analysis of the local authority's development proposals for the harbour. This cost benefit analysis is now nearing completion and I expect the county council to submit the findings to my Department for consideration in the near future. Funding allocation will be informed by the findings of the cost benefit analysis. However, under the national development plan, funding for major fishery harbour development work is substantially oversubscribed at this point. Future capital development of Clogherhead will be assessed in the light of the cost benefit analysis and the overall funding envelope available.</P>

In line with standard procedures under the programme, specific documentation and information was sought in a letter to the club in July 2001 to enable payment of the grant to be put in hand. To date this documentation is still outstanding despite a subsequent reminder to the club. Until the documentation requested has been received and approved the grant cannot be paid.</P>

      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, 2000-02, which is administered by my Department, support is available towards the cost of swimming pools, toddler pools, sauna and steam rooms. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been received for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation. Some 46 applications are being processed under the current programme and these are at various stages of progress. The funding for the programme amounts to &euro;57.15 million over the three year period 2000-02. The closing date for submissions under this programme was 31 July 2000. No application was received under the current programme in respect of the project to which the Deputy refers. Local authorities will be advised when a new swimming pool programme is initiated and it may be open to the project in question to apply for funding at that time.</P>

      <P>The administration of the system for the registration of marriages is a matter for An tÁrd-Chláraitheoir, the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and for local registrars who operate under his general direction. Section 32 of the Family Law Act, 1995 &ndash; No. 26 of 1995 &ndash;  provides that a marriage shall not be valid unless both parties to a marriage have given three months written notification of their intention to marry to the appropriate registrar of marriages or an exemption to this requirement had been granted by the courts as provided by section 33 of the Act. Where the requirements set out in section 32 have not been fulfilled, a marriage is not valid in civil law and may not be registered. Unfortunately, the marriage referred to by the Deputy may not be registered because the three months notification required by section 32 of the Act of 1995 was not received by a registrar of marriages and a court exemption to the requirement to give three months written notification was not obtained.</P>

      <P>In recognition of the importance of leisure activities and their role in promoting and sustaining personal and community development, the new programme for Government builds on commitments given in the national children's strategy. The strategy, which is a significant Government ten year plan to improve the quality of all children's lives, includes a commitment to the development of play and recreation policies.</P>
      <P>Approximately 2,500 children and 300 adults participated in a consultation process feeding into the preparation of the national children's strategy. The main issue raised by children in the consultation process was the lack of play and recreation facilities for children and young people. The deficit in the provision of public playgrounds was often highlighted. At the launch of the strategy, the Taoiseach announced that a national play and recreation policy would be developed to address this issue. The development and implementation of the new policy is one of the priority areas for attention by the National Children's Office.</P>
      <P>The new policy will provide a framework for future development and will look at a range of issues, including: guiding principles; a partnership approach between the statutory, community, voluntary and private sectors; developing a play infrastructure; other issues including safety, public liability insurance and litigation matters; and funding arrangements. It is proposed to address the leisure needs of children up to 12 years of age in a national play policy and to deal with the wider range of recreational opportunities for teenagers in a national recreation policy.</P>
      <P>There are a number of inputs to the development of these policies. These include advice from the National Children's Advisory Council, the establishment of a working group comprising key statutory and non-statutory agencies, a survey of public playground provision and the establishment of pilot projects to identify the issues likely to be encountered in providing a public play facilities of a high standard. Research into the influences on young people's recreational choices will also be undertaken. It is hoped to circulate a draft play policy for consultation in the autumn. The policy, including the financial implications and the identification of responsibility for implementation, will be submitted to Government for approval.</P>

      <P>The healthcare of immigrants is addressed in the context of general arrangements governing eligibility for public health services. Under the Health Act, 1970, entitlement to health services is primarily based on residence and means. Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility, category 1, or limited eligibility, category 2, for health services. Health boards normally regard a person as ordinarily resident in Ireland if he or she satisfies the health board that it is his or her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year.</P>
      <P>Persons in category 1 are medical card holders and they are entitled to a full range of services including general practitioners services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultant services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.</P>
      <P>Persons in category 2 &ndash; non-medical card holders &ndash; are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services and out-patient public hospital services including consultant services. Dental and routine ophthalmic and aural services are excluded from out-patient services available. However, such treatment is provided to children who have been referred from a child health clinic or a school health examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discharging its international obligations, my Department, through the health boards, provides for the healthcare of asylum seekers. The arrangements in place are not, however, subject to residency and means criteria and such persons may avail of public health services on the same basis as medical card holders, while awaiting a <Col N="430" /> decision on an application to remain in this country.</P>
    <P>As part of the initial reception process for asylum seekers, communicable disease screening is offered on a voluntary basis to such persons during their stay at reception centres in Dublin. This service is offered in the interests of the asylum seekers themselves, their families and the community generally. Health boards in other parts of the country also offer screening to asylum seekers accommodated in their area, who have not availed of screening during their stay in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 457, 528 and 553 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has received legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General on this matter, the implications of which are currently under examination by the Department. I would point out that the drugs payment scheme, introduced on 1 July 1999, essentially amalgamated the existing drug cost subsidisation and drugs refund schemes, and provided that families would only have to meet the first &euro;53.33 per month of spending on approved prescribed medicines. The threshold for the DCSS scheme was &euro;40.63 per month per individual, and &euro;114.28 per quarter for each eligible person and dependants for the DRS. Under the DRS the person had to pay for the drugs at the pharmacy, and claim a refund from the health board at the end of the quarter.</P>
      <P>The new drugs payments scheme was designed to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes, to be more user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. The scheme was also designed to iron out anomalies whereby, for example, a person or family who might spend &euro;101.58 in one month on medicines and have no expenditure for the remainder of the quarter would not be entitled to any refund. Accordingly, under this new scheme families are able to budget for the cost of prescribed medicines.</P>
      <P>Regardless of the cost of their prescribed medicines, families are liable only for a maximum of &euro;53.33 in any month. A further advantage is that applicants are not required to pay and claim a refund as in the previous schemes. In addition there are no qualifying criteria for the DPS unlike the previous DCSS where a person had to have a certificate from a doctor and be approved by a health board as having a long-term medical condition requiring regular and continuous prescribed drugs in excess of &euro;40.63 per month.</P>
      <P>The financial benefits of the new DPS are reflected in the significantly increased spending level relative to the earlier schemes it replaced. The total cost of the DPS and the DCSS in 1998, the last full year of operation, was £74.69 million. In contrast the new DPS cost £110 million in 2000, the first full year of operation, and rose to £140 million in 2001. The aggregate benefits of the new scheme are clearly significantly greater than the previous schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order for any item to be included in the common medicines list it must comply with a published list of criteria. These range from their auth<Col N="432" /> orisation status where appropriate, their price and in certain cases the uses for which the products are intended. In addition, the products should ordinarily be supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public. A comprehensive range of medicinal products authorised and recommended for use in the treatment of eczema are included in the common list. The list is subject to ongoing review and amendment as new products become available and is updated on a monthly basis.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of speech and language therapy services to children and adults with an intellectual disability in the north east is a matter for the North-Eastern Health Board. Additional funding has been made available annually in recent years to the health boards, including the North-Eastern Health Board, in respect of the provision of health related support services for children with an intellectual disability and those with autism. In addition to this ringfenced funding, children with disabilities would also have benefited from the additional therapy posts which have been put in place in services for persons with physical or sensory disabilities.</P>
      <P>However many health boards and specialist service providers have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting allied health professionals and specifically speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. This is due primarily to the general shortage of available staff in these grades nationally. Health boards and agencies have been and are continuing to undertake intensive recruitment drives at home and abroad. My Department has asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision or an enhancement in line with agreed service developments using the resources allocated to the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to my concern regarding the high level of vacancies my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The study was published in July 2001. The report recommends an annual increase of 75 course places for speech and language therapy in order to achieve a fourfold increase in the num<Col N="433" /> ber of speech and language therapists over the next decade.</P>
    <P>An inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority. The HEA, following a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions, has allocated an additional 75 training places for speech and language therapy to respond to the training needs identified in the study. In addition the Northern Area Health Board will shortly be undertaking a concerted overseas recruitment drive for speech and language therapists on behalf of all health boards.</P>
    <P>The report of the expert group on various health professionals recommended the establishment of a therapy assistant grade, where appropriate, to provide practical support to speech and language therapists in their work and also to address the issue of skills mix. This recommendation will be progressed in 2002 in the context of the continuing implementation of the expert group report.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the availability of traditional, alternative and herbal medicinal products. In this regard, I would like to inform the Deputy that my Department is not seeking to restrict availability of these medicinal products, other than in cases where there may be overriding public health considerations. On the contrary, in order to seek to ensure the continued availability of such products that are of appropriate quality and safety, my Department is currently examining proposals from the Irish Medicines Board for the control of these products, the aim of which is to provide the consumer with an assurance that the traditional medicinal products which they buy are: produced to an appropriate quality standard; safe under the recommended conditions of use; can be expected to be effective in the context of their established tradition of use, and are appropriately labelled.</P>
      <P>In order to gain the most from these types of medicinal products, it is essential that they be controlled by an appropriate authority to ensure that, like all other medicinal products, they are of an appropriate quality and safe for the consumer to use. The interests of public health can best be realised when there is a formal mechanism for the assessment of these products and a subsequent means of monitoring their use in order to assure their continued safety in use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy should be aware that a proposed EU Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal <Col N="434" /> Products was agreed by the European Commission on 17 January 2002. This proposal has now been sent to the European Parliament and Council. I understand that the Irish Medicines Board's proposal for an interim national control scheme for these products is broadly in line with the proposed EU directive. Both the Irish Medicines Board's proposal and the proposed EU directive are currently being examined in my Department.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be interested to know that, at my request, the Irish Medicines Board recently organised a seminar for interested parties to review the implications of its proposed scheme for the control of these products. This seminar was held in May and proved to be a useful and constructive exercise which facilitated the exchange of information and opinions. I have also received a number of representations from various interested parties, including members of the public, all of which will be considered in the context of our ongoing examination of the IMB proposed scheme of control and the proposed EU directive.</P>

    <P>Under the Health Act, 1970 and the Health (Dental Services for Children) Regulations 2000, children who have attended national school retain eligibility for dental treatment up to their 16th birthday. In 2000, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;3.935 million for this extension of eligibility for the children's dental services. Moreover, an additional &euro;0.203 million and &euro;0.867 million was provided to the Eastern Regional Health Authority in 2001 and 2002 <Col N="435" /> respectively for the recruitment of extra dental teams to provide dental treatment to children up to their 16th birthday. It is anticipated that over the coming months staffing will be in place to provide treatment services to this age cohort.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, treatment is provided within the resources available to the health boards and where resources are limited, an emergency dental service is provided by the health board pending recruitment of additional clinical staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards in the first instance. The Southern Health Board was allocated an additional &euro;1.191 million last year for orthodontic services of which &euro;1.032 million was for the orthodontic initiative. Under the initiative, the board propose to <i>inter alia </i>recruit an additional two consultant orthodontists, one of whom will be located in Kerry.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officer of the board has informed me that the Local Appointments Commission has recommended a candidate for one of the consultant orthodontist posts, to be based in the north of Cork city. This candidate is expected to take up duty with the board in September 2002. The board is presently examining the possibility of re-advertising the other consultant post for the Tralee unit in order to expedite an appointment. I have initiated a range of measures to substantially increase the capacity of the orthodontic services and reduce the waiting times for orthodontic treatment.</P>
      <P>Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service such as the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. My Department has provided additional funding of &euro;0.932 million for orthodontic services in 2002 of which &euro;0.541 million was for a specialist training programme in orthodontics. Six dentists from the health boards &ndash; four of which are from the Eastern Regional Health Authority &ndash; commenced their training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications last October. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Post-Graduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and is <Col N="436" /> playing a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. My Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately &euro;1.269 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as part of the initiative, my Department is also exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists. Finally, the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has advised me that at the end of the March 2002 quarter, there were 2,750 patients in orthodontic treatment in the board.</P>

There are no plans to amend the long-term illness scheme to include persons with Crohn's disease.</P>
      <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;53.33 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision of health services to people with physical and sensory disabilities, including those with post-polio syndrome, is a matter for the health boards. The boards provide a range of support services to enable people with physical and sensory disabilities to live as independently as <Col N="439" /> possible within the community. This includes residential respite care, day care, home support and personal assistance services, nursing, therapy, counselling and family support, aids and appliances. Specialised residential care services are also provided.</P>
    <P>Significant additional funding of over &euro;179 million has been provided by the Government since 1997. This level of funding is indicative of the Government's ongoing commitment to the provision of quality services and includes: just under &euro;35 million for aids and appliances; &euro;60 million for the development of services, including residential, respite, home support and personal assistance and therapy services; &euro;36 million for capital projects; and a significant proportion of the remainder allocated in support of voluntary sector service providers.</P>
    <P>People suffering from one of the following conditions, who are not already medical card holders, may obtain drugs and medicines without charge for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness (under 16 only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
    <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.

Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    <P>Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;53.33 a month for approved prescribed medicines. There are no proposals at present to extend the long-term illness scheme or automatic eligibility for medical cards to people affected by post-polio syndrome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Effective rehabilitation draws on a broad range <Col N="440" /> of services to meet the particular needs of patients, with the objective of helping patients return to normal life in the community. In the light of this, a large element of rehabilitation services is provided on a day or community care basis. The relevant services range from specialist in-patient medical rehabilitation through such services as physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy. These services are often initiated in the context of in-patient treatment for another underlying illness or condition and subsequently continued on a day care basis or in the community, consistent with patients needs. It is, therefore, more appropriate to focus on ensuring that rehabilitation is provided to patients in the most appropriate setting rather than on the basis of identifying dedicated services for particular categories of patients other than those requiring specialist in-patient medical rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>The provision of appropriate rehabilitation care is also an integral element of the service required by many types of patients and proposals for development of additional capacity in the services that contribute to rehabilitation are often presented in the context of proposals for broader service developments. For example, the report of the review group on the waiting list initiative identified that a significant proportion of acute hospital beds were being inappropriately used by patients who did not need, or who no longer needed, acute hospital care. This problem arises due to a shortage of places in the areas of &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; or convalescent care, rehabilitation facilities and community based services which reduce the need to use acute hospital care.</P>
      <P>Rehabilitation services also have an important role for groups such as people with physical disabilities. Rehabilitation services in this area are provided as part of a comprehensive range of community based services. Since 1997, additional funding of just over &euro;185 million has been invested in the maintenance and development of health related support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, including those with significant disabilities (young chronic sick).</P>
      <P>In December 2000, I gave approval for the establishment of a project team to oversee the developments at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Cork. The establishment of a purpose-built acute rehabilitation unit with associated treatment and ancillary facilities is part of the proposed development. This unit will serve the Cork and the greater Munster region and will provide services similar to those currently being provided in the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire. A design brief has recently been submitted to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, as set out in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System For You, my Department is currently preparing to carry out a review, in consultation with the relevant stakeholders, of the current rehabilitation services available for people with acquired brain injuries. I regard the continued development of <Col N="441" /> rehabilitation services as an essential element of providing appropriate care to patients across a wide range of health services and I wish to assure the Deputy that I remain fully committed to the further development of this important and complex area of the health system.</P>

      <P>The provision of health related services to people with physical and sensory disabilities, including those with post-polio syndrome, is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Health boards provide a range of support services to enable people with physical and sensory disabilities to live as independently as possible within the community. This includes residential respite care, day care, home support (including personal assistance services), nursing, therapy, counselling and family support, aids and appliances. Specialised residential care services are also provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant additional funding of over &euro;179 million has been provided since 1997. This level of funding is indicative of the Government's ongoing commitment to the provision of quality services and includes: just under &euro;30 million for aids and appliances; &euro;60 million ongoing funding <Col N="443" /> for the development of services, including residential, respite, home support and personal assistance and therapy services; &euro;36 million for capital projects; and a significant proportion of the remainder allocated in support of voluntary sector service providers.</P>
    <P>In addition to this level of funding, my Department, in conjunction with the Health Research Board, the health boards and the voluntary sector service providers, are currently developing the national physical and sensory disability database, which I launched in March 2002. When complete, the database will provide: at local level, a detailed picture of each individual's health service requirements over a five year period; at national level, detailed statistical information to assist in the acquisition of funds and identify priority services at which to target these resources. The database will be an essential tool in the delivery of effective services to people with physical and sensory disabilities, in a planned and co-ordinated manner.</P>
    <P>The above-mentioned issues relate to the many and varying conditions which cause physical and sensory disabilities, including post-polio syndrome. It is not proposed to form a committee relating specifically to that condition. It is worth noting, however, that the Disability Federation of Ireland, of which the Post-Polio Support Group is a member, is represented at various fora, such as the national physical and sensory disability database committee and the review group on home support services.</P>

A brief for this is now complete. The proposed development includes the <Col N="444" /> replacement of 32 orthopaedic rehabilitation beds and the relocation of paramedical services, outpatients department and associated clinical and non-clinical services. This will increase the total bed complement of the hospital from 104 to 160 beds.

A comprehensive range of medicinal products authorised and recommended for use in the treatment of eczema are included in the common list. The list is subject to ongoing review and amendment as new products become available and is updated on a monthly basis.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the responsibility for recruiting social workers to health boards is a matter for individual health boards. The problems in the Eastern Regional Health Authority arise primarily due to the high level of demand for assessments combined with current difficulties in recruiting social workers. A range of actions have been taken to assist the ERHA to improve the service available, including allocation of an additional &euro;830,000 over the last four years. I understand that the ERHA is continuing to look at options to further increase the number of assessments carried out, including involvement of other health boards and agencies.</P>

      <QRef>[13243/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin): The White Paper on private health insurance, published in 1999, set out the Government's proposals regarding the corporate status of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. The White Paper provided for the establishment of the VHI as a company under the Companies Acts, with full commercial freedom of operation, in the ownership of the Minister for Finance. The possibility of third party investment and eventual full sale of the State's interest in VHI, if deemed desirable by the Government, was also addressed.</P>
    <P>Specifically, the White Paper provided for the appointment of a corporate financial institution and legal advisers to advise the Government on any possible sale of the VHI. Following completion of the tender process, I, jointly with the Minister for Finance, appointed advisers to examine and report on the matter. The consultants have now completed their report and it is currently under consideration. It will be a matter for the Government to decide, in due course, whether or not to dispose of the VHI as a State company. Any change in VHI's corporate status will require legislation and will, therefore, arise for consideration and discussion in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The issue of community rating is not related to the status of the VHI or any other insurer. Community rating and the protections necessary for its continuation are enshrined in legislation. The sustainability of this system in a voluntary environment is not just a matter of legislation, but is critically dependent on people joining private health insurance at a young age. The surpluses that young healthy people contribute to the system facilitate the insurance of older, sicker people at premium rates that would not otherwise be affordable. With this in mind the White Paper announced the Government's intention to introduce lifetime community rating and the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2001, has provided the necessary basis for the making of regulations in this area.</P>
    <P>Lifetime community rating gives insurers discretion to apply additional premium to people who enter health insurance for the first time at older ages. This will strengthen the system by <Col N="454" /> encouraging entry to the community rated system at young ages and by providing that late joiners will, at the discretion of the insurers, be liable to pay sufficient extra premium to make up for the surplus they would have contributed had they joined at a younger age.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means rather than income. Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility &ndash; category 1, that is, medical card holders &ndash; or limited eligibility &ndash; category 2 &ndash; for health services. Health boards normally regard a person as ordinarily resident in Ireland if he or she satisfies the health board that it is his or her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year.</P>
      <P>Persons in category 1 are medical card holders and are entitled to a full range of services, including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards, including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services, including consultants services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons in category 2 &ndash; non-medical card holders &ndash; are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards, including consultants services and out-patient public hospital services, including consult<Col N="455" /> ants' services. The current public hospital statutory in-patient charge is &euro;33 per night, up to a maximum of &euro;330 in any 12 consecutive months. Attendance at accident and emergency departments is subject to a charge of &euro;31.70 where the patient does not have a referral note from his or her doctor. This charge applies only to the first visit in any episode of care. A maternity and infant care service is provided during pregnancy and up to six weeks after birth.</P>
    <P>Alternatively, one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital. Any patient, whether a medical card holder, who opts for treatment in a private hospital or as a private patient in a public hospital is liable for the costs relating to such treatment. A public patient who receives an MRI scan for treatment provided under the Health Acts is not liable to be charged for such a scan. Where a public hospital carries out an MRI scan on a patient referred from another public hospital, a system is in place to allow for charging between the hospitals. Any such charge may not be passed on to the public patient.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that services which are not related to the diagnosis or treatment of a particular condition are provided on a private basis to the consumer. These include, for example, pre-employment screening, screening relating to applications for licences, provision of vaccinations and x-rays for travel abroad. Any charges for such services are the liability of the individual, including those who are medical card holders.</P>

    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin): I propose to take Questions Nos. 517, 543 and 565 together.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware that the Mater Hospital, Dublin, has been designated as the surgical site for the establishment of a lung trans<Col N="456" /> plant facility in Ireland. The provision of a lung transplant unit at the hospital forms part of a major capital development approved for the hospital and considerable preparatory work has already been completed by the hospital in relation to the commencement of this project. An expert consultative group, chaired by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, was established to advise my Department on various issues associated with the development of the programme. The report was the subject of a very positive discussion with the ERHA and the Mater Hospital in March this year. A number of key clinical appointments have already been made at the Mater Hospital, including the appointment of a consultant surgeon and a consultant physician.</P>
    <P>The hospital has now finalised an assessment of the resource requirements associated with the introduction of the programme and this is currently being considered by my Department. I am advised that the hospital proposes to commence lung transplantation towards the end of the current year. Pending the establishment of the programme in this country, an agreement is in place with the Freeman Hospital in the UK for the treatment of Irish patients requiring a lung or heart and lung transplant. To date 19 patients from this country have received a transplant at the Freeman Hospital under the agreement. This contract will continue while the necessary arrangements are being progressed in terms of establishing the programme in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is also important to note that lungs donated in Ireland have been retrieved by the medical team at Newcastle and have helped to facilitate this additional transplant work at Newcastle for the benefit of Irish patients. I assure the Deputies that the establishment of the Irish programme will continue to be progressed as a priority by my Department in conjunction with the ERHA and the Mater Hospital.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the position in relation to VHI or other health insurance and the reason credit or reduced rates cannot be given to persons who qualify for medical cards of public health hospital provision; the fundamental principle involved which prevents this; and if the philosophy behind this matter can be outlined.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13248/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin): There is no relationship between the criteria for eligibility to hold a medical card and the rates applicable to the purchase of private health insurance. The former relates to a statutory based social protection provision, while the latter involves the voluntary purchase of commercial insurance against the risks associated with the cost of illness and is solely a commercial arrangement for the insurance provider, primarily guided by business considerations.</P>
    <P>In terms of health insurance considerations, there are no grounds to require insurance companies to provide cover to persons with medical cards at more favourable rates than the insured community at large. From a regulatory perspective, such a measure would not be compatible with the core principle of community rating in our health insurance system. A broad range of factors could be put forward as justifying reduced premiums for certain categories of persons, for example, a no claims bonus. However, such an approach would be detrimental to community rating.</P>

      <P>A range of dental services for adult medical card holders over 70 years of age are available under the Dental Treatment Services Scheme, DTSS, from participating dentists holding contracts with health boards. In 2002, I provided additional funding of &euro;6.166 million to the DTSS in order to meet an increased uptake of it. The scheme is administered by the general medical service payments board on behalf of boards and it is monitored at a local level by principal dental surgeons with a regional responsibility for the DTSS. The guideline time for replacing dentures is every five years; this time-limit may be varied by agreement with the principal dental surgeon in exceptional circumstances. A difficulty with the provision of dentures to medical card holders under the DTSS has already been raised with my Department and this is being addressed through the appropriate industrial relations mechanism.</P>

      <P>The provision of dental treatment to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. All health boards have adopted a planned targeted approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children. This is to ensure the optimum use of dental resources and equal access for all national school children to the same level of dental care.</P>
      <P>Children in specific classes in national school, usually second, fourth and sixth class, are targeted for preventive measures under the school based approach; the children in these classes are screened and referred for treatment as necessary. The programme has been specifically designed to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school. The screening provided in second, fourth and sixth classes ensures that follow up appointments for examination, treatment or orthodontic review are made, as necessary, with the dental surgeon in the clinic designated for the particular school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, and the Health <Col N="459" /> (Dental Services for Children) Regulations, 2000, children who have attended national school retain eligibility for dental treatment up to their 16th birthday. In 2000, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;3.935 million for this extension of eligibility for the children's dental services. Moreover, an additional &euro;0.203 million and &euro;0.867 million was provided to the Eastern Regional Health Authority in 2001 and 2002 respectively for the recruitment of extra dental teams to provide dental treatment to children up to their 16th birthday.</P>
    <P>I have asked the ERHA for a report in relation to the level of service in Millmount Clinic, Drumcondra. The authority has been unable to provide the information in the time available and I will arrange for the information to be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Between 1997 and the end of 2001, the previous Government invested additional revenue and capital funding amounting to &euro;260.3 million to implement an accelerated programme of development in services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Further additional revenue and capital funding amounting to &euro;51.525 million has been provided in 2002, bringing the overall investment in these services to nearly &euro;312 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When allocating additional funding for new services, estimates are made, based on averaged costs, of the number of new residential and day places which might be expected from this funding. However these figures are subsequently adjusted to take account of the actual number of new places which are provided by the end of the year in question. As the Deputy will appreciate, the cost of providing residential and day places varies, depending on individual client needs. In 2000, which was the first year of the accelerated programme, 422 new residential and 815 new day places were provided. The original estimated figures for the services were 555 residential and 700 day places. In 2001, the original estimated figures for these services were 450 residential and 600 day places, with 395 new residential places and 700 new day places actually provided. The additional funding provided this year will enable <Col N="460" /> over 100 new residential places and a further 600 day places to be put in place.</P>
    <P>In addition to the new residential and day places mentioned above, the additional funding allocated to the services over the period in question also provided for: a significant investment in the respite services; an enhanced level of support for those already in receipt of some level of residential, day, respite or other support services; the enhancement of health related support services to children with an intellectual disability and those with autism; the continuation of the programme to transfer persons with an intellectual disability or autism from psychiatric hospitals or other inappropriate placements; the development of specialist support services for those who require a more intensive level of support; identified needs in existing services.</P>
    <P>In April, 1999, information from the national intellectual disability database indicated that in the period 2000 to 2004, 1,677 new residential and 912 new day places were required to meet the identified needs for these services. It should be noted that in addition to the day places required to meet the needs of those awaiting placement in the services as mentioned above, the additional funding also provided for those requiring a change in day services. For example young people leaving school and requiring rehabilitative training places or those moving from rehabilitative training to other areas of the services such as sheltered work, activation or services for older people. My Department is reviewing on an ongoing basis the position in relation to the implementation of this development programme with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. Information will be available within the next few weeks from the national intellectual disability database in relation to the level of service provision and identified need as of 30 May 2001, which will reflect the impact of the 2000 development programme. Further information in respect of service provision and identified need as of 30 May 2002 will be available later this year. This information will also assist my Department in this matter. The national monitoring committee, which is representative of my Department, the Health Research Board, the chief executives of the health boards, the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies Providing Services to People with Intellectual Disability, the National Parents and Siblings Alliance and the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland, NAMHI, is also involved in the monitoring of this programme.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to fulfilling the commitment which it gave in relation to meeting the needs of this population group, as outlined in the programme for Government.</P>

      <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;53.33 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>
      <P>An Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to extending medical card eligibility in line with the recommendations of the national health strategy and, further, to review cases for the extension of both the medical card and long-term illness schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, is the statutory responsibility of the authority in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have taken a range of important measures to improve the capacity of the public orthodontic services and place it on a sound long-term footing. Structural changes are being introduced into <Col N="462" /> the orthodontic service such as the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>Following agreement at the Health Service Employers Agency, a new grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the public orthodontic service. This agreement resulted from complex and time-consuming negotiations. The introduction of the specialist grade will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics and will address the issues of recruitment and retention of qualified staff.</P>
    <P>In addition, four dentists from the ERHA commenced their training last October for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. My Department has provided &euro;0.405 million to the authority in 2002 for specialist in orthodontics training. The general objective of these training programmes is to educate dentists to become specialists in orthodontics with a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods. They are made possible by co-operation between health boards, consultants and dental teaching institutions. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence this year are also under way.</P>
    <P>In order to enable the achievement of greater caseloads, the Dental Council was requested to produce a scheme to recognise auxiliary dental workers in orthodontics. This grade &ndash; to be known as orthodontic therapist &ndash; will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling a greater volume of treatment. I expect the Dental Council to submit a final scheme for my approval shortly.</P>
    <P>My Department has also funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish committee for specialist training in dentistry through the post graduate medical and dental board. The director has taken up duty and is playing a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes.</P>
    <P>In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. Additional funding of &euro;2.971 million was provided to the ERHA in 2001 for orthodontic services of which &euro;2.044 million was for its orthodontic initiative. This has enabled the authority to recruit additional staff &ndash; including two consultant orthodontists &ndash; and develop new treatment facilities at Loughlinstown and at the regional orthodontic unit located at St. James's Hospital. My Department has also funded a six-chair orthodontic suite for the Northern Area Health Board. The chief executive officer of the ERHA has informed me that the unit is expected to be operational in October this year and will be located in Blanchardstown.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="463" />Furthermore, under this initiative, my Department is exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the ERHA has advised me that at the end of the March 2002 quarter, there were 3,701 persons receiving treatment in the authority's orthodontic service. I am confident that when fully implemented the orthodontic initiative, combined with the structural changes to the orthodontic service, will significantly increase the number of cases in and reduce waiting times for treatment in the ERHA.</P>

      <P>Since 1996, over &euro;103 million has been invested in the development of cancer services under the national cancer strategy. In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy has identified the need for the preparation by the end of this year of a revised implementation plan for the national cancer strategy. This plan is being prepared by my Department in conjunction with the National Cancer Forum and will set out the key areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years.</P>
      <P>As part of this work, a sub-group of the National Cancer Forum has recently been established on generic screening. This group is currently reviewing all issues relating to screening, including looking at specific diseases such as prostate and colorectal cancer. Their recommendations will help to inform policy developments in this area on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. It is expected that phase one of the programme will be completed by December 2002. To date, over 75,000 women have been called for screening and over 55,000 women have been screened, representing an uptake of 73%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential that the programme is driven by international quality assurance and best practice and the experience gained in phase one will facilitate the process of planning and organising the roll-out of the programme nationwide. All of the <Col N="464" /> health boards are represented on the board of BreastCheck by their respective chief executive officers. My Department has been in ongoing consultation with BreastCheck concerning expansion of the programme and will continue to support BreastCheck in moving to nationwide coverage as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Phase One of the national cervical screening programme was launched in October 2000 covering the Mid-Western Health Board area. Under phase one, cervical screening is being offered free of charge, to approximately 67,000 women in the 25 to 60 age group, at five yearly intervals. As with BreastCheck, the importance of a national cervical screening programme which is underpinned by quality assurance and best practice is a key objective and the experience gained in phase one will facilitate the process of planning and organising the roll-out of this programme. Currently the chief executive officers of the health boards are involved in an examination of the feasibility and implications of extending the programme to the rest of the country.</P>

Under the terms of this scheme, persons with an long-term illness card are entitled <Col N="466" /> to receive drugs and medicines for their specified illness free of charge.</P>
      <P>The provision of health related services, including therapy services for persons with cerebral palsy is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Since 1997, the Government has provided additional ongoing development funding of almost &euro;11 million for therapy services, including physiotherapy.</P>
      <P>In response to my concern regarding current labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists including occupational therapists. The study was published in July 2001 and concluded that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of each of the therapy grades, requiring a significant increase in training places.</P>
      <P>Following the recommendations of this report, I announced in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Science, on 29 May last, the provision of 175 extra professional therapy training places, including 25 physiotherapy places, for students to tackle the acute shortage of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists in the health service. This almost doubles the number of therapy places available at present. The first intake to the extra places is expected to commence in the 2002-03 academic year.</P>

      <P>A common list of reimbursable medicines was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme. This list ensures equity between the general medical services and drug payment schemes in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. This common list is subject to ongoing review and amendment on a monthly basis as new products become available and deletions are notified.</P>
      <P>In order for any item to be included in the common medicines list it must comply with a published list of criteria. These range from their authorisation status where appropriate, their price and in certain cases the uses for which the products are intended. In addition, the products should ordinarily be supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public. The product referred to by the Deputy is available in hearing aid centres without prescription.</P>

      <Quest>the situation regarding the retention of secondary benefits, for example, medical cards for persons on community employment schemes; and the process for a person on a community employment scheme who has been informed by the health board that their medical card is being withdrawn.</Quest>

      <P>In relation to the scheme operated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, my colleague, Deputy Mary Coughlan, has informed me that participants on community employment schemes may retain their secondary benefits, at the level which obtained prior to participation in the scheme, subject to a weekly gross household income limit of &euro;317.43. The retention of the medical card is not affected by the operation of the limit.</P>
      <P>The key secondary benefits under the social welfare system are rent and mortgage interest supplement, fuel allowance and back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance. In the case of rent and mortgage interest supplement, the payment is phased out over a four year period, with 75% of the claimants previous entitlement being paid in the first year on the programme and 50%, 25% and 25% being paid in the subsequent three years.</P>
      <P>In relation to retention of medical cards in this area, as part of budget 1996 the then Government announced that &ldquo;persons who have been unemployed for at least one year shall retain their medical cards after entering employment.&rdquo; Persons on the live register for at least one year, who take up paid insurable employment were deemed to meet the criteria for retaining their medical cards for three years. The provision also covers participants on approved schemes applicable to the long-term unemployed, including back to work allowance, BTWA, community employment, Jobstart, job initiative, partnership and community group initiative and development courses such as workplace and vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS. The purpose of the budget provision was to remove disincentives to labour force participation by long-term unemployed persons.</P>
      <P>The retention of medical card eligibility is approved for a period of three years when a person or the spouse of a person who has been unemployed for a minimum of one year takes up employment. In this context, time spent on the live register, approved schemes or courses for the long-term unemployed is treated as an unemployed period.</P>

      <Quest>his plans for targeting health inequalities in accordance with the commitment given to this in the programme for Government.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13444/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>A wide range of plans is in train to target health inequalities in accordance with the commitment in this regard in the programme for Government. These plans build on the substantial investment in social inclusion issues made over the period 1997-2002. Plans going forward are set in the context of the national health strategy: Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, which has been identified in the programme for Government as the blueprint for the future direction and development of the health services. One of the key underpinning principles in the strategy is equity. The strategy was developed following an extensive consultation process including that carried out with vulnerable groups as part of the process of developing health targets for the national anti-poverty strategy. These latter have been taken on board as an integral part of the national health strategy. Some examples of plans for targeting health inequalities are outlined below.</P>
      <P>The health strategy provides a framework for the reform of the acute hospital system and for improved access for public patients. It includes a plan covering the action required to address the issue of waiting lists and particularly waiting times. The target set out in the strategy is that by the end of 2004 no public patient will wait longer than three months for treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To achieve this target the current waiting list initiative, which directs additional resources to health agencies to enable them to carry out waiting list procedures, will continue to operate. In addition a new dedicated treatment purchase fund has been set up for the purpose of purchasing treatment for public patients from private <Col N="470" /> hospitals in Ireland and from international providers. A sum of &euro;30 million has been provided in 2002 for this fund. This considerable investment is in addition to the existing waiting list initiative funding of &euro;43.8 million in 2002.</P>
    <P>The single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. In this context a comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted in both the acute and non-acute sectors. I recently announced the commissioning of an additional 709 acute beds in public hospitals at a cost of &euro;65 million. This is the first phase of the provision of an additional 3,000 acute beds over the period to 2011, as announced in the health strategy.</P>
    <P>The national health strategy contains a commitment to establish a national hospitals agency to plan the configuration of hospital services. Work is under way in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to ensure not only that vulnerable groups have access to care in acute hospitals, and elsewhere in the health system, within a reasonable time but also that the care they receive is of the highest quality. To that end the Irish Health System Accreditation Agency, an independent statutory body, has been established and the accreditation scheme will initially operate in eight major acute teaching hospitals. The first hospital survey under the scheme is planned for mid-2002. The total investment in the scheme to date stands at &euro;4.127 million.</P>
    <P>Government has approved the establishment of a national task force on medical staffing. The task force will, among other issues, consider the proposed development of a consultant delivered public hospital service, which would guarantee availability of a senior hospital doctor at all times, for which resource and cost implications need to be quantified.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the continued development of a hospital service which will provide patients with the best possible care from well trained and fully qualified health professionals, using treatments based on best practice and evidence-based medicines at whatever time and in whatever circumstances they are admitted to hospital.</P>
    <P>The extension of the 24 hour general practitioner co-operative initiative, as mentioned in the health strategy and the programme for Government continues and will be in all regions by the end of 2003.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government contains a commitment to the development of a network of primary care centres where general practitioners, public health nurses, physiotherapists and other health professionals will work together to improve the care available to all groups. This commitment is in line with the primary care strategy, Primary Care: A New Direction, which I launched in conjunction with the national health strategy. A task force and budget has been put in place to take this development forward in 2002. Stakeholder involvement including the community and voluntary pillar is being secured <Col N="471" /> through a broadly based steering group and it is intended to have a number of initial implementation projects commenced in 2002.</P>
    <P>The development of the primary care system will provide: A greatly strengthened primary care system which will play a more central role as the first and ongoing point of contact for people with the health-care system;an integrated, interdisciplinary, high-quality, team-based and user-friendly set of services for the public; enhanced capacity for primary care to complement the existing diagnosis and treatment focus in the areas of prevention, early intervention, rehabilitation and personal social services.</P>
    <P>A key objective will be to ensure that services meet the special needs of particular groups or communities and are directed at reducing health inequalities.</P>
    <P>The key health target chosen by Government in its review of the national anti-poverty strategy is to reduce the gap in premature mortality between the highest and lowest socio-economic groups by at least 10% for circulatory diseases, cancer and injuries and poisoning by 2007. A wide range of actions across the whole spectrum of health services and in other sectors is required to achieve this. The Department is committed to the further development of a NAPS health implementation framework to ensure a coherent and integrated approach to the achievement of the NAPS health targets.</P>
    <P>The cardiovascular health strategy &ndash; Building Healthier Hearts &ndash; noted that the lower socio economic groups are disproportionately affected from heart disease. In this context two targets have been set for 2010: The medium term objective is to bring Irish levels of premature deaths from cardiovascular disease in line with the EU average at a minimum; and the longer term goal is to reduce Irish rates to those of the best performers in the EU.</P>
    <P>Funding of &euro;45 million has been allocated to the implementation of the strategy to date across a range of services including, health promotion, primary care, pre hospital, hospital and cardiac rehabilitation. In relation to future plans one of the implementing structures, the advisory forum, has recommended a prioritisation to the implementation of the 211 recommendations. I am committed to implementing the strategy in a coherent manner in line with this prioritisation, within available resources.</P>
    <P>The national cancer strategy, Cancer Services in Ireland: A National Strategy, was published in 1996. Since that time, over &euro;103 million has been invested in the development of cancer services. In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy has identified the need for the preparation by the end of this year of a revised implementation plan for the national cancer strategy. This plan is being prepared by my Department in conjunction with the National Cancer Forum and will set out the key <Col N="472" /> areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years.</P>
    <P>In relation to children the Government is committed to moving forward on the basis of implementing the national children's strategy.</P>
    <P>We will continue to implement the Children First guidelines for the prevention, identification, reporting, assessment, treatment and management of child abuse in all its forms. Children First are national over-arching guidelines and are being implemented as a priority in all health boards. Significant additional resources have been made available to health boards over the past three years to progress implementation and a national advisory group on the implementation of Children First advises health boards on implementation matters. A dedicated resource team from the Health Board Executive, HeBE, is also assisting the regional health boards in the implementation process and the social services inspectorate is monitoring implementation. A full independent evaluation of Children First will also be initiated in 2003.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government pledges to establish the office of the children's ombudsman and to have the office fully operational during 2002. The legislation to establish the office was signed by the President on 2 May. Work is ongoing at present to recruit the ombudsman and to staff the office.</P>
    <P>Family Support and other community-based early intervention services including Springboard will be expanded under a new programme of investment. My Department is committed to undertaking a review of family support services, which it is intended will commence in 2002.</P>
    <P>The youth homelessness strategy provides a strategic framework for youth homelessness to be tackled on a national basis. The Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards have submitted draft implementation plans based on the objectives of the youth homelessness strategy. The National Children's Office has lead responsibility for driving and co-ordinating the actions necessary to ensure the successful implementation of the strategy.</P>
    <P>Capital investment of approximately &euro;38.092 million, including &euro;4.63 million in 2002, is being made available by Government through the health boards to put in place additional high support and special care places to provide for a small group of children who need more intensive intervention than mainstream residential or foster care services. The number of high support and special care places has increased from 17 in 1996 to a current total of 94 with an additional 41 high support-special care places due to be introduced on a phased basis from mid-2002.</P>
    <P>The Children Act, 2001, was passed by the Oireachtas in June 2001. My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has the main responsibility for the Act. A plan to implement the Act on a phased basis was put forward by the then Minister of State with responsibility for children and was approved by the Cabi<Col N="473" /> net Committee on Children at its meeting in March 2002. Work on the regulations to bring into effect the sections of the Act relating to non-offending children is in progress.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government sets out a number of specific initiatives to improve the health and well being of drug misusers. These include the efficient operation of regional drugs task forces, the expansion of treatment and rehabilitation programmes, and the monitoring of specific prevention, supply reduction and treatment targets. These initiatives will be progressed within the context of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, which provides a focused plan for the improvement of the health and well being of drug misusers.</P>
    <P>In relation to services for older people, the programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a home subvention scheme to maximise support to those needing full time care in the community. As outlined in the recently published health strategy, the expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has shown that current funding arrangements do not effectively support home care. The Government intends reforming the operation of existing schemes in order to introduce an integrated care subvention scheme which maximises support for home care.</P>
    <P>One of the groups which experiences significantly worse health status than the general population is the Traveller community and one of the NAPS health targets is to reduce that difference and earlier this year I launched, Traveller Health &ndash; A National Strategy 2002-2005. This strategy provides a clear statement of policy which focuses on the underlying problems associated with the poor health status of the Traveller community and sets out a realistic and practical plan for specific improvements in that status.</P>
    <P>Significant additional funding amounting to &euro;312 million has been invested in recent years to enhance the level of support services available to people with an intellectual disability and those with autism. The Government is committed to continuing this programme of investment to meet identified needs in this population group. There is specific objective in the health strategy to complete the transfer of persons with an intellectual disability from psychiatric hospitals as soon as possible and not later than 2006. Additional funding was provided for an extra 500 rehabilitative training places across all health board areas in 2002.</P>
    <P>Between 1997 and 2002, funding of over &euro;179 million has been provided for the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, to enable them to live as independently as possible within the community either on their own or with their families.</P>
    <P>The Mental Health Act, 2001, was enacted in July 2001 and will significantly improve safeguards for persons with a mentally disorder who are involuntarily admitted for psychiatric care <Col N="474" /> and treatment. The Act will bring Irish law in this area into conformity with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The Act provides for the establishment of an independent agency to be known as the Mental Health Commission whose primary function will be to promote and foster high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to ensure that the interests of detained persons are protected.</P>
    <P>The health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, includes a commitment to prepare a national policy framework for the further modernisation of the mental health services, updating the 1984 policy document, Planning for the Future. It also includes a commitment to intensify the existing suicide prevention programmes over the coming years. The Government is fully committed to ensuring that further investment takes place in this area, building on the achievements to date.</P>
    <P>The national health strategy recognises that if health status and particularly the health status of vulnerable groups is to be improved then initiatives in the health sector must be supported by health promoting policies in a range of other sectors whose activities impact on health. In this context health impact assessment will be introduced, led within my Department by a population health division. Statements of strategy and business plans of all relevant Government departments will incorporate an explicit commitment to sustaining and improving health status. A national environmental and health action plan will be prepared.</P>
    <P>Relevant, accurate and timely information is essential in identifying and addressing health inequalities. A national health information strategy is currently being finalised. Key developments will be the establishment of a health information and quality agency and a national population health observatory. Enhanced health service and population health data will greatly improve our ability to measure areas of inequality, to adopt targeted strategies and to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. An important aspect of this work will the provision of appropriately disaggregated data to improve service planning, provision and monitoring for vulnerable groups in line with the commitment to this in the review of the national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS. It is also relevant to mention that the Department continues to support the areas of reserach and monitoring with, for example, the commissioning of the second nationally representative lifestyle survey in 2002. Such surveys provide valuable data on the link between poverty and health and help formulate and inform policy development to reduce health inequalities.</P>
    <P>The national health information strategy will provide an essential framework for the subsequent development of a national information and communications technology, ICT, plan for the health services. This will be carried out under the auspices of the health boards executive and <Col N="475" /> will constitute a health services wide, ICT, response to the health and primary care strategies. It will provide a cohesive and cost effective framework for fully exploiting the potential of ICT and support a broadening of access to expert care. It will also integrate closely with the overall eGovernment initiatives. The introduction of the electronic healthcare record and a health information portal will be part of this.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the plans I have outlined above together with other measures detailed in the national health strategy provide a coherent basis for targeting health inequalities in accordance with the commitment given to this in the programme for Government.</P>

    <P>The work of the expert group on the development of radiotherapy services is at an advanced stage. I have been advised that all health boards, including the South Eastern Health Board, have been afforded the opportunity to meet with the group. Due to the importance and the complexity of the work, it is not possible to give an exact date for the report of the expert group but it is anticipated that their work will be completed in the near future.</P>

      <P>Each year, my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance notifies each health board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority of its determination for the following year. This would include ongoing funding for existing services, together with any additional funding which has been made available for new service developments. It is a matter for the individual health board-authority to allocate these funds having regard to the level of service provided by the board-authority.</P>
      <P>In relation to the agency specifically mentioned by the Deputy, officials from my Department met with representatives of the agency in late 2001. It was explained to them that while the Department had no funding available to it at that time from which financial assistance could be given, consideration would be given in the context of the 2003 Estimates discussions, to the need for core funding which had been identified for the agency. However should an opportunity to assist them arise in the meantime, my Department will follow this up with the agency.</P>

      <P>I announced approval for phase 2B of the Longford-Westmeath General Hospital on 19 July 2001. The current estimated cost for the project is in the region of &euro;60 million. The projected programme for design, build, equip and commissioning of the total project is for completion by 2006-2007. Elements of the project will be handed over in stages. It is not possible at present to give estimated expenditure for each year of the project given the possible implication of future construction inflation and without a design proposal illustrating the phased development of the project. It is a matter for the Midland Health Board to progress the project under the NDP in the light of prioritising capital demands on the funding resources available each year.</P>
      <P>A design team for the project had been selected by the board and funding of approximately &euro;0.6 million has been provided by my Department in the current year for the preparation of a development control plan for phase 2B.</P>

In terms of intellectual disability and autism, there will be provision for over 100 new residential places; 75 new respite places; 600 new day places; the further enhancement of health related support services for children with an intellectual disability and those with autism; the continuation of the programme to transfer persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements; and the further enhancement of specialist services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 579 and 582 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Road Traffic (General and Ordinary <Col N="490" /> Speed Limit) Regulations, 1992, S.I. No. 194 of 1992, provides that a speed limit of 50 mph applies in respect of heavy goods vehicles. It is an offence for such a vehicle to be driven at a speed in excess of that speed limit on any road in respect of which a speed limit of 50 mph or higher applies. Where a road speed limit of 30 mph or 40 mph applies on a road, heavy goods vehicles must comply with that speed limit. Decisions in relation to the speed limit to be applied in respect of any road are a matter for the determination of the local authority.</P>
    <P>The Road Traffic Acts already provide an ample framework for the application of restrictions or prohibitions on the use of roads by traffic based on the weight of the vehicle. The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997, S.I. No. 182 of 1997, gives local authorities the power to apply restrictions to heavy goods vehicles from entering particular public roads or areas. The application of any such restrictions on any particular route is a matter for the individual road authority concerned.</P>

      <P>In accordance with EU Directive 96/96/EC, passenger cars are required to undergo a roadworthiness test when they are four years old and every two years thereafter. The age and consequently the first-test-due date is determined by reference to the date of initial registration of the vehicle with subsequent test-due dates falling every two years after the first test-due date. Where a NCT inspection does not occur on the original test due date, the NCT certificate is valid from the date of the test to the next test-due date. This is to ensure that the car is again liable for a test in accordance with the test schedule laid down in the directive. As ownership is not a criterion in determining the test due dates, I have no plans to change the current arrangements.</P>

      <Quest>the major projects under his Department included in the national development plan; the initial cost of each of these projects; the current revised cost of each project; the action he intends to take to address this difficulty caused by inflation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13858/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer this question on the basis of the transport, energy and communications functions for which my predecessor had responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of public transport the national development plan sets out a programme of investment in public transport to address the key infrastructure deficits in the greater Dublin area and nationally. The plan provided for the following investments in 1999 prices: Dublin suburban <Col N="493" /> rail, &euro;235 million; Luas, &euro;546 million; Dublin Bus network development, &euro;279 million; mainline rail, &euro;635 million; regional, rural and provincial bus services, &euro;173 million; integration, &euro;63 million; accessibility, &euro;13 million and rural transport, &euro;4.4 million.</P>
    <P>In addition, a rail contingency fund of &euro;635 million was set aside for future development of the suburban rail network pending further evaluation of a range of options to address deficits in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, the DTO &ldquo;Platform for Change&rdquo;, published in November 2001, identified the requirement for significantly enhanced projects over and above the NDP to address the deficits in the public transport infrastructure in the greater Dublin area. The &ldquo;Platform for Change&rdquo; sets out a programme of investment over the period 2000 to 2016 at an estimated cost of &euro;21.9 billion. Key projects include: an enhanced bus network in Dublin; an increased number of rail cars; a major enhancement of the DART network to increase the capacity of the operation from six car to eight car trains; a major enhancement of the planned works on the Kildare route for suburban and mainline services; an enhanced Luas system for Dublin; and a metro from the Dublin area, being procured by the Railway Procurement Agency on a PPP basis.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, additional funding is being made available for public transport projects to reflect this enhanced investment programme. In the current year, &euro;410 million is being made available compared to &euro;253 million in 2000. This is apart from EU funding and the funding available from own resources of CIE and the RPA. In addition, new methods of funding capital projects will be explored on the basis set out in the programme for Government.</P>
    <P>My Department recently announced the allocation of over &euro;9 million in funding under the national development plan for capital works at the country's six regional airports for the period 2000 to 2003. The primary focus of these allocations is to facilitate improvement works and upgrades in facilities to maintain continued safety and viable operation at the regional airports. This funding is the first round of funding to the regional airports under the NDP provision. A further round of financial allocations to the regional airports for the period 2004 to 2006 is intended to follow next year's mid-term review of the NDP.</P>
    <P>The amount allocated to each of the six airports is as follows: Donegal, &euro;980,100; Sligo, &euro;709,000; Galway, &euro;1,739,000; Knock, &euro;2,100,000; Kerry, &euro;1,739,000; Waterford, &euro;1,895,000. In total, this amounts to &euro;9,162,100. As the allocations have only just been announced, the question of a current revised cost for each project does not arise. I am confident that the projects which were selected for support under the airports measure will be delivered on time and within the overall projected costs of those projects.</P>
    <P>With regard to renewable energy, a total of &euro;30 <Col N="494" /> million has been allocated to the grid upgrade infrastructural programme. This programme is designed to upgrade the electricity network at strategic locations to accommodate additional renewable energy projects, particularly wind energy projects. Inflation will not have any impact on the costings of the scheme as the funding provided to selected projects will not exceed the overall allocation.</P>
    <P>With regard to telecommunications, under the provisions of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, my predecessor signed nine contracts in 2001 for the provision of advanced information communication technology, ICT, infrastructure in the regions. The nine projects are listed below. The funding for these projects is fixed.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to an application to establish a project under the Garda youth diversion scheme.</P>
      <P>All applications for Garda youth diversion projects must first be approved and recommended by the chief superintendent, Garda community relations section, who, in turn, channels them to my Department, where they are further examined before a final decision is made.</P>
      <P>Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of such projects, from 12 in 1997 to 64 at present, a process made possible, in part, by funding under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. The locations of the new projects were decided upon according to local needs, prioritised by the Garda authorities, in conjunction with my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remain committed to the provision of diver<Col N="495" /> sionary services for young people at risk. However, I must also have regard to financial constraints. In this respect, further projects can only be established if and when resources allow and according to the prioritisation of local needs on a national basis. I assure the Deputy that the application for the Listowel-north Kerry area will remain under review in this context.</P>

As soon as I have reached a decision on the matter, both the applicant and the Deputy will be informed of the outcome.</P>

      <P>The Probation and Welfare Service has a strategy for the localisation of service offices. At present the service has offices in Crumlin, Dún Laoghaire, Ballyfermot, Finglas and Tallaght. Other offices are planned for Parnell Street, Bray, Blanchardstown, Ballymun and the south inner city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over three years ago, as part of the service's strategy already mentioned, the probation and welfare service and the Office of Public Works identified offices in the Donaghmede shopping centre as being suitable for a service office. The <Col N="498" /> Office of Public Works and the owners of the premises of Donaghmede shopping centre negotiated a contract to rent the offices. In March 2002 planning permission was sought to adapt the building to service the needs of the probation and welfare service. The permission was obtained and the next stage will be to tender for and carry out work on the premises. This process will take approximately 12 to 18 months. The office will not become operational until this work has been completed.</P>
    <P>A new facility of the nature proposed is necessary to serve the needs of Donaghmede and surrounding areas and is necessary for the delivery of the obligations on the probation and welfare service for family conferencing under the recently enacted Children Act, 2001. In addition the following services will be provided: liaison with local community organisations and other agencies, including an Garda Síochána, the offices will be used as a venue for meetings with those and other agencies; management of persons on court orders coming from the local area; local office for the north Dublin probation and welfare service.</P>
    <P>On the 20 May 2002, probation and welfare service personnel met with traders at Donaghmede shopping centre. A further meeting took place on 23 May 2002, at the Office of Public Works and was attended by service personnel and representatives of Harcourt Management Properties, the owners of Donaghmede Shopping Centre. The representatives of the owners of the centre were advised of the issues raised at the meeting with the traders. The owners undertook to meet with the traders again and to report back to the Office of Public Works. It would be inappropriate to make any further statement on this matter until such time as the owners report back to the Office of Public Works.</P>

    <P>The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000 to 2006 is administered by ADM Limited on my behalf. Applications for grant assistance are evaluated under five main criteria: socio-economic and demographic profile of the area; quality of the proposal; capacity of the group to implement the project; level of integration or co-ordination; costings and value for money.</P>
    <P>On receipt of funding under the programme, each grant recipient must provide a quarterly report on the progress of the project, from both a financial and an operational standpoint. In addition, grant recipients are subject to audit by Irish and EU officials to ensure compliance with their contractual obligations. Grant recipients must comply with the Child Care (Pre-school Services) Regulations, 1996, which are administered by the health boards and must, where relevant, submit their most recent inspection report with their application for grant assistance.</P>
    <P>The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme does not prescribe fee structures for grant recipients, but each grant recipient must be able to meet all their operational costs from their income &ndash; including fee income &ndash; and their staffing grant assistance.</P>

      <P>The Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, contains a number of controls regarding the availability and possession of offensive weapons and other articles. Obviously, this legislation recognises that there are various purposes for the possession of knives and only penalises in cases where they are carried for no good reason. Section 9 of the Act provides that it is an offence to have any knife or any other article which has a blade or which is sharply pointed in any public place without such good reason or lawful authority. The penalty on summary conviction for this offence is a fine up to &euro;1,270 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 of the 1990 Act makes it an offence to trespass with a knife or any article made for causing injury to or incapacitating a person intended for such use. Section 11 makes it an offence to produce any article capable of inflicting serious injury in a manner likely to intimidate another person, in the commission of an offence or in the course of a dispute or fight. The penalty on conviction on indictment for the above named offences is a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both. The manufacture, importation, sale, hire or loan of a range of offensive weapons is prohibited by <Col N="503" /> section 12 of the Act and also by the 1991 offensive weapons order made under the Act.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the House that my Department and the Garda authorities have considered all aspects of this issue and are of the view that the matter would best seem to be addressed by the strict enforcement of the existing legislation and the exercise of a responsible approach by the sellers of these objects. While I have no plans to amend existing legislation in this area, I would, of course, be prepared to consider any submissions which might be made to me in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been very significant developments in relation to the provision of child care over the last number of years. In 1997, the Government established the Partnership 2000 expert working group on child care &ndash; chaired by my Department &ndash; with the responsibility to develop a national strategy for the child care sector to meet the needs of society in general. The expert working group made a series of recommendations to Government in February 1999 on the development of quality child care services to meet the increasing demand by parents for child care places. This report forms the basis of the Government's current child care programme in relation to the development of the supply side of child care.</P>
      <P>In 1998, my Department developed the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 1998-1999 which provided funding under a broad range of initiatives from a social inclusion and equal opportunities perspective. The programme had a budget of almost &euro;14 million and provided capital grants for the establishment, upgrading and enhancement of 106 community based child care facilities as well as grants towards the cost of two senior level child care personnel in each of 25 identified flagship community projects. Funds were allocated to employer involvement in child care provision, enhancement of the national voluntary child care organisations whose membership base comprises service providers, completion of a national child care census and database and a research project in relation to family friendly policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child care was identified as a priority area for investment in the National Development Plan 2000-06 and initially &euro;317.43 million was made available under the plan. The importance of child care was further endorsed with an allocation of &euro;33.65 million under the anti-inflationary package in October 2000. In addition, in February 2001, the Cabinet committee on social inclusion <Col N="504" /> decided to transfer to my Department responsibility and certain funding for child care initiatives previously included in the Votes of the Departments of Education and Science and Social Community and Family Affairs. As a result, I have now a total of &euro;436.79 million available to me over the period 2000-06 to develop the child care sector. The primary objectives of this funding are to increase the availability and quality of child care places. This funding has an equal opportunities and social inclusion perspective and focuses on provision of child care to allow parents, particularly women, to avail of training, education or employment.</P>
    <P>The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-06 was launched in April 2000. It makes available capital and staffing grants for community based-not for profit child care organisations, capital grants for self-employed-private providers, being made available for the first time, while grants are also available for quality improvement projects and innovative projects.</P>
    <P>Since the availability of funding was formally announced in April 2000, funding of over &euro;111 million has been committed to 1,136 child care projects on the ground, both in the community and private sectors. Almost 33,000 child care places are being supported by this tranche of funding which will include the creation of almost 15,000 new child care places. The funding will also enable many of the services extend their hours of operation and enhance the quality of the child care provided. In addition, funding of over &euro;18 million has been approved for quality improvement projects such as the county child care committees, the national voluntary child care organisations and innovative projects. This brings the total amount allocated under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme to almost &euro;130 million to date and ensures that parents in all parts of the country will have access to quality child care places.</P>
    <P>In addition, my colleague, the Minister for Finance makes available a number of tax reliefs in relation to child care facilities, the purpose of which is to help increase the supply of affordable child care places. Capital allowances are available for capital expenditure on the construction, extension and refurbishment of a building, or part of a building &ndash; or the conversion of an existing building &ndash; which is used for the purpose of providing a pre-school service, day care or other child care facility. The premises must not include any part of a building in use as, or as part of, a dwelling. There is also an exemption to the usual benefit-in-kind provisions for employees who enjoy free or subsidised child care facilities provided by their employers. In such circumstances, the employer must be wholly or partly responsible for both financing and managing the child care facility. The benefit-in-kind exemption applies whether the employer provides the facilities &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; or in a premises made available by the employer in another location which suits the employer and employees. The exemption also <Col N="505" /> applies if an employer provides child care facilities jointly with others, for example with other employers or with a voluntary body. To cater for circumstances where the employer may opt not to be involved in the management of the child care service, the benefit-in-kind exemption was amended last year to cover instances where the employer provides financial support for items of capital expenditure and equipment but not other costs, such as salaries. This provision was introduced to make the scheme more attractive to the many employers who did not want to be involved in the day to day management of the facility.</P>
    <P>In relation to the cost of child care and financial support for parents, the Government consulted widely and ultimately considered a universal child benefit system to be the most equitable approach to this issue. In this regard, the improvements in child benefit introduced in the past two budgets are part of a three year programme which will see an additional &euro;1.27 billion invested in child related payments. The recently published programme for Government and the progress of my Department's equal opportunities child care programme is confirmation of the Government's commitment to developing and reviewing child care services and to keeping child care at the forefront of its social agenda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have responsibility for policy in relation to family re-union &ndash; that is the policy in relation to granting permission to enter and remain in the State to the spouses and children of non-EEA nationals who are legally resident in the State. This includes the spouses and children of non-EEA nationals who have entered the State for work purposes. While I have responsibility also in relation to the protection of their rights under equality legislation, their entitlement to other benefits is a matter for other Ministers as part of the mainstream provision of various services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully acknowledge that family reunion policy should recognise the needs of persons coming to Ireland to work and be in accordance with the <Col N="506" /> broad needs of Irish economy. However it must also embody reasonable safeguards. While in most cases where a person comes to Ireland in order to take up employment, everything will go according to plan, unfortunately the experience is sometimes not so straightforward. The concern therefore has been that were a person's family to join them immediately and they were then to lose their job or otherwise become a burden on the State the costs involved are likely to be much higher and the prospect of securing the person's departure much lower, given that their family will have settled here and formed links.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the foregoing, policy operates in the following manner. There is no general policy of restriction in operation in relation to family reunion where the family members in question are not visa required. The only caveat is that the worker in question must be in a position to support the family without recourse to public funds. The spouses and children of the vast majority of foreign workers in the State fall into this category. There are restrictions on family reunion for visa required family members since in general terms persons from visa required countries pose the greater immigration related risks. In the case of visa-required family members of non EEA national workers, the general rule is that it is only after the worker has been in the State for 12 months and has been offered employment for a further 12 months that they may be joined by their families. Again, this is subject to the worker being able to support the family without recourse to public funds.</P>
    <P>In 2000, the aforementioned 12 month waiting period was reduced to three months by my predecessor in the case of the family members of workers operating in certain specified high skill areas covered by the working visa programme. The considerations underpinning this policy in the case of visa required family members is to ensure that that the worker's presence in Ireland has a degree of stability and is likely to be for the longer term. In such circumstances it is humanitarian and generally appropriate to allow family reunion. Our practice avoids us allowing family reunion to persons whose employment relationship is not yet &ldquo;up and running&rdquo; and where that relationship may prove to be short-term. Our approach is broadly in line with international practice.</P>
    <P>In relation to equality entitlements of work permit holders and their families, the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000, outlaw discrimination on nine distinct grounds, namely, gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community in the work place and in the provision of goods and services. Work permit holders would be entitled to the protection offered under both Acts in relation to employment and the provision of goods and services. Family members, not in possession of a work permit, would nat<Col N="507" /> urally only come within the provisions of the Equal Status Act, 2000.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that an application for a Garda CCTV system for Drogheda is currently under consideration by the advisory committee that was established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate CCTV applications. The advisory committee are also considering applications from other cities and towns throughout the country. When this process is completed, they will submit their recommendations to me and I will then decide on the matter.</P>
      <P>Applications for Garda CCTV systems are assessed by the advisory committee on the basis of Garda operational needs and include the following criteria: crime-public order statistics in the area; population and level of activity there; the recommendation of local Garda management and any special circumstances or needs that exist and the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system on that area. Co-funding is a feature of Garda CCTV systems and this is usually addressed when it has been decided to install a Garda CCTV system in an area.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to note that the number of Garda CCTV systems are to be extended. As part of the first tranche of this expansion, CCTV systems are to be installed in Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Tallaght and Waterford. Contracts have been placed in respect of the town centre CCTV systems for Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick. It is intended that these CCTV systems will be installed and operational by the end of 2002. The planning in respect of the town centre CCTV systems for Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford is well advanced and it is expected that tenders will be invited via the EU Journal and the national newspapers soon. Work on installing systems in a further seven areas &ndash; Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clonmel, Ennis, Kilkenny and Sligo &ndash; will commence in 2003. This will bring the number of areas where Garda CCTV systems are to be extended to by 2003 to 17 in all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some applications for CCTV systems that have <Col N="511" /> been received by the advisory committee relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. To this end, a grant scheme was announced last month to facilitate community based groups who wish to press ahead with their own local CCTV system. Grant assistance of up to &euro;100,000 will be available from my Department towards the cost of such schemes. It will be up to the community groups, in conjunction with the relevant local authority to install, maintain and monitor the community based CCTV schemes. To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards will have to be met and the gardaí will have to be allowed access to grant aided systems as and when they require it. A prospectus has been prepared by my Department which provides information on how to apply for grant-aid funding, outlines the application process and identifies the main issues that applicants will need to consider. Copies of this prospectus are available upon request from the Garda administration division of my Department.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that two burglaries were reported in the weekend from Friday, 31 May 2002, to Monday, 3 June 2002. I understand that two persons were arrested in connection with the burglaries and that property was recovered by the Gardaí. An alleged larceny of petrol from a filling station was also reported on the same weekend, which is currently under investigation. I am also informed that no burglaries were reported on the weekend from 7 June 2002, to 10 June 2002. I understand that one person was arrested in connection with alleged criminal damage and public order offences, and that two persons were arrested and charged in connection with an alleged attempt to pass counterfeit sterling notes. The gardaí are also investigating the alleged larceny of diesel, an attempt to pass counterfeit notes, dangerous driving and assault.</P>

      <P>The Legal Aid Board administers civil legal aid under the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, and regulations made thereunder. This Act allows for the provision of legal aid and legal advice in civil cases to persons who satisfy the financial eligibility and merits criteria laid down in the Act and regulations. The Act also provides for dissemination of information in relation to its services and their availability. Each application for legal aid is considered in accordance with the terms of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, and regulations made thereunder.</P>
      <P>Both refugees and asylum seekers, who satisfy the financial eligibility and merits test laid down in the 1995 Act and regulations made thereunder, will qualify for legal aid in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Refugee Legal Service, RLS, was established by the board in 1999 to provide legal advice and assistance at all stages of the asylum process to persons applying for asylum in Ireland. Legal advice is available from the RLS for: the initial completion of the asylum application questionnaire; preparation for the initial interview; attendance at the interview, if the Legal Aid Board considers that attendance is required; review of the interview notes after the interview; making of post interview submissions within the seven day time limit; advising an applicant of the decision at first instance and of the options open to the applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legal aid is provided to applicants in relation to the lodgement of appeals before the Refugee Appeals Tribunal against a recommendation of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner to refuse status. Legal advice is also provided in appropriate cases on immigration matters. Where refugee status is refused, assistance is provided generally in the submission of applications pursuant to the Immigration Act, 1999, and matters arising therefrom. Assistance is <Col N="515" /> also provided in relation to deportation orders and judicial review proceedings.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that additional staffing resources have been allocated to the western region recently. I am further informed that as a result of this the arrears of cases in hand was initially stabilised and is now starting to decrease. While the intake of applications has increased by 6% over the first five months of this year the output of dealings has increased by 20% and the output of copy folios with filed plan maps has increased by 74% over the same period. The Registrar of Titles expects that this trend will continue throughout the year and that the service the Land Registry provides to their customers in the western region will continue to improve.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that the Land Registry has recently commenced a major programme under which all existing paper folios and filed plan maps will be imaged and available over the Internet by the end of 2004. The five counties of the western region will be the first to have the benefit of this programme. Imaging of Galway folios and filed plans has commenced and it is hoped that all of the western region will be completed before the end of the year. I am also informed that in the case of urgent applications the Land Registry will continue to prioritise these applications in order to facilitate their customers.</P>

Most of these action plans and associated local targets have now been completed and they provide a clear framework for the planning and delivery of support and services to the homeless.

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Current regional waste management plans provide for the progressive development of segregated collection of dry recyclables from households in urban areas, where it is economically feasible to do so. To date, a number of local authorities working in partnership with the private sector have developed such schemes. In Dublin more than 180,000 households are currently serviced, and it is anticipated that this service will extend to more than 250,000 households by the end of the year. Segregated collection has also been introduced in other areas including Galway, Nenagh, Waterford and parts of Louth and Meath. Repak Limited, the voluntary industry initiative for the recovery <Col N="518" /> of packaging waste, subsidises packaging waste recovery by local authorities through segregated kerbside collection schemes. Local authorities also have powers under the Waste Management Act, 1996, to require the segregation and separate collection of household waste and I expect local authorities to use these powers where appropriate in support of increased segregated kerbside collection.</P>
      <P>While my Department's grant scheme for waste infrastructure will provide capital support for recycling facilities, an ongoing subsidy for segregated waste collection is not envisaged. I will continue to monitor and keep under review progress in relation to the expansion of segregated collection of recyclables.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 633 and 639 together.</P>
      <P>South Dublin County Council applied to my Department on 7 May for approval for the use their internal capital receipts to fund any excess expenditure on the disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes. My Department's reply of 31 May 2002 indicated that the priority claim on the use of internal capital receipts is assigned to the main local authority housing programme and the remedial works scheme but that it is open to the local authority to use any surplus internal capital receipts over and above this requirement to assist in the funding of the above grant schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of the essential repairs grant scheme is delegated to local authorities and has been designed to give authorities an appropriate degree of flexibility in its administration. Within broad overall guidelines set by my Department, it is a matter for each local authority to decide the level of funding to be provided for the scheme in their area, to assess the circumstances of each individual applicant, to decide what works are necessary to prolong the useful life of the house for the occupants, to determine the level of grants in individual cases and the circumstances in which a grant may be paid. The regulations governing the essential repairs grant scheme do not require local authorities to operate a means test. However, in determining priority among grant <Col N="519" /> applicants, local authorities have regard to relative means and needs.</P>

      <P>The criteria to be applied to the provision of public open space in housing schemes is a matter for each planning authority in accordance with its development plan. When deciding on planning applications a planning authority must have regard to the policies set out in the plan and may attach conditions to permissions requiring the provision of appropriate facilities. The planning guidelines on residential density published by my Department in September 1999 indicate that public open space is one of the key elements in defining the quality of the residential environment. The guidelines recommend that the achievement of higher densities must be coupled with a higher standard of residential environment: the provision of higher quality communal and public open spaces is therefore highly important. The guidelines recommend that any acceptance of lower quantitative standards of open space must be accompanied by a parallel increase in qualitative <Col N="520" /> standards of open space. The guidelines recommend for higher density developments that in greenfield sites public open space should be a minimum of 15% of the total site area and in all other cases it should be a minimum of 10%.</P>
      <P>The social housing design guidelines published by my Department in September 1999 contain recommendations regarding open space within social housing schemes. They recommend that regard should be had by local authorities to the size of the scheme, the nature of the accommodation being provided, existing open space provision in the area and the requirements of the development plan for the area in deciding on the extent and nature of provision for public open space within a scheme.</P>

      <P>The management, maintenance and improvement of their rented dwellings, including the installation of central heating, is in principle the responsibility of local authorities to be financed from their own resources. However, where capital funding is provided under remedial or regeneration schemes operated by my Department for the upgrading of local authority dwellings the provision of central heating may form part of the work undertaken. To date, such funding has been provided to Dublin City Council under the following schemes: the remedial works scheme which assists local authorities in carrying out major essential works to dwellings in designated estates; the special area regeneration programme which consists of a <Col N="521" /> once-off programme of upgrading high density older flat complexes; and the redevelopment of a number of seriously rundown flat complexes involving a mix of new building, refurbishment and, where appropriate, demolition and replacement. My Department has provided some &euro;210 million to Dublin City Council under these schemes to date, in addition to the major programme of regeneration of Ballymun.</P>
      <P>Local authorities may also seek my Department's approval to use their internal capital receipts which are surplus to the requirements of the local authority housing construction and remedial works scheme programmes for the provision of central heating in their rented housing stock. Apart from the foregoing, there is no specific funding mechanism available from my Department for the installation of central heating in local authority rented dwellings and Dublin City Council has been advised to this effect.</P>

      <P>My Department amended the terms of the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme in November 2001 to provide that up to 25% of accommodation in new projects undertaken under the scheme may be allocated to elderly emigrants returning to this country who satisfy eligibility criteria drawn up in connection with the Safe Home programme. Allocation of accommodation under the amended scheme is not contingent on persons being included or accepted for inclusion in the housing authority assessment of housing need. Instead, specified conditions in relation to their present circumstances and inclusion in the Safe Home waiting list are relevant. This obviates the need for elderly emigrants to have returned before they are considered for voluntary housing under the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter for the relevant voluntary housing body to select suitable candidates from the Safe <Col N="524" /> Home waiting list in consultation with Safe Home and the housing authority concerned. My Department has already asked housing authorities to facilitate approved voluntary housing bodies in operating the amended scheme. Officials of my Department, in the course of direct contact with relevant officials of housing authorities, request that they encourage individual voluntary housing bodies undertaking sheltered housing projects under the capital assistance scheme to provide for the needs of returning elderly emigrants. Formal monitoring of the scheme will be initiated shortly by my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Security arrangements at British nuclear power plants, including Sellafield, are a matter for the British authorities. Nevertheless, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, has been in regular contact with the UK's nuclear installations inspectorate, NII, with a view to obtaining as much information as possible with regard to security measures at such facilities. Following the <Col N="525" /> 11 September attacks, the Irish Embassy in London contacted the relevant Government Departments to ascertain the security measures in place at nuclear installations. The embassy was informed by the UK's Department of Trade and Industry, DTI, that it is not UK Government policy to disclose details of security measures taken at civil nuclear sites. However, the DTI indicated that stringent security measures applied and that these were regulated by the DTI's Office for Civil Nuclear Security, OCNS. The OCNS works closely with the UK's health and safety executive, which provides advice on the safety implications of events including external hazards such as plane crashes at nuclear installations. The DTI also confirmed that security and safety precautions at nuclear installations are kept under regular review and that the regulators were reviewing all relevant precautions in the light of the events of 11 September.</P>
      <P>On 3 November 2001 the head of safety at BNFL, in a speech to a public forum on Sellafield in Drogheda, invited the RPII to assess the BNFL evaluation of the consequences of a large aircraft deliberately crashing into the high level radioactive liquid waste storage tanks at Sellafield. As a follow-up to the BNFL invitation, the RPII and BNFL met in Dublin on 14 January 2002. BNFL outlined its evaluation on a confidential basis, and assured the RPII that the storage tanks are robust enough to withstand such an attack. The issue of security at Sellafield was also raised at a meeting between the NII and the RPII on 30 November 2001. At this meeting the NII chief inspector indicated that he was under instruction not to discuss the details of these arrangements and that any request for such information should be directed to the DTI via the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</P>
      <P>The OCNS recently prepared a report for the DTI on the state of security in the civil nuclear industry and the effectiveness of security regulation. This concludes that, <i>inter alia</i>, &ldquo;stringent security precautions are being taken to protect civil nuclear sites and material in the United Kingdom, commensurate with current threats to national security&rdquo; and &ldquo;satisfactory arrangements have also been made with the Ministry of Defence to protect civil nuclear sites from attacks from the air&rdquo;. However, the RPII has advised my Department that due to UK security restrictions neither BNFL or NII briefings nor the OCNS report provide sufficient technical detail to enable the RPII to evaluate these conclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following approaches to the UK authorities on behalf of my Department, seeking information on the consequences of a major terrorist attack on Sellafield, the DTI conveyed an offer under which the director of the OCNS would meet with the RPII in London to explain the processes which the OCNS follows to assess the terrorist threat, evaluate the vulnerabilities and develop effective countermeasures. In conveying this offer, the DTI has emphasised that it is not in a position to provide details of security measures <Col N="526" /> being taken at nuclear sites as it is not UK Government policy to disclose such details. My Department is in contact with the DTI to finalise a date for this meeting which, it is envisaged, will take place in July and will also involve my Department.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government has in place a national emergency plan for nuclear accidents. This is designed to respond to a major disaster at a nuclear installation in the UK or elsewhere which would result in a major release of radioactivity into the environment and pose a radiological hazard in Ireland, whether caused by an accident or a terrorist attack. All the information gained by the RPII with regard to safety and security measures at British civil nuclear power plants provides constant input to our emergency planning and management response programme. An information booklet, National Planning for Nuclear Emergencies, published by the Department of Public Enterprise in March 2002 sets out the principal features of the national emergency plan. An information leaflet summarising the main elements of the booklet has been distributed to every household in the country.</P>

In relation to the introduction of additional grant schemes for islanders to ensure that non-Gaeltacht islanders have access to the same schemes as Gaeltacht islanders, the Deputy should be aware that many of the schemes available to Gaeltacht islanders such as Scéim Labhairt na Gaeilge, the Irish-speaking scheme, and Scéim na bhFoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge, the Irish language learners scheme, are language-oriented and would be of little or no benefit to non-Gaeltacht islanders if extended to them.

      <P>The income maintenance needs of asylum seekers are met for the most part by health boards which administer the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme on behalf of my Department. The SWA scheme provides entitlement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>Where a person has access to some resources either in cash or in kind this is taken into account in determining entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance. This occurs in the case of asylum seekers who are being provided with full board accommodation under the direct provision system operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Direct provision came into effect on 10 April 2000.</P>
      <P>Where a person in direct provision receives all meals and has access to other facilities such as laundry and leisure areas the recommended weekly allowance is &euro;19.10 per adult and &euro;9.60 per child. These rates are currently under review by a working group which was established to examine certain issues related to the assessment of need for supplementary welfare allowance purposes. Furthermore, as is the case with all persons who are resident in the State where there are other reasonable expenses, exceptional needs payments will be made by the health board.</P>
      <P>Asylum seekers who have not been provided with full board accommodation in direct provision and who have no other means qualify for the full standard rate of weekly SWA. This amounts to &euro;118.80 per week for a single adult, &euro;197.60 per week for a couple and &euro;16.80 per week for a dependent child. Asylum seekers who arrived in the State prior to the introduction of direct provision and who live in private rented accommodation qualify for rent supplement on the same basis as other recipients. For example, a single person living in Dublin can receive up to &euro;99.38 per week towards rent, while a family can receive up to &euro;269.30 per week, depending on the number of people in the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A small number of asylum seekers are in receipt of other social welfare payments such as one parent family payments, pensions or disability allowance. Asylum seekers and refugees are also entitled to child benefit at the standard rate in respect of their children. The monthly rate is &euro;117.60 per child for the first and second child <Col N="530" /> increasing to &euro;147.30 for third and subsequent children.</P>

      <Quest>her views on the assessment of means for non-contributory old age pension, as many pensioners do not get anything near 10% interest on their savings; the changes in the exemption disregard amount in recent years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In assessing means for old age, non-contributory, pension purposes, account is taken of any cash income the person may have, together with the value of capital and property. For the purposes of assessing the value of capital and property a notional assessment method is used. The use of the notional method avoids the necessity of frequent reviews of the entitlements of a very significant number of recipients whenever interest rates fluctuated or whenever the capital was moved from one investment option into another.</P>
      <P>Up until 1997, the assessment rates for savings that applied to old age, non-contributory, pensions were: first &euro;253.95, £200.00 &ndash; nil; next &euro;476.15, £375.00 &ndash; 5%; balance &ndash; 10%.</P>
      <P>Gradually between 1997 and 2000 the method of assessing capital was streamlined across the various social welfare schemes. As the most recent step, my predecessor made provision in the Social Welfare Act, 2000, for the introduction of a new assessment method for capital which came into effect from October of that year. This new method applies to all social assistance schemes, other than supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>Under the new method the first &euro;12,697.38, £10,000, of capital is disregarded; capital between &euro;12,697.38, £10,000, and &euro;25,394.76, £20,000, is assessed on the basis of &euro;1.27, £1, weekly means for each &euro;1,269.74, £1,000, of capital; capital between &euro;25,394.76, £20,000, and &euro;38,092.14, £30,000, is assessed on the basis of &euro;2.54, £2, weekly means for each &euro;1,269.74, £1,000, of capital; and capital above &euro;38,092.14, £30,000, is assessed on the basis of &euro;5.08, £4, weekly means for each &euro;1,269.74, £1,000, of capital.</P>
      <P>The revised arrangements introduced in 2000 considerably benefited both single and married old age, non-contributory, pensioners by up &euro;27.93 per week in the case of single pensioners and &euro;41.90 per week in the case of married pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently, assuming that persons have no other means, a single pensioner with capital of up to &euro;20,315.80 will qualify for a full pension while single pensioners with capital of up to &euro;63,486.89 will qualify for a minimum pension. The equiv<Col N="531" /> alent figures for married pensioners are &euro;40,631.61 and &euro;126,973.80, respectively.</P>
    <P>The effective rate of assessment of capital depends on the level of capital: for example, it is less than 3% for a pensioner couple with savings up to &euro;25,000, and less than 4% for a pensioner couple with savings up to &euro;63,000. The new system continued and enhanced the policy of ensuring that those with modest amounts of capital receive the greater share of available support, while the small proportion of people with large amounts of capital should avail of it to contribute, at least partially, towards meeting their needs.</P>
    <P>The arrangements introduced in 2000 were also, from the point of view of both customers and departmental staff, relatively simple to use and to understand. However, while the introduction of the euro has not changed the provisions in any way, a degree of mathematical complication has inevitably occurred. My Department is currently examining a range of options designed to simplify the present system and I look forward to considering these as part of the budget process later this year, having regard to available resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Act, 1966, introduced an occupational injuries scheme which replaced the workmen's compensation scheme and provided for compulsory insurance against injury arising out of, and in the course of, employment and against prescribed diseases due to the nature of the employment. Contributions were paid into the occupational injuries fund and a range of benefits were paid from that fund. The occupational injuries fund was merged with the social insurance fund in 1990.</P>
      <P>The principal occupational injuries benefits payable, at present, are disablement benefit, injury benefit and death benefit pension. The weekly rates of these benefits over the period from 1993 to date is shown in Tables 1 and 2 which follow while the rates of disability benefit and invalidity pension are shown in Table 3. Death benefit pension is the only occupational injury scheme which is payable at different rates depending on death benefit pensions, whether payable to widows and widowers aged 66 and over and those under 66, are paid at a higher rate than similar age related social welfare payments. For example, the current rate of death benefit pension payable to person age 66 or over is &euro;4.40 higher than the rate of old age contributory pension and &euro;6.90 higher than the rate of widow/er's contributory pension. The rate payable to persons aged under 66 is &euro;23.30 higher than the analogus rate of widow/er's contributory pension.</P>
      <P>The aim of the special increases which have been given to those aged 66 and over since 1998 was to achieve the last Government's priority of the attainment of a minimum rate of &euro;127 a week for all social welfare old age pensioners by 2002. This target rate has now been well exceeded for all pensioners.</P>
      <P>There are a number of important commitments in the new Government's An Agreed Programme for Government in relation to social welfare rates generally; in particular, the Government is committed to increase the level of the basic State pension to &euro;200 per week by 2007. The level of future increases in the rates of occupational injuries benefits generally will be considered in the context of the overall social welfare commitments in the new programme.</P>
      <P>In addition, the question of providing more preferential benefits as a consequence of accidents at work is one of the issues being addressed in the context of the expenditure review of the illness and disability payment schemes, which is currently being carried out. The findings of this review will guide future policy in this regard, and I look forward to receiving the results later this year.</P>

According to the records of my Department, this cheque was cashed on 19 June 2001. There is no further pension due to his estate.</P>

      <P>There is a statutory obligation on all claimants for one-parent family payment to make, and continue to make, appropriate efforts in the particular circumstances to obtain maintenance in respect of themselves and-or their children from their former spouse or partner. This obligation reflects the general policy of the scheme that, in so far as possible, one-parent families should be maintained by their former spouses or partners rather than have to rely on social welfare support.</P>
      <P>The person concerned applied for one-parent family payment in January 2002. She was asked by the Department to seek maintenance from her spouse by contacting her local district court clerk, and to forward documentary evidence to the Department that she had done so. Her claim was rejected by the Department when she failed to supply the necessary information.</P>

      <Quest>if she will investigate the legitimacy of the recent changes to fostering allowance whereby a payment from her Department, namely orphan's allowance, was incorporated into the fostering allowance paid by the Department of Health and Children; the legislation under which this was passed; if it was clearly stated that orphan's allowance and fostering allowance could not be paid together; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Report of the Working Group on Foster Care was published by the Department of Health and Children in May 2001. <Col N="542" /> The report proposed that the weekly rate of foster care allowance be increased from &euro;90.85 to &euro;253.95 for children aged under 12 and from &euro;108.63 to &euro;279.34 for children aged over 12.</P>
      <P>In light of the Report of the Working Group on Foster Care, the Government decided to increase the rate of the foster care allowance as recommended while also ensuring that all foster children benefit from the orphan's (non-contributory) pension or orphan's, contributory, allowance.</P>
      <P>I understand that there were a number of foster carers and members of the Irish Foster Care Association represented on the working group and that there was wide consultation and general agreement on the recommendations of the report. The working group on foster care also highlighted &ldquo;the need for administrative efficiency in the payment structure as well as the adequacy of financial supports to foster carers&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, orphan's payments which were formerly paid by my Department on behalf of some children in foster care, are now payable in respect of all foster children. Since August 2001 the orphan's payment is paid directly to the health board, on behalf of, and for the benefit of, children in foster care. It is also the case that an orphan payment will continue to be paid in respect of eligible children up to age 22 where they are in full-time education.</P>
      <P>Under the new arrangements a foster parent receives a much higher single payment from the health board and no longer has to apply for separate discretionary payments from the health boards or for orphan payments from this Department. This change in arrangements addresses many of the concerns raised by the Irish Foster Care Association concerning the involvement of my Department in foster care situations. It also accords with their strong recommendations that the foster care allowance should be inclusive of all former discretionary payments and entitlements.</P>
      <P>These arrangements are under social welfare legislation which provides that the orphans payments may be made to the guardian or to another person for the benefit of the child. In the case of children taken into care, the health board is the legal guardian.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed and was paid unemployment benefit for the full period from 10 May 1999 to 10 June 2000. At the time of making her claim she indicated that she was fully unemployed and, during the period of her claim, she did not advise the Department that her circumstances had changed. She subsequently signed off the register to commence community employment, which ended in September 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned made a further claim to unemployment benefit on 5 September 2001. This claim was awarded at that time and payment continued until 6 February 2002. Following a review of her entitlement, it was established that the person concerned had been employed for one day per week for the entire period of the first benefit claim. Payment of benefit for the days on which <Col N="544" /> she worked was, therefore, inappropriate and an overpayment of &euro;979.44 occurred.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the person concerned was employed for part of each week in which she claimed benefit, she was not entitled to credited contributions for that period. To qualify for payment of unemployment benefit in respect of her second claim, which commenced on 5 September 2001, the person concerned would have required to have had at least 39 PRSI contributions paid or credited in the relevant contribution year governing that claim, the 1999-2000 tax year. As a consequence of the revised decision made in relation to her previous benefit claim, it transpired that she no longer had sufficient paid or credited contributions to enable her to requalify for payment due to the disallowance of the credits originally awarded in respect of first claim. Insurance contributions payable in respect of the employment for a day per week throughout that period were at a rate which provides cover for occupational injuries only.</P>
    <P>A deciding officer disallowed the unemployment benefit paid to the person concerned for 57 days during the period 10 May 1999 to 10 June 2000 on the grounds that she was not unemployed. The deciding officer also decided that the person concerned was not entitled to unemployment benefit from 5 September 2001 to 6 February 2002 on the grounds that she had insufficient relevant contributions in the governing contribution year. Payment of benefit to her for the period 5 September 2001 to 6 February 2002, which amounted to &euro;877.50 was, therefore, inappropriate. The total overpayment arising from these decisions amounts to &euro;1,856.94.</P>

      <P>The statutory agencies operating under the aegis of my Department are the Pensions Board, the Combat Poverty Agency, Comhairle, the Social Welfare Tribunal, the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland and the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board. I have made no appointments of the kind referred to by the Deputy in his question since taking office on 6 June 2002.</P>
      <P>The following appointments were made by my predecessor, Deputy Dermot Ahern, during the period in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="545" />The Pensions Board was established under the Pensions Act, 1990, and has the general function of monitoring and supervising the operation of the Pensions Act and pensions developments generally. The Pensions (Amendment) Act, 2002, provides for the addition of a representative of pensioner interests and a representative of consumer interests. Michael O'Halloran of the Senior Citizens Parliament and Carmel Foley, Director of the Office of Consumer Affairs, were appointed from 1 June 2002.</P>
    <P>The Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board was established on 5 June 2002. The establishment of the board stems from the enactment of the Dormant Accounts Act, 2001. While the main purpose of the Act is to reunite account holders with their dormant funds in banks, building societies and An Post, it also provides for a scheme to disburse unclaimed moneys for projects and programmes designed to alleviate poverty and social deprivation. The scheme will also be applied to programmes to assist people with disabilities or primary school students with learning difficulties.</P>
    <P>The membership of the board includes representatives from the financial services industry, community and voluntary sector, disability organisations and the education sector. Following are the board members: chairperson &ndash; Conleth Bradley, barrister; members &ndash; Deirdre Carroll, assistant secretary, Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs; Úna Henry, nominated to represent the community and voluntary sector; Professor Áine Hyland, Vice President of University College Cork, to represent the educational sector; Dónal O'Siochain, first officer, captain and former director of Aer Lingus; Gerry Ryan, former general secretary of the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland and nominated to represent the disability sector; Séamus Thompson, chief executive of the Irish Wheelchair Association; Enda Twomey of the Irish Bankers' Federation, representing the financial services industry; and Frank Ward, solicitor.</P>
    <P>Legislation to establish the Family Support Agency was finalised with the passing of the Family Support Agency Act, 2001, and I propose to establish the new agency shortly. The new agency will provide a family mediation service; support, promote and develop the provision of marriage and relationship counselling and other family supports; and support, promote and develop the family and community.</P>
    <P>It will also undertake research, provide and disseminate information about parenting and family issues and provide advice to the Minister on matters relating to its functions.</P>
    <P>The Act provides that there shall be 12 members, including the chairperson. These shall include persons with an interest and expertise in the functions of the agency, one member of staff of the agency a representative of the Minister and not more than three officers of another Minister of the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" />I propose to appoint the following individuals as members of the Family Support Agency in the near future: Chairperson &ndash; Mr. Michael O'Kennedy, senior counsel and former Government Minister, TD and EU Commissioner; members &ndash; Ms Clare Cashman, youth and community worker, Resource Centre, Ballingarry, County Tipperary; Ms Sinéad Hanly, counsellor and barrister, Dublin; Mr. Dick Hickey, director, St. Brigid's Family Resource Centre, Waterford; Mr. Brendan Murphy, psychologist and member of the Mediators Institute of Ireland, Dublin; Dr Colm O'Connor, clinical psychologist and director, Cork Marriage Counselling Centre; Ms Muriel Walls, solicitor and family law specialist, Dublin; Ms Deirdre Carroll, assistant secretary, Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs; Bríd Rocks, remedial teacher and psycho-therapist, Cooley, County Louth.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of &euro;9 per week is normally paid to eligible households. However, an additional &euro;3.90 per week is paid in smokeless zones, bringing the total amount in those areas to &euro;12.90 per week. In the case of a relatively small number of people living in smokeless zones, the &euro;3.90 per week smokeless fuel supplement only is payable.</P>
      <P>The conditions of the scheme are that the applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, satisfy a means test, and must live alone or only with other qualified persons.</P>
      <P>Over the course of recent budgets a number of improvements have been introduced in relation to the operation of the scheme. In the budget of 2001, the duration of the fuel season was extended from 26 weeks to 29 weeks. The fuel season now runs from the first week in October until late April. In addition, the means test was eased. Since October 2001 a person may have a combined household income of up to &euro;50.79 per week or savings-investments of up to &euro;41,266.49 over and above their pension and still qualify for a fuel allowance. In the budget of 2002 the payment rate of the standard fuel allowance was increased, with effect from January 2002, from &euro;6.35 to &euro;9 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the scheme now running for 29 weeks of the year, from early October to April, there will <Col N="547" /> be periods when the allowance will be paid although temperatures are above the seasonal norm. Equally, there may be a small number of occasions outside of the heating season when the allowance is not paid even though temperatures are unseasonably cold. However, as the scheme extends for almost seven months of the year this is likely to be the exception rather than the rule.</P>
    <P>Any further extension of the duration of the national fuel scheme would have cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    <P>Although the national fuel scheme operates for a fixed period, there is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs at any time of the year. This operates in addition to the national fuel scheme. Under the SWA scheme, a person who has exceptional heating costs due to ill health or infirmity may qualify for a heating supplement. This can be paid as a weekly supplement in addition to other social welfare payments. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides support to carers on low incomes who look after people who are in need of full-time care and attention. It is not a payment for caring.</P>
      <P>The means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more generous in terms of the assessment of household income and it is necessary in order to target scarce resources towards those who are most in need of support. These views were borne out in the review of the carer's allowance, published in October 1998.</P>
      <P>However, to increase the number of carers eligible for carer's allowance, the Agreed Programme for Government commits to the relaxing of the means test so that all those on average industrial incomes can qualify. The current weekly income disregard is &euro;191 for a single person and &euro;382 for a couple. Average industrial earnings at December 2001 were &euro;491.30 per week. Further improvements in the means test will be examined in the context of the next budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health strategy proposes to reform existing arrangements for carers in order to introduce an integrated care subvention scheme which maximises support for home care. Following on from this, An Agreed Programme for Government has committed to introducing a new home subvention <Col N="548" /> scheme to maximise support to those needing full-time care in the community. My Department has already begun to work with the Department of Health and Children to develop proposals in this area.</P>
    <P>In addition, the strategy proposes that a co-ordinated action plan to meet the needs of ageing and older people be developed by the Department of Health and Children in conjunction with my own Department, the Department of Public Enterprise and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. This wider approach is the most appropriate way to proceed.</P>

      <P>The treatment benefit scheme operated by my Department provides to insured persons and their dependent spouses a range of services in the area of dental, optical and aural benefit. The availability of these benefits are subject to certain PRSI contribution conditions. The PRSI contribution classes which qualify for treatment benefit are A, E, H and P.</P>
      <P>The PRSI contribution eligibility requirements vary depending on the insured person's age. Persons aged under 21 must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work in order to qualify while persons aged from 21 to 24 must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year. In the case of persons aged from 25 to 65, the requirement is that they have at least 260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year. Persons aged 66 or over are required to have at least 260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in either of the last two tax years before reaching age 66.</P>
      <P>The relevant tax year for claims made in the year 2002 is 2000-01. Currently I have no specific proposals for changing the qualifying contribution conditions. However, my Department monitors the operation of the treatment benefit scheme on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>A condition for receipt of the fuel allowance is that the claimant must reside alone or only with certain excepted categories of people. These categories comprise a dependent spouse-partner, dependent child or children, a person who would qualify for the allowance in their own right, a person who gives the claimant full-time care and attention if he or she is disabled or a semi-invalid, or a person receiving short-term unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>In July 2001, the person concerned applied for the fuel allowance. However, her application had to be disallowed on the basis that her son who was residing with her was not one of the excepted categories of people mentioned above. However, he subsequently applied for and was awarded a carer's allowance with effect from 20 December 2001. As a consequence, his mother would have had an entitlement to the allowance from that date.</P>
      <P>On this basis, a decision has been made now to award a fuel allowance to the person concerned with effect from 21 December 2001. A cheque for &euro;156.70, representing arrears of the allowance for the 18 week period from 21 December 2001 up to the end of the heating season on 25 April 2002, will be issued to her shortly. In future, this allowance will be paid automatically as part of her pension payment, provided her household circumstances remain unchanged.</P>

      <P>The Family Mediation Service is a free, professional and confidential service which assists couples who have decided to separate or who have already separated, to reach agreement on all issues related to their separation. It assists couples to address the issues on which they need to make decisions, including post-separation living arrangements, finances and parenting arrangements to enable children to have an ongoing relationship with each parent. The benefits of family mediation as a non-adversarial approach to resolving the issues which arise on marital separation are well known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with Government policy, the Family Mediation Service has been radically expanded over the last five years and is now available in Dublin, Limerick, Athlone, Castlebar, Cork, Dundalk, Galway, Tralee and Wexford. The Dublin service has been expanded and relocated to larger premises to deal with more clients and new services have been established in Tallaght, <Col N="550" /> Marino &ndash; serving Coolock and the northside of Dublin &ndash; and most recently in Blanchardstown.</P>
    <P>Efforts are continuing to recruit a suitably qualified family mediator to work in the north west of the country or indeed, to identify a person from the region who is suitably qualified to undergo training in the profession so that the people of Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal can have ready access to this important service.</P>
    <P>The Family Support Agency Act, 2001, which I plan to bring into effect from the beginning of September provides a statutory underpinning for the future development of the Family Mediation Service. The overall objective of the agency is to give more families throughout the country access to this and other valuable support services. The expansion of the Family Mediation Service to the north west, will continue to be a priority for my Department and for the new agency.</P>
