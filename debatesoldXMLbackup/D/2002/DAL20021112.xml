      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>Expenditure by my Department to date is on target and it is expected that overall spending in 2002 will remain within this year's agreed Revised Estimates. I do not anticipate any specific cutbacks or adjustments to the Department's Vote for this year. Nevertheless, expenditure will be incurred with regard to seeking to achieve best value for money, consistent with provision of the services funded by the Vote. Details of expenditure figures to the end of September follow in a table which shows the Department's spending to be within budget for the first nine months of the year.</P>
      <P>Expenditure versus Profile at the end of September 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The 14% was an overall figure. The figure in my Department is well within the 14%, therefore it is not profiled against the 14%. I am not sure what the percentage is. The Deputy is asking if I am taking the figure for the year, plus 14%, and benchmarking against that. I am not. It is within the actual figure profiled for the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach wishes to show good example, let me remind him of what he could do. The budget for his Department is approximately £30 million out of a public spending budget of &euro;30 billion. Under the Freedom of Information Act I received information that his Department's expenditure is approximately &euro;2 million per month.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should submit a question to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's expenditure is &euro;2 million per month up to the end of September. That means he could have a saving of &euro;9 million at the end of this year. However, he has not offered up these savings in the context of what the Government requested Departments to do. Will he explain why, under the e-commerce budget, his Department's expenditure was &euro;7,000 in July , &euro;96,000 in August, it will rise to &euro;540,000 <Col N="5" /> in October, &euro;660,000 in November and &euro;683,000 in December? Is this not a complete sham in order that the money will be spent in its entirety in some form or other merely to comply with the budget allocated? The budget the Taoiseach was allocated showed &euro;660,000 expenditure on consultancy, &euro;400,000 of which has been spent. How much of that money has been spent on public relations and how is it proposed to spend the remaining &euro;200,000? </P>
      <P>In terms of leadership and good example, would it not be better if the Taoiseach continued the level of expenditure to date, which would give him a &euro;9 million saving? This is the equivalent of one million hospital visits. The charges have increased by &euro;8 because the savings were not coming through. Would this not be a good example and good leadership for the Taoiseach to demonstrate? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question is in order, but the second is going into detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in reply to Deputy Rabbitte, overall spending will remain within &ndash; hopefully well within &ndash; the agreed Revised Estimates for 2002. My budget profile at the end of September was &euro;23,761,300 and the actual expenditure was &euro;19,360,200. The Deputy highlighted a figure associated with the Information Society Commission. The budget profile for this was &euro;535,700 at the end of the third quarter and the actual expenditure was &euro;185,700. The Deputy also mentioned consultancy figures. In my Department this is mainly made up of expenditure associated with outside agencies. The budget profile for this was &euro;487,600 and the actual expenditure was &euro;382,600, so the Deputy will see that I was well within the budget profiles entering the last quarter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach says he is well within his limit, but he has not explained on what the &euro;382,600 was spent in the area of consultancy. How much of this went on public relations? What will the other &euro;200,000 be spent on? In view of the fact that expenditure has risen by 48% in the past 22 months, is it not clear that the Government has a responsibility to introduce fiscal legislation requiring Ministers to stay within the budget allocated to them by the Cabinet for the running of their Departments for the year? Is that not a moral responsibility, in view of the fact that a total shambles has been made of running the public finances in an efficient, competent and professional manner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Minister must endeavour to stay within the figure allocated to him in the volume of Revised Estimates. As stated earlier, 14.4% was the figure set down and I will achieve that. For other Ministers there are reasons for going outside these figures, particularly on <Col N="6" /> demand-led schemes. In some areas, schemes are totally dependent on how many people turn up for treatment or services. One cannot take an arbitrary budget position, although it would be nice. We cannot say that as soon as the figure in the Estimates is reached treatment must be cut off. That would be neither humane nor practical. Departments such as mine do not provide services like that so figures can be cut down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach could have offered &euro;9 million himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever figure is decided in the budget for my Department is used and in the mid-term review every year I must offer up any savings I have. That is the normal practice and has been so for a long time. It is not as easy for other Ministers in line Departments which provide services to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Which organisations constitute the new National Economic and Social Development Office? Is it fully up and running yet? This seems to represent the biggest increase in the Taoiseach's subheads. What is the approximate range of pay increases enjoyed by the different categories of staff over the last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The organisations making up the new office, which come under a range of subheads in my Vote, are the National Centre for Partnership and Performance itself, which is the new agency, the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Economic and Social Development Office. They will all come under one heading as soon as the legislation is passed in the House. The organisation is working on an interim basis but for all purposes other than legislative it is up and running. It has the benefit of pulling the organisations together, not only enabling them to share administrative and research services but also streamlining their activities. They will be able to pool their analytical and statistical work. It will ultimately result in increased savings and efficiency. Salary and wage increases in my Department are all as per PPF and there are no increases over and above that. There would have been the 1% lump sum in April and the 4% in October, with other incremental increases.</P>

      <P>The responsibilities of the Taoiseach's Department could be broken down into areas dealing with public relations and presenting the message the Taoiseach wants to get across, and other areas dealing with disadvantage, basic income and those affected by drugs. Will the Taoiseach tell the House if, when trying to come within the terms of the budget limitations, he will focus on all areas within his Department or will he target the PR area for cutbacks and not the disadvantaged?</P>

      <P>My net total budget at the end of September is &euro;90,360,000. Consultancy services, about which I recently answered a written question, take up &euro;382,000 of that total. Even if I did away with all consultancies, not just those related to PR, and that figure does not include PR consultancies, that would be the contribution to my Department.

      <P>I doubt the Taoiseach is disinterested in PR. Under subhead A7, expenditure in May was &euro;67,000 while in June there was no expenditure. Is that not unusual? On subhead A8, will the Taoiseach explain why, for the last three months of the year, expenditure will be in excess of 1,000% up on any other month of the year except one? Where is this money being spent? Have contracts been placed that are only now coming into play? Why is expenditure rising so sharply and suddenly in the last three months of the year?</P>

      <P>My Department always pays a month or six weeks in arrears. On the information given to the House by Deputy Kenny, in May I spent no money. As for profile expenditure, in the latter months there would not be many commitments or contracts in my Department because, other than salaries and other office expenses, most money is used for committees, such as the information society, partnership and millennium committees. The profile, other than annual bills, does not change that much. I must report each month to the Department of Finance on the profile for the month but the main aim is to come in within the figure in the Revised Estimates, which is my intention.</P>

If the figure for PR consultancy is not contained in that provision, how much is provided for PR? Is the <Col N="8" /> Taoiseach saying that staff in his Department benefited in the year 2002 only from increases permitted under the PPF or is he excluding staff in his personal office? Is he aware, either from this side of the House or from his own colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party, that the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas employs Deputies' secretaries at &euro;327 per week? Will he agree that this is an anomalous position that cannot be sustained given the job of work that Deputies' secretaries are expected to do?</P>

      <P>To start at the end, I know only too well the job that constituency secretaries do for Deputies. It is an important, detailed and difficult job and one which may be more difficult in some areas than others but certainly it is a difficult job, and their pay rates are put forward from time to time. When I was a Whip I was involved in the initial discussions to set up the structures and the whole system 20 years ago. I am not familiar with the detail now because they are not subheads of my Department. I was familiar with them for many years through the negotiations and set up the entire structure. I know they are represented by SIPTU and that they keep those discussions with the Department of Finance and the Houses of the Oireachtas in train. I am sure they fight their case in the normal way.</P>

      <P>As regards consultancy services, as I outlined in reply to a question recently most of the figure for consultancy services was for consultants doing various jobs for the Department. There is no PR contract from the Department for me or for the Department as such. They are all consultancy services. I can provide that figure again but I think it is in a reply to a parliamentary question which I gave to Deputy Durkan, if I recall correctly, about a week or two ago.</P>

Two weeks ago Deputy Kenny questioned me on that particular issue. The other people in the Department are paid as per the allowances.

The members of my Department received increases under the PPF. Those on contract received the terms of their contract, but those increases would also be in line with the PPF, other than what I stated, concerning two of the staff in my Department who retired or did not continue on. One was elected to the Seanad and one left my employment. They received their statutory amounts which, needless to say, had nothing to do with PPF.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals in my Department to mark the 80th anniversary of the foundation of the Free State in December 2002.</P>
      <P>While it is the general practice to commemorate significant anniversaries of major historical events, it would not be appropriate to commemorate the 80th anniversary this year, as we commemorated the 75th anniversary of both the foundation of the State and the meeting of the first Dáil relatively recently, in 1997 and 1994 respectively.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will recall that in December 1997 a State Reception was held in Dublin Castle and 12 special postage stamps were issued to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the coming into operation of the Constitution of the Irish Free State Act.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the 75th anniversary of the first Dáil was commemorated in April 1994 by the holding of a State Reception in the Mansion House and the issue of a special commemorative postage stamp.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Those were two of the key events leading up to the birth of the State. If the Taoiseach does not think it appropriate to commemorate the 80th anniversary, is he aware that there is no definitive list of those who lost their lives in the War of Independence or the Civil War? Would it not be an appropriate commemoration to make available an official definitive list of combatants and non-combatants as well as people killed in error, as happens in other countries in relation to similar events or wider scale conflicts, or as happens, for example, in the case of the tragedies in Northern Ireland of the past 30 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the practice over the years that 50th and 75th anniversaries are commemorated by the State. I am following that practice which has been followed by successive Governments. Otherwise there would be many events to commemorate. I did commemorate these events on important dates. A commemoration was held five years ago in Dublin Castle for the 75th anniversary, which was a major occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Rabbitte's second question, the records of such data are held in the Department of Defence. If the Deputy says it is <Col N="11" /> not a definitive list, I accept that. I know from personal experience of seeking data on individuals or relevant papers on behalf of families, that the Department has an authoritative list. If it is not a definitive list, I assume that is because it has not been possible to put one together. In the 1950s the Department endeavoured to produce a list that included not only those who were deceased, but medal-holders and those who held various ranks. That list has been updated and is still used when relatives make inquires and for numerous other purposes. I raised the matter with the Minister for Defence. I do not know why there is no definitive list. Obviously it was not possible to compile one at the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year the Taoiseach led the ceremonies in respect of the interment in Glasnevin of those who were shot in Kilmainham. Let me follow on Deputy Rabbitte's question by saying this is the 80th anniversary of a critical year in this State's history. I note the Taoiseach has &euro;66,000 in his Department's Estimate for commemorative events. On what is it proposed to spend that money? Is there any element of it allocated to the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the foundation of the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not. That money is good for two purposes &ndash; the Robert Emmet commemoration and I cannot recall the other. However, the event five years ago was elaborate and a lot of work went into it. I am sure it will be the same for the next major anniversary, as is the practice. Otherwise, those events would have to be organised on an on-going basis&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has treated us to one of his classics by saying that &ldquo;the importance of the language is vitally important.&rdquo;  Given that fact and that the participation rates in the deontais na Gaeilge schemes for those who speak Irish on a constant basis has declined seriously in recent years and that as a consequence the Taoiseach presides over its decimation as a spoken language, would he not consider it appropriate that there should not only be a cultural or artistic commemorative event but also a scholarship scheme to support investment and participation in the language on the 80th anniversary of the foundation of the State? I ask this especially given that his own party has always had as one of its twin pillars the restoration of the Irish language, which we are far from, and that such a commemoration would be very appropriate, as others have said.</P>

      <P>As I stated, some years ago I held the first reception ever to honour those who were active in restoring and developing the language throughout the State. It was held in Dublin Castle with several hundred people from many organisations and none attending. It was suggested then that one be held every five years and I support that. It would be better to put our efforts and resources into lánscoileanna Gaeilge and to help the young and old to speak the language. That would be more productive and would be preferred by activists. I do not wish to mix up the 80th anniversary of the foundation of the Free State with honouring those involved with the language.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cabinet Handbook is primarily concerned with the procedures determined from time to <Col N="14" /> time by the Government for the conduct of business at Cabinet meetings. While members of Government are, of course, answerable to this House in respect of decisions taken at Cabinet, they are not answerable for the procedures under which the business at Cabinet meetings is regulated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1(28) of the handbook prohibits Ministers from accepting expenses from private commercial organisations. Could the Taoiseach clarify whether this extends to semi-State commercial bodies which in many cases are dependent upon ministerial contact for decisions in respect of their development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cabinet Handbook is effectively the Standing Orders of the Cabinet just like those for the regulation of this House, so it does not extend beyond that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach explain the current regulations governing the acceptance of awards or gifts to Cabinet Ministers by commercial or semi-State organisations and tell us if he has reiterated those to members of the Cabinet recently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is going outside the terms of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All Cabinet members are bound by the rules which are internal to the Cabinet and members may not go beyond the gift levels or circumstances listed in the book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware of the responsibility under the standards in public office legislation in regard to gifts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cabinet Handbook provides that a Minister can have ten staff in his or her private office and six in the constituency office and a Minister of State can have seven and five respectively. Does the Taoiseach propose amending that given that hard-working TDs must have their political contributions and their constituency work done by one poorly paid secretary? Is this not excessive and bad use of scarce public resources? Does the Taoiseach believe it is productive use of public servants to have them churning out sacks full of Christmas cards between now and Christmas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Between now and Christmas six or seven workers in every Minister's office will <Col N="15" /> merely be churning out sacks full of Christmas cards to every dog and devil the Minister thinks he or she should grace with such cards. Is that not an argument for change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

      <P>I am not sure if the handbook refers to this matter, but will the Taoiseach clarify whether the new penalty point system applies to State cars and ministerial drivers? If it does apply, how will it work and who will get the insurance increase? Is that mentioned in the Cabinet Handbook or does the Taoiseach intend to amend it? Some of these vehicles move through traffic at speeds in excess of 30 miles per hour.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>With regard to the transfer of files to the Moriarty tribunal, I refer the Deputy to replies which I have already given to similar questions on a number of occasions since the tribunal was established.</P>
      <P>In relation to files requested by the tribunal, the Secretary General of my Department assigns an official to deal with such requests, which are usually required by the tribunal to be kept confidential. I am obliged to respect that requirement. My Department will continue to co-operate with the tribunals in making available any records sought.</P>
      <P>The costs met by my Department to date in respect of the tribunal amount to &euro;10.9 million. This includes fees paid to counsel for the tribunal and administration costs incurred to date since the establishment of the tribunal in October 1997.</P>

They were held by an adviser at the time and they related to a number of issues that affected passports in one way or other. They were all given to the tribunal.</P>
      <P>They related to different issues and different periods of time, but they were passed over. The files, to which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform referred, were files from his Department. As the Deputy knows, I did not have access to those files. I had a note on one of those files, but history moved on from that issue. When I was dealing with that note, I was Minister for Finance, but then went into Opposition. It was subsequently investigated by the then Minister for Justice, who is no longer a Member of the House. In so far as I can answer the question, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is strongly of the view that there are questions to answer.</P>

      <P>The fees payable to legal staff at the tribunal remained unchanged since 1997. It was not envisaged the tribunal would go on so long. During the five year period, remuneration rates generally in the legal profession increased significantly. The legal staff at the tribunals have been pressing for an increase to reflect this. The increase has been given based on what was happening in the marketplace and arose out of the Morris tribunal and the outcome provided an adjustment in the fees to the existing tribunals also. This is only fair given that these people come out of the courts for a lengthy period. It would not be possible to get them to do so if they were not paid the market rate and that is the reason for this.</P>

      <P>I gave my initial response to this report in a statement I issued on 6 November. I also wrote to the Ombudsman on 6 November indicating that I would study his report carefully. As the Deputy is aware the Revenue Commissioners have indicated that they were unable to implement certain recommendations of the Ombudsman's report on the basis that they do not have the statutory authority in these cases to pay interest in respect of tax repaid.</P>
      <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, is examining the contents of the report. The general issues raised by the Ombudsman are already being actively examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise with the individuals concerned, but as I indicated in my initial response to the Ombudsman's special report, any solution has to be on a general basis taking into account all the issues, including the amount of revenue involved. In this regard, the House might be interested to note that the Revenue Commissioners pay out billions of euro in tax rebates each year. Consequently, the Exchequer implications of a general interest scheme must also be weighed. The parameters of any statutory scheme, which may be considered to address the repayments issues, will need to be thoroughly and carefully examined. As with all legislative changes, such a scheme, if introduced, would apply prospectively. I will con<Col N="21" /> sider the result of this examination in the context of the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Does he agree the rejection of three of the Ombudsman's five recommendations amounts to such a misrepresentation as to be a direct and unprecedented challenge to the authority of the Ombudsman, as he indicated in his report?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is grossly unjust for people who are late with tax payments to face an interest penalty of 1% per month? The Revenue is saying &ndash; the Minister is not saying to the contrary &ndash; that compliant taxpayers who have overpaid should lose in real terms because of their overpayment. To quote the High Court, does the Minister not accept the doctrine of unjust enrichment should apply in this case and a refund of interest should be given?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is damaging to the Revenue Commissioners to be seen to oppress in this way compliant taxpayers and particularly two widows who are in difficult financial circumstances? Was it not open to the Minister and his advisers, acting with the Revenue Commissioners, to come up with a solution before this report was placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ombudsman made five separate recommendations. The Revenue is implementing two of them. The Revenue says it is not in a position to act on the other three because of its statutory powers. The Ombudsman does not agree with that assertion. I accept the issues raised by the Ombudsman need to be addressed, but the Revenue Commissioners did not lightly reject the recommendations. They had no legal basis to make the payments recommended by the Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's second question, interest is repaid to certain categories of taxpayers, normally those under schedule D on which an assessment has been raised. In that case a person who overpays tax is entitled to a refund of tax with interest. That is based on the days when estimates were made for all types of self-assessed tax. People make preliminary payments on account and the exact charge may not be known until later. However, the Revenue Commissioners do not generally charge interest on an underpayment by PAYE taxpayers. They charge such interest only when making an assessment regarding the underpayment of PAYE, which does not happen often.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are wide-ranging implications to making further changes in this area. I note what the Ombudsman has said and we will consider all these matters in the lead up to next year's Finance Bill. This is a difficult area to address and there are different legal opinions involved. The Revenue Commissioners seem to have their legal opinion. I am sure the Ombudsman has his legal opinion. Lawyers enrich themselves every day in the courts of Ireland due to differences of legal <Col N="22" /> opinion. However, as stated in my reply, billions of euro are repaid every year by the Revenue Commissioners. We will have to judge whether it would be an efficient use of resources in the light of constrained public finances to introduce a statutory interest scheme here. This could raise all sorts of problems and I will consider all these matters in the run-up to next year's Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that to deny justice and fair treatment to all taxpayers on an equal basis cannot be the appalling vista the Minister suggests? This is a question of justice. The Minister makes precisely the same point as the Ombudsman. The Revenue gives refunds with interest to certain people but denies it to the most deserving cases. Where is the equity in that? Does the Minister agree Revenue has a duty of care not to extract from any taxpayer more than is due? That means when people overpay, they must be recompensed in full and in real terms so they do not lose out. The principle here is one of justice. Will the Minister consider approving this?</P>

Why have we seen no real progress on the massive decentralisation, involving more than 10,000 civil servants, which was promised in the Minister's budget speech in December 1999?

    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the concern of the many towns which feel that decentralised offices have passed them by and I sympathise with every place that wants to get its share of the action, but that has led to enormous pressure to take all the factors into account. Some towns made major presentations at considerable cost to their local authorities and they must be considered with issues <Col N="24" /> regarding the more efficient delivery of public services. It was not possible to evaluate everything before the last election and whatever I did at that time would have been regarded as being for political purposes.

      <P>He also said that he had more expectation, but that has led to zero delivery. Did the Minister underestimate in this area too? Does he recognise that a real decentralisation programme is long overdue, in the first instance, in relation to the needs of the capital city which is choking with traffic and where the price of houses available to young couples is unacceptable? Does he further recognise the associated benefits which would accrue to the areas toward which decentralisation would be targeted? Does the Minister realise that outside what is regarded as the more developed eastern and southern seaboard, areas such as Monaghan and other Border locations have long been neglected. They have received no industrial support or inward investment courtesy of Government agencies in recent years. Decentralisation offers a real prospect to communities to develop and an opportunity for civil servants to find quality of life and for the capital city some relief from traffic gridlock, spiralling house prices and all the other associated problems. When will we see real delivery in this area?</P>

      <P>I cannot disagree with anything the Deputy has said but a number of criteria, which I referred to earlier, must be considered. I know at first hand the difficulties of getting into and out of the capital city each day and how far people are travelling to and from Dublin. One benefit of the delay, if one can call it that, since 1999 has been a realisation on the part of higher civil service management and some trade union representatives of the desire of many of their staff and members in the capital who would like, for all the reasons the Deputy alludes to, to move to other parts of the country but there are other criteria which must be borne in mind. I must also ensure efficient and effective delivery of services. There is no point announcing a big department for a town or village which does not have the infrastructure to support it. We could announce it and it might not take place. I am considering all the criteria the Deputy mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 70 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>One of the key principles underpinning the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act, 2000, is that the fund is managed by commissioners who are independent of Government. The commissioners control and manage the fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement an investment strategy. The Act requires the commission to follow a strictly commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long-term subject to prudent risk management.</P>
      <P>These features of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act, 2000, are similar to the trustee arrangements which exist in private pension funds. With the statutory prohibition on drawdowns from the fund prior to 2025, they insulate the fund from day-to-day pressures on Government and enable the commission to take a long-term view. This is essential if the purpose for which the fund was established, to meet as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of pension payments from the year 2025 to at least the year 2055, is to be achieved.</P>
      <P>Consistent with the philosophy underpinning the fund, I do not regularly ask the commission for detailed reports on short-term investment returns. The fund's investment strategy is a matter for the commission and I have no say in it. It is my strong view that regular discussions between the commission and me on its investment strategy and the resultant short-term gains and losses, which may in any event never be realised, would seriously interfere with the long-term focus which must attach to a fund that will not start to make significant disbursements for over 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that the arms-length relationship between the Minister for Finance and the commission gives rise to some accountability issues. To resolve these issues, the Act provides for the appearance of the commission chairperson before the Committee of Public Accounts to give evidence on the commission's policies at such times as the committee may reasonably request. I <Col N="26" /> specifically included this provision in the Act to ensure that there would be direct accountability of the commission to the Oireachtas in respect of the fund's investment strategy. This requirement is additional to the standard requirement that the chief executive of the NTMA, in his role as accounting officer for the fund, appear before the committee whenever it so requests. I also draw the Deputy's attention to the detailed provisions in the Act concerning the format of the commission's statutory annual report to the Minister for Finance. The commission is specifically required to include in the report information on the investment strategy followed, a report on the investment return achieved by the fund and a valuation of the net assets of the fund at year end. These requirements are designed to ensure that information similar to that requested by the Deputy is made available to the public at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>The commission's report for 2002 is due around mid 2003. According to the commission's report for 2001, the total value of moneys standing to the credit of the fund at end year was &euro;7.715 million. This represented a return of 3.27% for the period to 31 December 2001, compared to a short-term benchmark return of 3.24% and a long-term benchmark return of 3.5%. While the fund was invested entirely in short-term cash instruments in 2001 pending the appointment of investment managers, the report also stated the commission had decided on an investment portfolio of 80% equities and 20% bonds.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund Act places a statutory requirement on the Minister for Finance to make a payment of 1% of GNP into the fund each year. I have no plans to introduce amending legislation to change this requirement. To leave discretion in the making of the 1% contribution would, I am convinced, undermine the whole basis of the fund. If discretion were left in the making of the payment of the 1% contribution, it is likely that future Governments would come under pressure to prioritise shorter term economic goals at the expense of making the payment. It is essential that the mandatory contribution be maintained. Once it is breached for one purpose, it is more likely that it will be breached again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>As an experienced accountant, would the Minister advise his clients to invest over &euro;1 billion per annum in a plummeting equity market despite the fact that his clients &ndash; in this case the taxpayers of this country &ndash; had lost &euro;500 million on investment markets in the earlier part of this year? Having regard to the Minister's expressed commitment to the principle of the fund and in view of the recent history of the fund and the failure of equity markets, does he agree that it is political correctness of the right gone mad to have the national pensions reserve fund investing in worldwide equity markets from Hong Kong to New York while this country is crying out for investment in public transport, roads, <Col N="27" /> hospitals and schools? Will the Minister explain how it has come about that, in implementing this policy, he may end up borrowing to invest money to lose money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps one could take the view that the whole capitalist system is finished, in which case all our pension funds are at risk, including those of Members of this House, semi-State organisations, individual private pension funds and company pension funds. Every pension fund in Ireland and elsewhere invests in the equities market but if one takes the view that the capitalist system is finished, nobody will invest at all. One can also take a longer term view of what has happened over the past 50 to 100 years in the equities market. On that basis, a reasonable person, as I believe Deputy Burton is, must conclude that returns in equities over a period are greater than anything else. That is why all pension funds are mostly invested in equities, with some investment also in property, bonds etc.</P>
      <P>The national pensions reserve fund commissioners are independent of the Government. In appointing them, I have put them as far away as possible from the maw of the Minister for Finance of the day and I have no power whatsoever over them. If a future Minister wishes to change that situation, it will require new legislation. As matters stand, it is up to the commissioners to do as they see fit. As I understand it from the report, the commissioners have gone through a very elaborate process. They have taken a great deal of advice, tendered internationally and then made their decisions, in which I have had no involvement. I take the longer term view that, in times of success, one should put money aside for a liability which arises every day and I believe future generations will appreciate the fact we have done so. Other European countries have not done so and are now suffering the consequences.</P>
      <P>I am not in favour of making the short-term adjustment which Deputy Burton's question implies. Once such an adjustment is made, ministerial colleagues and other Deputies will always have various other reasons for spending the money. At best, the 1% of GNP which is being put aside will probably only meet one third of the extra cost of health and welfare at the relevant time. I hope future generations will thank this generation for its long-term view in setting up the national pensions reserve fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister to address the question put to him as to whether it makes economic sense to borrow money, pay returns on it and lose money in the process, as the national pensions reserve fund is now doing? Has he considered the alternative of allowing the fund to invest in infrastructure, such as on a build and lease back arrangement? Does he agree that would give adequate returns and deliver badly needed infrastructure? Will he now look at that approach, rather than having 80% of the fund <Col N="28" /> tied up in equities which have performed very poorly, particularly in the last 12 months? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to prevent the pension fund commissioners investing in any infrastructural project, subject to the overriding requirement in the National Pensions Fund Reserve Act to invest prudently and seek the optimum return. The fund was set up on the same basis as any company pension fund. I have no doubt the commissioners will invest where they see good opportunities. As Deputy McGrath is probably aware in relation to teachers' pension funds, trustees of private pensions tend to take a conservative approach &ndash; rightly so &ndash; in dealing with other people's money. The national pension funds commissioners are perfectly entitled to invest in infrastructural development if they so choose, subject to the rules to which I have referred. However, we must remember that is similar to borrowing from a bank or other investment institution. It makes sense to borrow money to put into the fund in the short-term if, in the longer term, the rate of return will be greater than the rate at which one has borrowed. I already dealt with that aspect in replying to Deputy Burton.</P>
      <P>On the issue of losing money, the pension fund has invested in a wide variety of assets and the chief executive of the NTMA has given a mid-year report on those investments and the value of the fund at that stage. However, those are unrealised values. For example, if one invested in a particular share three years ago at the height of the market and it has since fallen in value, one will not realise that loss unless one sells the share. One may hold on in expectation of a recovery in value. Some of the comments made in relation to national pension fund investments have not taken account of the unrealised losses aspect. I should also point out that the money going into the pension fund has absolutely no effect on the general Exchequer balance, which has been the subject of comment here and in Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied the national pensions reserve fund commissioners deserve to remain in office? They are handling a very large portfolio of investments and, in disastrously falling equity markets, have decided to invest 26% in the USA and another 5% in Japan. Will the Minister bring in some additional expertise, perhaps from within this country, to identify investment opportunities such as in our disastrous public transport system?</P>

      <P>The Deputy and others, including writers, may misunderstand this. If there were opportunities for investment infrastructure which give a good rate of return people would be queuing at the door of the relevant Department to put money into them. The investors may be from the private sector or the pensions fund commissioners. That is not a problem. Any good project which comes up will have people knocking down the door if there is a satisfactory rate of return.</P>
      <P>Regarding equity markets, I do not wish to judge how the commissioners made their decisions. It is not my role. When they present their annual report at the end of the year the chief executive and the chairman will come before a Dáil committee to outline details of their investment. They can answer those questions. I do not wish to pre-empt their decisions. If Deputy Burton was able at the start of the year to guess the way in which the markets would return I am sorry that she did not tell Deputy McGrath and me. We could have made a fortune on the market. She is wasting her time here because she could make a fortune in the private sector if she can predict those events.</P>

      <Quest>the action the Revenue Commissioners intend to take arising from a case highlighted in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in which a property developer who built apartments, townhouses and a shopping centre had a number of substantial tax bills written off due to the fact that the Revenue Commissioners could not locate him; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Operational matters concerning individual taxpayers are a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and confidentiality must also be borne in mind. As a result of these constraints it is not possible to reply with full details of this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the events referred to in the particular case took place over a considerable period of time. It is a feature of the property development sector that a different limited company is usually formed for each development. The amounts written off related to the liabilities of individual companies of which the property developer was a director. In the case of limited companies outstanding tax liability can normally only be collected from the company itself. Where there are outstanding liabilities from a company that has ceased trading, confirmation from the director that the company has ceased trading is usually sought. In the case in question it proved difficult to establish the identity of the director and, in the circumstances, a decision had to be taken without contacting him. The decision to write-off the tax was made on the basis that the <Col N="30" /> company had ceased trading and there were no assets in the company to meet the outstanding liability.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Comptroller and Auditor General's findings the decisions to write-off the tax have been re-visited in each case. In general, decisions to write-off the tax remain valid in so far as they relate to the individual companies. I understand that the Revenue Commissioners are, however, also examining the financial situation of the property developer himself and a formal investigation is under way to determine if there has been under-declaration of income. This is now the most appropriate way of recovering any tax that might have been underpaid.</P>
    <P>More generally, the Revenue Commissioners have advised me that many of the collection shortcomings highlighted by the report related to collection activities from some time ago. Over the years the whole approach to tax default has improved significantly and continues to be improved as lessons are learned. It is clear that the pursuit of the cases referred to would be radically different today.</P>
    <P>Of particular relevance in this case is the Companies Registration Office's search facility which has been available since September 2000 and now provides Revenue with the ability to examine records in that office. The significance of this facility is that it allows officers involved in compliance to create the links that the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned in his report. Such a facility was not available prior to September 2000.</P>
    <P>While the Revenue Commissioners are confident that many of the collection shortcomings identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General no longer arise in practice, the report demonstrates that there is always room for further improvement. Since the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the Revenue Commissioners have introduced additional measures to improve effectiveness in this area. The need for possible legal changes is also being examined and I will consider this aspect further in the context of the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>In the context of the facts of this astonishing case, where a wealthy property developer and builder, despite making millions of pounds profit on the sale of property and having a number of companies, managed to have insufficient income to pay a modest residential property tax, is the Minister satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are competent and have sufficient resources to operate satisfactorily in view of their failure to collect tax in this instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the Minister's reply and the improvement of information technology and links between the Revenue Commissioners and the Companies Registration Office, can it not be argued that the annual return should be significantly amended for certain types of occupation, particularly developers and builders, who have had an exceptionally good two decades? Should <Col N="31" /> not their statements to the Revenue Commissioners be amended to include not only their statements of earnings, but also detailed statements about their asset holdings, investments and the names of the companies and trusts with which they are associated? My colleague raised the question of two widows who could not get redress from the Revenue Commissioners yet there are people driving around this town in top of the range Mercedes cars costing &euro;120,000 or more who are not capable of paying income tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will not take advice from me but that kind of politics has outlived its usefulness. Deputy O'Keeffe might even agree with me. Most of the tax in this case arose from companies which had been out of existence for many years. The tax collection system has been improved recently and one of the most significant changes has been the facility now available in the Companies Registration Office.</P>
      <P>This case shows the difficulty which limited liability poses for tax collection. As the Deputy is aware, a limited company is a corporate sole and has an existence of its own. The shareholdings are owned by different people, often a husband and wife. The only assets that can be touched are those of that limited company. The Revenue Commissioners have improved their system recently to enable them to identify companies which close down and then re-start with the same directors. I am satisfied with their approach. They have made enormous changes in the past ten to 15 years and carry out their work efficiently. I have given them extra resources and am satisfied that they now have sufficient resources.</P>
      <P>Questions relating to the annual return are matters for the Revenue Commissioners. If necessary, I will consider them.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73, 77, 92, 98, 122, 129, 132 and 138 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to moving forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies taking the national spatial strategy into account. This commitment was reiterated in An Agreed Programme for Government. As I have said on many occasions of late, there is a wide range of important issues that must be taken into consideration before a final decision is taken on the matter. It is vital that all involved are consulted, be they staff concerned about their futures or departmental managements concerned about the delivery of the public services for which they have responsibility.</P>
      <P>Given these wide ranging considerations it is not possible for me to state, at this time, when the Government will be in a position to take a decision on the issue of decentralisation. The Deputies may be assured that the submissions and representations which have been made will all be taken into account as part of the deliberative process.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister for Finance is aware of how quickly the capital <Col N="33" /> city and east coast locations have been developed in the past few years compared to some parts of the country, would he agree that it is necessary to make decisions as soon as possible and not prevaricate any further? Decisions on decentralisation were expected to be announced by the Minister about 18 months ago. I realise that the Minister had to take political considerations into account before the general election, to ensure that nobody was upset. Does he agree that decentralisation is urgently needed if we are to remove regional disparities and to improve the quality of life of the people? Early decisions regarding the spatial strategy and decentralisation are essential if we are to have proper planning and development of the regions.</P>

I said in my answer to the priority question that a number of criteria must be taken into account. I decided, late in the lifetime of the last Government, that nothing was to be gained by making a decision at that stage. I accept the Deputy's remarks about the capital city, which is one of the many criteria that must be taken into account. The Government hopes to be able to resolve this question early in its lifetime and thereby attract praise from many parts of the country.</P>

Does he agree that the public deserves better treatment from the Government than that it has received regarding this matter? Will areas that have been officially designated as disadvantaged, under research carried out under the RAPID programme, receive special consideration when decisions are being made about decentralisation? I am thinking in particular about two towns in my constituency, Tuam and Ballinasloe, which have been designated as disadvantaged but which have received no Government attention as a consequence of the designation.</P>

      <P>As I outlined in my earlier reply to a priority question, a number of issues must be taken into account when making a decision about decentralisation, and the matters to which Deputy McHugh alluded can be included among them. I will endeavour to marry all the criteria, even those that may seem to conflict, to put together a genuine programme of decentralisation. I have received submissions from the towns mentioned by the Deputy and I acknowledge that areas that lost out previously wish to be considered on this occasion. As I said earlier, many other matters must be taken into account. I have been intensively lobbied about decentralisation every time I have gone around the country in the past three years.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that it is an insult to the snail to suggest that he has proceeded at a snail's pace? Does he recollect that he told the House in May 2000 that he would make decisions about decentralisation within a couple of months? Did the criteria to which he now refers occur to him when he promised us a decision within a couple of months of May 2000? Does he accept that he has not adequately explained the delay? Does he agree that 32,000 or 33,000 public servants in Dublin are seeking to get out of the capital? Does he have any consideration for those who are being kept in cold storage in the capital? Can he indicate whether there will be an independent assessment of this matter, or whether decisions will be made on the basis of purely political considerations when he ultimately catches up with the snail and announces a decision? As I do not wish to be outdone by my colleagues from other parts of Ireland, can I finally ask the Minister if he is fully aware of the benefits to the country of relocating an office to <Col N="35" /> Bandon, apart from the benefits to the town itself?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the exact number of public servants who would like to relocate from Dublin. Perhaps the figures mentioned by the Deputy are accurate, but there is no doubt that the number involved is considerable. If there is any advantage in the delay since I first announced, in December 1999, the plan to put in place a decentralisation programme, it has been the realisation among public service managers that many of their workers wish to relocate outside Dublin. As I said earlier, this desire has probably been noted by trade union leaders too. Immediately after I announced the decision, I encountered many obstacles in the form of managers in many Departments, including my own, who said that I should not think about going through with the plan. Those who manage and represent public sector workers were taken aback, as time passed, by the large numbers of people who expressed a desire to relocate outside Dublin, for the reasons alluded to by Deputies Hogan, Ó Caoláin and others. This revelation is the only positive aspect of the snail's pace of progress regarding this matter.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to go down the road of independent assessment. I can give two good reasons why politicians should be prepared to make tough decisions as best they can. Whenever thorny issues are encountered in Ireland, it seems that public representatives delegate responsibility to somebody else as it is too difficult for them to decide. It has almost reached the stage where we do not make our own decisions, but I do not subscribe to that theory of politics, as Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and others are aware. The other problem of giving the decision to an independent group of eminent people is that they would take into account the official things said to them, but they would not listen to the points made by people like Deputies O'Keeffe, Deenihan, Hogan or McHugh. I believe such arguments should be taken into account. Anyone who has been in Government, as Deputy Jim O'Keeffe has been, would realise that to be the case.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy O'Keeffe's questions about the snail's progress of this project, I can inform him that I recall the remarks I made in the House in May 2000. I have made many decisions in recent years, including during my time as Minister for Finance, and I have been regularly criticised for not consulting adequately. Some of my better decisions, however, have been those which did not involve consultation, but I do not get credit for them. One result of the many decisions I have made is that I am still on this side of the House and the rest of the Deputies are still on the other side&mdash;</P>

      <P>In view of the chaotic state of the national development plan and the fact that there are shortfalls in terms of money to invest in it, even at a time when we are investing in worldwide equity stock markets, as the Minister has said, does the Minister agree that decentralisation has been delayed to the extent that its costs will be tremendously high? Civil servants will be sent to places where significant elements of infrastructure have been cut. For example, the Minister for Transport has decided, in effect, to destroy railway transport in the south-west and south-east. If we are to have effective decentralisation, the maintenance of public transport infrastructure is essential.</P>

      <P>People can argue about such matters among themselves. What happened when large amounts of money were put into infrastructure in recent years? We created a large inflationary spiral when we spent a great deal of money. People might say that we did not get a great return for it, but those kinds of aspects must be borne in mind for the future. I do not agree that higher costs would arise from a Government decision about decentralisation now than would have been the case if a decision had been made in 1999 or 2000. The same infrastructure will have to be provided and the same office accommodation will have to be made available. The best thing I can say is that the Government will make a decision about decentralisation early in the lifetime of this Administration. We will allow plenty of time for work to take place and for the necessary planning to be put in train. I hope that the decision will be made in the near future.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that his statement in May 2000 created an expectation within the Civil Service and in provincial towns like Mullingar? Midland towns like Longford, Athlone, Tullamore, Portlaoise and Kells have decentralisation, but Mullingar does not. When the Minister made his statement he got a tremendous response from a variety of organisations. He created an expectation in these towns which wanted decentralisation but he then put a damper <Col N="37" /> on everything for purely political reasons.

I hope the Minister will honour that commitment. In the preliminary census report the Listowel area is the only one showing a decrease in population. This is a good reason for decentralising a public office to Listowel.

The area, particularly County Monaghan, has the lowest increase in population anywhere in the country. I put it to the Minister &ndash; the Minister of State is sitting beside him &ndash; that a small amount of extra office space is required for much-needed staff in the Ballybay DVO office. In spite of all the financial problems, at least some extra money should be made available for the restructuring of a house, which is available, to ensure the necessary staff are in place to service the most intensive farming county in the country, which engages in poultry and mushroom farming and so on.</P>

      <P>Given the time the Minister has had to consider decentralisation, will the programme be deepened as well as widened? What we have had to date has been office relocation. Given that the apparatus of Government is still centralised, it matters little to ordinary citizens whether an office is located in Letterkenny or Dublin in terms of accessing information or having complaints redressed. The real issue is that decisions <Col N="38" /> for local communities should be made in local communities themselves.</P>

      <P>Deputy Deenihan and Deputy Collins have been more vociferous than most other Deputies in the House in pushing the case for Listowel, Kilrush and Newcastlewest over a long period.

      <P>Will the Taoiseach clear up the confusion which exists in respect of the meetings that took place between Father Alex Reid and the Real IRA? As the House and the country will be well aware, the Real IRA was responsible for 31 murders in the Omagh bombing, one of the worst atrocities in the past 30 years. Last week-end the Taoiseach indicated there was no contact between the Government and the Real IRA. He subsequently clarified in a long statement that there was contact between Father Alex Reid and his then special adviser on Northern Ireland, Senator Martin Mansergh, during the course of those meetings. <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> alleged there were three meetings between Father Reid and the Real IRA and that during the course of these meetings advice was given by Senator Mansergh to Father Reid. Will the Taoiseach clear up, once and for all, whether he is aware there were three meetings between Father Reid and the Real IRA? Second, was the advice of Senator Mansergh to Father Reid given with the consent and knowledge of the Taoiseach? In view of its importance, this matter needs to be cleared up fully and comprehensively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In replying to Deputy Kenny I wish to go back over some of the points I made last week, which are important. Following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in April 1998 and ratification of the Agreement by the people on 22 May 1998, a great deal of effort was put in by many people, including my then adviser, Senator Martin Mansergh, Father Alex Reid and other individuals whom there is no need to name, including clergymen on both sides of the divide. They tried to influence those still engaged in violence to desist and move away from it. That approach continued for quite some time. There was some success in that the INLA and through it those associated with the IRSP called a ceasefire. The ceasefire did not take effect until after the Omagh bombing but the decision had been made in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how many meetings Father Alex Reid had with the Real IRA but I know he was very active in trying to convince that and other groups. At that time, before Omagh, my adviser had met the 32 County Sovereignty Committee, the political movement, and I know that Father Reid, even after Omagh, had been contacted by the representatives of that group and asked to do his utmost to create the conditions under which these people could be involved in a ceasefire. Clearly, Omagh changed everything. The organisation was then responsible for the biggest atrocity ever, as Deputy Kenny said. After that, contacts were continued by some but not by the Government. The effort did not succeed. The organisation had a ceasefire, during which I know efforts did continue on the part of religious leaders, but that did not work either. After about six months it returned to violence and it never really <Col N="40" /> stopped. It recently issued a statement, but we will have to wait and see whether it is valid.</P>
    <P>After the Good Friday Agreement and its ratification by the people, and prior to Omagh, Father Reid definitely did have contact with these people and he was also in touch with my adviser. I cannot say, and neither can my former adviser to whom I have spoken, whether it was during the meeting phase or at any other time. He continues to keep in frequent touch today, as he has since 1988. Anything that was done in all this time was absolutely above board and helpful to the peace process. The work of Father Reid, although he has not been active recently because of his health, has always been extremely helpful. I will always defend his actions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt the validity of the work of Father Reid at all. I did receive some confidential correspondence from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, for which I am grateful, in respect of the other matters I raised here last week. What I am really interested in is the contact between Senator Mansergh, then the special adviser on Northern Ireland to the Taoiseach, and Father Reid. Was the advice from Senator Mansergh to Father Reid given with the knowledge and consent of the Taoiseach? In other words, did Senator Mansergh contact the Taoiseach, tell him he was talking to Father Reid, who was in contact with the Real IRA, and ask for his consent or <i>imprimatur</i>? Was there direct contact between the Taoiseach and Senator Mansergh? Did the Taoiseach know the subject of Father Reid's discussions with the Real IRA?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On that narrow point, the answer is clearly &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  In fairness to Senator Mansergh, it was not only I who did not know. He did not know either, but he was always in communication with Father Reid, and many others who will remain nameless as they are not in the public domain, giving them advice. It was definitely not the case that Father Reid was with the Real IRA, communicating with Senator Mansergh, who then communicated with me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to today's front page story about Sir Alex Ferguson and his ownership of a stallion which brings in &euro;5 million tax free per annum in breeding fees. Does the Taoiseach know that this is but one example in a mega-million euro industry? Is he satisfied that owners of stallions, in these circumstances, are not even required to note, for income or other profits purposes, in their income tax returns the income generated from this area? In reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister for Finance could not say how much tax was foregone. Some experts estimate it to be of the order of &euro;100 million, although others say it is far more. Does the Taoiseach know that &euro;100 million in tax would create a thousand extra hospital beds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the excuse for allowing this industry to operate effectively outside the law? Why is this <Col N="41" /> industry not required to make returns so that the State can calculate precisely how much is being foregone? How is it that this regime has not been reviewed? Is there any other single industry operating within the State in which returns need not be made, where normal compliance with company law is required? These companies do not even have to retain books. Is the Taoiseach aware that one bloodstock owner is dominating the industry to such an extent that abuse of dominance is evident and that the loophole, such as it is, is being exploited by the export of stallions for a period of the year? The resultant loss to the Exchequer is massive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the story in today's newspaper about Sir Alex Ferguson's horse, The Rock of Gibraltar, and many other stallions down through the years. It is the case that this aspect of the racing industry has had a special tax concession for many years. A decade ago, when the last fundamental review of various allowances and thresholds took place, this concession was not removed. It was left as it was because it was seen at the time as a very good vehicle for employment in many rural parts because those who were beneficiaries of it employed a large number of people. The view was that Coolmore Stud, which is clearly the company we are talking about, and all the smaller organisations with the ability to move, would move elsewhere if they did not have this concession. In fact, many of them would not have been here in the first place without it because in that industry, many of the stallions and their owners are from outside the country. There are other parts of the industry in Australia and Asia and they could have moved to those locations. That was the logic behind it and it has been developed for ten years.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance said recently that he was reconsidering tax shelters and allowances in various areas. The case could still be made that there is a tax argument for retaining the concession. Of course these companies must comply with company law. I do not know the amounts of money they save with these concessions and I am sure the Minister would take this into consideration in any examination. I do not want to give the impression that the Minister will come to the conclusion that it should be dispensed with &ndash; this would have to be examined for its benefits. It is true that these companies have a lucrative arrangement under successive Governments. Deputy Rabbitte must agree that he sat at the Cabinet table and agreed to leave it there through three budgets. If the matter is examined again all these arguments will be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that when I sat at the Cabinet table, we did not need money as badly as we do now? Considering the rate of deterioration of the public finances, if the State can levy income tax on stable lads, it ought to be able to levy income tax on the owners of a <Col N="42" /> mega-rich industry. The Rock of Gibraltar, to whom the Taoiseach referred, brings in &euro;5 million per annum in breeding fees. In the case of Sadler's Wells, the amount is estimated to be &euro;30 million per annum. Hundreds of millions of euro per annum are returned without any computation by the State. Why should this not be measured? Why should an incentive considered necessary for a fledgling industry in the 1960s be continued in circumstances in which such huge profits are being made?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach does not know how much is being made because he does not want to know. It amounts to hundreds of millions euro at a time when the Government is cutting CE schemes and imposing charges for services, when registration fees for students are increasing by 69% and the meals on wheels service cannot be run because the CE personnel are withdrawn. How can we justify not imposing a modest tax regime on this industry? It will not happen under the present Minister for Finance, although he will probably not be around for much longer. Will the Taoiseach make a commitment to review this or at least make a statement with an assessment of the amount of tax foregone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the amount of tax foregone but the Department of Finance is reviewing all shelters and tax allowances and it will examine this scheme. Deputy Rabbitte is incorrect in saying that times were not worse. This tax allowance existed when there was emigration of 40,000 people a year and unemployment of 18%. It was in place when the country was on its uppers.</P>

      <P>Was the Minister for State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, articulating Government policy when he was quoted in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Friday saying, &ldquo;We want to maximise the assets of the State in the light of the difficult situation in which we find ourselves&rdquo;, referring to the crisis in Government finances? He outlined a plan to price any asset <Col N="43" /> under control of the Office of Public Works that could be flogged to fill a gap in the Government's finances, as a result of the disastrous Government policy of massive tax breaks for the rich and big corporations. Does the Taoiseach agree that this intended plunder of the Office of Public Works, which I refer to as &ldquo;Parlon's pillage&rdquo;, would be extremely reckless? It would be wrong to use such assets for short-term benefit while sacrificing investment in future social and community needs for which many of these lands and other assets could be used.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the example of the National Aquatic Centre, which is to be ready in time for the Special Olympics, bears out my point? It is built on publicly owned land that, if it had been flogged to a speculator ten years ago, would have to bought back for tens of millions of euro of taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>Is it the policy of this Government, provided it survives, to privatise every significant public asset and enterprise in the State during this session, in view of the Minister for Transport's clear view that Aer Lingus should be privatised and his attack on public transport with the privatisation of 25% of Dublin Bus? In terms of his policy of privatisation, Deputy Brennan ideologically puts himself somewhere between Attila the Hun and Genghis Khan, as does the rest of the Government.</P>
      <P>Is it not recklessness to sell off assets that will be needed for community and social purposes to make up for this Government's disastrous handling of public finances, instead of preserving and developing them for community and social uses?</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, is looking at areas within the Office of Public Works that are not being used for any useful purpose and are not required by the agency involved. If, after review, they are not going to be used in the medium or long-term, they should perhaps be sold off. That seems an eminently sensible thing to do. He is not looking at any existing services or utilities used by the public. If he had the opportunity to sell off some of the assets that are not being used, he would be able to invest further in the infrastructure of present utilities.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport confirmed there were no plans to privatise any of the CIE companies but outlined how he believed they could be restructured, with Bus Éireann, Bus Átha Cliath and Iarnród Éireann operating as independent commercial companies that will give a more efficient service, with more flexibility for the staff and organisations involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has engaged in discussions with staff in Aer Lingus, who have managed to fight <Col N="44" /> their way out of the difficult position they were in two years ago, are now back in profit and are looking to the future.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 11, motion re referral to select committee of proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of the report by the Minister for Defence pursuant to section 4 of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993; No. 26, Private Security Services Bill, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); and No. 3, Licensing of Indoor Events Bill, 2001 &ndash; Order for Second stage and Second Stage. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 11 shall be decided without debate. Private Members' Business shall be No. 36, motion re confidence in the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>There is one question to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 11, without debate, agreed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not agreed to. This is as important a matter as can come before any Parliament. In particular, given our Constitution, we should debate and vote on the expectations of a war, involving this country through the use of Shannon Airport for US military personnel and equipment. I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, in upholding not just the rights of this House but the Constitution, that you ensure this matter does not go without debate and get hived off to another theatre of debate which is not the central Parliament. I ask you to uphold the seriousness of this issue and the Constitution. The effects of a war not just on humanity but on the price of energy, Co2 emissions, the radioactive burden from weaponry that may be used and the knock-on effects, and the likelihood of terrorist attacks anywhere else in the world, including our country, make this a matter of the utmost gravity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is well aware, it is not a matter for the Chair to decide, it is a matter for the House to decide on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue that has been raised is of concern to the entire Chamber. There has been an enormous amount of confusion as to, for example, commitments which have been made. Have they been made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach in relation to the context of Resolution 1368? Is Resolution 1368 being used or abused to justify preparation for a pre-emptive strike for military purposes? On all of these matters all Members will have received representations from different constituents. If it is referred to the committee, it may get deferred and not receive the full extended debate it needs. The issue should be discussed as a matter of urgency. Any use being made of facilities in <Col N="47" /> Ireland at present is improper and does not have a mandate from this House. Such commitments as the Taoiseach may have made in a conversation, on foot of Resolution 1368, have no connection whatsoever to what is taking place at present.</P>
      <P>I support the demand for time for a debate in the House. If the Taoiseach holds a very different view to the rest of us on this matter at least we are entitled to hear it. It is here we should discuss it. If he is suggesting a change in the Defence Acts so as to facilitate the kind of activity that is taking place, let us hear that too. What is happening at best is a fairly deceitful construction. Even if the terms of Resolution 1368 allowed it, which I believe they do not, it is a totally improper and unsustainable extension of that resolution to argue that it justifies what is going on at present. This is a matter of such urgency that I do not think it can wait for two weeks. Perhaps the best way to do that would be to have a discussion now in the House on the appropriate interpretation of such a resolution as has been passed by the Security Council, including this dimension of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to also support the objection as articulated by Deputies Sargent and Higgins. In light of Ireland's voting position at the Security Council meeting at the end of last week there is a bounden duty on Government to facilitate the address of the proposition on the Order of Business in this Chamber rather than hiving it off to a committee of the House. It is an imperative and I urge the Taoiseach to confirm the request of the Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter last week. In the event that the Iraqi Government has turned down the UN recommendation in respect of weapons inspectors going in and in the event that the United States, together with other countries of like minded mentality, decide to take action by force in Iraq, will the Taoiseach see to it that this House discusses the implications of that either as an emergency or in the course of a full debate? That is what is being requested by Deputy Higgins and others. The matter was raised last week but was not responded to clearly. War in the Constitution is a matter for the entire House. This <Col N="48" /> could have the most catastrophic, social, personal and economic consequences not only for the countries of the Far East and Middle East but for countries of central and western Europe also. I seek clarification that the entire House will have the opportunity to discuss it if this unfortunate and potentially catastrophic event takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Higgins and Deputy Kenny, in particular, I welcome the fact that the adoption of the Security Council Resolution 1441 was unanimous and that the Security Council has been able to express in a unified and rare fashion its concerns and intentions regarding Iraq. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will be answering questions on this issue tomorrow and no doubt there will be a debate in the House but it demonstrates the Security Council's determination to ensure that Iraq, on this occasion, will meet its obligations. We believe that Resolution 1441 offers the most likely means of achieving those three goals &ndash; obtaining Iraq's voluntary compliance with its disarmament obligations, avoiding a military conflict and preserving the primacy and importance of the Security Council. Deputy Kenny asked in the event that does not happen if there will be a debate here. We can certainly have that. We have had a few debates on this issue previously. I have no difficulty in ensuring another debate on it.</P>

      <P>The report is being referred to a committee. It in no way affects what we are talking about. Clearly the Deputy is using it as a device to raise the issue and he has succeeded in doing that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this important legislation which was proposed by former Deputy Farrelly. The Bill gives effect to the principal recommendations contained in the report of the consultative group on the private security industry which was published in December 1997. It is typical of the Government that a report published by a committee five years ago is only now being dealt with. On numerous occasions Deputy Farrelly asked that this issue be dealt with as a matter of urgency. Unfortunately, since his request to have it dealt with, some serious incidents involving bouncers at night clubs and other similar situations have occurred. It is sad that security is a necessity and that door supervisors are required not just at night clubs and pubs. I welcome the Bill in the context that if we must have a security industry it must be supervised.</P>
      <P>Are all our security firms insured? The five year gestation of this Bill reminds me of the five year committee that sat on insurance. It is vital that insurance is covered in the Bill. The Bill recommends training for all door persons, or bouncers. That is essential, but is the individual licence the same as that for a security company? How can we make sure these people are of a reputable background, of sound mind, can work under the strain of the job and can act responsibly in that situation? I know many of these people are good people but only a few bad apples are needed to cause problems. If we are to implement this Bill, we must ensure that all the security personnel with whom young people and others will come in contact are of sound character and are trained to do a proper job. People have been injured and have had to go to hospital and some have even died as a result of security incidents. This situation must be examined from every side.</P>
      <P>We need to look at the issues of late opening hours, fast food outlets and super pubs in our cities and country towns. Off-licences and supermarkets make drink available and people of all ages are free to get alcohol. We must deal with the whole drink culture. It is not covered in this Bill but it is the culture that gives rise to the need for security. The drink culture is worse than the drug culture. Often they are linked but alcohol is consumed at births, baptisms, first communions, 18th and 21st birthday parties, weddings and funerals. There always seems to be a reason groups finish up in the pub, club or hotel. We are a long way from the family tradition where these events would have been celebrated in the home, although thankfully in some rural areas there are still halls and community centres that facilitate these functions. The sooner we gear towards that form of celebration the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to deal with the drink culture. A local chamber of commerce and town commission sent a resolution to me recently. They were making a cry for help as to how to contain the people leav<Col N="59" /> ing clubs and pubs and going to take-aways, causing mayhem in the streets at 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. Some of the newer take-aways, chip shops and restaurants are tied down with legislation from the planning authorities. Surely, if necessary, we can implement legislation that can take away some of those rights that are being abused and that have built up over the years.</P>
    <P>We only need to read our week-end newspapers to see the difficulties being caused in towns, villages and cities around the country. People have died as a result of serious abuse of alcohol. While the implementation of the security Bill will maintain some regulation it will not deal with the issue of late night drinking, binge drinking or the availability of alcohol to the young. I spoke to a 16 year old who told me that she was probably the only one in her group who did not drink. It is not easy for that person. The situation where 12, 13, 14 or 15 year old children have such easy access to alcohol is desperate. This may not be relevant to the Bill but it is relevant to our culture and nature. I plead with the Minister to examine this issue.</P>
    <P>Security personnel in black coats outside our shops, night clubs etc. are an indication of how the wealth of the Celtic tiger has brought problems. I want to be assured that the security people who work here can be certain that they are not up against groups coming from elsewhere, working below cost and undermining legitimate and properly organised groups. That is a danger. My constituency is close to the Border. Can we be certain in this age of mobile labour which can come from inside or outside the EU that companies from across the Border or elsewhere will be subject to the legislation? Will companies be bound by the law irrespective of whether they are based in the Republic?</P>
    <P>I am reminded of builders who must compete with colleagues from other areas and who must meet various criteria. I remember a story about a builder in a Border town who was required to guarantee that his employees were legitimate and had paid their social insurance. One was found to have committed a slight misdemeanour which was settled with the inspector. On having done so, the builder inquired about another employer and the nature of his business. The inspector replied: &ldquo;There's no point in going there.&rdquo;  That is how bad matters were.</P>
    <P>I want to ensure the same cannot be said of this legislation. I am not sure how it can be done but it is vital that if someone establishes a security firm, pays his taxes and meets all the licensing criteria, he is not up against rogue security firms and that firms providing a service at a realistic charge can be sure they will not go out of business because someone else does not meet the criteria.</P>
    <P>Those employed by security firms should be monitored and controlled by whatever means. Some form of licensing should be in place to ensure their background and past is known not just to the company for which they work but also <Col N="60" /> to a wider group, whether it be the board established by the legislation or another one. We have witnessed the trauma caused by sexual abuse which occurred because there was insufficient scrutiny and people were employed without their past being examined. It is vital that people's history is examined so that companies employing security firms are certain the personnel on the door or wherever else are beyond question.</P>
    <P>I wish the Bill every success. The former Deputy, John Farrelly, had a great interest in this area when he was a Member of the House. He will want to see it passed and implemented as soon as possible. I hope when that happens the monitoring personnel are in place. I cannot help but recall the former Deputy, Michael O'Kennedy, who always reminded us that in 1989, as Minister for Agriculture, he rushed through legislation curtailing the use of meat and bonemeal in animal foodstuff to combat BSE. The problem was that neither he nor his successors until 1996, when the BSE problem hit us, put personnel in place to monitor the use of such meal in animal foodstuff.</P>
    <P>A drink-driving law without the gardaí to enforce it is of no use, neither is a law dealing with animal foodstuff without agricultural officers to monitor it. We need to ensure sufficient personnel are in place so that when the Bill is passed, security companies will know they are monitored, that their licences will be demanded of them and that the system works. There is no point in our spending hours in the House initiating, debating and putting in place legislation unless the finance and personnel are in place to operate it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill which provides for the establishment of the Private Security Authority to control and supervise individuals and firms providing security services. The main function of the authority will be to operate a licensing system for providers of such services to maintain and improve standards within the industry. The Bill gives effect to the principal recommendations of the consultative group on the private security industry which reported in December 1997.</P>
      <P>The principal features of the Bill are as follows. A new body to be known as the Private Security Authority is to be established. The Minister will appoint the members of the authority, including representatives of a range of relevant interests, including private security employers and employees, the Garda Síochána and the staff of the authority. In the interests of maintaining and improving standards of service within the private security services sector, the authority will operate a licensing system to control and regulate access. It will publish a register of licensed providers of private security services each year and will issue identity cards to all licensees. The authority will also set training standards and put in place a system for investigating complaints.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Security service&rdquo; is defined as including door supervisor, supplier and installer of security <Col N="61" /> equipment, private investigator, private security employer, security consultant, security guard, provider of armoured car services, locksmith and supplier and installer of safes.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out the grounds on which the authority shall refuse to issue a licence. These include that the applicant is not a fit and proper person to provide a security service. In the context of vetting applicants, the authority may request information from the Garda Síochána. Provision is made for the establishment of an independent Private Security Appeal Board to hear and determine appeals against decisions of the authority.</P>
    <P>The Bill creates a number of new offences. These include providing a security service without a licence, providing false information in support of a licence application and employing a person to provide a security service if that person is required to but does not have a licence.</P>
    <P>The legislation is being introduced at the behest of the private security services industry. It will enhance the image of the industry, provide quality assurance for customers and reassure the public. Private security services cover a broad range of activities and occupations and form an important area of economic activity. It is estimated that about 400 companies are active while overall employment in the industry is in the region of 22,000. The legislation will provide a sound footing for the industry to expand further by promoting consumer confidence and improving the quality of service.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of disquieting reports in recent years about so called bouncers at entertainment venues using excessive force resulting in young people getting injured. As there is no regulation for such jobs at present, it is up to the owners of such premises to select the people they put on the doors. Only last week we had the disturbing case of two bouncers being found guilty of assault in Dublin. The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on RTE recently carried a shocking exposé of the nightclub bouncer scene in Dublin. I have concerns about the implications of the drink and drugs culture for public order and civil society. Wanton violence, thuggery and destructiveness are increasingly obvious symptoms of a decline in public order.</P>
    <P>The private security industry is an important section of our economy and society. Its growth is a reflection of the buoyancy of the economy. Obviously any new, growing industry must be regulated on a sound footing. That is the best way to secure the interests of employers and employees in the sector as well as society. An integrated system of registration and licensing will separate the gamekeepers from the poachers. The vast majority of operators in the sector are legitimate but some are not. The legislation could also safeguard the rights of employees of private security companies, some of whom suffer injury and trauma in pursuit of their duties but who are often left to deal with the impact of these problems on their own and at their own expense.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" />It is important that the sector should not be allowed to become a free for all where people, some perhaps with criminal backgrounds, could establish security firms and blacken the name of the industry. This happened with one former paramilitary who was carrying out a business providing bouncers to clubs.</P>
    <P>Registration is in the industry's best interest, as people will be enabled to approach security firms with confidence. It is a nightmare for some companies working in areas, which continue to be the focus of crime. They often do not know whether those whom they are employing are posing a threat to their own security. Employers of security firms allow employees of those firms access to their property. They must be given help to recognise who is a legitimate operator and who is not.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill and I look forward to its implementation which will safeguard the interests of society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate on the Private Security Services Bill. The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the establishment of a body, to be known as the private security authority, to control and supervise individuals and firms providing private security services. While this is laudable and good in its own way, it does not go far enough in addressing the problems of our society. Deputy Crawford spoke earlier and commended the former Deputy, John Farrelly, who introduced a Private Members' Bill on this subject in the last Dáil. That Bill was defeated but now the Minister has introduced a Bill and of course this will become legislation.</P>
      <P>Everybody in this House is generally in favour of what is included in this Bill. However, given the problems that exist, a little bit of licence has been taken by some Members in straying from the exact contents of the Bill. Nevertheless, those contributions are vital, because we must put on record our fears about society and the way it is developing.</P>
      <P>The fact that we are discussing this Bill recognises there is a problem. Parents can no longer be confident when their children, including young adults, go out at night either in a city, a town or a rural area. They cannot be sure they will come back as they left home safe and uninjured. That has changed entirely from my time as a young person going out at night. What has happened to society leading to that situation? There have been many stabbings on the streets with people being killed. A young man in Dublin was stabbed recently for his mobile phone. Why should we tolerate that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this Bill deals with the licensing of security firms and individuals and where they operate, there is a wider problem. I believe the previous speaker is a publican &ndash; he certainly was during my time in that part of the country. When nightclubs close people pour on to the streets causing difficulty for security people, the gardaí on the street and members of the public. If there were <Col N="63" /> enough gardaí on the beat many of the problems at those times could and would be avoided. No deterrent is greater than the garda on the street.</P>
    <P>About a year ago the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform visited Galway. I invited him to accompany me around Eyre Square and the centre of Galway between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. He declined the offer, but I carried out that exercise anyhow. Galway is no different from any other town or city in this country. When the nightclubs close thousands of people come out on the street at the one time. This results in tension, queues and rows at take-aways and taxi ranks. This is all part of the security problem.</P>
    <P>At that time, I suggested to the nightclub owners and the security people dealing with this problem outside nightclubs, that the nightclubs should close on a phased basis. If different nightclubs closed at 12.30 a.m., 1.30 a.m., 2.00 a.m. and 2.30 a.m., people would not arrive on the street at the one time. A rota could be established that would be fair to everybody concerned. This would result in orderly queues at the take-aways, the taxi ranks and on the streets instead of having all this at one time of the night. That offer was not taken up by the nightclubs. Perhaps this legislation could be amended, through regulation or otherwise, so that when nightclubs are renewing their licences they would be required to close at different times. In that way the chaos and subsequent violence that occurs on our streets could be eliminated.</P>
    <P>This is a matter that concerns parents greatly. I am a parent of four young people and, when they go out at night, I have the same worries as everybody else. As well as the offices of State, bouncers, gardaí and parents must take responsibility. Parents have abdicated their responsibility to know where their young people go at night, who they are with, what time they will be home and whether they are staying in friends' houses or not. If we continue to develop a drink culture central to night clubs and other centres for young people's leisure, we will store up problems for society in ten or 20 years' time. Experts in this field inform my opinion that the incidence of alcoholism in ten and 15 years' time will be several percentage points greater than it is today because of the tolerance of the culture of excessive drinking. Security personnel can only do what they are trained and employed to do in this context.</P>
    <P>Every activity seems to begin or finish in the pub. I brought my sons to a match last weekend which we won. We went to a pub on the way home and another &ndash; which may have sponsored the team's jerseys or donated a spot prize &ndash; when we got home to Galway. Later that night, the team met in the pub rather than in a parent's house &ndash; everything is centred on the pub. That is the culture which has developed and, as parents and legislators, we must face up to our responsibilities. Although the Bill does not cater for this, does the Minister have power to introduce other <Col N="64" /> regulations relevant to it which could address the issue?</P>
    <P>Definitions in the Bill include &ldquo;door supervisor, installer of security equipment, private security advisor, security guard and security service.&rdquo;  Can the Minister broaden this to include those in responsibility in public places, such as the owners of licensed premises, and define their obligations? With the growth of super-pubs has come the demise of family-run and owned public houses with the result that, when one goes into such a place, one does not know who the owner or person responsible is. This is unlike 20 or 30 years ago when one knew the people concerned and could speak to them if one saw irresponsible behaviour on their premises. There should be a limit on the capacity and size to which such pubs can develop.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill provides that the authority, which is to be established by it, will grant and renew licences to persons within the sector and, where appropriate, suspend or revoke them. How will this be achieved? What will one have to do to renew one's licence? Will there be an examination at the end of the year? Will the record of one's activities in the previous year be taken into account? What will the criteria be?</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides inspectors with certain powers of entry and inspection for the purposes of obtaining information in relation to any matter under investigation by the authority. Will inspectors, as provided for in the Bill, have the same authority as a garda in questioning owners or licensees about incidents that occurred on or outside their premises, where security personnel were witnesses, involved or should have been present? Will inspectors need to be accompanied by a garda or will they have similar powers of investigation? What will be the penalty for non-co-operation with them?</P>
    <P>Like everyone in the House, I welcome the Bill, but it does not address what are serious problems. Perhaps this is a debate for another day, but it is related and this is the only opportunity Members will get to bring to light the incidents we see in our constituencies, the way we see society going and what we can do about it collectively. I encourage the Minister to broaden the scope of a Bill such as this to deal with other aspects of security. When we go out, particularly during the tension hours between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m., there are many people on the streets. The Bill only scratches the surface of the problems on our streets which are evolving because of the acceptance of the culture of excessive alcohol consumption, particularly by young people.</P>

      <P>The demand for private security services has increased recently. Individuals and companies are seeking greater protection for themselves and their businesses. Ideally, self-regulation is the best way forward in any industry. In practice, however, it has not worked in the private security services industry nor in a number of others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" />I welcome the introduction of the Bill to provide for the establishment of an authority to control and supervise individuals and firms providing security services. The private security industry has been overlooked and neglected in terms of regulatory measures and also the subject of justifiable criticism. It is badly in need of regulation to provide a reliable and well trained service. It must also have the confidence of individuals as well as ensuring the rights of property owners are protected. Those charged with the responsibility of delivering the service are faced with a very difficult task. The work often requires tact, diplomacy and sensitivity, but, unfortunately, one does not normally associate those characteristics with some of those engaged in the private security business.</P>
    <P>The job also carries a high level of responsibility. While many of those involved in the industry take that responsibility seriously, many others have caused serious problems by their ineptness or lack of suitability for the job. The recent tragic death of Adrian Moynihan in Cork is an example of a situation where a person charged with responsibility for maintaining order ended up, sadly, being involved in an incident resulting in the death of this young man. That tragic incident and others with less serious outcomes have highlighted the need for training for those employed in the private security industry. Training and recruitment procedures are fundamental to the success of the industry. These issues have not been addressed in sufficient detail. Unless recruitment procedures are clearly defined and appropriate training requirements set out, the private security sector will not develop into the quality service we need and are entitled to expect.</P>
    <P>Nowadays, there are very few areas of employment in which it is possible to walk in off the street and find oneself employed on the spot, with very little serious discussion and no training whatsoever. Given the importance and sensitivity of the job, the emphasis has to be on responsibility and training. There is no shortage of sources of training and the private security industry should avail of those facilities. FETAC, an organisation for further training and education, might well have a role in setting out parameters for the required training and validation.</P>
    <P>Because of the nature of the business, it should be mandatory for those engaged in it to have Garda clearance and appropriate references. The consultative group set up to review the industry recognised that it was not uncommon for criminal elements to infiltrate the sector. In the absence of standards and a licensing system, it is relatively easy for such people to find their way into the business, yet until now there has been no requirement for applicants to have Garda clearance. The provision for this fundamental requirement would be widely welcomed in the industry.</P>
    <P>The advent of CCTV has been an extremely useful development. Security cameras can act as a significant deterrent for those considering criminal activity. The possibility of security film being <Col N="66" /> produced can also be a restraint on any over-enthusiastic response from a security guard or bouncer. CCTV equipment should be introduced in what I might term trouble hot spots as a matter of urgency. The private security industry has developed very rapidly in the past ten years because of the growing need for its services in the context of an increasing crime rate. While CCTV is no panacea for all problems, I suggest it would go some considerable way to improve matters, especially in sensitive locations where there is good reason to anticipate attempted criminal activity at specific times.</P>
    <P>There is also a clear need for compliance in areas such as taxation, social security and health and safety standards. I welcome the relevant provisions in the Bill. Because these aspects were largely ignored, people were left open to exploitation by unscrupulous employers. I hope they will be covered comprehensively in the Bill, taking account of all aspects of the private security business.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Private Security Authority is of fundamental importance. I welcome the provision for a publicly accessible register of all licensees. Traditionally, this industry has had a passing trade, in terms of its employees. I welcome the provision of a system of tracking or traceability and the degree of transparency this will bring to the sector. Most industries are subject to some form of inspection or auditing and it is appropriate this should also apply to the private security sector.</P>
    <P>The powers of the inspectorate and the training of inspectors will be no less important than the training of those actually engaged in security work. The key issues are training, registration, taxation, health and safety and the quality of the inspectorate in this multi-million euro industry. The taxpayer must not be short-changed due to a lack of accountability of persons who might otherwise seek to bypass the system by avoiding registration and not contributing their proper share of taxation. Equally, employees must not be short-changed by being deprived of their social security entitlements. Above all, individuals have a right to be protected under a system in which trained employees deliver a quality service.</P>
    <P>The private security industry should not be seen as taking over the role of the Garda, but rather as an important adjunct in maintaining order in sensitive areas and at times of day or night when there is reason to anticipate problems.</P>

      <P>The Private Security Services Bill, 2001, begins to address an area which needs regulatory legislation. There have been incidents which cried out for regulation of private security services in situations where large groups congregate on social or commercial occasions. However, the scope of the Bill is limited in many ways and I wish to deal with some deeper issues before coming to the issue of regulation. There is need for a serious investigation of social factors which sometimes give rise to violent incidents in our cit<Col N="67" /> ies and towns, a problem on which no area has a monopoly. The most remote provincial town is just as liable as the capital city to have problems in this regard, particularly after closing times of clubs and pubs in the early hours of the morning. Responsibility for this widespread problem can be attributed to a number of factors. Bad planning over many decades is one factor in the psychology which brings a minority to engage in antisocial and violent behaviour.</P>
      <P>The creation of large, soulless housing estates in which drinking emporia are among the few facilities is a recipe for alienation. Alienation leads to a breakdown in neighbourly relations and in responsibility for neighbours, the environment and the community. Unfortunately, a small minority are in a pathological state of being prone to express this alienation in severe alcohol abuse and persistent violence. It is a huge area to examine and tackle but this does not mean that it should not be done.</P>
      <P>Society should have learned from some of the similar disasters which were created in urban areas. Planning should take account of the design of the infrastructure, including services, to create communities capable of interacting on a human and close level. There will always be places such as clubs and social centres where alcohol is sold and these should be planned in such a way as to eliminate the horrors which have happened over the years. Alcohol abuse, which is partly related to what I have described as well as to many other factors, is a huge problem which leads to the type of incident that makes security a fact of life.</P>
      <P>In view of the massive damage done as a result of alcohol abuse, excluding the damage done to the human body by over-consumption and the social violence, the fact that the law and successive Governments continue to allow widespread advertising of alcohol is an absolute scandal. The fact that this very dangerous substance is portrayed as good in every aspect and in a seductive manner which inveigles people of all ages, not just young people, into believing that it is merely anodyne is incredible. It is inconsistent that stern measures are taken against tobacco advertising while ignoring alcohol advertising. I wholeheartedly agree with the measures against tobacco advertising and called for them before they were introduced, but we have a lax approach to advertising a substance which is equally damaging and perhaps much more so in terms of the social consequences spawned by its abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alienation is increased because there is no control on the prices charged in some of the trendy drinking emporia in the larger cities and towns. Statistics show there has been a huge rip-off in services in the past few years, especially since the changeover to the euro. The rip-off in the sale of alcohol is incredible. The difference between the prices in some of the so-called hot spots in Temple Bar in Dublin and those paid in a neighbourhood pub or club is massive. If people, particularly young people, feel that they are being <Col N="68" /> ripped off it adds to a general cynicism and a feeling that nobody cares about anyone else and that the faceless management of these emporia are intent on ripping people off. This can entrench attitudes of irresponsibility and recklessness in behaviour towards these establishments and their employees.</P>
    <P>There should be a wide-ranging discussion on alternatives to the drinking culture, drinking dens and the position of alcohol in society. The Government and local authorities should proactively create plans for new kinds of recreational and social centres which are not simply purpose-built tennis clubs, ball alleys or community centres but are alternative recreational outlets where young and old people can go to relax. Bowling, table tennis and other activities should be facilitated in large complexes which sell food and soft drinks. We need to break this obsession, of which we are all simultaneously guilty and victims, with considering the pub as the only recreational outlet. From a socialist point of view, ordered social ownership of such facilities and large pubs in communities, rather than their being in the hands of conglomerates and big business who soak as much profit as possible from communities, would transform the attitude towards these institutions and behaviour within them. That is something which should be developed.</P>
    <P>I move on to some of the specifics of the Bill. One of the fundamental provisions of the legislation is the requirement for an applicant for a licence to provide a security service. The Bill provides that the authority granting the licence must take account of the qualifications of the person, his or her character, financial position and competence. This is far too narrow. The Bill states that a prescribed fee must be paid and there must be such references to the applicant's character, financial position and competence as the authority may require.</P>
    <P>Section 40 defines that competence. Section 40(2)(<i>d</i>) provides the first reference in the Bill to training. It reads, &ldquo;the Authority, with the consent of the Minister, may by regulations provide for any matter referred to in this Act as prescribed and for the qualifications for licences or particular categories of licences (including any training requirements) and the assessment of those qualifications.&rdquo;  It is quite clear that the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; is placed in the Bill as an afterthought, even though it should be central to it.</P>
    <P>Security personnel have a serious responsibility, especially when large groups congregate in crowded areas and interact with great vigour. Many different problems arise in such circumstances. It is entirely remiss that the Bill does not clarify the type of training that should be required to be granted a licence to provide security services. In his introduction to the Bill, the Minister said about 12,000 people are employed to provide security services and that there is a high turnover in the sector. There is, therefore, a clear need and continuous demand for schools or institutions of <Col N="69" /> some kind to train entrants to the industry and provide refresher courses for those involved in providing security services for a long time.</P>
    <P>I suggest that such schools should provide a wide range of instruction courses, including paramedical training, as security personnel often have to deal with casualties. It can happen that customers suffer from innocent, natural ailments such as an epileptic fit or a heart attack, possibly in a crowded place. Security service providers should be able to attend to such difficulties immediately in a manner that is consistent with best practice. People who are injured as a result of violent attacks which take place before security personnel get to the scene should benefit from first aid techniques which have been professionally taught. Similarly, security officers should be able to give suitable first aid when they encounter people suffering from the effects of drug poisoning.</P>
    <P>An element of thorough training in inter-personal relations should be part of any training course for those involved in the security industry. Those interfacing with the public are routinely arrogant, hostile and aggressive. Their attitudes provoke incidents rather than defuse difficult situations. They should be trained to resolve tense and potentially violent situations by restraining people without having to strike or injure those involved.</P>
    <P>The range of problems faced by security personnel should be addressed as part of proper, professional training, which should be a requirement before a licence is given to work in this area. The philosophy behind such training should be that customers, those spending their money in pubs, clubs or while engaging in other activities, should be approached in a friendly fashion. Security personnel should bear in mind that customers' money, acquired by their hard work, sustains the establishments in which they work and that, consequently, they deserve respect.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to deal with the points I have made. I am sure he will say the authority will be responsible for these matters, but I am saying that such an answer will not be good enough. The Bill should clearly state the parameters of the type of training that is acceptable.</P>
    <P>Section 27 of the Bill states, &ldquo;the Authority shall issue an identity card to each individual who is a licensee.&rdquo;  It goes on to provide, however, that security personnel will be required to present identification to a garda, a member of the authority or the person for whom the licensee is providing a security service under the licence. A system should be put in place to allow people availing of security services to identify security personnel. I concede that it might not be feasible for the identity card to reveal the person's name, as people might try to target innocent doorpersons, but there should be a numbering system similar to that used by the Garda Síochána. If a customer is abused and wishes to make a complaint, he or she should be able to see the number of the security personnel and use it when making <Col N="70" /> a complaint to the authorities. The Bill should provide that the identity of security personnel should be clear and capable of being established through such a numbering system.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the composition of the authority will be determined by the Minister. Similar unsatisfactory provisions have been made for the boards of State and semi-State companies. I have complained about this matter on many occasions in relation to semi-State bodies. While I do not wish to pre-empt who the Minister may or may not appoint to the authority being established under the Bill, I worry that the disgraceful and scandalous practice of packing boards and authorities with individuals whose main qualification is the fact that they are hacks of the political parties which happen to be in power will be repeated. The individuals concerned tend not to have the qualifications needed to make a meaningful contribution in the area to which they are being appointed. This process should not continue with regard to the Private Security Authority.</P>
    <P>No provision is made in the qualifications required for membership of the authority for those who use security services. A mechanism should be found whereby representatives of young people, the biggest users of certain security services, can be represented on the authority. The democratic process dictates that the views of young people, who have to deal with doorpersons and other security personnel and whose money is sustaining the industry, should be heard clearly.</P>

      <P>There has been a quite disgraceful delay on the part of the Government in bringing forward the Private Security Services Bill, 2001, which is known by some as the bouncers Bill. I use the word &ldquo;disgraceful&rdquo; advisedly. A consultative group charged with examining this area produced an excellent report almost five years ago, in December 1997. Persistent attempts were made by my colleague, the former Deputy John Farrelly, to get the Government to move on foot of the report, but the Government only acted after he had produced a Private Members' Bill. The Bill before the House was circulated almost two years ago, but has only just reached Second Stage. There was no question of an apology or explanation from the Minister, Deputy McDowell, as he introduced this debate last week, as he ignored the delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it a coincidence that the Bill has reached the floor of the House in the weeks following an RTE &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; report on the security industry? Is this the kind of Government which is trying to run the country? The point I am making in relation to delays is not an academic one. The seriousness of the matter is clear to those familiar with the case of Adrian Moynihan, who died in Cork last year. I do not wish to pre-empt any investigation or other follow-up to that tragedy, but it is proper to ask whether Mr. Moynihan's death would have occurred if the Government had not been so negligent in the discharge of its <Col N="71" /> responsibilities by leaving the Bill on the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>The same problem arises in regard to the many who have suffered during the years as a consequence of the actions of bouncers, in many cases criminal action. The Government has been utterly neglectful in the discharge of its responsibilities by not moving on the basis of the report produced five years ago and not going ahead with the Bill circulated two years ago. I demand an explanation from it for the delay and to know the reason it did not bother implement this Bill in the meantime. Too many have suffered as a consequence of the Government's delay in bringing forward the Bill to let the issue rest.</P>
    <P>There is another matter with which the Government needs to deal. Now that bouncers are going to be controlled, who will control the gougers? The difficulties inside and outside nightclubs and super-pubs have not arisen solely from the activities of unregulated bouncers. While it is hugely important that security staff are properly vetted and trained, it is also important to bear in mind that if we are to deal with bouncers, we must also deal properly with liquor louts and those driven out of their minds by drink or drugs, very often the cause of public disorder inside and outside nightclubs.</P>
    <P>The record of the Government on this issue is seriously suspect. I recall debating in the House last June the Public Order Bill, which is anaemic enough in its provisions. However, while the Government suggested the Bill was a panacea for much of the ills in the area of public order, it is still lying around and nothing has happened. This raises the issue of the absolute neglect of the Government in dealing with these crucial issues. It might give an explanation for the delay in introducing the bouncer Bill and processing the Public Order Bill. I do not want to be told there is not enough time. Let the House sit longer, there are plenty of days when it could be sitting. It is the Government which orders business. If it was interested, the Bills in question would have been dealt with long ago.</P>
    <P>These issues are totally apart from matters such as the need for adequate resources for the Garda. Now that the Garda is under investigation on so many fronts, it is important to have an understanding of the problems it confronts. Perhaps at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. two of its members must try to control a mob driven wild by booze or drugs. We possibly do not have a full understanding of the difficulties they confront. What is clear also is that the Government does not have an understanding of the need to provide the Garda with adequate resources and backup to deal with such problems.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate other issues have been raised which I do not intend to go into. They relate to the responsibilities of proprietors of nightclubs and super-pubs and parental responsibility which need to be properly debated and dealt with and on which the Government <Col N="72" /> must lead the debate and, if necessary, introduce legislation in this regard. It is important to highlight the need for the Government, which is now in office for over five years, to shake itself out of its lethargy and enact proposals, particularly good ones. That is what we are doing with this Bill five years after its proposals were originally introduced.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the terms of the Bill, of which I largely approve, there are a couple of other issues which need to be dealt with. There have been a number of references to security cameras and the installation of CCTV. As I understand it, the Bill merely provides for the regulation of those who supply such security cameras. It does not stipulate cameras must be put in place. Therefore, while we are regulating the suppliers, we are leaving the provision of cameras to the discretion of proprietors. If that is a correct reading of the Bill, we need an explanation from the Government.</P>
    <P>I recently saw a recommendation from Judge Michael Patwell who suggested that in the renewal of certain licences there should be a requirement that security cameras be installed. That recommendation should be given serious consideration, although I appreciate there may be technical difficulties, for instance, security cameras may not operate well in the steamy and cloudy atmosphere of late night spots. If the technical problems can be overcome, I strongly believe the suggestion of Judge Patwell should be considered seriously whereby the granting of such licences would be contingent on the installation of adequate security equipment. I am interested in hearing the Minister's response.</P>
    <P>Perhaps because of economic prosperity over the last ten years, there seems to be a coarsening of civil society which has resulted in a serious situation in regard to crime. While in some instances there is a trumpeting of figures which indicate a reduction in the overall crime level, hidden within the figures is an increase in the level of serious crime. Last year there was a 93% increase in the number of violent assaults, about which, needless to say, we did not hear until after the general election. There was also a huge increase in the number of sexual assaults and a 33% increase in the number of murders. There seems to be a very serious upward trend in the level of serious crime, including personal assaults and appalling crimes of a sexual nature against women and others. This should call for a response from the Government, which we have not got.</P>
    <P>In general, I find the Bill is one I can support. There are, however, some issues which are not covered in the Bill or in the Minister's speech. He did not deal adequately with the question of funding. I am not sure whether the new authority will be self-financing. The consultative report referred to the best solution as being a cost-sharing arrangement between the State and the industry. It referred to licences being issued at £20 for individuals and £350 for companies. I would like <Col N="73" /> to know the up-to-date thinking of Government on how the new authority will be funded.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the authority. The Minister said in his speech that the authority would be independent, but as usual its members will all be appointed by the Minister. Some explanations will be required from the Minister about how the authority can be totally independent if he is to appoint all its members. In the past there have been appointments to independent authorities which were clearly not intended to ensure that the authorities were independent but to provide voices for the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is one interesting provision in the Bill with which the Minister might deal. It relates to section 18, in which there is a prohibition on members of the authority from disclosing information obtained in the course of their duties. Further explanation is needed for this and the Minister might also explain the position of a member of the authority, or indeed the chief executive or another person working for the authority, who finds himself in possession of information which he feels should be given to the Garda Síochána or another lawful authority. This has not been clarified within the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another provision in section 20 prohibits Members of Parliament from ever being members of such an authority. That is a fairly standard provision, but I often wonder why it is included. Why should a Member of the House not be a member of such an authority, particularly if the Government were to appoint somebody from the Technical Group, for example. What is the reasoning behind that provision? There is also a recommendation in the report of the consultative group which was not dealt with in the Minister's speech or in the Bill. This is the possible involvement of local authorities in the issuing of licences. My recollection is that the group considered that the establishment of the system might ultimately involve the assistance of the local authorities in the issue of licences. Again, this is an issue which has not been dealt with. I am anxious to know the proposals of the Government in this regard.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been a long time coming and the delays have not been explained. The consultative group, when it completed its report five years ago, made certain recommendations assuming the Bill was to be published the following year &ndash; 1998 &ndash; and that the authority would be established within 12 months, but its hope was not realised. After all these years, it is time to get on with it. Let there be no further delay. Let us have a clear commitment from the Minister on closing this debate that this authority will be up and running as quickly as possible and that the needs in relation to vetting and training and the elimination of the criminal and black economy elements from the industry will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also confirm to us that the other issues properly and seriously raised here in the course of this debate will at some stage be dealt with. The Government's lethargy in dealing with <Col N="74" /> such issues, which has been quite obvious over the years, should be a thing of the past. I say this in hope rather than confidence &ndash; I do not think it will happen, but if it does not the Minister may be sure that the Opposition will keep at him. These issues are getting more and more serious and unless they are dealt with we will have more incidents like the one that happened in Cork last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is long overdue and, as many speakers have said, has its basis in the consultative report that came out in December 1997. I welcome in general the contents of the Bill. However, I hope that the regulation of the private security industry will not be used by the Government as a reason for refusing manpower and technical resources to the Garda Síochána, allowing private security firms to take over work that should be done by the Garda. I would have some difficulty with that because the numbers of gardaí on the ground are simply inadequate. There is no serious concern on the part of the Minister or his Department that the numbers required by the Garda are made available to it. For instance, in the town of Clonmel, which is the largest inland town in the country, with a population of more than 20,000 within a radius of a mile and a half of the centre, there are 38 gardaí. This means that at best, eight gardaí are on duty at any time in the area. Two of those are based in the Garda station, so six gardaí are actually on duty. This situation is not unique to Clonmel. It is all too prevalent throughout the country, but it is obvious in Clonmel when compared to the town of Thurles, 25 miles away, which has more than 50% more gardaí than Clonmel.</P>
      <P>I hope the Bill will not be used as an excuse not to provide manpower resources to community gardaí. This area needs to be developed as it has not been done in the past. Unfortunately, the Minister and the Department are simply sticking their heads in the sand. There are no community gardaí, for example, in Clonmel. The issue of closed circuit television cameras in public streets and in the premises covered in the Bill is relevant. Some of the largest towns in the country have no CCTV cameras. In my constituency, there is not a single town with CCTV cameras, nor are they planned for any of these towns despite numerous election promises over the years. There is also the question of whether there should be a requirement that premises, particularly pubs, discos and night clubs, should provide these cameras. They should provide them both inside and outside the premises.</P>
      <P>Sporting, recreational and cultural facilities, under one roof, must be provided for young people. This issue is being ignored. The necessity for the private security industry arises from a change in our society and the perceived and factual increase in serious crime and antisocial behaviour, which may not be criminal in itself but is driving communities to despair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The private security industry has become a huge employer in the past 20 years. In 1997, when <Col N="75" /> the consultative committee reported, 10,900 individuals were operating as sole traders, contractors or employees and there were 400 companies, with a turn-over of £200 million. That is not the whole picture because many security firms operate in the black economy. Since 1997 that figure has probably increased by 50%. Every pub and disco now employs security staff, something that was not as prevalent in 1997.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill covering licensing, professionalism, training, conditions of employment and minimum standards. Many of the companies operating in this area do a great job and employ people with good wages and conditions. Unfortunately, however, there are those who bring the industry into disrepute, who operate in the black economy, do not pay the minimum wage and do not pay social welfare contributions for employees.</P>
    <P>Doormen and employees of the private security industry should be easily identifiable, perhaps even with a uniform similar to that of the Garda. They should wear a badge with an identity number. When private security employees are operating in areas where there are large numbers of people, particularly young people, difficulties can arise and it should be possible for the public to identify security staff so that if they wish to make complaints about them they can be followed up.</P>
    <P>The industry has outgrown voluntary regulation and has unfortunately attracted some criminal elements. In light of that and of the lack of training, the suitability of some employees is open to question. Training is a vital element that must be addressed in the Bill. Those acting as doormen must have a level of expertise to ensure they can deal with difficult situations that may arise where large numbers of people are gathered. The legislation should provide for public representation on the authority, particularly of young people who are at the cutting edge of the industry because they come face to face with it on a nightly basis.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 21 that the authority may require Garda certification of individuals who wish to get a licence should be mandatory. Section 27 provides for identity cards to be issued to licence holders. All employees should have identity badges. The section states that employees must show identity cards to the gardaí but it makes no mention of the public, who should have the right to see identity numbers.</P>
    <P>The character of those employed in the industry is very important. There are bases on which licences should be refused outright. Anyone who has been convicted of murder, rape, armed robbery, money laundering, drug trafficking and aggravated or sexual assault should be precluded from ever getting a licence to operate in this industry. People who have been in difficulty with the law may rehabilitate themselves and in such circumstances offences involving assault, firearms, burglary, malicious damage to property, <Col N="76" /> larceny, fraud, forgery and handling of stolen goods should preclude a person from applying for a licence for a period of up to five years after an offence.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and hope that on Committee and Report Stages it will be made more responsive to public needs, with better representation than that proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">

      <P>This Bill provides for the establishment of a private security authority. It covers many areas, licensing the security trade, security within companies and regulations to ensure that the industry has the highest possible standards. The legislation is overdue. It was an anomaly that this was the only country in Europe without regulation in this area and a code of conduct is necessary. Training is at the core of the Bill and it is vital that we implement regulations that will set high standards.</P>
      <P>Tax incentives should be offered for any capital costs. The control and safety of cash within business can involve huge costs when crime rates are so high. By encouraging investment in the installation of closed circuit television and similar security measures, important steps can be made in this area.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance must go at this point because for two years in a row he has allowed spending to grow at ten times the rate at which revenue came in. That is an incredible achievement. In just 22 months spending has grown by almost 47%. This reckless spending binge has burnt out the surplus which workers created. A surplus of &euro;4.8 billion which was available in 2000 has been burnt out in a reckless pursuit of electoral gain. These reserves which had been built up by the workforce were important because they would cushion the inevitable downturn. Now as we endure a downturn they are gone. The consequences of this extraordinary binge are more job losses in vulnerable industries as a direct result of the failure of the Minister for Finance to control public spending. Already in the past 12 months redundancies are up 46%. <Col N="77" /> Jobs are being lost at the rate of 500 per week while the Minister has allowed public finances to go recklessly off the rails and will add to that sorry toll as we approach Christmas and beyond.</P>
      <P>The origins of this spending spree go back to the beginning of 2001. With their eyes firmly on the election, Operation Bertie was rolled out, with money being offered as the solution to everything. More was to be spent on everything. It was all about glad-handing the public, finding photo opportunities and taking part in grand openings. It was promised that largesse would be dished out to sports clubs and sports people. It did not matter what the occasion was once there was a good opportunity for photographs. People were recruited to the public service at a rate of 1,000 per month. This was an incredible rate of recruitment into the unreformed same old public service and bureaucracy that was not delivering value. A Minister who complained about the failures of that bureaucracy to deliver value, more than any other Minister in the history of the State, recklessly spent money we did not have. The high point of that came with Stadium Ireland, the grand project which was to cost £283 million. It was soon clear that neither costs nor benefits had been assessed and once it came under independent scrutiny the whole thing collapsed like a house of cards.</P>
      <P>We have a vote of no confidence in the Minister for Finance as it was his duty, above all others, to control public spending, to heed the warning signs and to ensure corrective action was taken. The Minister built his political reputation on his dissent when Mr. Haughey in the early 1980s was pursuing a similar tactic of spending recklessly. His courage went when it was demanded and when the tables were turned when he sat at the Cabinet table. The scale of what the Minister has done makes the budgets of Mr. Haughey in the 1980s seem like child's play by comparison. Real spending was at 7%, which was reckless, but the Minister has allowed real spending grow at the rate of 35% in two years, which is an extraordinary level. This was the Minister who prided himself on prudence in public management. His courage completely failed him. Who will suffer as a result of this failure of courage? It will not be the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, and his colleagues in Cabinet but the ordinary people who have already witnessed cutbacks and increased charges for VHI, ESB and attendance at out-patient and casualty departments. For those who want to put a child through college there has been a 70% increase in fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beside the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is the Minister for prices who said she would hold prices during the euro changeover and would make sure the public was not ripped off. Far from holding down prices the Ministers enthusiastically got in on the act. It was they who led the charges as soon as the election was over to hike up prices on every Government service for which they could charge extra. It is not sur<Col N="78" /> prising that people are cynical, angry and frustrated at what is happening.</P>
    <P>The Minister's epitaph will be &ldquo;Get out and party&rdquo;. The spending spree undertaken to back up their well-woven slogan, &ldquo;A lot done, more to do&rdquo;, is the legacy of the Minister. The public quickly discovered that this slogan was like buying a car with the mileage clock turned back. When the election was over they discovered the reality. They opened up the bonnet and it was burning oil and the timing belt was gone. All these extra cutbacks which suddenly emerged from nowhere had to be imposed.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Minister will say the economic downturn has caused all these difficulties and that spending has increased by 47% because the economy has been sluggish. I have never heard anything so ridiculous in my life. Indeed, the Minister's budget says what would happen if economic growth faltered by 1%. He said it would affect the budget only marginally, by 0.5% in borrowing. However, in the past two years spending has increased three fold, more than anything that could be explained by an economic downturn. Economic downturn is not the explanation of what happened, rather it is a matter of Ministers spending recklessly and beyond what the Dáil approved for them at budget time, with the Minister for Finance presiding over a buckaneering approach to tax and tax manoeuvres that resulted in less than a quarter of the revenue he said would materialise in both years. That is an extraordinary performance. The greatest crime is that the Minister will not accept responsibility. He must face up to his direct responsibility. It was he, despite being Minister for Finance, who allowed his party's political agenda to take priority over the duties of the office which he held. He did nothing to rectify trends until it was far too late. He tolerated Ministers spending far beyond what had been approved by the Dáil. It was he who dispensed with advisers on the basis he did not need them and could proceed on his own hunches. He pursued his hunches with our money and we will have to pay the consequences. Those who asked questions were contemptuously swept aside. Days before the election even the then leader of the Opposition, Deputy Noonan, had this contemptuous letter addressed to him, saying everything in the garden was rosy. It was wrong when it was written and it is wrong now.</P>
    <P>Subterfuge was the order of the day throughout the 2002 budget cycle. The Minister produced Estimates showing spending up 8%, which is now running at 19.6%. It was a journalist who highlighted the subterfuge involved in the Estimates at that time. They got past the first stage. When budget day arrived there was a huge emerging deficit of &euro;2.5 billion and there would have to be borrowing. However, that was not the thing to announce in an election year. Instead they dipped into every fund conceivable. They raided the social insurance fund to the tune of &euro;635 million, took &euro;610 million from the euro changeover, brought forward corporation tax and self-<Col N="79" /> employed tax to gain another &euro;700 million and the capital services redemption account was conveniently used to find another &euro;500 million. Miraculously the Minister was free and the huge yawning deficit was gone. He could face the electorate saying he never allowed borrowing and that he made sure every budget he introduced was in credit. It was the greatest phoney action that could be conceived.</P>
    <P>The returns for the first quarter showed that income and corporation tax were already &euro;250 million off target and that spending was running way ahead of target. EUROSTAT had ruled out the &euro;610 million that was to paper over the budget. All this was concealed. There was no admission that things were going wrong. The mask had to be kept up because the election was looming.</P>
    <P>In April things were even worse. Spending in that month alone was up by 34%. Nothing was uttered. There was deathly silence. Any explanation was enough to paper over what was happening. No hard questions were asked by the Minister for Finance on whom we relied to see that public money was properly used.</P>
    <P>Then came the famous letter of 13 May. The Minister solemnly announced that no significant overruns were projected and that no cutbacks whatsoever were being planned, secretly or otherwise. He went on to say that the latest tax returns confirmed the return to growth and that the Government's budgetary projections remained the same as published. However, each month that passed produced more and more evidence of the extent to which this pre-election statement totally misrepresented the true state of affairs. While these words were being uttered memoranda were being produced in the Department of Finance calling for spending to be reined in. Within weeks of the budget the Minister has already on the table &euro;300 million in spending cuts. He let the cat out of the bag that the &euro;300 million shortfall in tax, which was already clear in the first quarter, was admitted to after the election was over. These were the consequences people faced.</P>
    <P>Even today we are assured by the Minister that spending will come in on target. That may happen but I am sure it will be done with smoke and mirrors. One thing is sure, the consequences of coming in on target, a fall in the nominal value of current spending in the last two months of this year, compared to the last two months of last year of 6%, will be dire. We will not see a 27% cut in the last two months in spending on health, a 23% cut in spending on the environment, an 11% cut in spending on justice or an 8% cut in spending on education. The Minister will not bring his budget in on target by making sure spending programmes stay within budget. There will be more funny money. Payments under benchmarking, which he budgeted for, will not be made. Reserves and balances will be brought forward and things will look much better than the reality, but that will not convince anyone. Three out of <Col N="80" /> four people believe the Minister misrepresented the facts and misled them to win the election. That is the truth of the matter. The Minister's legacy is runaway spending and crumbling revenue resources.</P>
    <P>The Government is now asking the people to believe the Minister can undo the damage he created, that he will ensure that the weak and vulnerable sections of our community will not carry the can in the forthcoming retrenchment, that extra burdens will be fairly shared and that ordinary workers will not have to bear the loss. The Government expects us to believe that the Minister will sensitively separate important social needs from the shrill demands of the loudest and the greediest. I have no confidence he will do so. Nothing in his record suggests that he is the man to do that. It is the weak and the voiceless who have been singled out for the cutbacks announced since the election. It is hard-pressed families that have borne the brunt of the extra charges brought about since the election. It is ordinary workers who are being asked to accept a pay freeze while nothing is done about unscrupulous profiteering. The Minister has celebrated the unfettered pursuit of profit, of rugged individualism, regardless of social price. That is the legacy he has left. We do not believe he will deal sensitively with the difficult problems ahead. He has allowed the systems for ensuring value for money in public spending to grind to a halt and rust.</P>
    <P>We now face a budget as a result of which the public will suffer the hangover for the Government's binge. We already see what will happen in the forthcoming budget. It will not be the big bureaucracies, advisers, spin doctors of the Government that will bear the consequences. There will not be serious reform to deliver value for money. It will be the small people who will be asked to pay again. This is a Government which has honed the skill of telling the public what it wants to hear. Now is the time for it to listen to its tracking polls and focus groups. Three out of four people believe that the Minister for Finance conned the public to win the election. He has lost the confidence of the people. He has no credibility in asking them to make sacrifices. He must go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the negligence of the Government, the weakest in our society are suffering the most. Ireland is currently in the grip of a serious housing crisis that began during the reign of the Celtic tiger and that the Government has failed to tackle in any way. This crisis has changed our society and the way we live. Only a few years ago home ownership was something to which most people could aspire, but that is no longer the case. In the not too distant past people in full-time employment could purchase a home. However, a few years ago, house prices began to soar beyond their means because of rampant and uncontrolled price increases. It was also difficult to rent in the private sector because of escalating rental costs brought about by the Government's <Col N="81" /> decision to embrace and implement the first Bacon report. How could people purchase a home when prices were out of control? Nationwide house prices have risen by a staggering 79% since 1997, with the average price of a new house now standing at over &euro;189,000.</P>
      <P>Many of the people caught by these rampant increases had nowhere else to go except to the local authority, swelling waiting lists that were in many cases almost out of control. In Cork, for example, waiting lists have gone from 2,000 to 4,000 in the few short years during which this Government has been in office. In our capital a very serious situation has developed. A recent study showed that only 10,000 new houses were being built privately each year although 15,000 or 20,000 units are needed yearly in the Dublin region. This helps to make house prices in Dublin much higher than in cities of comparable size in the European Union. Throughout all this, the Government has allowed the local authority house building programme to flounder so that it can no longer meet demand. Thousands of people, young and old, in this the 21st century are living under 19th century conditions. Thousands are living in hovels that are unregistered with local authorities and the local authorities do not have the resources to monitor and control these slums. The Minister, by refusing to answer questions in this House about enforcement, is effectively washing his hands of this appalling situation. Even with the recent highlighting of cases of students living in primitive conditions, the Minister would not come into the House and answer questions about enforcement of building regulations.</P>
      <P>This position is made even worse by the failure of the local authority house maintenance programme which is highly ineffective. Once again, the Government will not act. Throughout Ireland, in the middle of the most serious housing crisis ever in our history, there are hundreds of millions of pounds worth of houses lying vacant at any one time. In one local authority I estimate that £35 million worth of housing is lying idle. Individual houses lie empty for years because of the disastrous house maintenance programme, and these are houses that could be used by people on waiting lists.</P>
      <P>This scandalous situation is allowed to go on because of the Minister's failure to act. The reduced house construction programme, coupled with the very ineffective house maintenance programme, has brought about a bleak and hopeless scenario for the estimated 100,000 families on waiting lists. This scandalous situation is the result of gross mismanagement and negligence at the highest level of Government, involving the Departments of Finance and the Environment and Local Government. The result of this negligence is that the weakest in our society are suffering most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one sympathises with the plight of young people hoping to get housing, we must also remember that the Government has failed in its <Col N="82" /> responsibilities to the elderly. The essential repairs for the elderly scheme and related schemes which are designed to help elderly persons in substandard conditions have run out of money. In one health board area more than 1,000 elderly people have been told that although they are worthy of help they will have to wait two or three years for their essential repairs to be carried out because there is no funding. Many of those people are in their 80s and may be dead by the time their turn arrives. The reality of Ireland today is a harsh one brought about by this incompetent Government. It is a fact of life with which many people live, and one not often highlighted in the media and conveniently forgotten by Ministers.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks, I have been inundated with calls from the 227 Fine Gael councillors throughout the country. They are worried about the financial plight of their councils going into next year's estimates. Many local authorities are deeply in debt and are still in the dark regarding what funding will be made available to them next year. They are turning to new forms of taxation to raise revenue. For example, a local authority on the east coast slapped a &euro;35,000 development charge on a person building a house and a &euro;300,000 development charge on a person building a commercial garage. These charges are an example of a new layer of taxation imposed on people because of inadequate funding and structures. The coming year will be one of crisis for local authorities and they will be forced to impose further local charges which will essentially be a new form of taxation.</P>
    <P>In addition to these problems, the Ministers for Finance and Transport are jeopardising the future of the country by failing to plan for the full financial costs of the national development plan. There are many examples of projects at risk. Some 14 major road projects have been dropped so far including the Ennis bypass, the Carrickmacross bypass, the Sligo inner relief road, the Castleisland-Abbeyfeale route and the Enniscorthy-Clonroche route. Even the five major inter-urban routes are now running at least two years behind schedule with these roads not expected to reach completion until 2008 at the earliest.</P>
    <P>As Dublin city grinds to a halt, further cutbacks in the national development plan have had a negative effect on the development of the rail sector. We are told that, to date, no orders have been placed for the delivery of the 67 new inner-city rail carriages. It seems that the earliest date for the delivery of these carriages is now 2005. Only 10% of the budget for the development of suburban rail and park and ride facilities has been spent. The funding for integrated ticketing has been shelved until at least 2006. On top of this, Luas is running at least six months behind schedule.</P>
    <P>The only successful element of the national development plan investment has been the upgrading of the rail network. However, the Minister for Finance will not provide the funding <Col N="83" /> to utilise that network and improve the service. The funding of regional airports has been long-fingered at a time when many airports are struggling to survive and little industrial development is being achieved close to them. There is a litany of failure, negligence and indifference from the Government and it will have to pay the price.</P>

      <P>It will be my pleasure to put my remarks through the Chair but I hope they go to the Minister for Finance. I am glad the Taoiseach is in the House as he is another who saw no problems at the beginning of the year. The public was told by the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and every Fianna Fail and Progressive Democrats member in the country that there would be no cutbacks, secret or otherwise. One month after the general election, the Government re-evaluated the situation, looked at the books from the Department of Finance and the Minister found he had a problem. Even then, he could not admit that to the public.</P>
      <P>When the Minister found there was a problem, he targeted children, mothers and the unemployed. Inflation has been rising on a day-to-day basis over the past 12 months and increases in social welfare have been washed away. Food prices have gone up by the hour while the Minister and his Government have done nothing.</P>

Do the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and <Col N="84" /> Employment think that is wonderful? Can the Government be allowed to do this to the poor in society? The Western Health Board and every other health board are targeting the weak. Will the Government give extra funding to the Western Health Board to prevent that poor lady having to go to bed when it gets dark at 5 p.m.? She does not get up until the next day at daylight. Do the Taoiseach and the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Finance think it is right that poor people must go to bed when it gets dark because they are afraid and there are no services for them?</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance is probably the greatest scandal. I listen to Government backbenchers who are great for writing articles in newspapers telling the Government how badly it is doing its job yet come to the House every week and go through the lobbies to vote with the Government. In his Budget Statement, the Minister told us that there would be 3,400 more carers added to the 22,500 carers paid for by the State. He said there would be extra carers because the guidelines would be lifted and made easier. That did not happen and only 1,400 came within the guidelines. There are 100,000 carers looking after elderly people and, when they apply for carer's allowance, they are asked to supply savings books and every document they possess to the social welfare office. The Department of Social and Family Affairs does all in its power to ensure that these people do not get carer's allowance despite the fortune saved by the State due to their care for elderly people in the home.</P>
    <P>If elderly people cannot be looked after at home, they are put in nursing homes and must look for subvention. If an old person goes into a home, his or her house is taken away and, even if no income is being made from the house, income is calculated for it. Old people are being told that the next time they leave their homes will be in a coffin. Do you, a Cheann Comhairle, think that is right? If you wish, I invite you to ask the Government if it thinks it right that an old person's house is calculated as income when he or she goes into a nursing home. Old people should have some hope that they will come out of nursing homes and will live in society again. Some go to homes for the winter months while some go for respite on the basis that they are not able to look after themselves. That is an attack on the elderly, the poor and the weak, and it should not happen.</P>
    <P>Increasing numbers are being taken off medical cards and that is a crazy situation. When people on disability benefit get slight benefit increases their medical cards are withdrawn because of the guidelines. That should not happen and would not happen in a society that cared about the sick and weak.</P>
    <P>I will pose three questions to the Minister about the agricultural sector. I hope he or someone from his Department responds either tonight or tomorrow. I am told reliably that he is seeking a &euro;12 million cut in the Teagasc budget, &euro;2 mill<Col N="85" /> ion in that of Bord Bia and &euro;500,000 in that of Bord Glais. We are trying to sell beef and to keep the farming community and rural Ireland together, but the Minister targets the agricultural sector. This evening a man took responsibility for his actions, Brendon Menton of the FAI, who accepted that he did not do his job properly. The Taoiseach is a great sportsman and he, the Minister and the Tánaiste should do as Mr. Menton did tonight. They made a mess of the country and the economy and they should do the honourable thing. The three musketeers ought to resign as they have more to answer for than Mr. Menton. They destroyed the country and put people out of it.</P>

      <P>It is impossible to have confidence in a Minister for Finance who allowed the Minister for Health and Children to increase public spending on health by 137% with no requirement that he achieve a commensurate improve<Col N="86" /> ment in the health service. It is not that we criticise the spending of the money, but it was not spent wisely. Value for money in the health service is expressed in better patient care and service, which we surely did not get. Not alone was there no attempt to achieve value for the additional money spent, but there was no attempt to tackle the fundamental restructuring so that maximum value could be achieved from the core budgets, despite the fact that the need for it was clearly signalled by virtually everyone of the many dozens of reports commissioned by the Minister for Health and Children and unquestioningly paid for by the Minister for Finance. Every time it seemed the Minister was about to make a decision, he commissioned yet another report.</P>
      <P>One matter he might have paid attention to was the value for money audit, which was received 18 months ago and has sat on a shelf since with not one single recommendation implemented. It was a damning indictment of the health service, clearly and unequivocally stating that the structures, financial systems, control procedures and data bases were totally incapable of monitoring &ldquo;the efficiency and effectiveness of the health service&rdquo;. This did not seem to matter to the Minister for Health and Children who took the Minister for Finance seriously when he said that it was party time. On the scantiest of information, he proceeded to employ thousands more people who were tacked on to a health service that was already creaking at the seams.</P>
      <P>More recently, he demanded and got &euro;35 million for the national treatment purchase fund, but then found that he could not spend it, which typifies the lack of forward planning in the health service in the past five years. If that did not raise alarm bells in the Department of Finance, it must have been that the Minister was deafened by the sound of champagne corks popping in his office. Over the past five years, the Minister for Finance without question signed the cheques and allowed the money to be poured into a black hole of a structure that was not changed for 30 years and by common consent was wholly inappropriate to today's needs. Despite the fact that half of a massive health budget was being poured into acute hospitals and there were 25,000 on the waiting list, no attempt was made to make the hard political decisions to define a strategy for these hospitals. Consequently the 1,200 consultants were not appointed and the 300 beds were not commissioned, all because the Minister could not decide where or in what speciality to locate them, which is now irrelevant as the money is no longer there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result is that some hospitals duplicate services in some parts of the country while in other parts there are no services. There is the scandal of Monaghan with 300 consultants, doctors, nurses and support staff idle so that the hospital is costing more closed than it was open. At any time in the health service, there are 600 acute beds, costing &euro;3,500 per week, occupied by <Col N="87" /> patients who are inappropriately placed, often because the local authorities have run out of the money needed to provide even a simple chair lift so that they can be discharged. Meanwhile, 25,000 acutely ill people are on waiting lists. How can this be justified and why did the Minister for Finance not call the Minister for Health and Children to account for such waste? Why were whole theatres closed and consultants and their expensive support staff idle because of the failure to maintain equipment?</P>
    <P>I could go on endlessly with examples of waste and failure to obtain value for money in the health service. Worse is the absence of an information system. A child in the street could tell us that we cannot manage an operation as complex and costly as this service without the most up-to-date and reliable information. No private business would do it but the Minister, Deputy Martin, had no trouble doing so as he does not regard information systems as a priority, yet the Minister for Finance never called him to account. The Minister for Health and Children underestimated the number of patients over 70 and over-estimated the number of medical card patients. He may or may not have paid for patients who were dead, but it is reassuring that he is going to ask the health boards to check. The reality is that the Minister does not know how many clients he has or how many people work for him, but he just kept writing the cheques. He can no longer go back to the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, for more cheques because that Minister, with breathtaking carelessness, has managed to lose &euro;4.8 billion in just 22 months.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is that the much vaunted health strategy, which got the Government elected, is now effectively dead. The money needed to restructure the health service has disappeared into the wild blue yonder and the morale of the more than 100,000 people who work in it and who bought into the health strategy is at an all-time low. The patients have been betrayed most and they are being asked to pay with their money and health for the profligacy of the Minister for Finance. Pathetic attempts to claw back some of the over-spending by charging sick people were bad enough, but what is unforgivable is that none of the promises for the health service can be delivered, or we must wait for the birth of the next Celtic tiger. The public have no confidence that the Minister has the capacity to rebuild the nation's economy, or if he had, they would not trust him with it and neither would this House.</P>

    <P>A motion of no confidence is the ultimate sanction that Dáil Éireann has at its disposal and intended as an instrument of grave crisis or final ultimatum, yet only five months into its renewed mandate for opposition, Fine Gael has brought this motion against the Minister for Finance. It is not really about that Minister but the continuing political bankruptcy of Fine Gael. The policies put to the people by Fine Gael six months ago would have returned Ireland to where it left it when it last enjoyed a full term in Government in the 1980s. They would have plunged Ireland into a downward spiral of borrowing for current spending, job losses and emigration.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Based on the exact same figures that were available to the Government parties, Fine Gael promised to tax less than Fianna Fáil, to spend more and to borrow less. This three card trick was backed up by a reserve plan of agreeing to whatever the Labour Party proposed. Fine Gael's concern for economic prudence now is too little too late.</P>
      <P>The theme of missing billions is an interesting choice for Fine Gael. It combines highway robbery with massive fraud. It implies secret but lavish spending on a grand scale. It perfectly sums up Fine Gael's election manifesto which it is now trying to disown by projecting its worst excesses on to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ultimately, however, it is the parties in government whom the people have chosen to trust. I take seriously the charge of deception that has been made against the Government. Worse than squandering the people's money is abusing the <Col N="89" /> people's trust. Confidence in our public affairs, so difficult to build, is it seems just more ammunition for Fine Gael in its fight for lost ground. This is neither the first time nor the only issue in the short life of this Dáil that Fine Gael has made unsubstantiated personal accusations in the absence of evidence, let alone a reasoned case.</P>
    <P>The Government has a proud record of achievement and integrity. We were frank about the changed circumstances which Ireland found itself in from the second half of 2001. At home, foot and mouth disease had impacted on our economy. Then the terrible events of 11 September impacted upon the world. This was in a context where the economy in the United States had already begun to slow significantly. It was against this background that budget 2002 was framed. In budget 2002, the Minister clearly signalled the slowdown ahead. Based on the information available, he anticipated a small surplus in 2002 of &euro;170 million based on tax revenue growth of 8.6%. Based upon these same figures, the Fianna Fáil manifesto projected a &euro;2.9 billion deficit for 2003 while Fine Gael projected a deficit of &euro;1.9 billion and Labour anticipated a deficit in 2003 of &euro;2.7 billion. As far back as last December, there was clear recognition that the era of double digit growth was over. It was stated plainly, clearly and repeatedly, and the deception is to pretend otherwise.</P>

      <P>Through 2002, events have moved on and we now find ourselves in a significantly tighter situation than anticipated last December. It is worth repeating again what the Minister for Finance had to say about this in an article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 29 September last. He stated:</P>
      <P>In an analysis of the end-May returns, the Revenue Commissioners, in a note to my department, &ldquo;very tentatively&rdquo; put forward the view that taxes might be &euro;300 million below target. This figure was subsequently revised to &euro;500 million at the end of the second quarter.</P>
      <P>The facts of the matter are that prior to May 17, neither I nor the Government had information that showed Budget targets would not be met. The Monthly Expenditure reports for the Government, the reports from the Revenue Commissioners to my department on tax receipts, including projections for the rest of the year, and the briefing notes prepared by my department on the Monthly Exchequer Balance all bear this out.</P>
      <P>I state categorically again, as the Minister for Finance has already done, that no information was kept from the people prior to the general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" />In the Fianna Fáil manifesto published on the day the general election was called my party made its position clear. We clearly stated up front in our manifesto:</P>
    <P>The achievement of strong growth is, of course, dependent on renewed world growth and no adverse economic shocks. They also depend on the right policies continuing to be pursued domestically, particularly on maintaining competitiveness and sensible budgetary policies.</P>
    <P>On the following day, when the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, published our party's economic document, the theme was developed further. That document entitled Delivering on Jobs and Growth stated:</P>
    <P>We believe that the clear and obvious lesson of the times that Ireland has left behind is that we cannot tax and spend our way to employment and better services. In fact, the surest way to cause unemployment and undermine the public finances would be to implement unsustainable spending plans or to try to return to the days of high taxation.</P>

      <P>This latter paragraph was not only printed up front, it was printed in bold type as well. Our position could not have been clearer, it could not have been more clearly stated.</P>
      <P>Given the colourful accusations being made about missing billions, it is ironic that over the past five years, the most trenchant criticisms of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, were reserved for the money he saved rather than the money he spent. During the last Government, when Ireland was a world leader in economic growth the Minister kept our budget in surplus.</P>

Further, he gave back nearly &euro;5 billion in tax reductions to Irish workers. This was just the money that the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, did not spend. When the Government is asked tonight &ldquo;where are the missing billions?&rdquo;, I say that they are where they belong. I say they are in safe keeping for a secure retirement for Irish workers. They are in the pockets of the working men and women whose hard work generated our wealth in the first place. They are there because of the vision and foresight of my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>These reductions in tax rates &ndash; 12 points in all &ndash; brought the standard rate to 20% and the higher rate to 42%. These reductions in tax went where they were needed most.</P>

      <P>Putting people back to work is the single and most important social change that has been brought about in this country's recent history. It has changed lives and communities and has transformed our country.</P>
      <P>The mark of the Minister's tenure is not only of good management but of radical reform as well. Having discussed it for half a century, our taxation system has been radically overhauled by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. The burden of personal taxation in Ireland is much less and much fairer. A business tax environment has been created that is supportive of jobs and of Ireland as a destination for investment in jobs. The business tax environment serves Ireland well and has been successfully defended in the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has pursued a policy of paying the national debt and of paying into a pension fund to secure a comfortable retirement for people who are working. These are farsighted decisions <Col N="93" /> that can impact positively on our quality of life for a generation to come and long after we have left the House.</P>
    <P>The boom has not been squandered. It has been spent wisely on the services we need today, invested prudently in the infrastructure we have needed for generations and has been saved with foresight for the retirement we all hope to enjoy.</P>
    <P>On Thursday next the Minister for Finance will present the Estimates for next year, and three weeks from tomorrow he will present his sixth budget. The resources available will be focused on the priorities set out in the general election by the parties in Government. Delivery on these priorities will, as we said, be &ldquo;predicated and dependent on continued growth in the economy&rdquo;. I await with interest to see if the concern of the Opposition about the public finances will survive in the cold light of the day after tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to reaffirm my confidence and that of the Progressive Democrats in the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. In any Government the Minister for Finance plays a pivotal role. In the Irish Government, the Minister for Finance is central to the workings of Government across a range of areas. He or she is responsible for the stewardship of the public finances, the management of the public service and the implementation of the Government's social and economic programme. When one speaks of confidence in the Minister for Finance, one is therefore talking about confidence in the Government. When one speaks of the actions of the same Minister, one talks about the actions of the Government. When one speaks of the record of the Minister, one is talking about the record of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the current Government parties formed the Government in 1997 we set out a challenging ambition &ndash; to revitalise the economy and trans<Col N="94" /> form society. By any yardstick, we have done a fantastic job. I wish to put the record straight in many respects. Unemployment was at 11% when we took office; today it is just more than 4%. Long-term unemployment accounted for more than 90,000 people; today it has fallen to 22,000 people or 1.2%. Some 370,000 extra people are at work. The record in terms of the public finances could not be better.</P>
    <P>I was abroad last week on parliamentary business, as many people in this House are periodically. When we meet the people who left this country in a different time, they are proud of what we have achieved. As we live through the transformation in the economy, some of us find it difficult to come to terms with what has happened. However, Irish people are returning to better jobs in Ireland today than they had in the United States, Germany and many other places.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>He has radically transformed the income tax system. The introduction of tax credits is probably the greatest change in the personal income tax system in a generation. It has delivered more reliefs to people on low and modest incomes. It has genuinely helped make the system fairer and more transparent. For example, the contribution income tax makes to our total tax take has fallen from more than 36% when the parties opposite were in Government to 32%, whereas the contribution of corporation tax to our overall tax take has increased from 11% to more than 15%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tax reform proposals are the key to much of the economic success we have experienced in this country in recent years because they reward risk-taking, encourage investment and enterprise and help create employment. Those tax measures would not have been introduced lightly by many in the Department of Finance and were pioneered courageously and correctly by the Minister for Fin<Col N="96" /> ance. They play a hugely important role in making this country the most attractive in the European Union from a foreign investment perspective.</P>

      <P>It has nothing to do with the election. The Government will take the decisions necessary to chart us through this challenging period and make sure that when the international economy recovers, Ireland will continue to do spectacularly well. We will do so because we have a flexible workforce and low corporate taxes. We remain the country of choice within the European Union for much of the investment from the United States into Europe. We get by far the largest share in getting more than 20% of the mobile investment as against a population of less than 1%. They are the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been in an expanding economy over the past five years. The population has grown. So far this year we have granted as many work permits as we did for the whole of last year. That does not indicate an economy in crisis or difficulty. People would not be coming here to work <Col N="98" /> in such huge numbers if the jobs were not available. I do not wish to take away from the fact that, unfortunately, too many people are losing their jobs because of the international difficulties. The challenge for us is to ensure we have the appropriate policies in place to make sure that when the economic recovery comes, we can again get the kind of share of investment and the growth in the economy we experienced in the past.</P>

The economic management of the country is in sound hands in those of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. He is prepared to support risk-taking in enterprise and to encourage employment by decreasing the rate of tax paid by those at work. For the first time in recent years we have a national minimum wage. The State recognises there is a minimum someone should earn for his or her effort and 90% of that wage is outside the tax net. This is not the <Col N="99" /> approach that would be taken by a Government that is interested in one section of society. The most effective way to help people out of poverty so they can participate in the economic and social development of their own country is by helping them into employment. We have record numbers of people moving from welfare into employment.

      <P>We have 25,000 people on community employment. We have mainstreamed those working in education. There are 370,000 extra people at work. There are 40,000 more people in training for jobs in this economy. In a tightened labour market, clearly the circumstances are different and we have to respond. Unfortunately in a different era, people had no option but community employment, but today other options are being created. I am the first to recognise community employment plays an important role in the social infrastructure of our society.</P>

      <P>As I said at the outset, I am happy to reaffirm my confidence and that of my party in the Minister for Finance. I am satisfied he is the person, perhaps more capable than anyone else in this House, or as capable as few that have ever been in this House, to steer us through the challenging and difficult times that lie ahead. Clearly we have to respond to the changed circumstances in this economy. There is a challenge as far as public spending is concerned and that challenge is clear to most people who want to be fair about it because of the difficulties that have occurred in the international economy and not because of any dishonesty or mismanagement on the part of the Minister for Finance or the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Stanton.</P>
      <P>I am fascinated by the Tánaiste's wish not to put Deputy McCreevy out to stud at this time because, if she does, he is likely to earn more money for the State than he is as Minister for Finance. I am also very confused that the Tánaiste does not know the difference between the economy and the public finances. I did not hear anyone say this economy was in recession or in tatters. The argument has been about the Minister's management of the public finances and that is a distinctly different issue. I know she is away a lot but, if the Tánaiste wants to give the impression that somehow the Minister for Finance has competently managed the public finances over the last two and a half years in particular, she is living on a different planet to the rest of us. It is almost impossible for the Minister to have done as much damage as he has over the last two years and it is almost unthinkable, given the pretensions to fiscal rectitude the Minister had when he was a backbencher, the damage that has been done by his engaging in the spending splurge running up to the general election.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste knows that, as a result, the weakest most vulnerable sections of our community, people on low incomes &ndash; in or out of employment &ndash; and people living on the margins will pay for the austerity programme that is now essential as a result of how the Minister has mismanaged the public finances. For the Tánaiste to go on about all the jobs the Government has created is an entirely different issue The Tánaiste frequently claims credit in this House &ndash; as does the Minister for Finance &ndash; but it is remarkable that now, when we are facing a downturn, the Tánaiste has no responsibility for it and neither does the Minister for Finance. Global factors are apparently responsible for the downturn but &ldquo;Champagne Charlie&rdquo; and &ldquo;Good Time Mary&rdquo; created the boom. Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expansion which took place in the private sector was for different reasons upon which we are all agreed and on which there was very little difference between any Government in office over the last 25 years. These were decisions about investment in education, the tax regime and the availability of skilled labour. These are the factors that created the job expansion to which the Tánaiste now lays claim. When things were right, the Minister told us to party and that he would give the money back to those who created and that the good times would go on forever. Yet now, when we have a downturn, the Government says it has nothing to do with it and that global factors are responsible. I do not believe that will wash, nor do I believe that the efforts made by the Taoiseach to suggest that the Minister for Finance has been consistent and revealed all to the people coming up to the general election are believed by anybody in this House and certainly not by anyone outside it. Every impression was given that the boom would go on forever and that <Col N="101" /> we were living in the good times. The entire presentation made by the Government was to mislead the people about the state of the public finances.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will say that in the small print of the budget last year it showed the Exchequer would be facing deficits of &euro;3 billion and more than &euro;3.5 billion in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Can we imagine what the figure will be when the Minister presents his budget on 4 or 5 December this year when the carryover from last year for the spending splurge he engaged in was &euro;3 billion? I do not know how the Taoiseach can say the Minister did not mislead the House. In proposing the motion, Deputy Richard Bruton adverted to the unequivocal undertaking the Taoiseach gave to the then Leader of Fine Gael when he said &ldquo;I can confirm that there are no significant over-runs projected and no cutbacks whatsoever are being planned, secretly or otherwise&rdquo;. The Tánaiste and the Taoiseach can speak about what was in one paragraph of an 84 page manifesto but what was communicated to the people is what was communicated in that sentence to the then Leader of Fine Gael. That was the conviction of the people and on that basis they went to the polls.</P>
    <P>We are already seeing the effects everywhere. The promise to extend the eligibility for medical cards has been reneged on; the registration fees for college students have been increased; various service industries have been engaged in excessive profit taking and the CE schemes are being dismantled in many areas. All this is happening before the budget, so what will we face in its wake? </P>
    <P>The boom is gone and the Minister has officially told us so. The surplus has evaporated, the public finances are in a state of considerable disorder, the capital programme is behind and our streets are congested. The opportunity for the first time in the history of the State to use the unprecedented resources we have had to make a real impact in tackling disadvantage has been missed. Unfortunately, the need for public spending has not gone away but the critical issue must always be the quality of spending and value for money and that the public finances are managed prudently.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Olivia Mitchell's observations on the Government's boasting about health spending. Money was thrown at the problem without fundamental reform of the health system. While the good times rolled, it was possible to keep throwing money at it but now we see the same queues the Taoiseach promised to eliminate in two years and the same problems are there. Three new health boards were created in Dublin and, as far as I can see, all that was created were new titles, posts and bureaucrats but at the coalface, the health services are worse than they ever were, even after providing all those hundreds of millions of euro.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance are the gurus of fiscal rectitude who believe in the neo-liberal economy. They are the people sup<Col N="102" /> posed to believe in value for money but nobody spent money like this Minister &ndash; he spent it like a drunken sailor for the 18 months up to the general election and it now cannot be gainsaid any longer. The information is in the public arena and we will see the full scale of it on budget day. The Book of Estimates will be published on Thursday and we will then see how programmes for which the Tánaiste herself is responsible will be impacted upon. That is the reality and the people outside this House know they were misled. They know they had the position on the economy misrepresented to them and they know that they are the ones who will pay. The Tánaiste may think that a tax exempt industry like the bloodstock industry is a matter for laughter.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear it because many people would like to know why they will be asked to pay for the Minister's mismanagement while an entire industry is tax exempt. Experts estimate the industry is worth &euro;100 million foregone in tax to the Exchequer. That would create 1,000 hospital beds. It is a real issue. If the Tánaiste is concerned about it, will she persuade the defender of the horse industry to introduce measures in the budget that will at least make it accountable, transparent and will impose some form of modest tax regime on them? That will be the real test because the Minister will have to levy taxes somewhere and I am willing to lay a wager tonight that it will not be on his friends in the K Club and in the bloodstock industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion of no confidence in the Minister for Finance, whose responsibility also includes the public service. In effect, we are calling on the Taoiseach to replace the Minister, whose underlying philosophy is to look after the rich and to hell with the rest. In relation to the savings scheme, it is being said it should be capped or scrapped. I do not believe this can be done, but it appears the scheme will cost up to &euro;500 million this year alone, or &euro;2.5 billion over a five year period, to give money to people who had enough to spare to enable them to put some away anyhow. That is indicative of the underlying philosophy of the Minister and the Government. The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, is being sent hither, thither and yon in an effort to sell off State properties to boost the public finances. It is a panic measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach began by attacking the Opposition &ndash; a tactic which, presumably, he picked up from the famous think tank set up during the general election campaign and which ensured the public was conned. The spontaneous reaction of the audience when the Minister for Finance appeared on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; recently on RTE is indicative of the degree of public unhappiness with his management. The spontaneous booing on that occasion was obviously not to his <Col N="103" /> liking, but, like it or not, it reflected the mood of the public. People are very angry with him and the Government. According to the Taoiseach, the Minister said on 29 September that neither he nor the Government had information to indicate that budget targets would not be met. Why did he not have that information? He should have known, but miscalculated hugely in the amount he gave away. He did not know how much it would cost. It seems he did not know how many were at work in the economy when he decided to cut taxes.</P>
    <P>The Minister was reported as saying it was his job to win the general election for Fianna Fáil. That, in itself, is an indictment of his priorities &ndash; party first, people later; politics before people. That is where the Government is coming from. A short time ago, when the community employment schemes were mentioned, the ranks of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats laughed. The schemes relate to the weakest of the weak, those struggling to make a living and who want to work with dignity. The policies of the Government will force many of them onto the dole queues yet again. How could Deputies on the Government side of the House laugh at this? It is just not good enough, but underlines the basic philosophy of the Minister, for whom the poor and downtrodden at the lower end of the scale do not matter. Those who have to be looked after at all times are the Minister's friends.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste referred to the national minimum wage, with a throwaway remark that most people at that level are not taxed. The fact that the minimum wage is still taxed, years after its introduction, again illustrates the Government's underlying philosophy. An article by Vincent Browne in <i>The Irish Times </i>today shows that people are getting away with hundreds of thousands of euro in unpaid taxes. Why is that the case? Accountants have told me they have instructions from Revenue and departmental officials to use every loophole to get at small taxpayers &ndash; they are the ones being targeted by the Government. The Minister for Finance speaks of cutting our cloth according to our measure, but applies this only to the poorer sections of society.</P>
    <P>I remind the House of the great debacle of the Government's handling of the Eircom sale when, once again, the people were conned. Millions in government funding was spent on advertising to induce people to buy shares in which the Minister had a central role, in collaboration with the then Minister for Public Enterprise. Having placed their trust in the Government, many lost their life savings in that operation. The Government led people to believe they would never experience poverty again. The message was to party on and spend, spend, spend. Now, the message is to cut, cut, cut. Again, it is those at the lower end of the scale who will suffer most. Health boards are being told to cut back and the same message is going out to the Garda and all State agencies. Schools are finding it difficult to get funds. The Minister for Education and Science will not even <Col N="104" /> answer questions in the House on the expenditure on schools, but simply refers Deputies to his Department's website. In this regard also, the message is to cut, cut and cut again.</P>
    <P>At the time of the euro changeover, the Minister for Finance and the Government promised there would be no price increases, yet we now have the highest inflation rate in Europe and are losing competitiveness. When the rainbow Government left office in 1997, the economy was creating 1,000 jobs per week. The Minister for Finance found a crock of gold at the end of the rainbow and lived off it for some years, but it has now run out. After five years of his stewardship, we are losing 500 jobs per week and this figure is rising rapidly. If the trend continues, we will very soon have regressed to the situation of the 1980s. The Taoiseach must reshuffle his Cabinet, remove the Minister before he does any more damage and replace him with somebody capable of managing the economy responsibly. Such management has been lacking to date. The Minister has tried scheme after scheme, pulling rabbits out of hats and performing conjuring tricks with the national finances. He has pulled revenue from next year into this year's accounts, raided the social insurance fund and Central Bank funds until stopped by EU intervention.</P>
    <P>People are waiting in fear and trepidation as to the Minister's intentions for the upcoming budget. Communities are worried and afraid of what he may cook up next. He is also the Minister for the Public Service who, some years ago, promised decentralisation, with thousands of civil servants being decamped to various locations. In reality, very little has happened in that regard, except where a few Ministers got in on the act and managed to move parts of Departments to their home constituencies. There has not been any major decentralisation. When I challenged the Minister on this issue some two and a half years ago, he said it would take place in the month of September. However, he did not specify which September he had in mind and, in reality, nothing has happened to date.</P>
    <P>With regard to expenditure, the Minister has totally lost control of the situation. In order to restore national confidence, it is time he decided to move aside and, if he does not go, he should be moved. Public anger and unhappiness are causing a severe loss of confidence which is so vital to society.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House. In reply to my question last Thursday about those who were not paid, the Minster for Agriculture and Food ignored the problem and spoke about those who have been <Col N="105" /> paid. He ignored the fact that people who in his Department's words &ldquo;have done no wrong&rdquo; are not being paid solely because they were picked out at random for inspection by the computer. One example is a young family who were inspected early in August. They were advised that everything was in order and payment was being processed. The farmer phoned the local office to find out how long the process would take. He also phoned Castlebar to find out when the cheque would be paid. He wanted it for his bank manager, amongst other things. He found out with difficulty that there is a dispute. I applaud the fact that the Department was trying to integrate the system, but they obviously did it without consulting the staff. Someone was taken out for inspection and for no other reason they are not being paid the 80% which others are paid. The reason for the 80% payment was to compensate farmers in some way for the horrendous weather conditions this year. The EU fund was under spent but there was no effort to obtain specific additional funding. The fund was paid quickly.</P>
      <P>The Minister spent last Thursday telling of the great job being done for the 83%. There is no point in the Ceann Comhairle or the staff of the House telling the individual who did not receive his cheque at the end of the month that all others were paid. Bank managers, family or business advisers only want to know whether there is a cheque. It is bad enough if someone makes a mistake and a cheque is held up, but there is no mistake in this case. Applicants were told that because a piece of paper cannot be transferred from one place to another in August they are not being paid and cannot be told when they will be paid.</P>
      <P>This is the most serious issue of all and I do not blame the Minister of State for it. I walked across the House because I like to do things quietly but when I mentioned it to the Minister for Agriculture and Food he seemed to be unaware of it or did not care about it. That is the reason I put this matter down tonight. I feel for the young family concerned. They have come through a traumatic situation as a result of being encouraged into deer farming by the same Minister. They lost their shirt and now they have not been paid. This is just an example. I hope that the Minister of State will not reply tonight with the same sort of crap, to be blunt about it, as the Minister did last Thursday, describing all of the good things. I want an answer and I want it now. When will this farmer and the many other like him be paid? According to the figures produced by the Department of Agriculture and Food there are 11,000 farmers who have not been paid and we are now approaching Christmas.</P>

      <P>Under the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme 54,325 farmers, representing 85% of applicants, have received their 80% advance payments. This amounts to &euro;155.3 million and compares very favourably with the position this time last year when 58% of applicants had been paid &euro;79.3 million. The vast majority of unpaid cases are under query for one reason or another and cases are being cleared on a daily basis. Over 1,300 cases which were selected for inspection since 16 October 2002 have been paid their advance payment. Less than 1,000 cases which were selected for inspection prior to 16 October 2002 have not been inputted for payment following inspection because of a disagreement between my Department and the staff union involved on matters relating to the inputting of inspection results generally. It was expected that this matter would have been fully resolved by now but, unfortunately, that is not the case. My Department is actively engaged in efforts to solve the problem with a view to having the relatively small number of outstanding cases finally processed for payment. Meetings took place yesterday and today and will take place tomorrow morning to try to resolve the difficulty.</P>
      <P>The general position with regard to payments is that in the period since 1 January 2002 to date almost &euro;1.2 billion has been paid to farmers under the various premium and compensatory allowance schemes, of which some &euro;706 million relates to payments made under the 2002 schemes. The corresponding amount paid at this time last year under the 2001 schemes was &euro;453 million. Normally, advance payment of 60% of bovine premia may commence on 16 October and full payment of arable aid entitlement may be made from 16 November. Ewe premium can be paid in full from 16 October. This year the Department secured EU approval to have the advance payment under the bovine schemes increased to 80% and to make a 50% payment under the arable aid scheme on 16 October. These arrangements have resulted in the highest level of payment ever achieved at 16 October.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the Deputy's concerns, particularly the hardship cases to which he referred. I have explained the reasons why payment has not commenced. My officials are making every effort to resolve this matter. Plans were made this evening to try to bring this to a conclusion tomorrow. The Department will ensure that the relatively small number of farmers who have not been paid will be paid as quickly as possible. I hope that will be very soon.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to the House and remind him that in a previous incarnation I recall the night he addressed a large public meeting in a <Col N="107" /> hotel in Athlone about the disastrous situation for householders and farmers because of flooding along the River Shannon. He spoke extremely well and rightly called for relief works and a fund to help people get over that crisis, and sought more permanent measures to prevent a recurrence. The Minister of State is on the other side of the fence tonight. Last Sunday about 100 of the 400 houses in Willow Park were flooded when the Al River burst its banks. Willow Park is across the road from Athlone IT. It houses many students as well as many long-established families who have lived in the estate for years. Access to the estate was closed and hundreds of people, mainly students, were made homeless. We clearly saw the situation as it was portrayed in the media on Sunday and Monday. I spoke today to the chairman of the residents' association, Iggy Burke, who outlined a long history of flooding problems in the area and told me about the efforts of the residents to do something about it. Unfortunately, the flooding has been far worse on this occasion than on any other.</P>

      <P>The problem in Willow Park was much worse on this occasion. People had to leave the area as their accommodation was flooded, property was damaged, student projects were lost and raw sewage was floating freely along roads, footpaths and gardens. The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, is in charge of the Office of Public Works, which is responsible, under the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995, for dealing with this problem. Plans and proposals to remedy this unacceptable situation have been forwarded to the Minister of State by Westmeath County Council. I understand that the estimated cost of the work is about &euro;4.5 million. I ask the Minister of State to honour the fine words of concern that he spoke in Athlone when he was president of the IFA. I want him to make a real difference to the quality of life of the residents of Willow Park, now that he is in the driving seat, <Col N="108" /> by approving the proposals for remedial works forwarded to him by the council. I ask the Minister of State to show that he is of real mettle by announcing that he is committed to having the works carried out.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment of the House. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, for attending this debate to outline how he intends to deal with the matter. I recall previous massive flooding problems in the Clonown and Golden Island areas of Athlone and I am sure the Minister of State remembers them too. The severe flooding on Sunday of the Willow Park estate, near Athlone Institute of Technology, was caused when the River Al breached a restraining culvert. The N6 road between Dublin and Athlone had to be closed to traffic because it was undermined by the floods. The Willow Park and Alverno Drive estates make up a densely occupied area of almost 400 houses adjacent to Athlone IT. A large student population, as well as many families, reside in the estate. The flooding obviously represented a major emergency for the area, as hundreds of people, including young children, were displaced by water levels of an average depth of over 900mm.</P>
      <P>I have spoken to many people in the area, as has my colleague, Deputy Paul McGrath. A considerable number of people had be evacuated and housed in alternative temporary accommodation overnight as their houses were uninhabitable. Severe and extensive water damage was caused to houses and their contents, which will take many weeks to be restored to normal. The restoration process is a costly one. Many students from the institute of technology have been badly affected by the flooding, having lost clothes, college work, computers, laptops and other belongings. The damage to the N6 meant that it had to be closed and major traffic diversions were put in place.</P>
      <P>While Westmeath County Council may be able to implement a short-term solution to this problem, including the replacement of the culvert, a permanent solution is urgently required. The Government must play a role in the solution by providing the necessary financial resources to facilitate it. A recent study commissioned by the council, referred to by Deputy Paul McGrath, confirmed that much of the Al River's catchment area is liable to and extremely vulnerable to flooding. The report, which stated that remedial action is necessary, has been forwarded to the Minister's Department and its recommendations are estimated to cost &euro;4.5 million. Such a sum is small change in the context of ensuring that this flood never occurs again and that those affected never have to face such a catastrophe again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to provide the relevant authorities with the necessary funding to resolve this problem immediately. This catastrophe must never be allowed to happen again. <Col N="109" /> The residents of Alverno Drive in Athlone were unable to make their way to their front doors and had to be assisted to safety. The people of the area, both residents and students, have been severely traumatised and stressed. It is vital that emergency relief is made available through the various Government agencies to deal with the matter on a short-term basis. Funding must be made available to Westmeath County Council to enable it to undertake the local flood relief work schemes and the installation of new culverts to ensure that this catastrophic event never happens again.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleagues for giving me the opportunity to speak during this debate. I concur with everything that Deputies Penrose and McGrath have said about this serious situation. Will the Minister of State agree to the urgent request, made by the county manager, County Westmeath's Oireachtas representatives and the Mayor of Westmeath, to meet a deputation tomorrow or early on Thursday morning? The people affected on Sunday night continue to live in strained circumstances as there is a possibility of further severe flooding if the rains come again in the next few days. The residents of the area have endured enormous hardship and our hearts go out to them. All three Deputies representing County Westmeath have spoken in the House of the need for the Government to do, and to try to have done, everything possible to alleviate this problem so that it does not happen again.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair and the three Deputies who have spoken on this matter. At the outset, I would like to extend my sympathy to those affected by the severe flooding. The accounts of the flooding I have heard seem to indicate that the Deputies are not exaggerating. Coincidentally, I was in Athlone on Monday morning, but I could not go from the roundabout to the affected area as the road was blocked off. I have visited the Athlone area on many occasions in the past to see at first hand the devastation caused by flooding and I am only too aware of the trauma and distress involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reports indicate that the flooding occurred on the Al River which rises in a bog north of the Athlone bypass and flows under the bypass and the railway to the River Shannon. Sunday's flooding problem was of a localised nature and is being dealt with by the local authority. Although the Shannon is high at present and other flooding took place in the Shannon region, the incident referred to by the Deputies had nothing to do with the Shannon. The Willow Park estate is close to the railway bridge and I understand that the area has a history of flooding. Although the local authority has taken measures to restrict the occurrence of flooding, on Sunday last, 10 November, a restraining culvert was breached and water flowed down the main road and into the housing estate. Initial estimates indicate that between 60 and 80 houses were flooded, some to <Col N="110" /> a depth of three or four feet. Approximately 30 families, as well as hundreds of students who reside on the estate, had to be evacuated and housed in alternative temporary accommodation overnight as their residences were not habitable.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for initiating and co-ordinating the emergency response to events like that which occurred in Athlone on Sunday rests with local authorities. I compliment the local authorities, emergency services, local voluntary services and individuals who responded so readily to the difficulties of those affected by the flooding. The Westmeath county manager contacted the Office of Public Works yesterday to point out that while a short-term temporary solution had been put in place by the local authority to prevent a recurrence of the flooding, a more permanent solution needed to be implemented. I understand that the local authority had been concerned about the possible vulnerability of the river for some time and had commissioned consulting engineers to carry out a study of the Al River catchment. I understand that this report, which recommended various options and outlined a preferred option, was received by the council recently.</P>
    <P>Westmeath County Council forwarded a request to the Office of Public Works last evening for funding of &euro;4.5 million for the necessary capital works. A copy of the consultants' report is awaited and will be examined by my officials as soon as it is received. Every consideration will be given to the proposals being put forward by Westmeath County Council in light of available resources and my officials will offer any technical advice deemed necessary. A meeting will be arranged with officials from Westmeath County Council at the earliest opportunity to discuss this matter.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Cassidy, I can inform the House that I have no difficulty in meeting Deputies from County Westmeath as part of the deputation at the earliest convenience. My office received its first notice of this matter from Westmeath County Council yesterday evening. At my request, an engineer from the Office of Public Works visited the area today to inspect the cause of the problem and the damage caused. His report will assist the consideration of the measures that may need to be implemented in the future.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I reiterate my sympathy and concern for the victims of the flooding. I assure the House that any advice or assistance that I or my office can give will be available to Deputies Paul McGrath, Penrose and Cassidy and the county council as part of the efforts to deal with this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to discuss an issue which is of great importance to my constituency. I have tried to raise it on a number of occasions since the idea of a total ban on catching whitefish was first mooted some weeks ago. I welcome the Minister of State <Col N="111" /> at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne. I wish to praise the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who has kept Deputies informed about developments. He is working hard to deal with the situation.</P>
      <P>I represent an area which incorporates the port of Greencastle, one of the biggest whitefish fleet operations in the country. This whitefish fleet has been keen to progress both in terms of its infrastructure for landing, piers and harbours and its boats. People have put their own money into their ability to do their job through investing and upgrading their boats in terms of safety equipment. They appreciate the new whitefish vessel renewal scheme introduced by Fianna Fáil in the last Administration. Reading the remarks in regard to Mr. Fischler, I am asking for an assurance that 40% of the fleet will not be decommissioned. This cannot happen in view of the investment being made in the area.</P>
      <P>The fishermen welcome the plans for the future development of the harbour in Greencastle to meet their needs. I want these needs to be met and I expect we will take up the fight to ensure there is potential for a better harbour in Greencastle. We are now faced with a potential 'turning of the key' in Greencastle as new blows are dealt to the industry each day. The Minister of State knows our fishermen are anxious about conservation. They understand the concept of sustainable development. They openly advocate keeping the seas into the future for their offspring to carry on the role of fishermen. Therefore, they cannot understand the blanket ban in the Irish Sea. Will the European Union invent some new net which will warn cod not to get caught? How else will fishermen deal with the situation where they find cod among their legitimate catch &ndash; dead cod at that? Will they throw them back into the water or will they become criminals if they keep them? Neither answer through quota restrictions alone will solve the issue of depleting stocks. Why not involve the fishermen and scientists and close off spawning and holding areas, which are known at certain times of the year to be particularly sensitive. This can be easily policed. There can be a number of different solutions to policing that problem. Everyone should be brought on board in the first instance to achieve a compromise. There are better solutions. Everyone is offering better solutions. Speaking of policing, all countries must be seen to adhere to the rules in regard to quotas, as Ireland does. That issue must be addressed properly under the common fisheries review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immediately after the Irish Sea issue there was the question of the possible opening of the Irish Box. Is this, too, in the name of conservation &ndash; closing off one area and letting everyone have a free rein in another area? I do not think that is consistent. I am asking the Minister of State, as Junior Minister in the Department, and his senior colleague, to continue the good work they have begun and work with our fellow member states <Col N="112" /> who have a similar interest in this matter. They should work with the fishermen as they embraced them in the talks yesterday with Mr. Fischler. It is only by co-operating and working together that solutions can be found. Without a key role in the Irish Box, we will close the fishing season for good for the fishermen I represent. We were sold out in the past, therefore, we must not let it happen again under the Common Fisheries Policy review.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that we are an island. We have so much potential as an island, be it in commercial fishing, angling, aquaculture, tourism, water sports or yachting. There is so much opportunity that we must continue to invest in our seas. The past Administration has been extremely good to fishermen. It put fishermen to the fore and provided facilities. It gave them opportunities they did not get for years. The difficulty now is that if we do not fight in co-operation with like-minded member states all that investment will have been in vein. Otherwise we may as well sit down and put up our feet in my constituency in regard to fishing, farming and Fruit of the Loom. Fruit of the Loom is almost gone, farming is in difficulty and I do not want to see our fishing go. The Minister has a difficult and vital job to do in his Department. It is essential to gain what we can from the fishery review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Keaveney for raising this important issue.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission brought forward proposals in May 2002 to provide for the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. These proposals include a change in fleet policy. The Commission's objective is to rapidly reduce fleet size by putting in place a system that will make the operation of the current national fleets uneconomic. The fleet reductions would be achieved through imposing restrictions on the days vessels would be allowed to fish. They would involve the introduction of limits on fishing effort, or days at sea, of between 30% and 60% depending on the state of stocks and the regions. The total amount of fishing effort the Irish fleet would be allocated would be significantly less than the total that would allow the present fleet to operate on an economic basis. Accordingly, many vessel owners would be forced to scrap their vessels and get out of fishing. The Commission estimates that the effect of its proposals would be that over 400 Irish vessels would be scrapped, which represents 40% of the total Irish fishing fleet. This would have very serious consequences for the fishing industry in Ireland and for the coastal communities dependent on fishing, such as in Greencastle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission's proposals were most recently discussed at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in September and October. At Council, the Minister, Deputy Ahern, explained his opposition to this element of the Commission's proposals on the basis that they were a technocratic approach to fisheries management and <Col N="113" /> would not ensure the sustainability of fish stocks which is the primary aim. He explained that Ireland could not support these measures which would force many family fishing enterprises in peripheral areas out of business. His position was supported by a number of other member states with whom he has been working to achieve agreement on a way forward. The Minister, Deputy Ahern, is satisfied that all other member states and the Commission understand clearly the difficulties the Commission's proposals on the fleet would create for the Irish fishing industry.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Ahern, is aware that the advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea recommends a closure of all fisheries for cod off the north-west coast of Ireland and Scotland as a targeted species or by-catch. This advice was reviewed by the Scientific, Technical, Economic Committee for Fisheries, a group of independent scientific, technical and economic experts appointed by the European Commission. STECF noted that there is serious concern about the stock and that stock recovery is unlikely unless stringent management action is taken immediately.</P>
    <P>A recovery plan is currently in place for this cod stock. Both the Minister, Deputy Ahern, and I consider that this recovery plan needs to be significantly strengthened in order to rebuild this stock. This advice has significant implications for whitefish vessels operating into the north-west fishing ports, including Greencastle. Proposals from the Commission for total allowable catches for 2003 for all fish stocks will be available from the Commission in the coming weeks. These proposals will be considered in the context of the scientific advice, current measures in place under the cod and hake recovery plans and in consultation with the industry representatives in order to determine a national position taking account of the need to provide for the recovery of the cod stock and the needs of coastal communities dependent on the exploitation of whitefish stocks in the north west.</P>
    <P>In the past few weeks, the Minister, Deputy Ahern, met with the Ministers with responsibility for fisheries in Portugal and France, who have taken a similar approach to this aspect of the Commission's reform package. He has also met the Danish Minister for Fisheries who currently holds the Presidency of the Council for Agriculture and Fisheries. As recently as yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Ahern, met Commissioner Fischler. At these meetings he sought to build an understanding of the difficulties facing Ireland if the CFP reforms are not altered to take into account our unique position and pointed out that he strongly supports fundamental reform of the CFP, but that any reforms must be equitable and effective and also based on taking into account the survival of fishing communities around our coast.</P>
    <P>Over the coming weeks he will continue to work with member states and the Commission to effect changes to the Commission's proposals <Col N="114" /> both for the CFP review proposals and for TACs and quotas which will ensure an appropriate balance between protecting the livelihoods of coastal communities and having in place effective measures to ensure the sustainable exploitation of fish stocks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to discuss this issue this evening but I regret the fact that the Minister himself cannot be here, despite the fact that he was in the House up to half an hour ago. He could not even wait an extra 20 minutes when there were two crucial questions about fishing on the agenda for the Adjournment Debate in the build-up to the Common Fisheries Policy negotiations. I hope that is not a sign of things to come. Having said that, I recognise the knowledge of the Minister of State in this area and I hope he has some answers.</P>
      <P>The Irish box became an issue for discussion among Irish fishermen last week when they realised for the first time that the restrictions on access to the box which currently exist were to be threatened under the CFP negotiation process. The ecological benefits and importance of the Irish box should not be underestimated. It is a breeding and spawning ground for fish species for European waters generally, not just Irish waters. Everybody agrees that we must conserve stocks in this area above all. The history of the Irish box is quite simple. In 1996, at the last major negotiations on this issue, it was decided under the western waters provisions to protect fishing stocks in the Irish box area by reducing fishing efforts. The decision was made to limit access for the Spanish fishing fleet, the largest in Europe by far, to 40 vessels in this area of water and we have been trying to police that ever since &ndash; with some difficulty at times.</P>
      <P>The Spanish now make the case, in the build-up to the CFP review before Christmas, that they have a legal entitlement to challenge the restrictions on the box and that they should have equal access to this very sensitive fishing area for their entire fleet as any other European country has. It has been made quite clear to me, from fishermen from Castletownbere to Killybegs, that if this happens Irish fish stocks and the Irish fishing industry will be under severe threat &ndash; in fact, as somebody said to me last night, it will be curtains for the Irish fishing industry. I am reluctant to be that dramatic but this is the major issue in the build-up to the CFP negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing we must do is clarify our legal position before we go into negotiations. It is unacceptable to me for our Ministers to go to mainland Europe to negotiate the new CFP until the legal issue has been clarified. We need to have the necessary legal advice available so that we may be sure before we go into these negotiations that we have a legal right to keep the restrictions on the Irish box in place. If we do not, it will be part of the negotiation mix, so that if Ireland does achieve some concessions from the Spanish on this issue, we will have to give much <Col N="115" /> in another area, because the Spanish are very anxious to get into the Irish box. They have recently been removed from waters off the coast of Morocco because of over-fishing in that area so that a significant portion of the fleet now needs to find new, fertile fishing grounds. They are looking to the south, west and north coasts of Ireland for them and we must keep them out.</P>
    <P>The Minister's success in these negotiations will be based on his achievements in the protection of the Irish box and in fleet restructuring, as Deputy Keaveney has already discussed. These are the two key issues, along with conservation matters, which are related. It is time we called in the favours of which we spoke so proudly during the Nice referendum. We said quite clearly that if we voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to Nice we would be able to use the goodwill we generate during crucial negotiations such as the CFP and the CAP. We now need to test our friends in Europe and the Minister and the Minister of State need to perform for the sake of Irish fishermen and for coastal communities around the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Coveney for raising this very important issue. A regime to limit fishing activity and access to western waters, including the Irish box, was put in place in 1995 to provide for a rational and orderly exploitation of fishing grounds by all vessels, including the Spanish fleet. The regime laid down as of 1 January 1996 provided the arrangements governing access to waters and resources by Spain and Portugal in the context of the full integration of these countries into the CFP. The regime restricts access by Spanish registered vessels to 40 vessels at any one time. In addition, the regime incorporates restrictions on fishing effort, i.e., days at sea, on all member states fishing in the Irish box.</P>
      <P>Ireland's legal advice is that this regime is not time barred and does not come to an end at the end of 2002. It is clear that the Commission has been of the same opinion as it did not envisage an end to the western waters regime in its Green Paper on CFP reform or in the proposals for reform introduced in May 2002. Accordingly, the recent opinion from Council Legal Service that the regime for the Irish box comes to an end at the end of 2002 was totally unexpected. The advice, in the view of the Attorney General's office, is incomplete and flawed and my Department will be submitting a formal paper challenging this advice in the next few days. The Irish box is a most sensitive fishing area. It is one of the richest fishing grounds in EU waters and is already under severe pressure from the many European fishing fleets operating off our coast. Spain has by far the largest whitefish fleet in the EU and has the potential to seriously overfish these rich grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national strategy review group on the CFP, under the chairmanship of Padraic White and involving industry representatives, has already <Col N="116" /> examined the situation of the Irish box. It has recommended that the sensitive nature of the box must be recognised, that adequate conservation management procedures be implemented and, furthermore, that effort in the box be reduced. The legal advice that provides for the ending of the current restrictions on fishing in the box flies in the face of these recommendations set down by the Irish industry, which is almost totally dependent on fishing opportunities in the area and is therefore committed to the protection of the valuable fish stocks.</P>
    <P>Since the legal advice from Council Legal Services became available, my colleague, the Minister for Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has held an intensive series of meetings at European level to draw attention to the very serious consequences arising for fish stocks and for the Irish fishing industry if unrestricted access to the Irish box is allowed from the beginning of next year. In the past week he has met the Portuguese Minister for Fisheries, who shares some common ground with Ireland on this issue, and the Danish Minister for Fisheries, who currently holds the presidency of the Council for Agriculture and Fisheries. The Minister also held a bilateral meeting involving the Irish fishing industry on Monday with Commissioner Fischler, the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Fisheries. At the meeting, Ireland's case that the waters within the Irish box are very sensitive and play an important role as nursery grounds for stocks in western waters and beyond was strongly made. The need to maintain and enhance the current restrictive regime, which is fully justified on the grounds of conservation and rational exploitation of fish stocks, was strongly emphasised.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Fischler stated that while the Commission will do its utmost to ensure that the Irish box does not fall, he considers that the rules currently governing the Irish box which relate to the 40 vessel limit for Spain are discriminatory and must be changed from January 2003. The Minister and I have serious concerns about this approach as the current 40 vessel restriction for Spain is a very effective instrument for conservation and must be retained. In this context, we are satisfied that the current regime, including the vessel limits for Spain, is legally sound and that there is no justification in the CFP legal framework for their removal. The Minister will continue in the coming weeks to work vigorously to have Ireland's position on this issue fully understood by our colleagues at Council and by Commissioner Fischler from both a legal and a political perspective. It is crucial that Council is fully informed of the consequences for fish stocks and for fishing communities around Ireland of any change in this regime that would increase access or fishing effort within the Irish box.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 13 November 2002.</P>

The exceptions are re-insurance, voluntary health insurance, marine, aviation and transit insurance and export credit insurance. Most EU member states have such a tax, and in most cases it is at a significantly higher rate than in Ireland, typically 9 to 15%.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 123 together.</P>
      <P>When discussing the Central Bank's reserves, it is important to specify the reserves in question. The official external reserves are principally composed of the foreign currency assets of the Central Bank. As of end September 2002, these stood at &euro;5.35 billion. The management of these foreign currency assets is subject to any guidelines issued by the ECB under Article 31(3) of the statute of the European system of central banks and of the European Central Bank to ensure that these operations will not interfere with the monetary and exchange rate policies of the euro area.</P>
      <P>In the Central Bank's balance sheet, the bank's total assets, including its external reserves, have a counterpart in liabilities. These liabilities include bank notes in circulation and credit institution and Government deposits. However, the bank does have accounting reserves which have been accumulated over the years from income earned by its operations. As of end July 2002, they stood at &euro;1,283 million. The bank also has a revaluation account which reflects unrealised gains from valuation changes in its assets. This acts as a contingency provision against currency and other market fluctuations. As of end July 2002, the value of the revaluation account was &euro;825 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appropriate level of the bank's accounting reserves is a prudential matter for the Central Bank board. An event such as the changeover to the euro, which has a large effect on the financial system, gives rise to some consideration of the role and purpose of the accounting reserves. I took the opportunity late last year, therefore, to invite the board of the Central Bank to consider whether a portion of its accounting reserves might be made available to the State.

      <Quest>the number of High Court orders sought to date by the Revenue Commissioners under the Finance Act, 1999, to require financial institutions to supply names, addresses and other relevant information regarding holders of bogus accounts; the number of cases in which orders have been granted; the general progress made to date in identifying the holders of such accounts who did not avail of the recent voluntary disclosure scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Authorised Revenue officers are empowered to make an application to a judge of the High Court seeking an order requiring financial institutions to supply names, addresses and other relevant information concerning account holders who may have held bogus non-resident deposit accounts. Such applications are made under section 908 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, as amended by the Finance Act, 1999. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that information supplied by the financial institutions under section 908 orders will be the principal basis of identifying bogus non-resident account holders who did not avail of the voluntary disclosure scheme in 2001.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that 17 applications for orders under section 908 have been made and have been granted. When one includes institutions which have been taken over or amalgamated with other institutions, these orders seek information in respect of accounts in 23 financial institutions. One other application has been made to the High Court in relation to one other deposit taker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information being supplied by deposit takers under court orders is becoming available on a phased basis. Work commenced in February 2002 on the initial lists of over 1,800 account holders identified in the DIRT look-back audits. Very large volumes of information are being reported to Revenue under the High Court orders. Inquiry work in relation to the examination of the first batch of taxpayers commenced on 11 October 2002. This inquiry work relates to 13,500 non-resident accounts that had 30,000 Irish addresses connected with them. As further information is <Col N="120" /> received, more inquiries will be made on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>Work commenced in February, as regards taxpayers who held bogus non-resident accounts which were detected in the course of the DIRT look-back audits of financial institutions in 1999 and 2000 and did not avail of the voluntary disclosure scheme in 2001.</P>
    <P>While it is clear that Revenue is facing a long programme of investigations over a number of years, the Revenue Commissioners have informed me that they are satisfied that significant progress is being made in this new phase of the investigations. The Revenue Commissioners have also informed me that in recent weeks tax offices have been contacted by many recipients of the 11 October inquiry letters who are indicating their intention to make payments by the deadline of 17 December 2002 and it has been clarified that some others have no further tax liability. The Commissioners also inform me that they intend to proceed with enforcement action against those account holders who do not respond by 17 December.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the principles underlying the strategic management initiative, my Department has been for some time pursuing an active policy of maximum delegation to Departments. In relation to large capital programmes therefore, responsibility for individual projects is generally delegated to the relevant Department.</P>
      <P>The role of my Department is to set out a clear framework in relation to the management of capital investment. In managing capital projects, Departments are required to comply with my Department's Guidelines for the Appraisal and Management of Capital Expenditure Proposals in the Public Sector.</P>
      <P>These guidelines, which are currently under review by my Department, set out four main stages of project appraisal and management: first, the appraisal stage aims to provide a basis for a decision on whether to approve a project in principle. This stage includes an assessment of uncertainty and risk; second, the planning stage involves the establishment of a project management structure, preparation of a design brief, detailed planning and design of the project and a review of costings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If changes are proposed to the project in the course of the planning stage, the guidelines make it clear that the cost implications should be fully appraised and the approval of the sanctioning authority should be sought before proceeding. On receipt of a tender price and other relevant infor<Col N="122" /> mation, the case for proceeding with the proposal is again subject to review. Where it is proposed, following such re-appraisal, to go ahead with a project at a price higher than that originally proposed, a decision will again be required by the sanctioning authority to proceed; third, the implementation stage begins once the final approval for the award of a contract has been secured. If adverse developments occur, including unforeseen cost increases, which call into question the desirability or viability of the project, the sponsoring agency should consider necessary measures to rectify the situation. Where, despite these measures, increased costs are likely to arise, the approval of the sanctioning authority for the extra expenditure has to be obtained before any commitment is made to accept cost increases. The viability of the project, given the changed circumstances, should also be reported on; and fourth, following the completion of a project, the final stage is post project review. Such a review is recommended to evaluate both the outturn and the effectiveness of appraisal and management procedures.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the steps outlined in the guidelines provide sufficient guidance to Departments and agencies for the re-evaluation of projects at key points in the decision making process and that accounting officers are fully aware of the need for ensuring value for money in the consideration of all capital projects.</P>

      <P>I did not consult the European Central Bank in relation to the transfer of income from the issue of notes to the Exchequer as the moneys arising from the issue of new euro notes are windfall profits accruing to the Central Bank's profit and loss account.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 12% corporation tax rate on trading income from 2003 is a key element in Irish industrial development policy and in attracting significant foreign investment generating significant employment. The origin of this policy goes back to 1956 when export sales relief, that is, no tax on manufacturing exports, was introduced. This was changed to a 10% corporation tax rate for manufacturing in 1980 after our entry into the EU. This 10% rate will continue for companies which were entitled to it before 31 July 1998 until 31 December 2010. In 1997 the EU Commission decided that the 10% rate was a State aid and the then Government decided to introduce a single rate of 12.5% corporation tax on trading income across the board. This was confirmed and implemented by <Col N="124" /> the present Government and the 12.5% rate will come in on 1 January 2003.</P>
      <P>The decision on a 12% rate was made on the basis that such a rate would best ensure Ireland's continued attractiveness as a location for business development and job creation. The decision is enshrined in legislation and widely publicised internationally, when marketing Ireland as a business location. It is my firm view that to change this policy now and increase the current 16% rate to 17% would have unacceptable consequences for Ireland in this international context.</P>
      <P>With regard to the tax base, it should be noted that corporation tax receipts have increased from &euro;1.8 billion in 1996 to &euro;4.1 billion in 2001, an increase of about 125%, despite the reduction in the rate for some companies. The share of corporation tax in the total tax take in Ireland, at almost 15% in 1999 and again in 2001, is significantly higher than the EU average which was 8.7% in 1999, which is the latest year for which OECD comparative data are available.</P>

      <P>On budget day, inflation as measured by annual changes in the consumer price index, CPI, was projected to average 4.2% this year. My Department's most recently published forecast was that contained in Economic Review and Outlook, published in August, where inflation was projected to average 4.5% this year. The upward revision partly reflected the impact of higher oil prices this year.</P>
      <P>In terms of EU comparisons, the appropriate measure of inflation is the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP. For 2002 as a whole, HICP inflation in Ireland was forecast at the time of the last budget to be 4.0% and this was revised to 4.75% in the Economic Review and Outlook. The most recent international forecasts for inflation in the EU are those of the IMF, published in September, and they estimate that HICP inflation in both the EU and the euro area will be 2.1% this year.</P>
      <P>Irish inflation is higher than that in the rest of the EU partly as a result of domestic cost pressures. It is important that these cost pressures are not allowed to lead to deteriorating competitiveness which would result in higher unemployment. This is the reason wage moderation, and cost moderation more widely, are so important.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>The Public Service Benchmarking Body was established as an independent body in July 2000 under the terms of the PPF to examine public service pay and jobs by comparison with the private sector. The body reported in June 2002 and recommended varying level of pay increases for the grades examined.</P>
      <P>It was agreed, as part of the adjustment to the PPF, that there would be discussions about the implementation of the report and also that one quarter of any increases recommended would be paid retrospectively from 1 December 2001. Talks commenced in July 2002 between the employers and unions about the implementation of the report and are continuing in the context of negotiations on arrangements to follow the PPF.</P>
      <P>The cost of implementing the recommendations of the report is estimated to be &euro;1.1 billion in a full year. Account will have to be taken of the impact this will have on the public finances in the light of the Government's commitment to keep them close to balance or in surplus. As I have indicated previously, there is a relationship between any new general round that might be agreed under a new programme and the benchmarking payments and this must be considered in the context of the budgetary pressures facing us.</P>

      <P>The National Development Finance Agency Bill was published on 8 November 2002 and I would hope to have the agency operational by January 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The functions of the agency will include: providing advice to State authorities, including Government Departments, to assist them in evaluating financial risks and costs of infrastructure projects and facilitating them to avail of the best financing package for each project; maximising value for money for the Exchequer; assessing optimal financing for major infrastructure projects set out in the national development plan and other infrastructure priorities; and in some circumstances raising finance for projects including certain design, build, operate and finance public private partnerships, where this would be more <Col N="127" /> cost-effective than private funding and, in respect of conventionally procured capital projects, where there are clear benefits offsetting any increased cost of agency funding over Exchequer funding.</P>
    <P>There is no obligation on the Government to request a view from the EU in relation to this legislation. The interest of the EU will arise in relation to the accounting arrangements for projects financed directly by the agency or through special purpose companies and how these arrangements might impact on the aggregates of relevance to the stability pact objectives, in particular the general Government balance and the general Government debt. The question of whether financing for projects will be on or off the general Government balance will be determined on a project-by-project basis by Eurostat.</P>

      <Quest>the rationale underpinning a 14.5% pay increase for TDs and Ministers from the Buckley Report and 13.8% from the benchmarking body, while low-paid workers receive no increase and 8% of children live in poverty.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15488/02]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past 30 years the pay of TDs has been examined by the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector. The review body, which was established in 1969, is an independent standing body whose primary function is to advise the Government on the general levels of remuneration appropriate to higher public servants, members of the Judiciary, Members of the Oireachtas and other political office holders.</P>
      <P>The review body carries out general reviews of higher remuneration in the public sector every four years. Its most recent general review was carried out in the course of 2000, and its report was published by the Government in January 2001. In line with the established policy of accepting the recommendations of this independent body, the Government decided to accept and implement the recommendations in its report. The recommendations were implemented in four phases between 25 September 2000 and 1 April 2002.</P>
      <P>The report of the review body recommended that the salary of a TD should be set at the ordinary maximum of the grade of principal, standard, in the Civil Service. It went on to state that, as its recommendation provided a basis for the future automatic review of the remuneration of TDs, their remuneration should no longer form part of the remit for general reviews. Accordingly, TDs will in future receive the same pay increases as principals in the Civil Service, including increases arising from the benchmarking process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="128" />The Public Service Benchmarking Body was established as an independent body in July 2000 under the terms of the PPF to examine public service pay and jobs by comparison with the private sector. The body reported in July 2002 and recommended varying level of pay increases for the grades examined. It recommended that the principal grade should receive an increase of 11.7%.</P>
    <P>While Deputies will receive an increase this time from benchmarking on top of the review body, this arises because of the shift to the new system as recommended by the review body. In future only increases in the Civil Service comparator will apply.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, this Government committed itself in an Agreed Programme for Government to the creation of a society where everybody has the opportunity and the incentive to participate fully in the social and economic life of the country. This is supported by the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the ongoing implementation of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.</P>
    <P>The review of the national anti-poverty strategy, published earlier this year, recognises that poverty is complex and multi-faceted and requires a co-ordinated response. Accordingly, the strategy is based on the principle of cross-departmental action and contains explicit targets for the reduction of poverty, including that of reducing the number of children who are consistently poor below 2% and, if possible, eliminating consistent poverty under the current definition of consistent poverty used by ESRI.</P>
    <P>A number of measures in this area have already had significant positive effects on the income levels of families with children. One of the major elements of support for child and family life is provided through child benefit, which is a universal payment payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years and continues to be paid in respect of children up to the age of 19 who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability. The current rates of child benefit, as of April this year, are &euro;117.60 for each of the first two children and &euro;147.30 for third and subsequent children. This is an increase of more than 200% over the rates payable in 1997 when this Government first came into office and represents a valuable financial support to all parents. It should also be noted that where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child dependant Increases are payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are currently engaged in an examination of the State property portfolio with a view to identifying vacant, under-utilised or surplus properties. When the results of the examination are available a full evaluation of the potential of the properties identified will be carried out. As part of the evaluation, a range of options will be assessed, including direct disposal on the open market; the possibility of joint development with private developers; the possibility of swapping the sites for developed accommodation elsewhere to meet specific State requirements; direct development of the sites by the State using State funding; and the use of the funds from direct disposal to finance other State projects.</P>
      <P>The guiding principle in any programme of disposal/redevelopment of properties undertaken by the Commissioners of Public Works will be based on ensuring that the potential of the properties is maximised, thereby securing the best return to the State and the taxpayer.

      <P>The total number of investors who had subscribed to <Col N="130" /> the special savings incentive account scheme on the closing date of 30 April 2002 was 1,170,208. The average monthly contribution per investor is approximately &euro;150.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to give a definitive answer as to the eventual cost of the scheme as it is subject to a number of variables such as where participants die, withdraw from the scheme or vary their monthly contributions. Using the existing data and assuming that these variations will broadly cancel each other out, it is estimated that the full year cost to the Exchequer will be in the region of &euro;525 million.</P>
      <P>I introduced the SSIA scheme last year for a specific reason, and that was to encourage people to save. I said when it was introduced that the cost would depend on its success. I have on numerous occasions made it clear that I see the widespread and popular participation in this scheme as a vindication of the principle.</P>
      <P>I would point out that the financial penalty referred to by the Deputy is an exit tax on funds withdrawn by savers from special savings incentive accounts before they mature and is consistent with the purpose of SSIAs which is to encourage regular saving. The purpose of the exit tax, as I indicated at the time the scheme was introduced, is to &lsquo;claw back' the Exchequer contribution of 25%.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the information from tax returns is not recorded in such a way that it would be possible to provide an estimate of the number of persons who have availed of relief for the provision of student accommodation. To establish the extent to which such claims have been made it would be necessary to manually identify and examine all claims for capital allowances generally.

    <P>The irregularities first came to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners in February 2002 who, after further investigations, informed the <Col N="131" /> Department of Finance in June 2002. As the Deputy is aware, the Revenue Commissioners are responsible for the administration and audit of the tax code. When an abuse comes to their attention they liaise with the Department of Finance and the abuse is then addressed and appropriate action is taken to prevent any future tax avoidance or abuse of the relief. Whenever such abuses of the tax code are brought to my attention, I have acted as quickly as possible to announce closures of such tax loopholes.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to change the existing rules. The general position is that an Irish resident individual is liable for income tax on his or her worldwide income. An individual will be regarded as being resident in the State for a tax year if he or she spends 183 days or more in the State in that tax year or spends 280 days in the State, combining the number of days spent in the State in that tax year and in the preceding tax year.</P>
      <P>Presence in a tax year by an individual of not more than 30 days in the State will not be reckoned for the purpose of applying the two year test. Presence in the State for a day means the personal presence of an individual at the end of the day i.e. midnight.</P>
      <P>These particular residence rules have applied since 1994 and were part of the new comprehensive set of rules on residence that were introduced that year. Prior to that the rules of residence were based on a mixture of legislative provisions, case law and administrative practice and were generally regarded as unsatisfactory and lacking in clarity. All tax authorities have rules to distinguish between residence and non-residence for tax purposes. The majority of EU states use the 183 days, or six months, rule as a criterion of residence.</P>
      <P>It should also be mentioned that Irish source income is generally liable to tax in the hands of a non-resident individual except where the taxing rights involved lie with that individual's State of residence under the terms of a double taxation agreement between Ireland and that other state.</P>

      <P>I am generally satisfied with the tax treatment of families. The tax code treats families more favourably than single persons. For example, in the case of income tax, with the exception of the PAYE credit, married couples may transfer their credits between spouses; married couples, who may or may not have children, and widowed and lone parents are entitled to higher standard rate bands than single persons; widowed parents with dependent children may receive the widowed parent tax credit in addition to a single personal tax credit and one-parent family tax credit; and lone parents may receive the one-parent family tax credit in addition to the single tax credit in recognition of the expenses they may face in raising children single-handedly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Family members also receive favourable treatment in the capital acquisitions tax, stamp duties and capital gains tax codes. For example, there is no liability to any of these three taxes on transfers between spouses. There is a much higher threshold for capital acquisitions tax in the case of <Col N="133" /> transfers from parents to children as compared to other transfers. There is also a special stamp duty concession for transfers between certain close relatives.</P>

If discretion were left in the making of the payment of the 1% contribution, it is likely that shorter term economic goals would be prioritised at the expense of making the payment. It is essential that the mandatory contribution be maintained. Once it is breached for one purpose, it is more likely that it will be breached again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that increases in public spending over the past two years have led to considerable improvements in the quality and quantity of public services, particularly in the key priority areas of health, education, social welfare and infrastructure. There are a number of procedures in place to assess value for money, including reviews conducted by individual Departments under the expenditure review initiative, Comptroller and Auditor General value for money audits and national development plan evaluations of spending.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the procedures already in place, I am determined to ensure a greater focus on value for money. In this regard, I would point to a number of initiatives which should assist in more comprehensive evaluation of spending in the future: the Commission on Health Services Funding was established to examine the financial management and control structures in the health services, with particular emphasis on securing arrangements which will enable budget holders to manage within agreed resources and achieve a cost efficient delivery of services; An audit of structures and functions is being undertaken; the continuing development of the management information framework, MIF, will put in place an important tool to enable Departments to more effectively monitor and assess value for money aspects of their spending; the further development of the expenditure review process will focus on significant areas of spending and will also address cross-cutting reviews; and the mid-term evaluation of the national development plan in 2003 will evaluate all spending under the plan. NDP expenditure accounts for nearly 80% of voted capital spending and about 14% of voted current spending. Each individual operational programme is also subject to evaluation; proposals are currently being developed by my Department to improve policy analysis and evaluation capacity across the Civil Service; and a review of the guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure is also under way in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that these measures will, over time, improve the evaluation of effectiveness of spending across the Civil Service. I am aware, however, that more needs to be done. The management information framework which I referred to above will facilitate the development of output information linked to specific performance indicators. My Department is currently exploring with other Departments measures to more effec<Col N="135" /> tively integrate the business planning function with resource allocation. Revised arrangements for reporting on results achieved are also being examined.</P>

      <P>There is no information available as to the precise occupation of individual purchasers of agricultural land. The Central Statistics Office, in its most recent release on land sales, indicated that the average price paid per hectare of agricultural land increased by 16.6% between the first quarter of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002. However, the Central Statistics Office has also advised in its release that in any interpretation of figures in relation to price rises in agricultural land allowance should be made for the fact that only a small amount of agricultural land is sold on the open market each year. In the period covered by the latest release, the year 2001, only 0.2% of the area farmed nationally in 1999 was sold on the open market. On the available evidence it is not clear that the value of land is being artificially increased given that it is an open market situation. The stamp duty on the transfer of land and buildings between close relatives is a concessionary rate and I have no plans to improve this concession.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that the moves by the banking system to use cheaper on-line channels for transactions are being introduced in a way that respects consumer choice and passes on the cost savings; his views on whether there is a need for consideration of legal provisions to influence the corporate responsibility of banks to the community; and his further views on whether a forum to discuss these ideas would be useful to inform the debate surrounding the legislation promised in this field.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that when the Deputy refers to on-line banking channels, he is referring to telephone banking and Internet banking facilities. I do not have information quantifying the savings involved in the move to on-line banking. As operated by Irish banks, on-line banking is generally a complement to, and not a substitute for, a traditional branch network. In this situation, therefore, I am not sure that, overall, taking into account the cost of providing such services, this type of operation is necessarily a great cost saving for Irish banking institutions.</P>
      <P>Banks recover their operating costs in a variety of ways. These include charges, fees and the differences in the rates at which they borrow and lend funds. In this mixed cost and revenue regime, it would probably be difficult to say whether specific charges match specific expenses.</P>
      <P>In any event, I should mention that while interest-related charges are set by market forces, non-interest related charges are a matter for the Director of Consumer Affairs and I have no statutory function in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, the most important force for ensuring that businesses pass savings on to consumers is the pressure of competition in the market. I might also mention that the Competition Authority announced on 13 September a preliminary consultation on the terms of reference of a <Col N="137" /> study on the level of competition in the provision of banking services in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is not clear what exactly the Deputy has in mind with regard to additional legal provisions in the area of the corporate responsibility of banks to the community. In common with our EU partners, our legislation on financial supervision is based on a comprehensive, harmonised framework of directives and regulations. This enables banks from Ireland and the other member states to compete with each other on a level playing field across Europe. Both consumers and providers benefit from being part of this wider market. I would be cautious in placing a statutory burden on Irish banks that did not apply to banks supervised and regulated in other member states, but operating in the Irish market.</P>
    <P>When the Deputy refers to legislation promised in the area, I take it this is a reference to the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill, 2002, which passed Second Stage in this House on 19 June 2002, and to the proposed Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (No. 2) Bill. This latter Bill has already been the subject of a recent public consultation. I would again acknowledge the many contributions received, which are currently being studied in my Department.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that this legislation will provide for ongoing structured consultation by the new regulatory authority with two statutory consultative panels, appointed by the Minister for Finance to be representative of industry and consumer interests respectively. The main function of the panels is to provide a discussion forum in relation to the activities of IFSRA and of bodies associated with it. The consultative panels will ensure that the new regulatory authority, or IFSRA, as it has been called, and bodies associated with it are responsive to the needs and concerns of consumers and of financial services providers. A general obligation would be imposed on IFSRA to consult the panels before issuing any general directives or guidelines. The chairpersons will also be obliged to appear before the relevant Oireachtas committee.</P>
    <P>In addition to creating these two panels, there is also provision for a joint committee of the panels and for the establishment of consultative panel advisory groups. A consultative panel advisory group might be established by one or both of the consultative panels to provide expert advice.</P>
    <P>As I noted earlier, an extensive public consultation has already been carried out on these legislative proposals, eliciting a significant number of submissions. The proposals provide for a high level of consumer and industry consultation to be built in to the new structure. I would not see any need, therefore, for a forum to debate the issues identified by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The recent special report by the Ombudsman, Redress to Taxpayers, recommended the provision of a general scheme for payment of compensation for loss of purchasing power in respect of tax refunds made to taxpayers. I gave my initial response to this report in a statement I issued on 6 November. I also wrote to the Ombudsman on 6 November indicating that I would be studying <Col N="139" /> his report carefully. As the Deputy is aware, the Revenue Commissioners have indicated that they were unable to implement certain recommendations of the Ombudsman's report on the basis that they do not have the statutory authority in these cases to pay interest in respect of tax repaid.</P>
      <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, is examining the contents of the report. Indeed, the general issues raised by the Ombudsman are already being actively examined.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with the individuals concerned but as I indicated in my initial response to the Ombudsman's special report, any solution has to be on a general basis taking all of the issues into account, including the amount of revenue involved. In this regard, the House might be interested to note that the Revenue Commissioners pay out billions of euro in tax rebates each year. Consequently, the Exchequer implications of a general interest scheme must also be weighed. The parameters of any statutory scheme which may be considered to address the repayments issues will need to be thoroughly and carefully examined. As with all legislative changes, such a scheme if introduced would apply prospectively. I will be considering the result of this examination in the context of the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>Section 62 of the Finance Act, 1998, section 486B of the Taxes Consolidation Act &ndash; introduced a new relief for corporate investment in certain renewable energy projects. It was necessary to obtain EU Commission approval for the relief, which took about a year. The relief then commenced on 18 March 1999 and was due to end last March 2002. However, I extended the relief in Finance Act, 2002, until 31 December 2004, subject to EU Commission approval.</P>
      <P>In the programme for Government, which covers a five year period, it states that we will improve the tax incentives for investment in renewable energy. However, any new tax incentives have to be considered in the context of the budgetary and economic policy provisions in the programme for Government, in particular, the reference to &ldquo;responsible fiscal policy&rdquo; and the need to &ldquo;keep the public finances in a healthy condition&rdquo;. Recent developments have emphasised the importance of this public finance constraint.</P>

      <Quest>when he intends to meet the commitment given in An Agreed Programme for Government to remove all those on the national minimum wage from the tax net; the numbers of persons who earn the national minimum wage or less who are paying income tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Deputy will recall that I answered a similar question from Deputy Brendan Howlin on 25 June 2002. The position is that the statutory minimum wage is an average hourly rate of gross pay for an employee as defined under the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000. The wage currently stands at &euro;6.35 per hour having been increased from the previous amount of &euro;5.97 per hour which applied up to 30 September 2002. The annualised equivalent of the present minimum wage is &euro;12,878.</P>
      <P>The document, An Agreed Programme for Government, between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats states that &ldquo;over the next five years our priorities will be to achieve a position where all those on the minimum wage are removed from the tax net&rdquo;. The commitment is given in the context of a broader economic and budgetary strategy which provides, among other things, that the public finances will be kept in a healthy condition and that personal and business taxes will be kept down in order to strengthen and maintain the competitive position of the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware also of the commitment contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which states: &ldquo;It is an agreed policy objective that, over time, all those earning the minimum wage will be removed from the tax net&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The question of when all those earning up to an annual amount equivalent to the statutory minimum wage annualised will be not be liable for income tax is a matter for consideration in the context of the Government's budgets over the next five years consistent with the Government's overall economic and budgetary strategy and with the Government's commitments as already outlined.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that there are at present an estimated 72,000 tax cases who have income at or below the minimum wage and who are liable for income tax. It should be noted that this figure relates to those whose annual income is less than the minimum wage annualised and would include those who are working less than full-time on an hourly rate that is greater than the minimum wage. The figure differs from the earlier estimated figure of 43,500 supplied in my previous answer to Deputy Howlin in June 2002 because of the fact that the value of the minimum wage increased on 1 October 2002.</P>

      <P>The tax status of these payments depends on the circumstances of the payment. If the payment was in the nature of income, the payment would be subject to income tax. If the payment was a gift which falls within the definition of a taxable gift in capital taxation law, tax under that heading would be payable. Whether a payment is considered to be corrupt, as such, is of little or no importance in tax law. Section 58 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides for taxation of profits or gains which have arisen from an unlawful or unknown source or activity. All of the payments referred to in the Flood tribunal report are the subject of continuing tax inquiries in the investigation branch of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I set out in my last budget speech what the Government has done to lessen the burden on the PAYE sector. I said that as a result of my five budgets, over 380,000 taxpayers have been taken out of the income tax net. I also said that of &euro;4.8 billion income tax reductions in these five budgets, 43% has gone on increasing the basic tax allowances, or credits as they are now, including the PAYE allowance; a further 22% went in taking over 370,000 taxpayers off the top rate of tax; over 16% went to reduce the standard rate of tax paid by all taxpayers, and just 11% went to cut the top rate of income tax.</P>
      <P>As regards the specific proposals suggested by the Deputy, I do not wish to comment on this given the fact that the budget is only three weeks away except to say that I have pointed out in the Dáil on a number of occasions in reply to other parliamentary questions that I regard the so-called Tobin tax on currency transactions as not workable in practice because of the difficulties involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume what the Deputy is referring to is the regime for mitigation of civil penalties documented in the new code of practice for Revenue auditors. Revenue's approach to penalty mitigation and prosecution as set out in the code could not by any means be described as an amnesty.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are empowered to mitigate penalties under the provisions of section 1065 of the Taxes Consolidated Act, 1997. This mitigation power has been part of the tax code for many years. In the context of Revenue audits, the code of practice provides clear guidelines as to how civil penalties should be mitigated by Revenue auditors depending on the nature of the particular tax default involved.</P>
      <P>The code essentially provides for different levels of mitigation for different degrees of default. This replaces the &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; scheme of penalty mitigation which had applied in the previous code and in some instances is less favourable and in some instances more favourable than previously applied. The most serious defaults, those categorised as &ldquo;deliberate default&rdquo;, qualify for the smallest level of mitigation; the least serious, classified as &ldquo;insufficient care&rdquo;, receive the largest mitigation.</P>
      <P>In relation to serious tax fraud, this is defined in the code as the making of a false representation by a taxpayer knowingly, without belief in its truth, recklessly, or careless as to whether it was true or false.</P>
      <P>The code provides that cases of suspected serious fraud, where a sustainable case is likely to exist, should be referred to Revenue's prosecutions division to evaluate suitability for possible prosecution. It also lists the criteria used in determining whether or not a case is suitable for investigation with a view to prosecution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 23 July 2002, the UK Government announced that changes in the rate of corporation tax in Ireland meant that it was no longer appropriate for companies operating in Ireland to enjoy automatic exemption from the UK's controlled foreign company, CFC, legislation which charges UK com<Col N="146" /> panies to tax in respect of the income of certain CFCs in which they have an interest. A UK CFC is an overseas company controlled, at least by 25% interest, by UK residents which is subject to a level of taxation less than 75% of the level that it would have paid had it been resident in the UK.</P>
      <P>There are a number of specific exemptions from the UK CFC legislation, including an excluded countries list. Up to the time of the change announced by the UK, Ireland was on the UK's excluded countries list and, therefore, Irish subsidiaries of UK companies enjoyed automatic exemption from the UK CFC legislation except for Irish companies availing of the 10% rate. Such companies could, however, avail of one of the other exemptions provided for in the UK legislation once they met various conditions. The effect of the change announced by the UK authorities was that Irish subsidiaries of UK companies are no longer automatically exempt from UK CFC legislation. However, they may still avail of the other exemptions provided that the conditions surrounding such exemptions are fulfilled.</P>
      <P>I do not agree that the decision effectively designates Ireland as an international tax haven. It is my understanding that this was not the reason for the UK decision.</P>
      <P>I see no reason we should not continue to attract our fair share of foreign investment as we have done in manufacturing which was always under the UK CFC regime.</P>

      <P>My Department has been studying the report of the Ansbacher inspectors which was published last July. The parts of the report of particular concern to my Department relate to taxation matters, exchange control and the Central Bank. When this examination is fully completed, consideration will be given to what further measures are needed to counter the unacceptable tax behaviour criticised in the report.</P>
      <P>In the interim the Deputy will no doubt be aware that I intend to introduce a Committee Stage amendment to the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill, 2002, which will impose an obligation on the bank to report to the Revenue Commissioners any information that leads the bank to suspect that a criminal offence of tax evasion may have been committed by a supervised financial institution. The bank will also be obliged to report to the Revenue Commissioners any failure by a financial institution to report suspected cases of money laundering of the proceeds of tax evasion.</P>
      <P>A second Bill, which has already been the subject of a public consultation process, will oblige the directors of financial institutions to certify each year that the institution is fully compliant with all of its statutory obligations. Auditors of these institutions will have to review the directors' compliance statement and disclose to the directors and to the new single financial regulator if they are not satisfied that it is accurate. The new regulator will also have a general right of oversight of corporate governance standards in institutions under its supervision. I expect to be in a position to present this Bill to the House in the first half of next year.</P>
      <P>In addition, I understand that officials of the Revenue Commissioners recently met with the tax authorities of the Cayman Islands, the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey and that discussions have commenced with a view to concluding agreements between Ireland and these states for the exchange of information in relation to certain tax matters.</P>

There are Ansbacher type arrangements and there are other cases involving offshore funds and deposits.</P>
      <P>Revenue has advised that the review team has inquired into 289 cases to date and six of these cases have concluded settlements with Revenue. The 289 cases, taking account of spouses and connected companies, consist of 300 names.

      <P>A total of 210 cases have been under active investigation. The remaining cases consist of 62 non-resident persons, including 17 former Irish residents, 12 individuals who claimed the 1993 amnesty provisions and five cases with insufficient identity information.</P>
      <P>The investigation includes examining the tax position of disclosed entities and accumulating and assembling information on other connected entities. The number of connected entities in relation to cases under investigation is now nearly 700.</P>
      <P>Revenue is making extensive use of its legislative powers to seek books, records, documents and information in the cases being investigated. Where appropriate, prosecutions will be considered but these will depend on the level of evidence available.</P>

      <P>Following the recommendations of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector in its report dated 25 September 2000, the Government decided to introduce a scheme of performance related awards for Civil Service posts at the levels of Assistant Secretary and Deputy Secretary with effect from 1 January of this year. The first payments under the scheme will be made early in 2003.</P>
      <P>The funding for the awards is based on 10% of the payroll for the posts covered by the scheme. The cost of awards will be in the region of &euro;1.9 million.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 is implemented through seven operational programmes, OPs. These OPs involve hundreds of projects of a capital and current nature. Some of these projects are under way while some are at conception and planning stage. In some instances implementing authorities still have to decide which projects will be funded over the remainder of the plan. It is, therefore, not possible to give the project level information sought by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="151" />Total NDP expenditure from 2000 to end June 2002 is estimated at some &euro;15.432 billion. In the key area of investment in infrastructure total expenditure under the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme is estimated to be &euro;10.4 billion by end 2002. This is &euro;300 million ahead of target. Within this the Exchequer has invested some &euro;800 million more than its original commitment.</P>
    <P>While there has been good physical rollout of the NDP infrastructure investment with many key projects under way or in planning, output has been adversely affected by significantly higher than expected costs. Looking forward, these higher costs combined with the tight constraints arising from the deteriorating economic situation means that the target level of infrastructural output in the NDP will not now be fully achievable by 2006.</P>
    <P>In relation to other operational programmes, progress is satisfactory in the Employment and Human Resources OP but behind target in the two regional OPs and the Productive Sector OP. This is due to a number of factors including lower private sector investment, awaiting State aids approval from the European Commission and the impact of the foot and mouth crisis in 2001. Future NDP investment under these OPs will also be subject to the public expenditure constraints referred to already in relation to NDP infrastructure investment.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy wishes to get more details on projects under the NDP, I suggest he contacts directly the managing authorities for the individual OPs, who are as follows:</P>

      <P>Ireland fully supports the Stability and Growth Pact, key elements of which were agreed at the Dublin European Council in December 1996. The Government underlined its commitment to the pact in its programme where it is described as providing the overriding framework for budgetary policy.</P>
      <P>The pact measures the budgetary position on a general Government basis rather than on an Exchequer basis. The general Government measure includes the fiscal position of all non-commercial public bodies as well as funds such as the Social Insurance Fund and the National Pensions Reserve Fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Durkan will be aware, I attended the PPF plenary meeting in Dublin Castle on Thursday 31 October, together with the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance to formally launch the talks on a successor agreement to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>All the social partners were represented at the meeting and its primary purpose was to begin the process of considering the nature and scope of a new agreement. The meeting also provided an opportunity for us all, Government and social partners, to outline the priority concerns which we will each bring to the process.</P>
      <P>For my part, I reiterated my remarks at the PPF plenary in July, when I said that I would invite organisations to participate in negotiations on a new agreement in the context that the Government will enter talks on the basis of its programme for Government. I also made it clear that those organisations invited to participate in the talks do so on the basis that social partnership brings rights and responsibilities, that these are exercised in a spirit of mutual respect and respect for the primacy of the democratic process and that what is agreed must reflect the objective needs of the whole community and the necessary accountability for public policy and public funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also referred to the reality that general economic conditions are tighter now than they have been at any point in the last five years. The international environment has become dramatically more challenging over recent months and the outlook is, to say the least, uncertain. The competitiveness agenda has become much more <Col N="153" /> demanding, as recent job losses have underlined. The inevitable impact on the public finances has become sharply evident over the recent weeks and months. I emphasised, therefore, that it is important that realism should guide us all.</P>
    <P>As I also said at the PPF plenary meeting, we have it in our own hands, to a large degree, to determine how the economy will perform over the coming years. However, in order to secure an agreed outcome, it will be imperative that expectations should keep in line with current economic realities. This is the key challenge now being presented to the process of social partnership.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Council is currently in the final stages of completing its three-yearly overview of economic and social developments and policy. I expect that the key recommendations will be agreed within a matter of days, followed shortly afterwards by finalisation and publication of the detailed strategy report.</P>
    <P>The NESC Strategy Report, along with the Government's programme and my statement on the basis on which the social partners are being invited into talks, will act as the guiding framework for the negotiations on a social partnership agreement to succeed the PPF. This process has commenced with a series of bilateral meetings with each of the social partners.</P>

      <P>Since the formation of the Government, I have not had any formal meetings with lobby groups or public relations firms to discuss pending legislation nor have any of my political advisers.</P>
      <P>I point out, however, that in the course of attending official functions all over the country I am approached by many individuals about various issues to do with Government.

Following these investigations, the decisions of the commissioner are communicated to the parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, either party to a rights commissioner's investigation may appeal to the Labour Court a decision of a rights commissioner within six weeks of the date on which the decision was communicated to them. The Labour Court may affirm, vary or set aside the decision of a rights commissioner. If the Labour Court sets <Col N="155" /> aside a decision of a rights commissioner that is in favour of the employee or employer, then either party may appeal to the High Court on a point of law and the determination of the High Court shall be final and conclusive. Otherwise the determination of the Labour Court is final and conclusive.</P>
    <P>If the decision of a rights commissioner is not carried out by the employer concerned and the time for bringing an appeal against the decision has expired and no such appeal has been brought, the employee concerned may, not later than six weeks after the expiry of that time, bring the complaint before the Labour Court. The Labour Court shall, without hearing the employer concerned or any evidence, other than in relation to the matters aforesaid, make a determination to the like effect as the decision. If an employer fails to carry out in accordance with its terms a determination of the Labour Court within six weeks from the date on which the determination is communicated to the parties, the employee concerned, any trade union of which the employee is a member or the Minister may initiate legal proceedings through the Circuit Court seeking payment of the award made. The Circuit Court without hearing the employer or any evidence, other than in relation to the matters aforesaid, will make an order directing the employer to carry out the determination in accordance with its terms.</P>

      <P>There are currently in the region of 25,000 participants on community employment, CE, schemes providing a range of services across the country. The primary purpose of the CE programme is to provide long-term unemployed persons with the necessary skills and confidence to take up employment in the open labour market. In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure CE, participation levels are gradually being reduced in line with reduced levels of long-term unemployment and a strategic shift in policy in favour of training and other more appropriate supports.</P>
      <P>The Government is very much aware of the important contribution which CE has made to the development of services for local communities over the years. In this context a cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of CE taking account of the link with the provision of community services. The outcome of these deliberations will help to inform the Government's consideration of options for the future of CE and the provision of community services, as will the outcome of Government consideration of the 2003 Estimates.</P>

      <P>Last February I asked Forfás to report on consumer price inflation in the euro changeover period and comparative prices in the euro zone. That report was published in June and is accessible via the Forfás website at www.forfas.ie.</P>
      <P>It found that the changeover to the euro had not in general been used as a pretext for the introduction of excessive price increases. It did, however, identify unusual levels of price increases in a number of particular areas. These included doctors, dentists and opticians' fees, pharmaceutical products, alcoholic drinks in licensed premises, food prices in restaurants and cafes and housing and house maintenance costs.</P>
      <P>Increased competition is the best way of reducing prices and ensuring that consumers get value for money. This is why I have taken steps to strengthen the powers of the Competition Authority to investigate price fixing and other anti-competitive practices and why I am committed to removing unwarranted restrictions on competition in all sectors of the economy.</P>
      <P>In order for the full benefits of competition to be realised by consumers, they must be given sufficient information to enable them to compare different prices and changes and, where necessary, they must be assertive in seeking alternative retail outlets which provide better choice and value. In this vein, I propose to introduce new price display regulations that will clarify and reinforce the obligations on retailers and other traders to provide legible and transparent information on prices to consumers.</P>
      <P>I am absolutely opposed to the reintroduction of price control. It is a discredited and ineffective means of reducing prices. When it was last used as a policy mechanism in the 1980s, maximum prices very quickly became minimum prices, inflation rates were close to 20% and consumers were the real losers.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the policy framework utilised at the time by the then Department of the Marine and Natural Resources provided that the licensing terms and fiscal regime for oil and gas exploration was designed to maximise the benefits to the national economy from the exploration for, and production of, indigenous oil and gas resources.</P>
      <P>To facilitate this the Department organised discussions between representatives the Irish Offshore Operators Association, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Offshore Suppliers Association on the utilisation of Irish resources and services in the offshore petroleum industry.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources at the time made clear there were no powers available to it to require undertakings in regard to jobs or the provision of services to the companies involved in offshore exploration. The imposition of such conditions would be precluded under EU rules. Responsibility for employment and the provision of workers are matters for the exploration companies and their contractors.</P>
      <P>The free movement of labour is enshrined in EU law and Ireland is not in a position to insist on employers giving priority to Irish workers over other EU citizens. Neither, however, is an operator or a contractor to misuse EU Directives and to disregard or discriminate against Irish suppliers of goods and services.</P>
      <P>It was against the above policy framework that the meeting took place with the public representatives and this position was explained to them.</P>

      <P>With regard to the draft Companies (Audit and Accountancy) Bill, 2002, officials of my Department met the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies &ndash; Ireland. The purpose of the meeting was to consult and obtain the expert advice of the committee on that element of the draft Bill relating <Col N="160" /> to disciplinary procedures for prescribed accountancy bodies. On foot of that meeting, a number of amendments to the draft relating to these procedures are being considered.</P>
      <P>In two other instances, proposals in relation to the draft Bill were raised in the course of meetings organised in a more general context. In one such meeting with me and my officials, the Financial Services Industry Association raised concerns about the application to various structures of the auditing related requirements in the draft legislation. This matter is currently under consideration. In the other case, Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, and Departmental officials met representatives of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Ireland. The issue of relevance to the draft legislation related to the question of statutory protection for the term &ldquo;accountant&rdquo;. The matter is currently under consideration.</P>
      <P>I recently met members of the Irish Bankers Federation to discuss, among other things, issues arising from the forthcoming Irish financial services regulatory authority legislation, which is being introduced by the Minister for Finance. No changes were made to the draft legislation arising from this meeting.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that in the case of primary and secondary legislation where matters of a highly technical and complex nature arise, or where matters of social partnership are involved, there is frequently a need to obtain advice from a variety of sources.</P>
      <P>My officials in the discharge of their day to day duties have regular contact with a range of stakeholders and representative groups who may express views and concerns on matters which may inform the overall legislative process.</P>

      <P>Clancy Barracks, Dublin was offered for sale by public tender on 14 June 2001. Two bids were received, one of which was from Dublin City Council. Both tenders were considered too low to permit acceptance. Subsequently discussions took place with officials of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and Dublin City Council. In the event, Dublin City Council did not proceed to acquire the property on the basis that it was considered that the public interest would be best served from a housing and planning perspective by selling the property on the open market rather than have it purchased by the local authority.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently accepted an offer from Florence Properties Ltd., Jersey for the sale of Clancy Barracks. A contract of sale is expected to be completed shortly. Pending completion of the sale contract it would not be appropriate to comment further on the matter, including the conditions of sale, at this time other than to say that access to the railway platform did not form part of the sale agreement.</P>

      <P>According to the commonage framework plan the destocking percentage in respect of the commonage concerned is 45.05%. The person named held a ewe quota in 2001 for 352 ewes and his bovine units in 2001 from the CMMS converted to 108.94 ewe equivalents (bovine units x 6.7) bringing the total ewe equivalents to 460.94, i.e. 352 + 108.94. He declared 248.27 hectares of land, including 159.2 hectares of commonage land, on his 2001 area aid application. Therefore the stocking density for his holding is 1.86 ewe equivalents per hectare, which was obtained by dividing the total ewe equivalents of 460.94 by the total forage area of 248.27.</P>
      <P>Based on these figures, the usual formula to calculate the destocking under the commonage framework plans was then applied, i.e. the stocking density multiplied by the hectares of commonage land multiplied by percentage destocking. The calculation in respect of the person named was therefore (1.86 x 159.2) x 45.05% resulting in 133 quota rights being destocked. Since he held a quota of 352 premium rights, his quota for 2003 will be 219, i.e. 352 less the 133 to be destocked. It should be noted that the person named is a participant in REPS 2, and qualifies for an annual payment of &euro;11,360 which includes an element of compensation for destocking on the commonage land.</P>

      <P>The objective of the commonage framework planning process is to set sustainable stocking levels which will ensure the protection and rejuvenation of commonage areas that are at risk because of overgrazing, and thus secure the future of hill sheep farming in these areas. The implementation of the plans is an integral part of an agreement with the European Commission secured in 1998, under which farmers with commonage receive generous payments of up to &euro;242 a hectare in REPS. Failure to implement the plans would jeopardise those payments. Farmers with commonage who are subject to destocking can either join REPS or apply for compensation under a complementary national scheme to be operated by Dúchas.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
      <Quest>if he will change the method of calculation used in determining the destocking levels under the commonage framework plan which includes lowlands and dormant shares, and which has effectively devalued entire farms.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>At individual farm level, the destocking calculation is based on the 2001 quota, including any quota that may have been frozen previously. The total forage area available, including private forage land, is taken into account in determining stocking density on the farm, but the destocking formula is applied only on the commonage area. <Col N="165" /> In a mixed farming system, farmers may opt to undertake not to graze their cattle on the commonage and have quota calculated on the basis of ewe numbers and commonage area only.</P>
      <P>The commonage framework plans are being implemented as part of an agreement negotiated with the EU Commission in 1998, on the basis of which I can make generous payments of up to &euro;242 per hectare on commonage land to farmers in REPS. Dormant shares are expressly deemed ineligible for payment under the terms of the agreement. The rules for implementing the commonage framework plans are as flexible as they can be within the limits of that agreement and no further changes can be made without Commission approval.</P>

      <P>Regrettably, the destocking figure specified on the framework plan in question was initially entered incorrectly on the list of destocking percentages published on the Department website. It has now been rectified to reflect the correct figure of 70.68%. Farmers and their professional advisers may, if they wish, verify the correct figure by checking the detailed commonage plan itself on my Department's website.</P>
      <P>Under the rules that I have laid down for implementing the framework plans no farmer will be required to destock by more than 50% in 2003 and no farmer will be destocked to fewer than ten ewe quota rights. Farmers who are subject to destocking can choose either to join REPS, where payments of up to &euro;242 per hectare of commonage are available, or alternatively to apply for compensation under the complementary national scheme to be operated by Dúchas.</P>

      <Col N="166" />The basic rate of payment in REPS is &euro;151 per hectare. Under the terms of an agreement which I negotiated with the EU Commission in 1998, farmers in REPS with commonage have received annual payments of up to &euro;242 per commonage hectare. As a result, the 3,700 farmers in REPS who have commonage are currently receiving an additional &euro;7 million per year on top of their basic REPS payments. This represents an average annual additional payment of &euro;1,800 per farmer and it brings the total average annual payment for REPS farmers with commonage land to &euro;7,100.</P>
    <P>Dúchas has made proposals to the EU Commission for a national scheme which will compensate for actual losses due to destocking under the commonage framework plans.</P>

      <P>The person named participated in the 2001 extensification premium under the simplified system. On participation he undertook to maintain a stocking density of not more than 2.0 livestock units per hectare for each day of 2001. Under the terms of the relevant regulation my Department is required to carry out a certain percentage of on-farm checks to ensure that stocking densities as chosen are not breached. On 21 September 2001 an on-farm check was carried out in this case and it was established that 28 animals in the 1.0 livestock unit category and 22 in the 0.6 category were present on the holding on that date. Based on an initially processed forage area of 18.61 hectares, a stocking density of 2.2138 livestock units per hectare was established. It has now emerged that the true forage area of the holding of the person named for 2001 amounted to 23.71 hectares. Based on this larger area, a stocking density of 1.737 livestock units per hectare has been established.</P>
      <P>Since the revised stocking density is now less than 2.0 livestock units per hectare, 2001 extensification premium will be paid shortly to the person named.</P>

      <P>My Department has over many years consistently adopted a rigorous policy of enforce<Col N="167" /> ment of the EU hormone ban. As part of the national residue plan, extensive monitoring of live animals and animal products is carried out with a view to detecting a range of banned substances, including hormones, and where positives are detected follow-up investigations take place. In addition, my Department's special investigation unit carries out specific targeted investigations as considered necessary.</P>
      <P>The success of this approach is evident from the record of prosecutions for offences under animals remedies legislation. Since 1996, over 200 people have been convicted under this legislation with over 60 of these receiving custodial sentences and fines totalling almost &euro;0.87 million imposed. The numbers of hormone positives detected by residue surveillance in more recent years has declined significantly (0.15% positive level in 2001) reflecting the success of consistently vigorous enforcement.</P>
      <P>Under the Animal Remedies Act, 1993 there is provision for the courts to ban a person convicted on indictment from having charge of animals for a period which can be for the life of the person. In addition, those found to have breached the EU hormone ban are excluded under EU law from receiving headage and premia payments for the calendar year concerned. In the event of a repeated breach, this exclusion is extended to five years.</P>

      <P>The person named established a suckler cow quota of three premium rights in 1993. On 31 August 2000 he applied to the 2001 national reserve for an allocation of three additional quota rights. Following examination of his application he was provisionally allocated three premium rights from the national reserve and was notified accordingly on 13 November 2000. The allocation was made on the basis that he would use his entire quota of six in 2001 by applying for and qualifying for six animals under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. Since he applied for premium in respect of only five animals, that provisional allocation of three quota rights was reduced to two, giving him a quota of five rights for 2001 and following years. While the foot and mouth restrictions imposed a ban on sales at livestock marts on 26 February 2001, my Department considers that the person named had sufficient time from mid-November 2000 to purchase the additional animal to qualify for premium. In addition, farm to farm sales recommenced on 14 May 2001 which enabled farmers to purchase animals before the 29 June 2001 closing date for receipt of applications under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme.</P>

      <P>The headage &ndash; cattle, sheep, equine and goats &ndash; payment schemes have been replaced with effect from 2001 by the area based compensatory allowance scheme. The main conditions for eligibility of the scheme are that applicants are registered herdowners, reside within 70 miles of the farm, farm a minimum of three hectares in a disadvantaged area, and maintain a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare. Being a PAYE worker or a public representative has no relevance to the conditions of the scheme. The general conditions for payment of grants under the premia schemes are that applicants are registered herdowners and that the animals applied on are maintained on the holding for the relevant retention periods. Again, whether a herdowner is a PAYE worker or a public representative has no relevance to the conditions of the premia schemes.</P>

      <P>The 2002 area aid application of the person named has been fully processed with no errors and with an area determined for payment of arable aid of 73.04 hectares and a forage area of 43.16 hectares.</P>
      <P>The person named was not an applicant under the 2001 and 2002 area-based compensatory allowance scheme. He is due to receive 100% of his arable payment on November 16. The person named participated in the 2001 extensification premium opting for the census system.</P>
      <P>Herd owners were notified by individual letter of each of the five census dates for 2001. When notified of the fifth date, herd owners were requested to return their completed CEN.1 forms to the Department by Friday 18 January 2002. Some weeks after the passing of this date, those who had still not returned their CEN. 2 forms were sent a reminder letter giving them a final opportunity to do so. The Department continued to accept CEN.1 and CEN. 2 forms where lodged up to Friday 17 May 2002. This was the very latest date that CEN.1 and CEN. 2 forms could be accepted in order that the information on both forms could be checked for accuracy against my Department's CMMS database, and spot-checked on the ground if necessary, in time to make extensification premium payments by the EU deadline of 30 June 2002. It must be appreciated that in order to avoid disallowances by EU auditors, adequate checks must be carried out to verify the validity of claims.</P>
      <P>As the person named did not submit a CEN. 2 form by 17 May 2002, nor subsequently, it is regretted that payment of extensification premium cannot be considered in this case.</P>

      <P>In response to the need to provide carrier services to support e-Government and to attain best value from public sector expenditure on telecommunications services, my Department signed a master draw-down contract with a consortium comprising Eircom and Vodafone Ireland for a range of both voice and data telecommunications services for the public service in May 2002. Specifically, the contract provides for: fixed, mobile and lo-call telephony services for all sectors of Government; managed data services to support the intranet needs of various sectors of the public service, interconnectivity with the reach services portal and ultimately the public services broker, and public service access to the Internet and secure data connectivity for mobile or e-working employees, agents or partners of Government agencies to Government servers, portals and networks.</P>
      <P>The voice services have been contracted for three years, with an option to renew for a further two years to a maximum of five years in total. The data services have been contracted for two years with the option to renew on an annual basis to a maximum of five years in total.</P>
      <P>The fixed voice services and data services in the provision of on-line services to the public are mandatory under this contract. All other elements are at the discretion of agencies, subject to normal procurement procedures. The contract provides for significant tariff reductions and volume discounts that were not available to public service organisations previously.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that there are nearly 6,000 buildings in State care, including Government offices, Garda stations, schools, heritage buildings and military establishments. Many of these are post-1980 structures and so are unlikely to contain asbestos as the use of the material has for the most part <Col N="175" /> been banned since then. To date approximately 2,500 of these buildings have been surveyed to determine the location, type, form and condition of any asbestos material present. The early stages of the survey programme were concentrated in areas where, from local knowledge, asbestos was known or suspected to exist.</P>
      <P>Works identified as necessary to tackle the problem are carried out on a priority basis and have been completed, are in hands or are being commissioned in almost all cases where the material has been located. The programme will continue until the State's complete portfolio of buildings has been examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there are a large number of buildings which have yet to be treated under the asbestos <Col N="176" /> programme, I am not aware of any instances where employees are working in conditions where they are exposed to respirable asbestos fibres. The Office of Public Works is continuing to monitor the position and to deal with problem incidents if and when they arise.</P>
    <P>A total of 471 asbestos-related claims have been filed against the State. To date eleven claims have been settled at a total cost of &euro;1,020,000.</P>

      <P>Stamp duty is chargeable on certain instruments and transactions, including the purchase of a property. As the liability primarily rests with the person purchasing the house, the specific question being asked by the Deputy, namely exemption from stamp duty on the sale of a house does not arise, as the person in question would not normally be the liable party.</P>
      <P>Any exemption to allow for particular circumstances would lead to pressure to allow similar exemptions for a range of deserving reasons which could have a significant effect on the stamp duty yield. Accordingly, I have no plans to introduce such a change.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the over-estimate in 2002 of the EU contributions; and if he expects that a similar saving will apply in 2003.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The original estimate for Ireland's EU budget contribution in 2002 was based on the 2002 EU budget as adopted towards the end of last year. Since then, two supplementary amending budgets adopted in the EU in 2002 have made substantial downwards revisions in the contributions expected of member states in 2002. These reductions in member state contributions were possible because of the carryover into the 2002 EU budget of an outturn surplus of &euro;15 billion from the 2001 EU budget. This surplus from the 2001 EU budget represents savings in the agricultural sector, fines paid in competition cases and the under-utilisation of allocations for the Structural Funds. The 2002 saving to Ireland arising from the supplementary amending budgets is some &euro;281million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" />The 2003 EU budget process is currently well under way but will not be completed until December next. It is expected that some surplus will be available from the 2002 EU budget which would be available for carryover into the 2003 EU budget. However, it is unclear at this stage how big the surplus from the 2002 EU budget is likely to be and what impact it will have on member state contributions. Since the 2003 EU budget is expected to be higher than the 2002 EU budget and since the surplus carried over into 2003 is unlikely to prove as large as that carried over into 2002, we would expect that Ireland's EU budget contribution in 2003 will exceed our EU budget contribution in 2002. As per normal, the White Paper for Receipts and Expenditure published before budget day will contain an estimate for Ireland's EU budget contribution in 2003.</P>

      <P>The annual report and accounts of the Central Bank for the year ended 31 December 2001 was published in June of this year. The Central Bank made a profit of &euro;563 million in 2001. It transferred &euro;32 million to its accounting reserves and surplus income of &euro;531million approximately was paid to the Exchequer in June of this year. This compares with an estimate of &euro;475 million included in the budget. The increase was due to capital gains by the bank on its investment portfolio.</P>
      <P>Total projected Central Bank receipts in 2002 are &euro;1,136 million. This includes &euro;605 million in projected exceptional receipts on top of the &euro;531 million in surplus income. A sum of &euro;240 million of this total arises from anticipated windfall profits due to the fact that the value of old Irish denominated banknotes redeemed in exchange for new Euro notes is projected to fall short of the value of Irish notes outstanding. A sum of &euro;365 million arises from the transfer to the Exchequer of accrued profits from the issue of coin. These previously accrued to the currency reserve of the Central Bank. The new arrangements are in line with normal practice in EU member states.</P>
      <P>The 2003 allocation is a matter for the Central Bank within the terms of the relevant legislation and will depend in large part on the surplus generated by the Central Bank in 2002.</P>

      <P>The projected general Government balance for 2002 is for a deficit of around &euro;700 million or 0.6% of GDP. The estimate made in budget 2002 was for a surplus of &euro;837 million or 0.7% of GDP. The elements which have caused changes to the budget day projection relate in the main to the projected shortfall of &euro;1,300 million in tax revenue and the non-counting of euro changeover receipts, offset by receipts from the sale of 3G phone licences and a reduction in our EU budget contribution.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw the Deputy's attention to replies to recent questions on this matter from Deputy McGuinness on 24 October 2002 &ndash; Parliamentary Question No. 58 &ndash; and Deputy Richard <Col N="183" /> Bruton on 15 October 2002 &ndash; Parliamentary Question No. 192.</P>
      <P>Ireland's debt strategy for developing countries was launched publicly last July. The debt strategy document, prepared jointly by Ireland Aid and the Department of Finance, was forwarded to Ireland's representatives at the IMF and the World Bank in advance of the recent annual meetings of these institutions. Both executive boards are fully aware of Ireland's policy on developing country debt.</P>
      <P>I remind Deputies of the Government position in relation to debt cancellation as stated in the debt strategy document. We have concluded that, in principle, the total cancellation of the debts of the heavily indebted poor countries is a politically acceptable objective and one that we would support. Total cancellation would, however, have to be funded largely through additional donor contributions. In order to mobilise the necessary funds for total debt cancellation, a greater number of donors, particularly the larger economies, would have to increase their ODA more rapidly and take concrete steps to meeting the UN target of 0.7% of GNP on ODA.</P>
      <P>The total cancellation of HIPC debts should be accompanied by strong monitoring and accountability mechanisms to ensure that the additional funds available to HIPC governments, through debt cancellation, would be directly channelled into increased social expenditure, particularly HIV-AIDS.</P>
      <P>While we support, in principle, the total cancellation of HIPC country debts we believe that, in practice, the additional donor contributions required to achieve this will be difficult to mobilise. The additional ODA commitments made by major donors &ndash; EU and US &ndash; at the International Conference on Financing for Development would not be sufficient to cover total debt cancellation. In any case, these contributions will be used to fund a number of development activities and not just debt relief.</P>

Examination and preparation of responses to the observations received following the public exhibition of the scheme is likely to take a number of months yet.

When the design is completed the scheme will be submitted to the Minister for Finance for confirmation in accordance with the Arterial Drainage Acts, 1945 and 1995. Following confirmation, the detailed design of the scheme and tendering for the works will commence.</P>

Bridge works have been completed on the Morrell River and embankment construction commenced. Due to adverse weather conditions, however, works have now ceased and will be resumed early next year. To date, all works are within the projected budget.</P>

      <P>On budget day 5 December 2001, inflation, as measured by annual changes in the consumer price index (CPI), was forecast to average 4.2% this year. My Department's most recently published forecast was that contained in economic review and outlook, published in August, where CPI inflation was projected to average 4.5 % this year. The upward revision partly reflected the impact of higher oil prices this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="188" />Ireland's inflation rate has been higher than in our major trading partners for some time now and this is undermining our competitiveness. Ireland's higher inflation rate partly reflects domestic cost pressures. It is important that these cost pressures are not allowed to lead to a further deterioration in competitiveness, which would result in higher unemployment. This is why moderation in wage developments and domestic costs generally is so important.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to change the existing rules. The general position is that an Irish resident individual is liable for income tax on his or her worldwide income. An individual will be regarded as being resident in the State for a tax year if he or she: <Col N="192" /> spends 183 days or more in the State in that tax year; or spends 280 days in the State, combining the number of days spent in the State in that tax year and in the preceding tax year.</P>
      <P>Presence in a tax year by an individual of not more than 30 days in the State will not be reckoned for the purpose of applying the two year test. Presence in the State for a day means the personal presence of an individual at the end of the day, that is, midnight.</P>
      <P>These particular residence rules have applied since 1994 and were part of the new comprehensive set of rules on residence that were introduced that year. Prior to that the rules of residence were based on a mixture of legislative provisions, case law and administrative practice and were generally regarded as unsatisfactory and lacking in clarity. All tax authorities have rules to distinguish between residence and non-residence for tax purposes. The majority of EU states use the 183 days, or six months, rule as a criterion of residence.</P>
      <P>It should also be mentioned that Irish source income is generally liable to tax in the hands of a non-resident individual except where the taxing rights involved lie with that individual's State of residence under the terms of a double taxation agreement between Ireland and that other state.</P>

His visit did not imply recognition of the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. No other Minister or Minister of State in the present Government has visited northern Cyprus since taking up office. It is Government policy to advise members of the Oireachtas not to associate themselves with events connected with the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.</P>
      <P>The Irish ambassador in Nicosia, in the course of his diplomatic duties and in accordance with established procedures, visits northern Cyprus from time to time and has contacts with the leaders of the Turkish Cypriot community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's design team procedures apply to major school building projects and a full design team is engaged to address the <Col N="198" /> architectural, structural, services and cost control aspects of projects. The design team procedures are in place to ensure that there is a consistent approach to the architectural planning of school buildings, with a view to ensuring quality school buildings built at a cost that represents value for money.</P>
      <P>These procedures consist of six stages up to the point of construction. Some of these stages may also be combined depending on the nature and complexity of the project. The design and planning of the project is covered by stages one to five, during which the project is developed from the assessment of site suitability, through the detailed design, including the obtaining of planning permission, to the point where detailed bills of quantities are prepared.</P>
      <P>At stage six tenders are sought in line with public procurement procedures and subsequently a tender report is prepared and examined. Assuming that the outcome of the tender process is acceptable in terms of procurement procedures, providing value for money and that funds are available to meet construction costs a construction contract is placed at that stage and the construction of the project begins.</P>
      <P>The rate of progress to construction depends on factors such as the complexity and size of the project, the time required to undertake architectural planning, the volume of other projects being dealt with by the design team and my Department's building unit, the period of time required for the granting of planning permission and obtaining a fire certificate, the availability of funding, the relative priority of the project, the outcome of the tender competition and the procurement, where relevant, of bonds, insurance and tax clearance by prospective contractors.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that in view of the nature and complexity of the architectural planning process, it would not be possible to be definitive above the average length of time it takes from initial approval to final completion. My Department has requested a combined stage one-two-three submission from the school referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>In the meantime, board of management of St. Mary's national school, Bagenalstown, should ensure that essential health and safety issues at the school are attended to. They should, therefore, continue to use the devolved grant for minor works and if the cost of any works of an emergency nature exceeds the amount available under the devolved grant, they may apply to my Department's building unit for grant aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the value of the grant, the practice in recent years has been to increase the level of maintenance grants annually at least in line with inflation. This year, in line with this policy, I announced increases of 5% in the rates of maintenance grant. The reference value for inflation is the annual percentage increase in the CPI to mid-February 2002. The increase of 5% in grant rates for 2002-03 was higher than the reference value, which was 4.7%.</P>
      <P>Similarly, my approach was to follow the practice of recent years and increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. I approved an increase of 7% in the reckonable income limits for the 2002-03 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 2000 to March 2001, which was 6.7%. I also increased by 15% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study, in line with the commitment in the June 2002 programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" />My Department is at present conducting a review of student support provisions aimed at ensuring that the benefits of the &euro;360 million investment being made are maximised in the context of the Government's objectives for achieving greater access to third level education among lower socio-economic groups.</P>
    <P>Any proposal for substantial increases in student grant levels could only be considered having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector.</P>

      <P>My Department has an extensive primary school building programme under way at present and this includes a large number of projects at various stages of architectural planning, details of which are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="206" />Decisions on additional projects proceeding to architectural planning are taken in the light of the annual allocation for capital projects, the financial commitments to be met and the priority to be afforded to individual projects. The programme for 2002 is in place and the schools concerned have been notified.</P>
    <P>Later this year when a financial allocation has been made for the primary school building programme in the 2003 budget I will be framing a further programme of works and this will involve putting more projects into architectural planning. The needs of the school in question will be considered at that time.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the school's board of management should ensure that essential health and safety issues at the school are attended to. They should, therefore, continue to use the devolved grant for minor works and if the cost of any works of an emergency nature exceeds the amount available under the devolved grant, they may apply to my Department's building unit for supplementary grant aid.</P>

      <P>The terms of the Government decision to establish the national educational psychological service &ndash; NEPS &ndash; in 1999, provided for a gradual expansion to full strength over a five-year period. Following the appointment of a number of additional psychologists during this term, I am happy to inform the Deputy that the NEPS will be extended to include St Patrick's boys' national school, Wicklow, within a matter of weeks.</P>
      <P>Because of the needs identified in the school and as an interim measure, the NEPS regional director for the east coast region authorised management of the school to commission four assessments during the first half of this school term, under the terms of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments. I understand that school management is satisfied with this arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to obtain full recognition as a primary teacher in this country, teachers must have satisfactorily completed a recognised primary teaching course. In addition, Irish primary school teachers are class teachers as distinct from individual subject teachers and must be able to teach all aspects of the curriculum including the Irish language. Accordingly, fully recognised primary teachers must be qualified to teach the full range of primary school subjects to children aged four to 12 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers trained in another member state of the European Union, but who do not possess an appropriate Irish language qualification, must have their qualifications assessed and accepted by my Department, before they are granted a five year period of provisional recognition to teach in national schools. Such teachers must satisfy my Department that they are competent to teach the Irish language and to teach the range of primary school curricular subjects through the medium of Irish before being granted full recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools. In order to satisfy the Irish language requirement such teachers must pass an Irish language examination &ndash; Scrúdú Cailíochta sa Ghaeilge &ndash; and provide certification that they have resided in the Gaeltacht while attending an approved three-week course. It is incumbent on boards of management of national schools to ensure that adequate provision is made for the teaching of <Col N="209" /> Irish to classes of teachers who hold provisional recognition.</P>
    <P>My Department also grants restricted recognition to certain Montessori trained teachers and to teachers who have a recognised primary teacher qualification from another jurisdiction but who are not qualified to teach in mainstream national schools because they do not have an appropriate Irish language qualification. Restricted recognition gives eligibility to teach in certain categories of special schools and special classes in mainstream schools where Irish is not a curricular requirement.</P>

    <P>It should be noted that two factors contributed to a substantially higher allocation for the higher education grants scheme in 1997 than in subsequent years. Until 1997, local authorities recouped payments in respect of the higher education grants scheme one year in arrears. A supplementary estimate was provided in 1997 to change to a system of recoupment on a current year basis. The free fees initiative was introduced on a phased basis in 1995-96. Full undergraduate tuition fees were payable in respect of eligible students from 1996-97. Students who received grant assistance towards tuition fees under the higher education grant scheme prior to the introduction of free fees continued under this arrangement for the duration of their undergraduate course. It should also be noted that the expenditure data for 2002 is anticipated expenditure, whereas the data for 1997-2001 represents actual expenditure.</P>

My Department advised schools of amended arrangements for the employment and remuneration of these personnel in a circular letter, dated 15 August 2002. Schools were permitted to retain the arrangements that were in place for the 2001-02 school year for an interim period pending the putting in place of the new arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 308 to 313, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The contract for the provision of a bundle of five post-primary schools under the first education public private partnership project was signed in November 2001 with Jarvis Projects Limited. This pilot project was developed on a design, build, finance and operate basis. While the maintenance and operation of the buildings is a matter for Jarvis for the duration of the service contract, in this case 25 years, the management of the schools and their day-to-day running will remain with the school management authorities. The State will retain legal ownership of all properties.</P>
      <P>The principal of &ldquo;everything works&rdquo; applies under the PPP process &ndash; classrooms, laboratories, heating, lighting, all have to be available every day during the lifetime of the project to avoid deductions to the operators unitary payment. No additional school PPP projects have been added to the pilot programme. However, I am actively identifying other possible education PPP projects.</P>
      <P>The initial outlay cost to my Department in the provision of the five schools is &euro;2.07 million, comprising the cost of the land for three of the schools and local authority capital contributions associated with planning permission. The capital cost of the schools is &euro;60.64 million. The operator will receive an annual unitary payment of &euro;10.122 million in years one to three of the contract and &euro;9.716 million thereafter &ndash; the information technology element of the contract is for three years supply and maintain. This figure comprises the cost of repaying the capital cost of the project, the provision of furniture and equipment and the maintenance and operation of the schools. However, under the PPP process no money is paid to the operator by my Department until the schools have been built, fitted out and are ready to be officially handed over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The project agreement between my Department and the operator is intended to cover all aspects and eventualities over the 25 year period of the contract. Provision has been made in the agreement for the termination of the project in certain circumstances. If the operator breaches <Col N="221" /> the requirements or defaults on the agreement, there is a mechanism available by which the contract may be terminated by my Department. It is also open to my Department to voluntarily terminate the agreement at any time and to purchase the outstanding debt.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the project agreement it is open to Jarvis projects to refinance the project but only subject to the approval of the Minister and provided that the refinancing does not increase the liability or potential liability. The agreement also ensures that my Department will benefit from savings generated through refinancing the project by a reduction in the unitary payment.</P>

      <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland which was established as a statutory agency on 1 May this year implements initiatives on renewable energy and energy efficiency on behalf of my Department. At present they do not provide any direct funding support at an individual householder level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two research development and demonstration programmes in the areas of energy efficiency and renewable energy have been launched, namely, the house of tomorrow and renewable energy research, development and demonstration programmes which are being administered on my behalf by Sustainable Energy Ireland. The house of tomorrow programme offers support for research, development and demonstration projects aimed at generating and applying technologies, products, systems, practices and information leading to more sustainable energy performance in Irish housing. The main focus of the programme is on stimulating widespread uptake of superior energy planning, design, specification and construction practices in both the new home building and home improvement markets. The programme has an indicative budget of &euro;21.1 million over the period 2001-06. The programme will include three specific strands aimed at enhanced best practice and innovation in housing. These three strands together aim to support a total of 2,500 new build homes and the retrofitting of 500 homes with specific support funding and regional spread criteria already set down. However, I must emphasize that in all cases the programme will seek to support collectives of more than five dwellings and so no direct support <Col N="223" /> at individual level is available. The focus of the renewable energy research development and demonstration programme is to stimulate the application and further deployment of renewable energies, particularly those close to market viability.</P>
    <P>Within this particular programme renewable energy technologies including photovoltaic and solar water heating are among a long list of technologies that may qualify for support as part of an overall and comprehensive project selection and qualification process. Within the renewable energy research, development and demonstration programme there is a provision for community based renewable energy projects to apply.</P>
    <P>The renewable energy research, development and deployment programme has a budget of &euro;16 million over the period 2001-06.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 318, 322, 327 and 333 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the principal factors which affects the uptake of broadband services is the price at which they are available. The price is in large part determined by the supply of the infrastructure and services which, in a fully liberated communications market, is the responsibility of the private sector companies offering these services. The ODTR also has a role in regulating the prices at which broadband is made available. My responsibility is <Col N="224" /> for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy.</P>
    <P>The provision and promotion of communications infrastructure and services including DSL broadband is a matter for the private sector companies that operate in the fully liberalised telecommunications market. However, recognising that there are areas of the country that are not as economically attractive for firms to invest in infrastructure and services due to differing demographics and population densities and cognisant that the global economic downturn has adversely affected companies ability to invest, my Department has undertaken a number of initiatives to facilitate the roll-out of advanced communications infrastructure, including DSL, which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in regional Ireland.</P>
    <P>In 1999, under the National Development Plan, 1994-1999, and Interreg II, &euro;26.5 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Some 13 projects which rolled-out broadband nationwide to a value (both public and private funding) of &euro;70 million were supported and are now completed. These projects entailed the roll-out of broadband services in the Border, midlands and west region and the south and east region.</P>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, the indicative figure allocated to telecommunications initiatives was approximately &euro;200 million. Funding under this communications and e-commerce measure of the NDP will be utilised to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced information and communications infrastructure and services which will enhance the potential for the development of electronic commerce facilities and enable the electronic provision of public services, including education services, virtual libraries, welfare and health services.</P>
    <P>A first call for proposals was run in 2000 and on foot of submissions received, nine contracts were signed at the beginning of last year which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure and increased availability of broadband services for business and residential users. The projects involved are scheduled to be completed by the end of next year and will entail an overall investment of &euro;160 million in broadband leveraged from grant assistance of approximately &euro;55 million.</P>
    <P>Of the projects selected under this call under the communications measure of the NDP 2000-2006, my Department will fund Esat-BT with up to &euro;9 million to roll-out a &euro;25 million DSL programme at 40 centres outside of the Dublin area. Under the second call, &euro;3.7 million has been made available to Eircom in respect of DSL roll-out at 14 exchanges nationwide. In addition, I am also aware that Eircom is rolling out DSL at 32 centres in the greater Dublin area. I am also <Col N="225" /> informed that by the end of the year 500,000 lines will be DSL enabled which will greatly facilitate the deployment of broadband nationwide. The roll out of DSL may, in the short-term, satisfy the demand for broadband for residential and some SMEs. In the medium to long-term it is expected that the demand for broadband will grow rapidly and that the demand for fibre will increase.</P>
    <P>The broadband programme announced in March will involve 20 projects which will lead to the construction of metropolitan area fibre optic networks in towns, including Dungarvan to link up with the existing backbone network in the country at a projected cost of &euro;60 million. The town links will facilitate consumers, educational establishments, industry and business and provide &ldquo;always on&rdquo; low cost and high speed Internet access which will drive the Governments e-commerce agenda. By reducing the cost of access to fibre rings, it will facilitate the provision of broadband services by a greater a number of operators and the ensuing competition should benefit the end users in these towns. The relevant local authorities have been asked to enter procurement to establish firm prices for their proposals. I understand that the tender process for the civil works for the SERA projects including Dungarvan has closed and that the proposals are currently being ecvaluated. Once procurement is completed, and subject to satisfactory pricing, contracts will be offered for these projects in the order that the local authorities complete the procurement processes to the satisfaction of my Department. It is anticipated that this will take place over the coming months. It is expected that these projects will be completed within 12 to 18 months.</P>
    <P>Under the first call under the communications measure of the NDP 2000-2006, my Department will fund Esat-BT with up to &euro;9 million to roll-out a &euro;25 million DSL programme at 40 centres outside of the Dublin area by the end of the year. Under the second call, &euro;3.7 million has been made available to Eircom in respect of DSL rollout at 14 exchanges nationwide. In addition, I am also aware that Eircom is rolling out DSL at 32 centres in the greater Dublin area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fishing Vessel (Personal Flotation Devices) Regulations, SI 586 of 2001, were signed on 14 December 2001 and came into effect on 1 March 2002. Under the regulations the skipper of a commercial fishing vessel must take all reasonable steps to ensure that all crew members wear a personal flotation device, PFD, when on the exposed deck of the vessel. This statutory instrument was made under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992. Under section 19(5) of that Act, if there is a contravention of regulations made under it, the owner and skipper of a fishing vessel are guilty of an offence. To date there have been no prosecutions.</P>
      <P>To facilitate the application of the new regulations regarding the wearing of PFDs the maritime safety directorate of my Department issued a marine notice, No. 7 of 2002, on 19 April 2002 giving guidance on the selection of personal flotation devices for use on board fishing vessels. The fishing organisations and other interested bodies were notified of the regulations and the regulations are available on my Department's website. In July 2002 BIM issued a brochure entitled Safe Fishing Is No Accident. The brochure outlines the requirement for fishermen to wear PFDs. In addition, fishermen participating in the basic safety training courses organised by BIM are introduced to the various types of PFDs available and the marine surveyors of my Department also bring the regulations in relation to the wearing of PFDs to the attention of the skippers and crew when they are surveying fishing vessels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, an &ldquo;authorised officer&rdquo;&ndash; which includes a member of the Garda Síochána and persons holding a commissioned naval rank in the Permanent Defence Force, may board any vessel to ensure that the regulations made under the Act are being <Col N="228" /> complied with. To date, the maritime safety directorate itself has not undertaken inspections specifically in relation to the wearing of PFDs. However, the review of safety regulations which I have asked the directorate to undertake includes enhancing enforcement arrangements in relation to all vessels from 2003 onwards.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 328 and 334 together.</P>
      <P>The regulation of Internet charges is a matter for the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. However, I share the view that access to the Internet at competitive prices is vital in driving the information society and is a pivotal part of our development as an economy and as a society. In this context, I propose to issue a policy direction to the new Commission for Communications Regulation in accordance with the terms of the Communications Regulation Act, 2002. It is my intention that the direction will focus on a number of key policy priorities for the CCR in the short to medium term, including the introduction of flat-rate Internet access. The new commission will be established very shortly and following its establishment I will publish a draft of my policy direction for public consultation. I am confident that my initiative in this regard should bring about a substantial improvement on the current position in this area.</P>

      <P>The Commission for Communications Regulation must have the appropriate resources to carry out its functions properly. However, it is important that this is balanced against the need to ensure that the cost of regulation of the communications sector in Ireland is competitive compared to those costs in other EU member states. It is my intention to use my powers under section 20(3)(<i>a</i>) of the Communications Regulation Act, 2002, during 2003 to review the number, grading, remuneration and other conditions of staff in the Commission for Communications Regulation, taking into account the commission's use of and needs for consultancy services.</P>

      <P>Scientific advice on the Irish Sea cod stock has been prepared by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, which recommends a closure of all fisheries for cod as a targeted species or by-catch. It also provides that where cod represents an incidental catch there should be stringent restrictions on the catch and discard rates of cod with effective monitoring of compliance with those restrictions. This advice was reviewed by of the Scientific, Technical, Economic Committee for Fisheries, STECF, a group of independent scientific, technical and economic experts appointed by the European Commission. STECF noted that there is serious concern about the stock and that stock recovery is unlikely unless stringent management action is taken immediately.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals at this time from the Commission in relation to Irish Sea cod or other stocks in the Irish Sea. The Commission will bring forward proposals in the next few weeks for all stocks, taking account of both the ICES advice and the comments of STECF. These proposals will be considered by the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in December. At national level, the ICES advice and the STECF review of the advice are being examined. A recovery plan for Irish Sea cod, involving closed areas to protect cod spawning grounds and fishing gear restrictions, is in place. This plan was introduced in 2000 in consultation with scientists and industry representatives to protect and rebuild the cod stock.</P>
      <P>The catch of Irish sea cod by the Irish fleet is relatively modest and a significant part is taken as a by-catch in the nephrops fishery. The Irish authorities will be seeking, as a priority, to agree a regime that enables the nephrops fishery to be maintained while ensuring that by-catches of cod in this fishery are minimised. Proposals for 2003 will be considered in the context of the scientific advice and current measures in place under the recovery plan and in consultation with the industry representatives, in order to determine a national position in view of the need to provide for the recovery of the cod stock and the needs of coastal communities dependent on the exploitation of Irish Sea stocks.</P>

      <P>The national drugs strategy 2001-2008, which was published last year, contains 100 actions, many of which are health-related. The strategy envisages that a range of treatment and rehabilitation options will be made available for drug abusers. This includes comprehensive residential treatment models incorporating detoxification, intervention, pre-treatment counselling, motivational work, therapeutic treatment and high-quality rehabilitation for abusers who wish to become drug-free.</P>
      <P>A range of these services is already available across the country. Indeed, funding has already been made available for extra residential rehabilitation places under the strategy. For example, &euro;700,000 was provided in 2002 for Matt Talbot services, a residential facility for the treatment of alcohol and drug misuse in young males between the ages of 14 and 18 years in the Southern Health Board area. My Department and the health boards are committed to the further development of a full range of services for drug abusers in line with the national drugs strategy. To this end a committee, chaired by the Deputy Secretary General of my Department, has been established to oversee the implementation of the health-related actions within the strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of health related services, including speech and language therapy, is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Accordingly, the Deputy's question has been referred to the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority with a request that he examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>However, I understand that all health boards are experiencing difficulties in the recruitment of therapy posts and particularly in filling senior vacancies.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department commissioned a report on current and future supply and demand in the labour market for certain professional therapists from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates. The Bacon report, which was published in July 2001, concluded that a major expansion is essential in the number of speech and language therapists requiring a very significant increase in training places to meet the long-term needs of the health service. The report therefore advocated an annual increase of 75 training places for speech and language therapy in order to achieve the fourfold increase in the number of speech and language therapists over the next decade recommended in the report.</P>
      <P>To advance this core recommendation of the report, an inter-agency working group, comprising officials from the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, was established to seek proposals from third level institutions to ensure the rapid provision of the additional therapy training places. On 29 May 2002 the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, announced the provision of 175 extra professional therapy training places for students to tackle the acute shortage of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists in the health service. This initiative almost doubles the number of therapy places available at present and it is expected that the first intake to the extra places for speech and language therapy will commence in the 2003-04 academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other key recommendations of the report include provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators; the need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; concerted recruitment from overseas; establishment of the planned system of statutory regis<Col N="236" /> tration consistent with the requirement for a patient-centred health service; career structure, workload, working practices and skills-mix issues encompassed in the context of the report of the Expert Group on Various Health Professions, published in April 2000.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Bacon report I have asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision, or an enhancement, in line with agreed service developments using the resources allocated to the services. The Northern Area Health Board has also undertaken a concerted overseas recruitment drive for various allied health professionals, including speech and language therapists, on behalf of all health boards. Procedures are being streamlined to minimise the length of time taken to validate foreign qualifications consistent with the over-arching need to ensure that all therapists working in the health sector are appropriately trained and qualified.</P>

      <P>A number of initiatives have been taken in relation to the improvement of dementia services. Significant additional funding of &euro;6 million has been made available in the period 1999-2002 for the express purpose of providing assistance to carers, including carers of Alzheimer's sufferers. Additional funding of &euro;2.5 million has been made available to the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland for expansion of its services, particularly day-care services. A number of new community nursing units for older people, which have been constructed in recent years, provide respite and day-care for people with dementia. A number of further such units are being planned during the lifetime of the National Development Plan.</P>
      <P>My Department has been informed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority that the South-Western Area Health Board, in conjunction with the Alzheimer's Society, has initiated a home respite scheme for dementia sufferers.

It is hoped that within six months up to 50 families will be able to avail of this service.</P>
      <P>My Department accepts the need to further develop services for people with dementia and their carers. It is intended to continue with initiatives commenced in recent years of allocating additional developmental resources towards the build-up of community supports for older people, including those with dementia.</P>

      <P>I have carefully noted the points made by the person referred to by the Deputy. I assure the Deputy and the person in question that I have studied and reflected on all that was said during the recent post mortem inquiry debate. In my contribution to the debate, I expressed the deepest of regret for the distress caused to members of Parents for Justice by post mortem and organ retention practice, which compounded the pain of having already lost a child and my determination that this matter should be fully investigated.</P>
      <P>When the Government decided to set up a non-statutory inquiry into post mortem practices, it did so in good faith believing it was the best option and that the task could be completed within 18 months. Regretfully, it is now clear that the work will take considerably longer. I believe that the only way in which the timescale can be shortened is to give the inquiry a much sharper focus. I regret that Parents for Justice has decided to withdraw from the inquiry process and I urge it to consider entering into discussions with me on how the present impasse can be resolved. I am open to positive suggestions to make progress. I have invited Parents for Justice to work together in partnership with me to resolve this problem. We must get to the facts, but we must do so within a realistic timeframe which does not prolong the suffering of bereaved parents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health (Amendment) Act, 1986, deals with how health boards and hospitals may charge for hospital services to victims of road traffic accidents whether they receive or are entitled to receive damages or compensation from the person liable for the injury. The Department specified that charges be calculated on the basis of the hospital's average daily cost. The average daily cost is calculated by taking the hospital's total annual expenditure, excluding capital, and dividing this by the number of bed days occupied in the year. On 11 July 2001, the Supreme Court ruled that the average daily cost is reasonable, proper and intra vires the Health (Amendment) Act, 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Act, health boards may impose charges on all patients for treatment arising out of injuries sustained in road traffic accidents where compensation is subsequently payable. However, the Act does not withdraw eligibility for public services from road traffic accident victims. It simply allows the health boards to recover the costs of all services provided to them. While bills are generally issued in all RTA cases they are only settled where compensation is received and then forwarded to hospitals. Compensation may be <Col N="244" /> significantly reduced in cases where contributory negligence is established. In the event of a person failing to obtain a compensation award, that person will only be liable for the normal statutory and maintenance charges, where applicable.</P>

      <Quest>further to Parliamentary Question No. 556 of 5 November 2002, the progress which has been made regarding the development and introduction of the therapy assistant grade in speech and language therapy since publication of the report of the expert group on various health professionals published in April 2000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the expert group on various health professionals published in April 2000, drew attention to the need to develop skills mix for the therapy professions, including speech and language therapy, and, in this context, recommended the introduction of a grade of therapy assistant, where appropriate. The expert group emphasised that the introduction of a therapy assistant grade should not be regarded as a substitute for existing personnel but rather should complement the role of the fully trained professional therapist. Consequently, the key prerequisite to the introduction of this new grade is the availability of adequate fully qualified therapists to appropriately oversee and supervise the provision of services provided by assistants, consistent with the provision of quality health care services to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hence, the main priority for my Department since the publication of the expert group report has been to address acute shortages in the numbers of therapy professionals employed in the health service. In this context, the Deputy may wish to note the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the Bacon report regarding the provision of a very substantial increase in training places, the introduction of new pay scales, career and management structures, the undertaking of a concerted overseas recruitment <Col N="245" /> drive on behalf of all the health boards, the introduction of a fast track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals and the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications. These measures are reflected in the increase of 54 speech and language therapists, +15.6%, employed in the public health service over the past two years.</P>
    <P>The report of the expert group also highlighted a number of important additional preconditions to the introduction of a grade of therapy assistant in the health service, including the development of suitably accredited training programmes and further consideration of the role of such assistants in service provision. It is envisaged that the establishment of a therapy advisory unit in my Department, a further recommendation of the expert group, working together with the health skills group, recently established under the aegis of my Department to examine key workforce planning issues including skills mix, can play an important role in progressing these issues and, hence, supporting the development and introduction of the role of therapy assistant.</P>

      <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal is the statutory body whose main function is to regulate appointments of consultant medical staff in hospitals providing services under the Health Acts, and to specify qualifications for such appointments. It also advises on matters relating to the organisation and operation of hospital services and publishes reports relating to such services. Arising from a number of meetings with various interest groups, I requested Comhairle na nOspidéal to conduct a <Col N="246" /> review of neurological services and related issues. Comhairle established a committee with the following terms of reference:</P>
      <P>To examine the existing arrangements for the provision of consultant-level neurology and neurophysiology services nationally and following consultation with the interests concerned, to make recommendations to Comhairle na nOspidéal on the future organisation and development of neurology and neurophysiology services. The review will focus on updating the 1991 Comhairle report taking into account recent advances in and increasing demand for neurological and neurophysiological services.</P>
      <P>The Comhairle review is still under way. It is expected that its report should be complete in the near future. The need for additional investment in neurology and neurophysiology will be considered in the light of the review by Comhairle, other competing priorities, and the availability of adequate funding.</P>

      <Quest>his views on Aer Rianta's proposals for a northern parallel runway at Dublin Airport for which an environmental impact statement is being prepared; if the board of Aer Rianta will be directed not to proceed with the planning process for this proposal pending the commissioning by him of an independent study into the development of a second greater Dublin-LeinsterMidlands airport as an alternative to this proposal; and, in his report, if he will comment on the opposition of Aer Lingus, Ryanair and the Aviation regulator to the necessity for this project, given the opposition to this proposal by residents, for example, on grounds of noise pollution, nuisance, traffic congestion, flooding and the need for proper spatial planning.</Quest>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply given on my behalf by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to a motion on the Adjournment of this House on Wednesday, 6 November 2002. That reply addressed the current position in relation to Aer Rianta's proposals for a new, second parallel runway at Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>With regard to the suggestion for the development of a new airport for the greater Dublin-Leinster-Midlands area as an alternative to the expansion of the current facilities at Dublin Airport, this issue was addressed in the Warburg Dillon Read Report of 1999 on the future strategy for Aer Rianta. The consultants formed the view that Dublin Airport is not constrained from a capacity point of view and indeed that it has sufficient potential to expand and accommodate up to 40 million passengers per annum. Accordingly, the consultants confirmed that Dublin does not need a second airport given Dublin Airport's capacity to grow for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>As my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, pointed out on the Adjournment last week, I will in due course consider Aer Rianta's proposal in relation to the new parallel runway from the shareholder and policy perspectives. Pending such consideration, it would not be appropriate for me to comment at this stage on the views of other parties in relation to the new runway proposal.</P>

      <Quest>if, during a visit to Argentina in 2001, discussions were held with members of the Irish-Argentinian community to discuss the possibility of getting Irish passports for great grandchildren of Irish citizens; if so, whether support was expressed for this development; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>During the Taoiseach's visit to Argentina in July 2001, the links between Ireland and the Irish community in Argentina were discussed. In that context, several people mentioned that they intended to research their Irish heritage and descent. The Taoiseach welcomed this. However, he did not endorse or propose any amendment to the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts in the course of these discussions. Consequently, as I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 1352 of 9 October 2002, it is not intended to introduce amending legislation on foreign births registration in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>Under the Courts Service Act, 1998, the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which include the provision of information on the courts system.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The main legislative provisions relating to under-age drinking are set out in Part IV of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, as amended by the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000. The Act of 2000 provides for considerable strengthening of those provisions which already existed in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, in relation to the supply or sale of intoxicating liquor to underage persons, including increases in fines for breaches of the <Col N="262" /> law on under age drinking. Serious penalties, including temporary closure of a licensed premises, can result where a licensee is convicted of the offence of selling intoxicating liquor to an under age person. In this regard, a total of 118 closure orders in respect of licensed premises have been made since the 2000 Act came into force.</P>

      <P>The 1997 programme for Government included, in the context of measures to combat the drugs problem, a recommendation for the creation of a drug court system which would involve court supervised treatment programmes for less serious drug related offences. A drug court planning committee was established in early 1999 to develop an integrated cross service strategic plan involving court supervised treatment programmes as an alternative to custodial sentences. The committee, <i>inter alia</i>, recommended the establishment of a pilot project to provide the information necessary to address their terms of reference. The committee undertook to reconvene when an evaluation of the pilot project was available to address all outstanding matters from their terms of reference and report thereon.</P>
      <P>The pilot drug court programme was launched by the Courts Service in the Dublin District Court on 9 January 2001 for a period of 18 months. The first sitting took place on 16 January 2001. The programme was evaluated by expert consultants who have reported to the Courts Service board on the operation of the pilot scheme. The board has recently forwarded the report and their recommendations to me. I will now look at the question of referring the report to the drug court planning committee.</P>

      <Quest>the research which has been carried out on drug misuse in Irish prisons; if there is ongoing research; if his Department intends to carry out new research; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of studies in the area of drug misuse in Irish prisons has been undertaken in the past. These studies, listed below, have served to illustrate, among other things, the ill-effects that drug misuse has had on the prisoner population &ndash; Drug use among prisoners &ndash; An Exploratory Study, General Healthcare Study of the Irish Prisoner Population, Summary of Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV in Irish Prisoners: Prevalence and Risk, Summary of Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV in Irish Prisoners, Part II: Prevalence and Risk in Committal Prisoners 1999. These studies and the expertise developed by, and the experience of, the many people working in this area have laid the basis for the continuing expansion of drug treatment within the prisons.</P>
      <P>An action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system was approved in 1999. This advocated a broad based approach to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders. The 1999 action plan, which built on an agreed policy between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the then Eastern Health Board, advocated the expansion of detoxification facilities, more drug-free areas and the provision of methadone maintenance. It is my intention to continue with the implementation of the plan.</P>
      <P>The national steering group, established in 1999 to implement the action plan continues to pursue a multi-disciplinary approach to the drugs problem with substantial input from the health sector, especially the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The group is chaired by the director of regimes in the Irish Prison Service. It has recently established a multi-disciplinary working group, composed of the in-house services and a member of the addiction studies department, Trinity College, to review the current drug treatment programme in the Mountjoy complex in terms of (a) the extent of ownership of the programme across a range of local stakeholders and voluntary agencies; (b) the extent to which the programme matches current best practice; and (c) to make relevant recommendations. In parallel to this review, another subgroup is developing a proposal for a major research project focusing on the follow-up of participants in the Mountjoy drug treatment programme to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implementation of the action plan may well necessitate further research, much of which it will be possible for the prison service to carry out, in conjunction with other stakeholders. The Irish Prison Service is also committed to evaluating the effectiveness of all prison programmes, including those aimed at the reduction of drug misuse and, under the national drugs strategy 2001 to 2008, it has undertaken to commission and carry out an independent evaluation of the <Col N="264" /> overall effectiveness of the prison strategy by mid 2004. This review will cover all aspects of drug services in prisons including research on the levels and routes of supply of drugs in prisons.</P>
    <P>The prison service is currently in the process of establishing a research policy group to formulate proposals for research projects relevant to the custody, care and rehabilitation of prisoners. A research ethics committee has also been established to examine all proposals for research involving prisoners, from external and internal sources and to recommend to the Irish Prison Service authorisation, rejection or modification of any such proposals in so far as adherence to ethical standards is concerned. Finally, it is the intention of both myself and the prison service to continue to place a high priority on battling the scourge of drug misuse among prisoners and, to that end, any research that is necessary to progress that aim will be undertaken.</P>

      <P>As I informed the House on 17 October last, some aspects of my address at the Garda Síochána graduation ceremony on 4 July 2002 were incorrectly represented in one of the national newspapers at the time. Rather than making any reference to increasing the numbers of persons charged with drugs offences, I did refer in my address to key a performance indicator in the national drugs strategy 2001-2008 which is to increase the volume of opiates and all other drugs seized by 25% by end 2004 and 50% by end 2008, using 2000 seizures as a base. These indicators reflect a major supply reduction objective of the strategy which is to reduce significantly the volume of illicit drugs available in Ireland, to arrest the dynamic of the existing markets and to curtail new markets as they are identified. A copy of my address at the graduation ceremony has already been lodged in the Oireachtas Library for the information of the House. Following the newspaper report to which I refer, an official of my Department contacted the newspaper in question to clarify the position as outlined above.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the statistical information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in the specific format in which it is sought. It would require a disproportionate amount of Garda time and effort to compile specially which, as the Deputy will appreciate, would not be justified in circumstances where there are continuing demands on Garda resources. However, I refer the Deputy to the annual reports of an Garda Síochána which have been lodged in the Oireachtas Library, the most recent of which is in respect of the year ended 31 December 2000. The reports contain comprehensive statistics on drugs offences and related matters, including statistics in relation to offences where proceedings were commenced by division and drug type.</P>

    <P>All gardaí have a responsibility, <i>inter alia</i>, to deal with traffic matters as they arise. I am also informed by the Garda authorities that personnel strength of the traffic department, Dublin Castle, inclusive of the carriage office, is 12 members. The road transport office and the cash escort unit have a strength of three members and nine members, respectively. This excludes the chief superintendent and superintendent. In addition, 121 newly attested gardaí are due to be detailed for traffic duty on the 29 November 2002 for the forthcoming Christmas period.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware certain bodily samples can be taken for the purpose of forensic testing from persons suspected of certain criminal offences in lawful detention in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990. The consent of the person concerned is required for the taking of blood and certain other intimate bodily samples. However, section 3 of the Act also provides that a court may draw such inferences from a refusal to supply a sample as appear proper and the refusal may be capable of amounting to corroboration of any evidence in relation to which the refusal is material. I have no proposals to change the law in this respect.</P>

One such circumstance is where the applicant &ldquo;is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of the 28th day of July, 1951, and the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees of the 31st day of January, 1967, or is a Stateless person within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons of the 28th day of September 1954&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A person who has refugee status and who is married to a person who is an Irish citizen otherwise than by naturalisation or by honorary citizenship, may lodge a declaration accepting Irish citizenship as post-nuptial citizenship, provided that the marriage is subsisting at the date of lodgement of the declaration and the couple are living together as husband and wife and the spouse who is an Irish citizen submits an affidavit to that effect.</P>
      <P>Records in my Department are not maintained in such a way that would readily disclose the current number of refugee applications on hand. It would involve a disproportionate use of staff resources to prepare such an analysis as each application is examined in chronological order and refugee applications are not separated from other applications.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the serious position disclosed by the Ombudsman in his reports on unauthorised development and of the expectations that Part VIII of the Planning and Development Act, 2002, would assist in restoration of planning enforcement, the steps his Department has taken to monitor the operation of the new provisions; if sufficient resources are being allocated to this by planning authorities; the reason his Department has still not issued guidelines to planning authorities on Part VIII; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Strong and visible enforcement is critical to ensuring that the planning control system works properly and for the benefit of the whole community. A key objective of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 was to bring forward strengthened provisions in relation to planning enforcement. These new provisions came into force on 11 March 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes in the 2000 Act which encourage increased enforcement and more compliance by developers include a new streamlined enforcement procedure. Fines under the Act have also been greatly increased and planning authorities will retain the income from such fines. Planning <Col N="274" /> authorities will also be able to recoup their expenses when they prosecute a case. In addition, an application for permission to retain unauthorised development will no longer be a defence to an enforcement action or be a reason for staying a criminal prosecution. Increased penal fees for applications for such retention permission will act as a significant deterrent to developers from undertaking unauthorised development. The Planning and Development Act, 2000 also enables a planning authority to refuse to grant permission to a developer who has not complied with previous permissions, subject to the consent of the High Court. As these provisions are clear and comprehensive, my Department does not intend to publish special guidelines in this area.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned to ensure adequate staffing levels for local authority planning departments. Numerous requests from planning authorities for sanction for additional planning posts, both professional planners and administrative staff, have been approved. Staffing of local authority planning departments has almost doubled over the last four years from 660 in June 1998 to 1276 in July 2002 and has involved significant recruitment of planners from abroad. I am confident therefore that the resources available to the planning system are increasing and will continue to increase over the next number of years as a significantly expanded number of graduate planners becomes available from the educational institutions.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman's report acknowledged that these changes were being made, and stated his intention to monitor the area closely. I also intend to keep the performance by planning authorities in this area under review.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of my Department have recently met with representatives of the Irish Seal Sanctuary in relation to this matter. I have previously acknowledged the excellent work which has been done by the Irish Seal Sanctuary over the years in rehabilitating small numbers of seals. However, <Col N="275" /> given the limited resources available to my Department for wildlife conservation and protection, grant assistance in this area must realistically be targeted at projects which will maximise conservation prospects. Given the abundant population of seals in Irish waters and that their species is not endangered in conservation terms, I regret that funding of the Irish Seal Sanctuary facility by my Department cannot be justified at this time.</P>

      <P>Both the national spatial strategy and the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area are of relevance to Drogheda. The national spatial strategy, which is being finalised, will have a strong focus on policies which will help every region to realise its potential and participate in a more balanced way in the country's continuing economic and social development. Drogheda has considerable potential given its scale, its established enterprise base, its strategic position on the Dublin-Belfast corridor and its communications and business links with the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The greater Dublin area comprises the Dublin and mid-east regions, including County Meath. The main purpose of the greater Dublin area strategic planning guidelines was to put in place a broad planning framework to guide the future development of the area.</P>
      <P>The national spatial strategy will be implemented with the support of regional authorities, starting with the preparation and adoption of regional planning guidelines in accordance with the provisions of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. In the case of the greater Dublin area, a review of the current strategic planning guidelines will be required to take account of the provisions of the national spatial strategy. In that review there will be a need to consider Drogheda's relationship with its catchment, its role within the Border region and its role in the spatial development of the greater Dublin area having regard to the town's close functional and physical links with the area.</P>

      <P>EC Regulation 2037/2000 provides for the control of ozone depleting substances (ODS) within the EU, and the regulation is directly enforceable and binding in Ireland on all persons involved in production, importation, exportation, placing on the market, use, recovery, recycling, reclamation and destruction of controlled substances defined under the regulation. I am considering national provisions for a compliance regime, including appropriate sanctions for non-compliance with the regulation.</P>
      <P>Specifically where fridges and freezers are concerned, this regulation together with European Commission Decision 2000/532/EC &ndash; which revised the EU list of hazardous waste &ndash; affects the disposal of such fridges and freezers manufactured before 1994 which contain CFCs in insulating foam as well as in fridge coolant. While technology is available in Ireland for the removal of CFCs from the coolants, no equipment is available yet for the removal of the insulating foam. Accordingly, since 1 January fridges and freezers cannot be dealt with by the traditional method of degassing, recovering the metal and sending the remaining waste to landfill.</P>
      <P>I understand that, in the absence of treatment facilities in Ireland &ndash; a problem also being experienced in other EU member states &ndash; a number of local authorities have made arrangements for the storage of fridges and freezers or for their export to appropriate European recovery facilities. Such arrangements may involve co-operation with private waste companies.</P>
      <P>In the interests of a longer term solution and within the co-operative framework of the North-South Ministerial Council, my Department has developed an all-island approach to this issue in co-operation with the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland. Tenders were sought in September 2002 on behalf of all local authorities on the island for the provision of a service for the management of waste fridges and freezers. These tenders are being considered with a view to the provision of such a service as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>In 2000, which is the most recent year for which complete data are available, emissions for the full basket of greenhouse gases as reported by the EPA to the United Nations framework convention secretariat and to the European Commission were 67 million tonnes (Mt) CO2 equivalent, of which CO2 was 43.9 Mt CO2. On the basis of the Central Statistics <Col N="278" /> Office estimate of population for 2000 of 3,786,900 persons, the annual emissions in 2000 of CO2 equivalent per person were 17.7 tonnes and of CO2 were 11.6 tonnes.</P>
      <P>The Government's national climate change strategy, published in November 2000, sets a ten year framework for achieving the necessary greenhouse gas emissions reductions to ensure that Ireland complies with the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that full implementation of the national climate change strategy over the remainder of the decade, together with any additional measures which may be identified in periodic review of the strategy, will ensure that our Kyoto obligations are fully met by the 2008 to 2012 period.

      <P>Regional and local waste management plans provide for the introduction in urban areas of source segregation and separate collection of household waste. The roll-out of segregated and separate collection services is contingent in large part on the availability of materials recovery facilities, where dry recyclables are sorted and aggregated for delivery to reprocessing outlets, and biological treatment facilities for organic waste. In addition, recycling by householders is facilitated by the steady expansion by local authorities of bring banks and civic amenity sites which accept a wide range of recyclable waste streams.</P>
      <P>A capital grant scheme for waste management infrastructure was launched on 12 March 2002, with a closing date for receipt of the first round of applications on 31 May 2002. This scheme will primarily support the provision of &ldquo;high in waste hierarchy&rdquo; waste recovery infrastructure, which is provided for or consistent with the objectives of local authority waste management plans. Eligible infrastructure includes civic amenity sties and other &ldquo;bring&rdquo; facilities, transfer stations and materials recovery and biological treatment facilities.</P>
      <P>On 7 November 2002, I announced the allocation of &euro;15 million in grant assistance towards the provision of recycling infrastructure. This first round of allocations will support the development of bring banks, civic amenity centres, composting facilities and the expansion of an existing materials recovery facility.</P>

      <P>A number of local authorities already apply systems of differential waste charges which, in effect, incentivise the diversion of household waste to home composting and local &ldquo;bring&rdquo; facilities.</P>
      <P>Government waste policy recognises that, as a matter of equity and to directly incentivise waste prevention/minimisation and recycling, the level of waste charges imposed on households and businesses, either directly or through gate fees, should be based on usage. Accordingly, the Government expects that all local authorities will move towards introducing weight/volume-related charging to the fullest extent possible within three years.</P>
      <P>Research is under way on the effects of weight-based charges for solid waste disposal as part of the EPA environmental research, technological development and innovation programme for 2000 to 2006. The outputs from this research project should add significantly to available information on the subject and assist assessment of the potential impact of use-related charges on waste management practice. This research study is scheduled to conclude in 2003.</P>

      <P>Proposed amendments to this effect were tabled during the Oireachtas passage of the relevant Bill, but have not been embodied in the Local Government Act, 2001. However, Parts 6 and 7 together with Schedule 10 of that Act have recently updated the law on local authority meetings, committees and related matters. Under these provisions, which came into operation on 17 July 2002, the public has for the first time in law the right of attendance at local authority meetings and com<Col N="281" /> mittee meetings. The Act also provides a right of attendance for representatives of the media and applies stricter conditions than before to the circumstances in which a local authority may meet in private.</P>
      <P>Local authorities must display a public notice of a meeting at their main offices. The notice must include the agenda for the meeting or state where it may be inspected. Additionally, local authorities may by resolution or standing orders arrange for the display of such notice at other suitable locations. Local authorities must supply copies of the notice of the meeting and agenda to any person upon request and may also arrange for the supply of copies to the media. Under the new meetings code each local authority had to make standing orders in accordance with the Act to come into operation concurrently with the relevant provisions on 17 July. Subject to the provisions of the Act, standing orders are a matter for decision by the elected council.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals to alter these provisions. They will, however, be kept under review in the light of the operation of the new arrangements and ongoing developments.</P>

      <P>I am informed by Waterways Ireland that it is committed to the development of the waterway network both as a visitor and tourism attraction and as a resource and amenity for the communities living along its corridor. A number of programmes are being implemented on the Grand Canal waterway including the development of facilities and amenities such as fishing stands, jetties and landscaping. A fish-stocking programme has been undertaken on behalf of the body by the Central Fisheries Board. A schools education programme was run in conjunction with the Offaly and Kildare Partnership. In addition there have been other maintenance, remedial and cleaning programmes.</P>

      <P>The National Advisory Committee on Drugs, NACD, for which my Department has responsibility, was established in July 2000 to advise the Government on the prevalence, prevention, treatment and consequences of problem drug use in Ireland, based on the Committee's <Col N="286" /> analysis and interpretation of research findings and information available to it. The NACD is overseeing the delivery of a three year prioritised programme of research and evaluation on the extent, nature, causes and effects of drug misuse in Ireland, a copy of which follows.</P>
      <P>The membership of the NACD reflects statutory, community, voluntary, academic and research interests as well as representation from the relevant Government Departments.</P>
      <P>The NACD's first report, Drug Use Prevention: An Overview of Research, was published last December and a further report, An overview of the effectiveness of Buprenorphine as a form of treatment for Opiate Addiction, was launched in late October.</P>
      <P>Currently, the NACD is progressing over 30 research projects, which are at various stages of development. Among the main projects currently under way are: a study to estimate the prevalence of opiate drug use in Ireland; and a longitudinal study on the effectiveness of methadone treatment and other interventions in relation to opiate dependence. It is expected the study on prevalence will be completed by the end of 2002 while the longitudinal study will take a number of years to complete.</P>
      <P>In addition, the drug misuse research division of the Health Research Board, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children, also carries out research in this area. Some of the main research areas include: drug use among prisoners; public knowledge, attitudes and belief on drug misuse; drug use in rural Ireland; and trends in drug misuse among individuals in treatment.</P>

      <P>However I met representatives of the Law Society at their request on 9 October 2002. The purpose of the meeting was to enable the Law Society to make a detailed presentation of the society's report of July 2002 on charity law reform. The Law Society's report on charity law is a welcome contribution to the process of reforming this important body of legislation and the issues raised and recommendations contained in the society's report will be considered in that context.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity sets out the Government's commitment to ensuring the introduction of comprehensive legislation on regulation of charities and charitable fundraising. The work of reviewing the legislation, which is currently under way in my Department, will be accompanied by a broad public consultation on the appropriate regulatory framework and the nature and extent of the legislative reform required.</P>
      <P>I also discussed the Official Languages (Equality) Bill 2002 at various fora and with a number of groups, including Conradh na Gaeilge. Conradh na Gaeilge was the only group to seek a meeting specifically about this subject.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>her views on whether it is fair that a family already in receipt of family income supplement and who subsequently suffer a substantial drop in income cannot have their FIS payments reviewed or increased due to the fact that they are already receiving a lower payment under the scheme than they are now entitled to; and if she will make the necessary adjustments to social welfare regulations to amend this anomaly.</Quest>
      <QRef>[21151/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The family income supplement, FIS, scheme is designed to provide an incentive for low paid workers with families to take up or remain in full-time employment. An integral feature of the scheme is that, once the level of the FIS payment is determined, it continues to be <Col N="293" /> payable at that level for a period of 52 weeks, provided the claimant remains in employment. The only circumstances in which the rate of payment can be amended is where an additional child is born in the course of the 52 weeks.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this measure, which is unique to the FIS scheme, is to ensure that claimants can be certain they will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period, regardless of any change in circumstances. This certainty is critical to the success of the scheme in providing an incentive to families to avail of employment opportunities. It is recognised that, as a consequence of this measure, there is no provision to adjust the level of FIS payable upwards to compensate for any reduction in income that may occur in the course of the 52 week period. Conversely, where earnings rise in the course of that period, there is no provision to reduce the amount of FIS payable. After the 52 week period has expired, the rate of FIS payable may be adjusted if warranted by changed circumstances. Any change in the existing arrangements would require legislative change, and given the nature and purpose of the FIS scheme, I am not convinced that such a change would be appropriate.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of reduced rate disability allowance since July 1999.</P>
      <P>Under the legislative provisions that apply to disability allowance all income which the claimant or spouse or partner have is assessable for means purposes. The means assessment takes account of a spouse's net earnings and an income disregard of &euro;88.88 is deducted, half the balance being assessed as means.</P>
      <P>Following a review, the means, of the person concerned, deriving from her spouse's income from employment, were assessed at &euro;109.73 per week. Accordingly, with effect from 13 November 2002 her rate of disability allowance payment will be reduced from &euro;72.80 to &euro;11.30 per week plus free fuel allowance of &euro;9 per week. She has recently been notified of this decision and the reasons for it. An appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office has been opened on her behalf.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Mary Coughlan Mary Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The back to work allowance scheme is designed to encourage long-term unemployed people, lone parents, and other social welfare recipients to return to work by allowing them to retain part of their social welfare payment when they take up employment or self-employment.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the scheme a person must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for 15 months, or if taking up self-employment or aged over 50 years, 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the claimant does not satisfy the 12-15 month condition payment may be awarded if he or she had 24 months unemployment in the previous 36 months. In May 2000 an enhanced version of this scheme was introduced, specifically targeted at persons who had been five years or more on the live register. This programme applies only to persons taking up employment and not to <Col N="295" /> persons in self-employment. Persons participating in this scheme avail of a compulsory six week training period either on or off the job and during this period receive a top-up of &euro;44.50 a week in addition to their weekly social welfare payment. When they take up employment they are paid a bonus of &euro;254 and a further payment of &euro;254 after they have completed six months work.</P>
    <P>When an applicant for this scheme has been employed for a brief period(s) within the previous five years, he or she may qualify for payment if there was at least five years unemployment in the previous seven years.</P>
    <P>The special programme for the long-term unemployed was introduced to meet a particular need which had been identified at the time, usually the difficulty for people out of work for a long period in accessing paid employment is the need for a high level of personal support to make them ready for return to the workforce. There are no plans at present to extend the arrangement to people engaging in self-employment.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that a cap of ?317 per week is in place for applicants for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance which has not been changed for the past seven years; if she will ensure this is significantly increased in the forthcoming budget; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards in parallel with the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. It is subject to a means test. Details of the 2002 qualifying income levels, which vary depending on the composition of the household, are shown in the following tabular statement.  </P>
      <P>The income limits for the allowance are based on social welfare payments plus an additional income disregard of &euro;50. The income limits are automatically raised each year in line with the budgetary increases in the relevant social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>In 2002 there was a significant increase in the scheme's income limits when, in addition to the usual budgetary increase in the relevant social welfare payments, the additional income disregard was increased from £5, &euro;6.35, to its current level of &euro;50.</P>
      <P>The income limit to which the Deputy refers is part of the special arrangements in place which allow people on employment schemes, such as back to work allowance, to retain their entitlement to secondary benefits including back to school clothing and footwear allowance. These arrangements were introduced to encourage people to take up places on the employment schemes and to remove the anomaly whereby some people lost entitlement to secondary benefits when they took up places on these schemes.</P>
      <P>A person participating on an employment scheme may qualify for payment of a back to school clothing and footwear allowance provided his or her weekly income is below a limit of &euro;317.43. Alternatively, if his/her weekly income exceeds this amount, he or she may qualify under the income limits of the back to school clothing and footwear scheme itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of the back to school clothing and footwear scheme, which is part of my Department's series of programme reviews is nearing completion. The review examined all aspects of the scheme including the rates of payment as well the income limits, the means test, time of payment, the eligibility criteria and other issues. I expect to receive the group's report early in the <Col N="297" /> new year at which time consideration can be given to making any changes in the operation of next year's scheme.</P>

      <P>The person concerned, whose claim for unemployment benefit was disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that she was not available for or genuinely seeking work, appealed this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office and an appeals officer upheld the deciding officer's decision. The appeals officer's decision issued to the person concerned on 23 October 2002. An appeals officer's decision is final in the absence of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in such decisions.</P>

      <P>The award of an exceptional needs payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is a matter for the local health board which administers the scheme. The SouthEastern Health Board has advised that the person concerned, who is attending a special sign language course, qualifies for a grant from the Department of Education and Science to cater for travel and accommodation costs incurred by those participating on the course and that in those circumstances, an exceptional needs payment would not be warranted.</P>

      <P>I held the annual Social and Family Affairs Pre-Budget Forum in October which was attended by 25 groups representing the welfare interests of a wide variety of people, including the elderly, people with disabilities, widows and widowers, lone parents, unemployed people, carers, family support groups and women in the home. The groups presented a wide range of social welfare and other proposals for consideration in the context of the 2003 budget. The social welfare proposals will be examined in detail by my Department and any necessary amendments to the legislation will be made where proposals are accepted and included in the forthcoming budget.</P>
      <P>The Pensions (Amendment) Act, 2002 was enacted in April this year. In the course of the drafting of this legislation and its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas, there was considerable consultation with all relevant parties including the social partners, those in the pensions industry and the Pensions Board. This approach was adopted and proved very useful due to the technical nature of the provisions. Many comments were received on the Bill, as published, from a large group of representative groups and from individuals. These were all examined in detail by my Department and amendments to the legislation was made, where considered appropriate. No comments were received from public relations firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the introduction of a modern civil registration service, the registration of births, deaths, marriages, a consultation document entitled Bringing Civil Registration into the 21st Century was published. This document sets out the context and proposed future approach to civil registration and related services. The responses <Col N="299" /> to the consultation document together with issues raised during meetings held with appropriate representative bodies and organisations will be considered in the course of the drafting of the civil registration Bill.</P>

      <P>The number of beneficiaries receiving their payments by means of electronic fund transfer, EFT, stands at 360,000. The EFT payment frequency is aligned with other payment methods in the case of child benefit, 154,000, and also in the case of beneficiaries receiving payments under a variety of schemes which are short-term in nature, 94,000. In the case of beneficiaries receiving pensions and similar payments of a long-term nature the EFT payment to some 92,000 is made two weeks in arrears and in the case of the remaining 20,000 it is one week in arrears. When payment by EFT was introduced <Col N="300" /> for long-term payments in 1993, payment was made four week in arrears.</P>
      <P>I intend to make further progress on aligning the payment frequency in these cases during 2003.</P>
