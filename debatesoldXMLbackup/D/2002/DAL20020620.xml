      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 on an important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, namely the latest evidence of how British Crown Forces planned and organised the murder of Belfast solicitor, Pat Finucane, attempted to thwart the Stevens inquiry, and were involved in widespread institutionalised collusion with loyalist paramilitaries.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Tánaiste will have read this morning the criticism of the Institute of Engineers in Ireland of the transition year programme in schools saying that it leads to a reduction in standards in the leaving certificate and an erosion of our capacity to develop the scientific basis of the economy. Does she agree that there is growing evidence, of which this is more, of the need for a radical overhaul in our education policy in view of the fact that the system is failing many young people? Almost 1,000 children fail to enter secondary school at all, one in six leave without an adequate level of literacy for the modern economy, and 20% of the cohort of children do not sit the leaving certificate. Would the Tánaiste agree that An Agreed Programme for Government fails to consider the radical restructuring of education policy that is needed to address this matter? Will she take on board the need for radical reform?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the value of transition year, will the Tánaiste agree that for the vast majority of young people in second level education it is a unique opportunity to explore options and develop their overall maturity as distinct from a narrow application of academic excellence or study, that part of the problem is that too many young people are under pressure to select a course which they subsequently find to be unsuitable in whatever third level college they attend, and that we have a very high and undocumented drop-out level of students in the first year of third level education because of a combination of academic and financial, especially accommodation, pressures? Could she indicate whether the Department of Education and Science and the Government intend to review the matter of <Col N="775" /> people dropping out of third level education on the one hand and, on the other, their failure to get the necessary qualifications in the first instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not read the article in this morning's paper containing the comments of the Institute of Engineers, but I share the views expressed by both Deputies that we need constantly to examine our education system to ensure it is equipping our young people with the skills required not just for the world of work but for their own personal development. I share Deputy Quinn's view that young people are under enormous pressure to secure a place in third level education. A good education is a passport to a good job and good prospects.</P>
      <P>Our education system remains one of the main attractions for investment to take place here. It is rated either first or second by most investors as the reason they chose Ireland. There is much emphasis on this in the programme for Government and a number of reforms were made in recent years. We must continue to customise our education system to make sure it meets our needs, particularly those of young people who drop out of the formal system at a very early stage. The new Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, proved to be a reforming Minister in the Department of the Environment and Local Government and I believe he will apply the same reforming zeal&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste is perpetuating this self-congratulatory approach to our education system when the reality is that one in six children leave school without an adequate level of literacy. Will she agree we have what might be described as a dinosaur in the Department of Education and Science in that it is highly centralised, it stifles innovation and is not properly geared to the needs of a modern and scientific community? Will she agree we need to institute serious reform in the Department, which is not in any way reflected in the timid programme for Government her party and colleagues in Government offered the people for the next five years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that. Ireland has a much higher participation of those under the age of 35 in third level education than is the norm in the OECD. There has been an enormous change in recent years. I accept that too many people are leaving education early. Perhaps economic success has acted as an attraction for people to take what is unfortunately a short-term option of going into the world of work at a very early age and not acquiring a skill. Everything we are doing in lifelong learning, training and education <Col N="776" /> is very much geared towards encouraging people to continue to participate in formal education and in some of the training schemes that have been customised to the needs of the disadvantaged in particular. I agree we cannot take our eye off the ball in relation to these matters. Education is important. We have terrific schools and teachers and we need to do more as a society to encourage young people to stay in education. We need to encourage families in that regard. In communities where there is no culture of education perhaps we need to do an awful lot more to promote the benefits of continuing in education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night the country watched the &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; programme, which was very disturbing in the footage it presented and the revelations it put on the screen, some of which had been referred to previously but which were brought forward in a stark manner. Will the Tánaiste agree that in the murder of the solicitor Pat Finucane there is now substantial <i>prima facie</i> evidence of collusion between the security forces and loyalist paramilitaries? Will she agree, notwithstanding the appointment of the retired Canadian judge, Mr. Peter Cory, to investigate a number of such murders, in respect specifically of the Pat Finucane murder there is now no longer need for delay and the authorities should move to immediately establish a full and comprehensive inquiry into his murder? Will she, on behalf of the Irish people, take this matter up through the Irish Government with the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Quinn in expressing concern at the extremely disturbing evidence that there may have been collusion, leading to the death of the solicitor Pat Finucane. Will the Tánaiste indicate to the House what commitments the Government received from the British Government that the review being conducted by the Canadian judge will result in an inquiry if, as is now very clear, <i>prima facie</i> evidence is in place that an inquiry is warranted? Has the Government received commitments that this will occur? Will the Government have access to the findings of that preliminary review in order that a proper and balanced judgment can be taken that is fair to all communities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the views expressed by Deputies Quinn and Bruton. It has been the view of the Government for some considerable time that there should be a public inquiry. The allegations that formed the basis of the programme last night were submitted to the Government in a file given by members of the family in 1999. At that time the Government called for a public inquiry. What was agreed at Weston Park was that a judge of international standing would be appointed to examine this and other cases. The Taoiseach met Judge Cory on 11 June. The judge intends as a matter of urgency to deal first with the Finucane case. Both Governments are committed to having a public inquiry, if that is what <Col N="777" /> the judge recommends. It remains the position of the Irish Government that there exists a case for a public inquiry in relation to the circumstances surrounding the death of Pat Finucane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Tánaiste said, but in light of what has been put into the public domain in a comprehensive way and will be followed up no doubt by the second part of the programme on Sunday, will she raise with the relevant authorities in Britain that Judge Cory, as a matter of priority, should examine the Finucane case following which he must surely come to the conclusion that a public inquiry is necessary? If we are to maintain trust, faith and belief in the peace process and the security system both sides of the Border, it is absolutely essential that such an inquiry proceed as quickly as possible. Will the Tánaiste give an undertaking that the Government will raise this matter with the British Government and Judge Cory to prioritise his investigation into the Finucane case and make a recommendation leading to a public inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach raised with Judge Cory when he met him last Tuesday, 11 June, the need to deal with this case as a matter of priority, and I understand that will happen. It is important that it happens. The allegations contained in the programme were the basis on which the file given to the Government was passed on. That is why since then the Government has called for a public inquiry. It is important that we should have one, but we must await the publication of the Stevens report and the outcome of the deliberations of Judge Cory. I hope that will happen very quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the useless Bill put forward yesterday by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and pronouncements by the Minister for Health and Children of concern about alcohol use, does the Government propose to introduce legislation to limit or regulate the advertising of alcohol, in particular in relation to sport? </P>
      <P>Will a Supplementary Estimate be introduced at some stage to cover the high cost of the contingency plan where supervision and substitution are involved in second level schools?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the second matter, no legislation is planned. In relation to the abuse of alcohol, the Minister for Health and Children and others have expressed their about this matter for some time. It is one the Government intends to examine, but we have not made a decision in relation to specific measures. Substance abuse generally and particularly the abuse of alcohol in our society by young and old is something that must concern us all. In addition to what it does to public health, it places enormous financial and other pressures on our health system and causes <Col N="778" /> major problems for families in our community, as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said yesterday. These matters will be examined, but no commitments have yet been made on the matters raised by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Government will publish legislation next week to deal with a second referendum on the Nice treaty. Is it the Government's intention when the Dáil resumes in September to take, in conjunction with this legislation, the European Union Bill, passed on Second Stage in the previous Oireachtas and which was recommitted to the Order Paper as it deals with some of the concerns about the democratic deficit expressed during the campaign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Deputy is right. The Government will publish the Referendum Bill next week to provide for the enlargement of the European Union. In agreement with the parties in the House, that debate will not take place until September when the Dáil will be recalled early for that purpose. I do not think it was the intention to take the Bill to which the Deputy referred, but I am sure that can be discussed between the Government Whip and the party Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>My question relates to the programme for legislation. I ask the Ceann Comhairle to understand that it is difficult for the Green Party, Sinn Féin and the Independents to remain in order when one of the few opportunities we have to contribute is on the legislation programme. However, we do not have a new legislative programme as yet. At this point we are looking at legislation which may be promised. Will the Tánaiste ensure we have an early or interim legislative programme that might make it clear on the Order of Business what it is we are asking to be published? There is no consensus as to how the House does its business because the larger parties have not ensured that the smaller parties can be facilitated. It is important that the Oireachtas be given the respect to which it is entitled.</P>

      <P>Will the Tánaiste inform us about the completion of the legislative programme that arises from the Good Friday Agreement? Recently, a monitoring committee in Geneva in relation to human rights rejected Ireland's suggestion that it could not make social and economic rights justiciable. It had made a previous conclusion in 1999. In view of the Good Friday Agreement and the British legislation in relation to rights and its commitment, is it the intention of the Government to bring forward human rights legislation that will ensure the same level of human rights across the same spectrum will be available to all citizens in all parts of the island? When will such legislation be introduced?</P>

An indication was given that legislation might be introduced on an emergency basis to prevent protected tenants from being evicted during the summer when their protection runs out.

      <P>Crime has emerged as a major issue for the electorate. The view is that the quality of life is seen to be threatened by public disorder and anti-social behaviour, generally by gangs. It is threatened also by under-age drinking, vandalism and lawlessness and by unprovoked attacks. A situation has developed where parents are afraid to let their children go to town at night for an evening's entertainment. In some areas elderly people are afraid to go to Saturday evening mass for fear of attack. In some parts of the city, and elsewhere in the country, our green areas and parks have become no-go areas. We need to tackle this, restore community life to the way it was and allow citizens go about their normal business without fear of attack.</P>
      <P>Many changes have taken place in Irish society as a result of our substantial economic growth. Young people are more affluent and some are consuming more alcohol than they should. This has resulted in the disorder we have witnessed on our streets and which this Bill seeks to address. There is a new aggression in society as well, as other Members have mentioned. There is a problem with senseless, unprovoked attacks, particularly against young men. It is a worry and it affects all classes in society, not just areas of disadvantage. On the contrary, it seems to be affluent young men who engage in such unprovoked attacks. It is they, too, who are at the receiving end of these appalling crimes.</P>
      <P>There is a new lack of respect for members of the Garda Síochána. That issue must be addressed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It should not be tolerated. If the gardaí have a constitutional role in upholding law and order, they must be respected in their role. The training which gardaí receive should deal with that new situation. In particular, young gardaí should not let themselves be abused or attacked. They have an important role to play. We must restore respect for members of the Garda Síochána, given its important role in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many communities there are no alternative venues to the pub. They do not have a community centre or youth club premises which could provide alternative entertainment for young people. The Government will have to address this through its various programmes. There are sev<Col N="782" /> eral programmes in place but facilities must also be put in place to encourage community and youth activity generally.</P>
    <P>Finally, we need to review the licensing laws. Opening hours were extended under legislation last year and this has caused problems, particularly late at night when young people are flooding onto the streets. We need to review and tweak the licensing laws in view of the difficult situation which has emerged with regard to public disorder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on this legislation. It is also necessary to make a statement about some aspects of the speeches that were made yesterday, which were not just of concern but were quite appalling in a number of respects. This legislation seems to be intended, and could be welcomed in that context, to address the issue of widespread concern about crime, particularly late night crime and crime that is associated with alcohol abuse. It is not just an election issue. Many people, particularly elderly people and young, unaccompanied people, are concerned at the disappearance of their right and ability to move from their homes to places of entertainment, places in which they might previously have been able to socialise without fear.</P>
      <P>I deplore the fact that so much fear exists at all levels of society and I support legislative efforts to address this issue. However, I cannot accept some of the assumptions in the Minister's speech and I oppose the thinking that was reflected in some of the speeches by Opposition Members yesterday. I spent about 24 years of my academic life lecturing in the area of the sociology of deviance and crime, in Ireland and abroad. In 1962, Albert Cohen published his book, <i>Deviance and Control</i>, in which he said there seemed to be more interest in control than in the understanding of deviance. Even though this was stated 40 years ago, the same fallacy surfaced again as late as yesterday. I feel strongly about this issue. The only construction in some of the speeches yesterday was that we should almost declare war on young people. We announce that we are going to escalate our side of the equation to deal with their behaviour on the other side without an examination of the behavioural sources and what is influencing the behaviour which is causing such problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want what I have said to be construed simply in the context of a dichotomy between hard or soft in relation to liberal issues. This society has lived with massive abuse by advertising and alcohol. Sweden, for example, took action to protect its children from the child abuse that forms of advertising directed at children constitute. The former president of the American Psychological Association took the unusual step some years ago of writing to members of the association asking them to consider their position on the ethical grounds that they were lending their skills to the abuse of children through advertising. There is evidence everywhere in the literature of the connection between the promotion of <Col N="783" /> alcohol and advertising. There was a hope that in the Swedish Government's Presidency of the European Union the children's side of this issue might be addressed but that opportunity was lost.</P>
    <P>This country, which is now to announce that it is going to war after dark, seems unwilling to look at the sources of its problem. I have mentioned one, the connection between advertising and alcohol. Another is the construction of great temples to the consumption of alcohol. There was a time when in many cities and towns, including Dublin, part of the character of a public house, be it in the public bar or the lounge, was the ability of the proprietor to know a certain proportion of the clients and to be in effective control. One cannot reconcile the thinking that said there is to be no limit on the number of pubs a person may own, no limit on the square footage that can be licensed and no control over or connection between ownership, management and effective control with trying to retain the behaviour of the small and intimate pub.</P>
    <P>Look at the example that is being given in this country from the top levels. There is an assumption that when dignitaries visit Ireland, be they presidents or prime ministers, their tongues are hanging out for a pint of beer and that we must assemble the cameras and press and take them to a pub. I have to be careful not to mention any particular establishment but some have been in the headlines more than others. Even when our heads of State visit cultures that are thousands of years old, they head for an Irish pub. That tells us something about the thinking that lies behind the behaviour which will produce legislation that purports to deal with young people. I mention this as background information. The Government claims to be dealing with the consequences of the connection between alcohol, misbehaviour and breaking the law, but it is not addressing the fact that a major alcohol abuse crisis is well under way. I have never seen so many young people who are vulnerable as a result of alcohol abuse and everything associated with it. This issue is not being dealt with.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Cabinet which introduced the Public Order Act, 1994, I wish to make clear a second reservation in relation to this Bill. I regret that we did not include greater protection of civil rights in the legislation at that time, as it has since been abused. I recall that it was specifically intended to deal with loutish behaviour, but, unfortunately, I could give several instances of the Act being invoked for little less than political reasons.</P>
    <P>If young people are to be interested in politics, they must feel they are entitled to object to the world's unaccountable corporate powers. I could list many corporations, such as Monsanto, which have bought power in several Administrations. They have been granted special meetings with the Commission and ensure topics are shifted from one area of the Commission to the other as they make their way to the World Trade Organisation. <Col N="784" /> The Taoiseach was lobbied as he travelled around New York on St. Patrick's Day. These issues have been well documented. Young people take to the streets to object to an unaccountable corporate power which is having detrimental economic, social and ecological effects on the planet.</P>
    <P>The 1994 Act was not intended to be abused in this manner. I ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in his Second Stage reply to tell the House whether there will be an investigation into the use of the 1994 Act. Will he strengthen this Bill to ensure it will not be abused beyond its express intent? If I were to perform a more subtle deconstruction of the Minister's opening speech, I would find it interesting that he saw fit to mention that the Bill &ldquo;deals with an area of great public concern to ordinary law-abiding people.&rdquo;  I am sure there are extraordinary law-abiding people, but moving on from the redundant use of language, I am more interested in the reference to &ldquo;those who may wish to socialise in the evening and late at night and those who wish to relax in the quiet enjoyment of their property.&rdquo;  There is no reference to the role of the family in the quiet enjoyment of property, which reflects in a curious way the shift in institutional emphasis.</P>

      <P>&mdash;for which I am grateful.</P>
      <P>I wish to mention a few other matters that are neglected in the Bill, such as the fact that it does not consider the temples to consumption known as superpubs. I am sure such establishments make it more difficult for Taoisigh who may wish to move from the public bar to the lounge more frequently and with less interruption. It must be difficult to deal with every floor of the superpub. Discussions on alcohol are marked by incredible hypocrisy. While I welcome the sections of the Bill that wish to increase the legal responsibility on owners of licensed premises, I have reservations about the manner in which the provisions may be implemented. The Bill will face immediate difficulties in the case of an offence occurring within 100 metres of three pubs adjacent to each other. How can one determine which publican should be held responsible? I could speak on such matters at length and may do so if the Bill progresses to Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other aspects of the Bill are similarly important. I wish to be positive about the crime problems we face, many of which are linked to economic factors. As late as ten years ago, people of all ages could be found during the day in communities in Dublin, provincial towns and rural <Col N="785" /> Ireland, but this is no longer possible. Couples have been conscripted to work, which involves leaving their homes early in the morning and returning late at night. Their children are moved around in search of child care, but provision is inadequate. One does not need to be a sociologist to know that if life is emptied from communities during the day, their survival will be placed at risk.</P>
    <P>Conclusions may also be drawn about the relationship between generations. I do not consider it strange to note that this is a terrible time for young people in Ireland. The number of male suicides is frighteningly high, for example. Those who talk to young people hear about the alienation and hopelessness to which they are condemned. The Government has allowed for the second lowest social provision in Europe. Teenagers and those in their twenties and thirties throughout Europe go alone, in pairs or in larger groups to skating rinks and similar venues not associated with alcohol. They may decide to drink coffee or beer. There is no such facility in this jurisdiction, although there is one in Belfast. Older legislators do not listen attentively to the requests of young people; they respond to their needs with ideas that reflect their own version of life. Young people write to me at election time asking for facilities associated with particular forms of recreation, such as skateboard parks or ice rinks. Such amenities are provided by civilised societies but not here.</P>

      <P>Why do we wonder that young people feel alienated and hopeless, given that this country seems to be committed to redistributing wealth to the rich by reducing the top rate of tax? Why is it a surprise that our communities are under stress? I call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to assure the House that the powers given to the Garda under the Bill will not be abused. One of his former colleagues on the Bench recently dealt with the case of a young man who had been approached by a garda while standing outside a hotel near the Spanish Arch in Galway. The garda asked him to move on and when he had not done so within a few minutes, the garda accused him of being disrespectful. He explained that he had argued with his girlfriend and was waiting for her to return, but he was arrested. He was threatened with a jail sentence when the case came before the courts. What kind of thinking does this demonstrate? When I examine certain queries from my constituents I am told that they gave cheek or were disrespectful. We live in a culture in which four letter words are often heard on radio and television and seen in the newspapers. If a young person uses such language and is considered by a garda to be disrespectful, he or she will fall under the remit of this new Bill. Are gardaí trained to exercise discretion in such situations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Minister for Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="786" /> Reform, Deputy McDowell, is consistent, at least. In his speech yesterday he claimed to be interested in the deterrent effect of the deferment of a custodial sentence:</P>
    <P>In this context, I acknowledge that punishment and sentencing are the functions of the judicial arm of the State. While we would not expect the Judiciary to regard imprisonment as a first resort for offenders who cause disorder while drunk, it may be that a judicious combination of immediate substantial fines, coupled with a deferment of the issue of custodial sentences could be part of an effective strategy to curb public order offences, especially in the case of first offenders.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister intend to introduce similar measures to deal with white collar crime? The programme for Government states the new Administration will seek to encourage corporate responsibility. The Labour Party is waiting for proof of this. The possibility that a first offender will be punished in this manner is outrageous and draconian. It does nothing to deal with social problems or provide the security demanded by those in communities.</P>
    <P>A number of unfortunate speeches were made yesterday. Who in 2002 wants to go down the road of issuing the gardaí with stun guns? Who thinks in regard to this problem that people should be arbitrarily thrown in for the night and when they sober up in the morning they will feel better? Young people are currently going through an unbelievable level of stress. Doctors say that in cases of male suicide, for example, where a young person dies, a whole network of friends and peers are affected by the event. Frequently, there is no counselling service available to enable these people to deal with a very traumatic event.</P>
    <P>To suggest that the Garda is at war with young people is an unbelievably disastrous strategy. I say to those Members of the Opposition who have been advocating the strategy that we will be known as the John Waynes of future Irish politics to think very carefully. The gardaí are called the Garda Síochána, the guardians of the peace. What about people? I agree with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that ordinary people are asking for the presence of gardaí. The issue is not the numbers of gardaí but their dispersal and management. People are asking for accountability from gardaí. They want a distinction drawn between an ordinary individual who is in trouble on a haphazard basis and someone who is a consistent offender. Not everyone is a lout. People want a distinction drawn between those who protest for whatever reason and those who are involved in anti-social behaviour of a totally destructive kind.</P>
    <P>There is another interesting point. I listened to Deputy Haughey who suggested there is a neat and simple equation between affluence and alcohol abuse. Believe it or not, there are many societies whose income increased and which did <Col N="787" /> not fall apart. They were able to celebrate forms of social solidarity and social relationships that were enriching and important. One of the most significant factors over the past ten years is the influence of peer groups. Young people are terrorising each other. Young people are taking norms of consumption derived from elsewhere and putting pressure on each other to follow a particular pattern of behaviour. Analysis of social patterns of drinking, for example, will indicate a significant difference. Twenty years ago the number of times people got drunk and were not capable of being in charge anymore occurred over a very long period. It was something that crept up on one. Now the emphasis is on getting out of one's head as fast as possible so as to be totally incoherent and spaced out.</P>
    <P>Everything in advertising supports this. The development of the drinks industry and the mixture of spirits with other forms of mixer, for example, is entirely new. No one in this House will ever make progress on the pressures on young people unless they are willing to tackle the alcohol industry, those who believe they have a right to own any size of pub for any kind of consumption and those who are making a fortune out of the child abuse that is advertising connected to alcohol and tobacco.</P>
    <P>The Minister places an obligation on those with premises that might possibly face a closure order to ensure order in the environs of their premises. It is one of the great changes in Ireland that one can no longer find such a pub. I look at young people outside clubs late at night and they are corralled like cattle. There is no control over the way in which bouncers behave. It is something which is not currently regulated. One can see people being pushed and shoved into lines and examined for permission to enter and pay over the rate for expensive drink. This is an indictment of Ireland. It is interesting that we have been hearing for five years that the Republic has the fastest growth rate in Europe and that it has performed miracles. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, cannot finish a sentence without getting excited at what he has done, yet we have produced the largest number of bouncers in Europe from a low rate and the worst queues in Europe.</P>
    <P>It will be wonderful if we get a reply from the Minister. I will be interested to hear his views on what is happening to a society for whom alcohol consumption is the only way of forgetting the kind of society in which people live. That is the description for young people, a deeply alienating society where there is little to encourage them. My hope is that these people will reject alcohol and that the next generation of politicians will demand facilities, provide skating rinks, music venues, etc, so that people can enjoy fulfilling lives without getting out of their heads and providing a fortune for multiple pub owners and people who want big temples to their own ignorance.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to welcome this Bill. For long months I have raised the issue of under-age drinking and the associated public order problems at the Committee on Health and Children and at parliamentary party meetings. I did this as it is such an important issue for the towns and villages in my constituency of Donegal North-East.</P>
      <P>This Bill is another step on the right road, but it will not be, as many have said, a panacea to all ills in society, nor is it intended to be. Alcohol related and public order offences top the agenda at most of our clinics and are uppermost in our minds and I wish the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform well in dealing with the wider implications of drink for our society. This is not a criticism of the Bill, but seeks to provide food for thought in terms of forthcoming legislation. Deputy O'Donoghue set up the committee on liquor licensing and the recommendations of the task force pointed to the key issue which is the number of Departments involved, including Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science, Finance, Arts, Sport and Tourism, Social and Family Affairs and the Environment and Local Government. I congratulate the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, for the expansion in the remit of the task force and for the fact that we have the interim report of May 2002. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must be proactive on the recommendations of the group and ensure interdepartmental development of what is possibly the largest single issue we face in these new years of the millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, when I sat down to put my thoughts on the issue of public order on paper, I almost felt like a spoilsport because our culture is so drink orientated that it is not trendy to denounce it. I wonder sometimes if we prefer the view of us from the days of poitín drinking and leprechauns, which was that of the Americans and others, or if we prefer the real view. I speak as someone who takes a drink, usually in moderation, yet I see what is going on particularly with our youth in terms of drinking. Ireland has, as Deputy Higgins said, the fastest growing economy in Europe and the prosperity that has yielded has reached into and become part of the lives of our youth. Their disposable incomes are manifested in the weekly show of prosperity on our streets. It is not all good news and the cost to our economy of the abuse of alcohol is reckoned to be in the region of &euro;2.4 billion, comprising &euro;279 million in health care costs, &euro;215 million in road accident costs, &euro;100 million in alcohol related crime, &euro;1,034 mill<Col N="789" /> ion on loss of output due to alcohol related absences from work, &euro;404 million in alcohol related transfer payments and &euro;234 million in taxes not received on lost output. It would be ironic if the social face of our prosperity, the importance of the pub, became implicated in the loss of our prosperity due to the costs which I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>During the recent election, I listened again to concerned parents who worry that their children are not coming home until 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. They are concerned that their children do not feel safe on the street as they make their way home from a night out, they bemoan the fact that the streets of rural areas are no longer safe and they feel harassed in their homes when their property is vandalised. The answer provided is always the easy one of suggesting the pubs be closed earlier, but is that really what should happen? Perhaps it is part of the solution. Too often in the blame game it is everyone else's fault, not our own. It is the fault of the child, the publican, the Garda, the parents or the teachers, even of society, but never ours. It is never something quantifiable. What is quantifiable is the scale of the problem facing us.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the children and their place in this issue of public order. According to the survey &ldquo;Health Behaviour in School Age Children&rdquo;, over half of young people begin experimenting with alcohol before they are 12, 20% of 12 to 14 year olds are drinkers and between the ages of 15 and 16 half of girls and two thirds of boys are drinkers. Some drink very large quantities of alcohol, engage in binge drinking and are frequently drunk. The peer pressure on our youth is immense. Nationally, our society celebrates success or consoles itself with alcohol, our reputation world wide still revolves around our drink culture and, despite its wonderful performance, the recent fortunes of the Irish soccer team provide a classic example. We celebrated with alcohol when we won and consoled ourselves when we lost. Our heroic ability to consume alcohol is what is admired around the world. Many young people are getting drink from a variety of sources, including pubs, off-licences, parents, relations, friends or from the cabinet at home. They drink in more and more public places as time goes on. They drink to excess and often become violent.</P>
    <P>There is no logic in the manner in which many young people drink in that they mix their drinks and have nasty reactions as a result, which translates into increases in assaults. There has been a steady increase in assaults and public order offences since 1995 and from 1996 to 2000 street violence offences increased by 97%. The Garda Commissioner highlighted the link between alcohol and the rise in street violence. In 2000 there were 62,000 instances of public order offences and 38,000 people were charged and 24,000 cautioned. It is awful that serious assaults increased in 2000 and the fact that most of them were alcohol related gives us pause for thought. Alcohol related offences might be committed by adults, <Col N="790" /> but there is concern that the intoxication in public among teenagers has increased by 370% since 1996. Much of this goes unseen due to the JLO system and I ask the Minister to look at that system in terms of the discretion of local gardaí. They have no discretion to intervene and recommend a prosecution of an individual and in many cases the really serious juvenile offender is laughing at the system when they are referred to JLO which they know is soft. JLO works extremely well for the soft criminal who just needs a good sharp shock, but I ask that the Minister look at it possibly to allow a local sergeant, inspector or superintendent to have some input into whether a person should be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>I hear people saying that young people have nothing else to do and they speak of the need for sports facilities, with which I agree in part, but I watch reality. I see the impact over the last few years of the national lottery moneys and the associated facilities which have been made available, but they are not utilised by those who would prefer to be in a back alley or on the shorefront with a six pack. Last week when the Irish team was going to play at 12.30 p.m. I was walking along the shore and trying to get back in time for the match while half a dozen young fellows were just arriving down with their six pack of cider, their Smirnoff Ice and their Hooch ready for their session. Even though there was something sporting on television and they all had access to sports viewing, they were not going to be there, they were going to be antisocially &ldquo;enjoying&rdquo; themselves. That is not to say that we cannot encourage more drop-in centres such as the one in Buncrana or the after-school and homework clubs operating in many towns, but the Minister should speak to his relevant colleague in relation to a national insurance scheme which must be created to address and overcome the problems for parks, playgrounds and skateboard facilities about which Deputy Higgins spoke.</P>
    <P>Young adults in the 18 to 24 year age group are the most directly affected by the issue of binge drinking. This and the younger age groups may live through the consequences of the less exciting part of alcohol consumption which is unwanted pregnancy. Of school going teenagers surveyed, 35% who were sexually active said that alcohol played a significant part in leading to them becoming so. Other problems include sexually transmitted infections, increasing disharmony in family relations, marriage break-ups, depression often leading to suicide, health problems such as sclerosis of the liver and various cancers, which like smoking related diseases make no impact on a young generation because they often take years to manifest themselves, accidents in the house and car accidents.</P>
    <P>I ask that the Minister, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, the Garda and local authorities discuss what is to be done with the burnt-out cars that are so prevalent around our countryside due to youngsters gaining access to old cars which have perhaps failed the <Col N="791" /> MOT and are joyridden before being abandoned and burnt out.</P>
    <P>When public order is raised with us as politicians, often the Garda gets the brunt of the blame, rightly or wrongly. The last Government increased the number of gardaí and there is a commitment to again increase their numbers significantly this term, which I welcome, but there needs to be an examination of how they are deployed. I disagree with Deputy Higgins about whether it is a numbers game. How can we have a visible Garda presence on our streets and towns if there are only one or two on duty at any time? Gardaí on the beat pick up information and are a visual deterrent to people who may think twice in the presence of authority, which goes back to my JLO argument. Some people will not be deterred by a garda &ndash; I was told of a recent incident where a person went up to a garda and took his cap &ndash; but others will be deterred from soft crime. However, I agree with speakers last night who raised the issue of many young people not having respect for authority, which means gardaí will be faced with very difficult problems on our streets unless they have the proper numbers and back-up facilities.</P>
    <P>Many young people do not have respect for authority. Therefore, gardaí are faced with difficulties on our streets, unless they are given adequate resources and supports. The number of gardaí on duty on my peninsula at weekends is in single figures. That may be okay for a rural location, but the Inishowen Peninsula is not such a location. It has a population of 30,000, which increases dramatically at weekends because it is a social outlet for Derry, capital of the north west. Given the advent of a ferry service across Lough Foyle recently, the peninsula's role as a suburb of the large urban centres in the north west is even more marked. I ask the new Minister to examine policing in County Donegal together with the Garda hierarchy and collate figures which take into account that 70 miles of east Donegal runs along the Border while 140 miles of west Donegal runs along the Atlantic Ocean with less than seven miles of the county bordering the Republic.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about public order because every week I receive an increasing number of complaints from individuals along the Border whose houses or businesses have been raided, often in smash and grab raids by gangs from the North. I commend the Garda's work in conjunction with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, which has resulted in arrests and the return of goods. However, I ask the Minister to examine the duty rosters of Garda stations in Inishowen at weekends and respond regarding how effective gardaí can be and how the community can feel safe given the current level of Garda support. The official reply to this question in the past is that per head of population Inishowen has more gardaí than it deserves, but the area is a suburb of many large urban centres and is not the rural backwater that some people think.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" />Public order problems are not unique to my constituency. There is a growing problem of drunken children taking over the streets and green areas of our towns. In the past 16 to 18 year olds engaged in under age drinking. Subsequently, 14 to 16 year olds became involved, but nowadays ten to 14 year olds are causing most grief as a result of drinking. A small percentage of our youth cause major problems for their peers, parents and the elderly. A number of gardaí believe parents do not care. When they pick up these juveniles for public order offences and take them home they are abused while the child is not chastised. This leads to the more important question of parental control and responsibility. When the Children Act, 2001, is fully implemented will it address the issue of reduced parental control which we are experiencing as a society?</P>
    <P>I am often asked whether a system should be implemented under which the Garda would be provided with sufficient paddywagons to pick up young offenders, bring them back to stations and hold them until their parents arrive to collect them. Gardaí believe many parents would not bother to do so, but a charge could be imposed to cover the cost of keeping these juveniles. Deputy Joe Higgins would be very irate at this concept. Many Garda stations are not big enough to hold numerous offenders. Perhaps the Minister could review the progress of the Garda station building programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins is correct, however, that research must be carried out to examine the problems underlying the reasons these children are drinking to excess in order that we do not resort to the easy solution, which is to lock them up and throw away the key or use stun guns. We are too used to adopting the easy solution. The Garda's frustrations are understandable when one considers the force does not have enough manpower, patrol cars or basic resources in stations and it often does not receive support from parents. A number of gardaí have been reported as saying they have no legislation to assist them to deal with young people causing public order difficulties, but that is not the case and resources will be put in place to implement the legislation fully.</P>
    <P>I am most concerned about this issue. I do not want to contribute to a debate on legislation and be party to putting more paper into a system if it is not workable. I, therefore, ask the Minister to ensure the necessary resources are put in place to ensure the legislation can be fully enacted in order that it will not be something to which we can point and say it is in place if only the Garda is prepared to implement it.</P>
    <P>Should parents be assisted to educate children about responsible drinking? I have spoken to a number of experts who deal with alcoholics and people involved with Alcoholics Anonymous and I am concerned to find that the average age of an alcoholic is reducing significantly. What used to be a phenomenon among 40 to 60 year olds has become a phenomenon among 25 to 35 year olds. This is a serious problem which must be tackled <Col N="793" /> on a cross-departmental basis. This issue is not solely the responsibility of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I commend the drinks industry on doing a great job. Guinness hijacked the Irish flag during the World Cup, but it is not an offence because the company used replicas. However, Guinness made the national flag part of its sales and advertising campaign which was wrong.</P>

      <P>Something should be done. It may not be possible to address defacing the flag through legislation, but the House must issue a strong message that this is unacceptable. We do not want the national flag to become a symbol for the drinks industry. Young children have been running around waving replica flags or with tricolours wrapped around them throughout the World Cup and drinks companies have tapped into this. Tennents is the official lager of the World Cup, but I do not know how the company achieved that title.</P>
      <P>The drinks industry is at the heart of the sponsorship of sports events. Drinks such as Bacardi Breezer and Smirnoff Ice, a mixture of spirits and soft drinks, have taken over from beer and wine in terms of the highest sales in Ireland. It is scary that young children who take up drinking start on spirits. Can we not find a way to encourage them to drink responsibly? The drinks industry does not enforce legislation regarding under age drinking, particularly in pubs and off-licences, and adults are knowingly served on behalf of children. While there is legislation in place, this issue must continue to be addressed. The onus of responsibility on publicans for serving under age drinkers was a good concept, but it is not being enforced rigorously. A good sharp shock in this regard could make people more responsible. As the Minister stated, the drinks industry has a significant role in society because it has a captive market, but it must become more responsible.</P>
      <P>No matter what the problem is in society, everybody says if another subject is added to the school curriculum, it will be solved by teachers. Communities must come together because they comprise people from different backgrounds and we all have something to offer in terms of a solution. There should be more collective responsibility. I look forward to the expansion of the CCTV system.</P>
      <P>Why can public houses remain open all night in other countries? Why do their residents drink responsibly? Why can many of our citizens not handle drink? The task force on alcohol stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alcohol abuse is a significant risk factor in suicide and compounds the other factors in suicide.Research in an Irish general hospital reported that 30 per cent of all male patients and 8 per cent of female patients were identified as having underlying alcohol abuse or dependency problems. However, many of these cases were not detected by the admitting medical team. The study highlights the deficiencies <Col N="794" /> and the under recording of alcohol-related problems in the hospital setting.</P>
    <P>That is a serious problem and more research needs to be carried out. If the problem cannot be identified, we need to draw on the experiences of other countries. Other countries are not in the same position, even though the pubs may have longer opening hours.</P>
    <P>I will conclude on what is perhaps a negative point because I worry about what the future will hold for the 21% of our children who are under 15 years of age. In the period 1989 to 1999, there was a 41% increase in the <i>per capita</i> amount of alcohol consumption whereas there has been a decline in consumption in most of Europe. We have a serious problem. We need to take enforcement very seriously. The task force report contains a review of the policy effectiveness of solutions to alcohol-related issues and I ask the Minister to consider that review.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well as he begins his term of office. I hope my attitude does not seem too negative but I believe it is such a big issue that we must take an all-party approach and do everything possible to enact workable legislation and introduce other support mechanisms for people who obviously have a problem with alcohol. We must support parents and children to help them overcome the difficulties they are facing in every community at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the new Minister every success. I am sure he will perform very well and I note that he is expected to be a &ldquo;super&rdquo; Minister. He has a difficult job to do and it is certainly not getting any easier.</P>
      <P>I am not confident that this Bill will solve the problems but parts of the Bill are necessary. I am proud to have been a Pioneer all my life but like most of my colleagues I spend a lot of my time in public houses. I have always believed that the less restriction there is on the availability of alcohol the better, although I acknowledge that this is an unusual stance for someone with my background. However, I am beginning to change my mind. This nation is now submerged in alcohol. I cannot find words to express how bad the situation has become at every level. Unless we can put a brake on this over the next few years, we will continue down a road where it appears that alcohol abuse is accepted in circumstances that would not have been envisaged ten years ago. The effects on society of the abuse of alcohol is costing the State millions.</P>
      <P>There could be a connection made between the fact that people have more disposable income and their desire to consume more alcohol. One does not need to be a rocket scientist to understand that. This must be examined in the context of wealthier European countries where there is not similar abuse of alcohol. There seems to be a different psychological approach to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Michael Higgins and other speakers regarding the way the alcohol industry <Col N="795" /> is treated in this country. I was a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children which examined the tobacco industry. Tobacco is hugely injurious to health but I believe it would not hold a candle to the damage done by alcohol abuse.</P>
    <P>I ask the Members to imagine a situation where at four and five o'clock in the morning a battlefield is created in every town and city where law and order cannot prevail. Night-clubs are allowed a huge extension of opening hours. In years gone by, I often sat outside night-clubs at three o' clock in the morning waiting to collect my own children. I was a youth officer before I was in politics and I note that 95% of the present younger generation are no different from the youth of 25 or 40 years ago. They do the things that young people should do at that age and there is nothing in the world wrong with them. The loutish behaviour of 5% or 10% has become very vicious and it is frightening to be a witness to such behaviour.</P>
    <P>About three or four years ago I was outside a hotel one night in a large town in my constituency. A young person came out of the hotel holding a pint bottle, tapped it against the railings and made a bee-line for another young person who was obviously a foe of his. He tried to imbed the bottle in the other's neck. I spoke to the local sergeant about my shock at the incident and he said that only for the grace of God there would be huge numbers of casualties to deal with.</P>
    <P>I see the situation as part of a vicious circle of events. Young people start the night in a pub and usually go on to a night-club. At three o'clock in the morning, five or six hundred youngsters pour out onto the street. The only time one is normally likely to see such numbers on the streets of a town would be if the county hurling final was being held and that would be in broad daylight. The takeaway and chip shops delay them for another hour or two. How can two or three gardaí in a squad car deal with those numbers and with the sort of gusto that some of those hooligans exhibit? They are expected to contain a situation when they are surrounded by five or six hundred youngsters. A situation has been created at that level in which the Garda cannot win.</P>
    <P>I believe that however it is managed, the opening hours of the night-clubs must be curtailed. I suppose it could be argued that the takeaways do not create the problem but they need to be better managed. I do not understand why there should be any activity at four o'clock in the morning in any town or village. I am no kill-joy and I know that it is important for youth to have its outlet. We should at least ensure that the Garda are empowered to contain the situation; they cannot do so at the moment. Some Members mentioned that. To put it crudely, long ago it was felt by many households that they would be doing well if youngsters could be kept away from alcohol until they were 18. People hoped that youngsters would then have enough sense to handle themselves with alcohol. That age came down to 16. Some of my family are teachers and that age is <Col N="796" /> ten to 12 years for some of their pupils. It does not matter how good the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or any of the other 165 Deputies are, law and order will be very difficult to manage if children of 11 or 12 are drinking. That is very difficult for the State to manage.</P>
    <P>This brings us back to parental control. I have no magic wand with which to solve this, no more than anyone else, but we must put responsibility back where it belongs. If parents do not know or care where their children are at a particular time or on a particular night, then we are heading for horrendous times. That may not be politically correct but it is how I see it. I spent some years as a professional youth officer and was involved with Macra na Feirme and Foróige. I have a great interest in that area and there is no doubt that any funding the State puts into that kind of work is extremely well spent. Unfortunately, when times get tough economically, that funding is always the first to be cut. As sure as night follows day, if economic circumstances change, then organisations' youth development officers and programmes are the first to be hit. I hope that does not happen in the next five years as every euro spent on youth development, regardless of the organisation, is good for the individuals concerned and their communities.</P>
    <P>There has been unfair bashing of the Garda in recent years, even in this House. I understand that there must be control mechanisms for the police force of any democracy. However, it is important to understand that if there was no Garda presence on our behalf, we would be in serious difficulty. There must be more respect for gardaí. People say one must earn respect no matter who one is and there is some truth to that. However, although the Minister has probably heard this point a hundred times already, he will hear it again from me. In ensuring the Garda was equipped and trained to deal with all sorts of crime, one major mistake was made in relation to community policing approximately ten years ago. Some may say I am speaking from a backwater; I am from a rural constituency in east Galway and our biggest town has a population of only 6,000 to 7,000. However, the situation in the cities is the same: a community officer or garda on the beat, whether he is in a part of Dublin or Mountbellew, Ballinasloe or Tuam, knows all the families in his area. All criminals start small, as has been said, as thugs engaged in minor crime. It is important that there should be a record of that on some Garda database &ndash; who the people involved are and where they are from. They should be easily identified by the people we pay to protect us.</P>
    <P>Many Garda stations were closed, presumably in the name of progress and to save money. Even worse, the squad car became the all-important policing instrument. One has to have squad cars to police a huge rural area and I do not want to return to the era of the bicycle, but what happened was that no matter how good the gardaí in the squad car were, there was a break in the <Col N="797" /> community. A squad car could go through a village 20 times a day and after five years the gardaí would still not know a person in the village. The communication link is broken. That is why so many people will say to the Minister: &ldquo;I used to know the gardaí in my area well before but now I cannot name one of them.&rdquo;  That also works in reverse because the community garda does not have the opportunity to know who people are in a low-key way. There is no hi-tech aspect to this apart from the gardaí being able to use the information in a hi-tech way. Unless we get back to that level we will be unable to identify the real thugs who are causing so much trouble on our streets late at night.</P>
    <P>There should be an early warning system but that can only be operated by the gardaí using the kind of methods I have described. It needs extra resources and more gardaí would have to be stationed in rural areas. They should be put on the beat where they can meet people and talk to them; they get involved in communities and get to know what is happening. It is striking that many of the police forces of the world I have looked at which have achieved results have done so by having people on the beat at that level. The Minister should take this seriously as it is something I will speak about a lot; I believe in this concept.</P>
    <P>No matter who was in Government, I sometimes got the impression that because a town had a population of 600 or 6,000, there was no need for a large Garda presence &ndash; one squad car just had to run through the place every so often. That is no good and we are reaping the rewards of that policy now. There is no great difference between what happens after a disco in Dublin and one in Tuam, Athenry or Galway. It is almost the same activity and it is not confined to any particular place. One simply has a higher concentration of people in the bigger cities. The actions of the louts are the same and there is no great change.</P>
    <P>I hope this legislation will help but many other things will have to be done before it can even hope to be successful. It is an issue we shall return to on many occasions in the future. At the end of the day those vicious attacks which are taking place in all our towns and villages will have to come to an end because the public will not wear it. Most important, the 95% of young people who have nothing to do with it do not want it and wish to see it brought to an end.</P>

      <P>I welcome this debate on the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill. It has been a good debate so far. Listening to different ideas on this issue across party lines will aid the solution to many of our problems. At the same time <Col N="798" /> we have to look seriously at this legislation. I wish to offer some ideas to deal with crime as a priority issue, particularly public disorder and alcohol abuse.</P>
      <P>When we speak about public order what we really mean is making the community feel safe and secure. We already have a situation where elderly pensioners lock their doors at 7 p.m. each night during the months of May and June because they feel intimidated by anti-social elements. During the recent election campaign, many canvassers commented that they had knocked on doors at 6.30 p.m. and 7 p.m. and found that elderly people were afraid to answer the door. I felt sad when I saw elderly people who had contributed so much to the State ending up in this situation. That is not acceptable. Political parties should not accept it and it should cease now.</P>
      <P>When speaking about the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill we should not be afraid to stand back and take a look at where society is going. The abuse of alcohol and drugs and the actions of dysfunctional people are factors. The &ldquo;spoilt brat&rdquo; syndrome is also a factor. This is where young people from affluent families get involved in anti-social behaviour and sometimes they are treated differently from children from disadvantaged areas. We have to seriously examine this issue. As one who has worked in a disadvantaged area for 20 to 25 years, I believe that 85% of pupils who come from areas riddled with poverty and disadvantage do not get into trouble, it is always the 15%. This is something that should be highlighted. Some 85% of people in poor areas can behave themselves and can work against the odds, and they should be supported. There should be strategies in place to assist the 15% who break our hearts.</P>
      <P>If we are serious about this Bill, there will have to be equality and justice and the causes of crime will have to be dealt with. When dealing with the Bill and public order generally we should look at examples of good practice. Let us look at the drugs issue. Ten years ago there were in the region of 15,000 addicts in the city of Dublin without treatment. Today there are 6,000 addicts in treatment making slow progress, but it is a major step in the right direction. However, as is clear from the recent march by the Dublin Citywide Drugs Campaign we cannot let up on this issue and cut back on services. Services will have to be developed, particularly in targeted disadvantaged areas and, if necessary, Criminal Assets Bureau money used to assist worthwhile projects &ndash; for example, projects in the primary school sector, such as Breaking the Cycle, where 33 of the poorest schools nationally were selected on merit because they were located in priority areas. They were given funding and staff, and extra after-school projects were put in place to assist the schools. I worked in one of those schools and in five years we turned depressed children into happy-go-lucky children and built up their self-esteem. It has to be acknowledged that projects such as this have made an impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="799" />Other speakers, such as Deputy Ring, discussed the crisis and violence outside chip shops and pubs. This is where we can look at examples of good practice. I know of one chip shop where there were fights, violence and anti-social behaviour on Friday and Saturday nights, particularly between the hours of 11.30 p.m. and 1.30 a.m. In my constituency there were two tragic deaths involving two young people who were assaulted. One was a young married man who was assaulted and murdered outside a public house and the other was a young non-national in another part of the constituency. These were alcohol related crimes.</P>
    <P>On the issue of good practice, one creative good sergeant and a young garda took it upon themselves to go to this particular chip shop and stand 50 meters away from the door every Friday and Saturday night between the hours of 11.30 p.m. and 1.30 a.m. This had the effect of reducing violent incidents in that area by 60%. That is an example of good practice, good police work, good community work and crime prevention. I do not go along with those who say nothing can be done about this problem. There are examples of good police work and good community work in the State and those people should be used when dealing with this issue. Those are the issues that should be taken on board when dealing with this Bill.</P>
    <P>We must also listen to ideas on the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill. l hope we have learned something from each other today in regard to doing something about crime and its causes. If issues such as low self-esteem and literacy are not tackled and if violent children are not controlled at an early age the seeds of crime are sown. That is an issue on which I have worked during the past 20 years. I have seen children of four, five and six years of age in dysfunctional families and abusive situations where we have not intervened sufficiently early with the provision of services. We have made a start with Breaking the Cycle by helping those children at the ages of four and five. There is no point in starting at the ages of nine, ten, 11 and 12 when the damage is done. They have to be helped at an early age by means of counselling and back-up services.</P>
    <P>We have to listen to people with creative ideas, such as John Lonergan, Governor of Mountjoy, Fergus McCabe, Seanie Lambe of the Inner City Partnership and, particularly in the past few days, Anna Quigley who was involved in the drugs campaign and in crisis areas. These people are on the front line in dealing with prisoners, young people, addicts and those at risk. They have put forward many creative ideas that will tackle poverty, disadvantage and crime. That is what the Bill should be about. Let us tell people they are worthwhile and that we care about them, but at the same time we have to stand up to the bullies. This is the way forward and the only way to tackle crime.</P>
    <P>We have heard the discussion on alcohol and <Col N="800" /> alcohol abuse. We have to look internationally at example of good practice. Let us take France, for example, and its attitude to alcohol and young people. I remember being on holidays in France two years ago on Bastille Day and going to the beach to see the fireworks display. Within half an hour there were 30,000 people present. I was there with my family. Having seen hundreds of teenagers beside me without cans who were not drunk or disorderly I asked what kind of a system has it got that it has a healthy attitude towards alcohol. We must learn from other European countries. This debate is very important.</P>
    <P>I agree with the remarks made by Deputy Higgins concerning child abuse and advertising aimed at young people. It is unfair that massive advertising is directed at young people. They are constantly bombarded by it. Large companies use young people to sell their message. There was a reference to the national flag being used to promote Guinness. That is appalling. Such advertising should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to listen to all the different views. I wish him well in his new office and, as one of the newly elected TDs for Dublin North Central, I say congratulations.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on his appointment and wish him every success. Every Minister has the potential to do many good things but it is important that this Minister makes an effort to make a major difference for the betterment of Irish society, and I hope he can do that.</P>
      <P>I welcome the debate on the Bill. This debate is all about people. I am here because the people sent me here. I have been a rural GP for many years. Like Deputy McGrath, who has worked at the coalface, I have something to say. There is a perception that we are closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. We are treating only one symptom of the disease rather than addressing the root cause.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum blames alcohol. That is a gross understatement because the problem goes much deeper than that. The Bill attempts to address a situation which is just a barometer of where we are in a post-Celtic tiger modern Ireland. Our work is only beginning and this legislation is but a small part of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not underestimate the level of abuse of alcohol in our society. People have grown up with it. In my practice I see the damage it does in families, to the people who take it and to the children. I see the damage it does in society. In putting this Bill forward the Government is saying something very important. However, we are also talking about the abuse of alcohol. I hope that same resolution and determination to get things done will be there when it comes to banning the advertising of alcohol, which is a step in the right direction &ndash; we are not at the stage of banning alcohol because of the extent to which <Col N="801" /> big business is involved. A colleague of mine, Dr. Mick Loftus from County Mayo, has also highlighted the problem of alcohol abuse, as have other doctors. As a coroner he has seen people die, particularly young people, who should not have died. It is terrible.</P>
    <P>I hope everybody in the Dáil, where the buck stops or should stop, will be equally strong in support of legislating for a complete ban on the advertising of alcohol. It will be interesting to see whether, in the fullness of time, the Government, because of the revenue from alcohol sales and lobbying by vested commercial interests, will soften and render such legislation largely ineffective. It will be interesting to see where the commitment is then.</P>
    <P>Community festivals, in which I involve myself, depend on sponsorship because there is no Government investment in such events. Such festivals are very important and they are sponsored by breweries to a major extent. If the Government is serious it should step in to address the situation by sponsoring festivals and sports events. Both young and old partake in sport. The recent World Cup testifies to the great interest in sport. However, when big breweries are involved what chance is there that young people will think other than that this is where it is at.</P>
    <P>How can we expect our young people to behave sensibly in regard to alcohol when &ndash; I speak collectively &ndash; we abuse alcohol ourselves, when they see their parents abusing it. It is not from the wind they learn. It should not, therefore, be a case of &ldquo;do as I say, not as I do&rdquo;. In management circles it is said that one must decide where one is and where one wants to go, but it can be useful to, perhaps, look back to see where we came from and recognise a common thread running through all of this. Much sense is talked by many people. I hope that sense will be converted into action. My biggest fear, however, is that this may turn out to be just another talking shop. I hope not because we should be doing what needs to be done, and this legislation is not by any means enough.</P>
    <P>There was a time when the only thing a local garda had to worry about was whether somebody had a lamp on his or her bicycle or whether it was defective. Those were simple days. Nowadays gardaí are often seen as enemies rather than friends, to young people in particular. Gardaí no longer live in the communities in which they serve. In my area we know the garda who serves our community. He gives a very fine service, but he does not live in the area and that is regrettable. Gardaí, therefore, do not have the same intimate knowledge of the people living in an area as they had previously. If people living next door to each other in a city often do not know each other, how can we expect gardaí to know the young people and their problems? In the past, young people who showed signs of embarking on the wrong line were put right by a garda who knew them and nipped a criminal career in the bud. Such young people never came to the notice of the authorities <Col N="802" /> because the garda dealt with them more effectively than could a social worker or anybody else. That is missing, and it is a shame. I pay tribute to the gardaí who worked in communities. I hope we will see a resurgence of gardaí working with people in communities, which they did in a friendly and not in a threatening way. Nowadays gardaí are reactive rather than proactive and that is where the problem lies. It is hard to blame young people. They see gardaí only when something is wrong and they see them as &ldquo;big brother&rdquo; coming to tell them off or to punish them in one way or another. Gardaí should live in the community and interact with the people. If there were more of them they could do that. However, the Garda Síochána no longer has the presence on the ground it should have. Gardaí driving around in squad cars cannot have the same contact as they would be able to have if they were on foot, but because there are fewer gardaí in rural areas they have to cover the ground in squad cars. It is lack of resources that is to blame, not the Garda.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to the situation in hospitals. Every weekend casualty departments are bunged up with young people who have been involved in fights. Those casualty departments are often understaffed. Mayo General Hospital is understaffed to the extent of 60 nurses. We would love to have an observation ward attached to the accident and emergency ward where young people and others recovering from the effects of alcohol could at least be observed and then sent home without blocking beds that are badly needed in a hospital that is chronically under provided for.</P>
    <P>This is not all about legislation. We all have a role to play. Legislation plays only a minimal part. The family and the community also have a role. However, there is no room for grandmothers in the flats or apartments of modern urban Ireland. I was about to ask where there would be room for a grandmother in the flats in Ballymun, but they are being knocked down. In the move to urbanisation there is not the same room for grandparents. In the past there was always room for an old person in the corner, for the cailleach, who got the best and warmest spot in the house and was there to ensure her grandchildren were reared in a God-fearing and law-abiding way. The move to urbanisation has done away with that and grandmothers are sent to an old folks' home. Their influence on child-rearing is no more and we are the poorer for it and are bearing the consequences of it.</P>
    <P>Too often both parents in a family must work and the children are left to their own devices. There are no proper recreational facilities to occupy them and they are bored silly. They hang around, try alcohol, drugs and other things for lack of something to do. They see their parents doing this too &ndash; they do not learn it from the winds.</P>
    <P>Let us have more gardaí on the beat in the community. Let us provide the resources to support the minority of young people who are <Col N="803" /> involved in serious crime, who deserve to be supported. Let us provide them with proper leisure facilities such as swimming pools. In County Mayo, the townland of Erris, an area the size of County Louth, has no swimming pool.</P>
    <P>We need also to consider the question of balanced regional development. In Mayo only 17% of young graduates taking up their first jobs can do so locally. Half of them must go to Dublin for their first jobs. Let us think about what we must do. Let us consider controlling legislation, but also putting a complete ban on the advertising of alcohol in order that the dignity of the person is ensured. I hope the Government will ban the advertising of alcohol with the same vehemence it is putting into this Bill.</P>

We heard Members' views expressed when the Bill was before the House previously and have heard them again today, and they have not changed. They range from the liberal to the more traditional reaction to the problems the Bill seeks to address.</P>
      <P>We are in a new situation in terms of the whole question of crime and the way it is impacting on society. It appears that Darwin's theory is beginning to manifest itself in that the law of the jungle prevails and only the fittest will survive. Unfortunately, society tends to go that way as affluence increases, as has happened here. We tend to recognise more and more the power that comes with affluence and it is not unnatural to assume that young people or, in some cases, the not so young will follow that trend. This country is similar now to American society in the 1960s, with the two car families and the young generation driving themselves to school and college. The theme in the late 1960s and early 1970s was &ldquo;Make love, not war,&rdquo; but in 2002 it appears to be &ldquo;Make war and forget about everything else.&rdquo; The pendulum of social development has always swung back and forth and it is now swinging back to an area where there is more aggression. There is little point in saying this is a trend particular to this country because it has happened in other countries also. Television undoubtedly has an influence on this problem. We have all heard about the lager louts who follow certain football teams in the United Kingdom and saw the difficulties they got into when they went abroad and the way they were treated. Therefore, what is happening now is not peculiar to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="804" />What are the causes of this problem? There is no doubt that more money is one of the causes. When I was a teenager I did not have any money. We went to the local take-away where there was a jukebox sitting in a corner under a pile of newspapers and other articles. It had a booming bass sound and did not work on occasions. Young people did not have access to drink at that time and they certainly did not have access to drugs. Therefore, they did what they were entitled to do, now known as &ldquo;hanging out&rdquo;. Young people should always have a place to hang out in safety without fear of being harassed by anybody.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of facilities and services. All of the new urban areas that have expanded over the past few years suffer from a lack of facilities for young people between the ages of, say, 14 and 19. We do not provide any facilities for them and say they are their parents' responsibility, which is very interesting. Everybody who is a parent will know the difficulty of always being responsible for the actions of their children. It is fine to say they are their responsibility, but parents cannot imprison their children in the home and not let them go anywhere. They will not get away with that. They can be totally responsible for all their actions and presume they have given them sufficient advice that will stand them in good stead in order that they will not drink or take drugs. They presume that everything will work out, but what if that is not the case? There is no way one can guarantee absolute adherence to the ground rules laid down in the home and there is little point in pretending otherwise. We can only do our best and having done so, society then has to take some responsibility in the matter.</P>
    <P>There is a greater contempt for discipline and authority in schools. Perhaps that is the case in the home in that some children do not have the same respect for their parents as they did some years ago, and that is carried on onto the street. Every citizen should have the right to walk at will on the street without fear of being attacked, having their handbag snatched, being beaten up or raped. They should have the right to walk freely and be protected in their own society.</P>
    <P>While the lack of recreational facilities is a problem &ndash; they need to be put in place &ndash; we also have to combat the consequences of that lack of facilities. The fact that young people do not have a place to go to is not necessarily a defence when it comes to beating up somebody standing at a bus stop, which is not unusual, nor is it usually the poor in society who are the culprits in every case. It is not unusual for a middle class young person to walk up to a law abiding citizen going about his or her business and beat him or her unconscious.</P>
    <P>In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s somebody may have got a bloody nose or whatever and that was the end of it, but for some unknown reason it no longer stops at that. Serious assaults are now being committed. Somebody is pushed down on the road and kicked almost to death. In some cases the person has been kicked to death, yet <Col N="805" /> nobody accepts responsibility or feels ill at ease in any way.</P>
    <P>The time has come to ask the reason this killer instinct has suddenly developed in our society. I am of the view that television has had an influence in that area for a long time. Some of the films available either through cinemas, videos or television would make the hair stand up on one's head in terms of the violence they contain. The way in which gratuitous violence is depicted is one of the most serious problems in society in that it attempts to glamorise gratuitous violence and go into it in great detail. It creates the impression that the perpetrator can get off with the crime. It appears to give the &ldquo;two fingers&rdquo; to society and get away with it. That is a serious matter. That is the law of the jungle. As a society, we have to examine that issue. There is no point in saying we cannot restrict what is happening in that area, but some make a great deal of money out of films which are an insult to all peace loving people. That is a fact of life.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, in what was then my constituency, I called into premises on a Friday evening as part of my rounds. There was a television in the corner with a group of young people around it. It was about 7 p.m. and I thought it was unusual. Out of curiosity I looked at the television. I would not like to describe what I saw on the screen in graphic detail to the House. Suffice it to say, the censor would have dealt with the film in question. It justified and portrayed violence in a way that caught the interest of the young people concerned, some of whom were impressed by it, some of whom were shocked by it, but they all saw it and it was readily available. It depicted victory for those who had contempt for people's rights and privacy. Television is only the medium. It can be films or videos, but there is a problem.</P>
    <P>What do wildlife programmes show kids nowadays? I have argued this point many times before. They show the law of the jungle. They show one animal chasing another, catching it and tearing it apart. I find that objectionable. I do not know what effect it will have on the impressionable mind of a five or six year old. I do not know if the children concerned will have been conditioned into accepting those principles by the time they are 15 or 16. We all know what the law of the jungle means. One animal kills another and then eats it. Nobody seems to have examined this in any detail, but schools all over Europe screen nature films which show this in great detail. I do not think it is funny. If one's domestic cat was being pursued by one's dog and footage was shown on television of one eating the other, people would be justifiably upset. This is part of the conditioning of young people and it is causing a problem.</P>
    <P>The question of policing must also be dealt with. How does policing function now compared to some years ago? Various Members have mentioned foot patrols and old fashioned policing. Gardaí used to look into dance halls in the past <Col N="806" /> and then leave. They would come back an hour later and catch anyone up to mischief. That does not happen any more. Different policing methods are now used. The patrol car travels on a circuit and as soon as it has passed by, drugs dealers reappear. I remember canvassing during a by-election campaign in this city some years ago. Elderly people pointed out drug peddlers to us. They told us that they would disappear when the squad car came around the corner. When the gardaí got out of the squad car there is no-one to be seen, but they are back in business ten minutes later. What is the answer to this? It requires a change in policing. The Minister knows that himself. We must support him in doing that job. The purpose is to bring about a reduction in crime. We will not be doing our job if we do not support the Government in doing so. Likewise, if a Minister does not take the necessary measures, then he or she is not doing his or her job. We have a serious problem that needs to be tackled. The whole attitude to crime on the streets needs to be changed.</P>
    <P>In the last ten or 15 years we have heard the courts, the juvenile courts in particular, complaining time and again. I know it is the job of the defence to make the best case for the accused. That is the nature of the business. Sometimes it is true and sometimes not &ndash; that is also the nature of the business. I cannot understand the reason it has not been possible to provide a system &ndash; in tandem with the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children &ndash; where a place of detention can be found for a young brat who has been in trouble on 27 occasions and has a conviction list the length of both arms. The more a person of that age is allowed to show contempt for the law by being released and reoffending, the worse it is for society &ndash; and the child's parents. We have talked about this in the House many times in the past. I know the area of juvenile detention is not the Minister's responsibility, but it is the responsibility of one of his colleagues. I strongly suggest that the three Departments with an input in this area &ndash; the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Education and Science &ndash; get together and do what is necessary to ensure that when things have got out of hand as much as they have, custodian measures are in place to bring a halt to the gallop of the people concerned. If we do not do that, we are failing to recognise what is happening before our eyes.</P>
    <P>The issue of drugs and alcohol and their effect on violence in society is an important one. I enjoy a drink as many people do and will not tell people not to drink. People should drink with respect for themselves and those around them. Having said that, if drink is mixed with other substances, the effect can be dramatic. This has already been mentioned by Deputy Deasy and others in the House. I do not know what the answer is, but society tends to go for kicks. Society always went for kicks, the problem is that the kicks society <Col N="807" /> now seeks are much more serious than they used to be. These kicks very often result in serious violence against innocent members of society. It is a serious problem. Some say drugs should be legalised. Members know what happened in the United States when prohibition was lifted. The money went from the bootleggers to the Government, but the consumption of alcohol increased by about 6,000%. That is the simple answer to the argument of legalising drugs. I do not agree with liberalisation. If drugs are causing a problem, legalising them will not stop people using them.</P>
    <P>I could go on and on as, I am sure, every other Member could. The Minister now faces a tough job which requires all his time, energy and dedication. If he can do it, we will assist him and if he does not, we will criticise him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate all those appointed last week and this week, particularly my constituency colleagues, Deputy Pattison and Deputy Aylward. I wish them all well in their service to the 29th Dáil. I congratulate the Minister and wish him well in a tough portfolio which I know he is up to and to which he will make a positive and definite contribution. He will have our support in this task. I listened to Deputy Durkan describing the chase and the kill and it made me reflect on the political process that we have just come through. It vividly reminded me of our in-party structures and what happens there. I can identify with the story that was told in terms of our political life here.</P>
      <P>Like others, when I reflect on the current circumstances in urban centres, I observe that this is a typical example of a Bill which allows us to debate on Second Stage the many issues that confront us in urban and rural Ireland, identify the problems and explain in detail some of our experiences as public representatives, parents and members of a local community, but what is the follow-up? Sometimes, as politicians, we have a reputation for blowing hot air on issues but doing little. We may stand accused of that in relation to what we are debating here. We can identify the many problems but there is little tangible action on the ground so that local communities can say that, arising from the legislation, there has been a vast improvement in law and order. The particular problems of public disobedience, vandalism or the abuse of drink or drugs will continue unless we put resources in place with this legislation by putting in money and people. That is the position with much legislation passed by this House regarding local government, health boards or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. If we do not invest the resources behind the legislation, then we are at nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the structure of the Garda, but I preface my remarks by saying that the members of the force, and those who support it in what it is trying to achieve, are doing an excellent job. However, they are seriously under <Col N="808" /> resourced in terms of technology and funding. The Garda's structure is dated and past its shelf life. It must be examined in comparison to the more successful European models. Speaking from local experience, as we all do, if a person contacts the local Garda station concerning an incident that is not extremely serious or life threatening, one does not get the type of response expected. Many people discover that if they phone to make a complaint, it is difficult to get through because the Garda resources are stretched or they do not get a response to their complaint or the investigation and results that they expect. The result is that they question the force itself and this is happening throughout the country. I would welcome a restructuring of the force with more patrols in urban centres and a better response in both urban and rural communities as well as seeing the Garda being respected. However, we must build up the force before getting respect from the community.</P>
    <P>Many young people today have little respect for the Garda because they know that there will be no response to vandalism, drunkenness or use of drugs. That is my concern about Bills like this. I see community gardaí at work in my community of Kilkenny city and they are extremely successful. It is a question of working with young people, their parents and community leaders to establish respect and to explain that the Garda are on their side and willing to listen and respond to problems on the ground, not from the patrol car or the station. That is not happening enough because the resources are not there. A community garda is often replaced or dragged from that important task to another one.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter because the Bill discusses public disorder in terms of places where the public congregates such as chip shops, restaurants, bars and night-clubs, but what about public disorder in housing estates and the joyriding that occurs throughout the country in company cars? Seven of these were burned out in a field belonging to the local authority in Kilkenny, but the Garda stated that it could do nothing because it was county council property and therefore a council matter. If there is an inter-agency meeting, one blames the other. The health board will say that it does not have enough people, as does the Garda. The local authority is local government in name only as it is in reality a bureaucracy that functions from time to time. When pressure is applied, known culprits are visited. In most communities the individuals causing the trouble, being disorderly or dealing in drugs are known, yet they are at large, tormenting people in their homes. At weekends, or on particular nights of the week, older people on housing estates are prisoners in their own homes. Gardaí would not police one estate in Kilkenny city until there was a concerted effort over a period to bring law and order into it. That does nothing for confidence in public representatives or the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to afford a greater degree of safety and protection to persons who may be <Col N="809" /> out and about most probably at night for whatever reason so that they will not be accosted by drunk and disorderly delinquents. It mentions CCTV cameras and other measures, but most public houses in Kilkenny and elsewhere have CCTV cameras and bouncers on the doors, which is something that I never thought I would see. The precautions are being taken, yet there is disorder.</P>
    <P>I will explain what happens afterwards. The local authority gets involved and states it has a difficulty with the opening hours. That is a problem for us to address. We passed the Intoxicating Liquor Act, which has proven to be a problem. We will have to review it. In Europe the law may allow alcohol to be consumed publicly at all hours and for shops selling alcohol and drinking houses to be open for longer periods than is the position here &ndash; some may argue that should be the case here in that we are all good Europeans &ndash; but apparently such late opening hours do not work here. Even though premises may close at the hour they do, drinking after-hours still occurs. The opening hours for night clubs have been extended. The Intoxicating Liquor Act needs to be revisited as its provisions are not working on the ground. That is part of the problem being experienced.</P>
    <P>The minute night clubs close, any number up to 5,000 to 8,000 people can be found on the streets in Kilkenny. The first place they would head to is the taxi rank or the chip shop, which is where the trouble starts. It continues from there and accident and emergency departments become crowded. In this way many problems occur at the same time.</P>
    <P>In regard to planning, members of my local authority tried to set a closing time for all the chip shops that open late in Kilkenny. However, some of them had received planning permission before the recent planning laws were implemented while others have planning permission to stay open to a certain time. We cannot impose a reasonable hour of closing across the board until such time as we get agreement from each of them. They would have to agree because some of them have planning permission to stay open to a certain time. That is a problem. Policing the streets is one matter, being out and about and making sure such behaviour does not happen is another.</P>
    <P>Addressing this problem involves many people ranging from the local authority in terms of planning to the Dáil in terms of passing the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, and in dealing with this Bill. Account must also be taken of the Equal Status Act. Those who operate these premises tell us that they want to reclaim ownership of the running of their premises and that they are experiencing difficulty in doing so in terms of this Act. That is another matter we will have to address. As legislators, in addressing the various legislation relating to this matter we should look beyond what is happening in Dublin and start to consider some of the valid points made in Second <Col N="810" /> Stage debates. Such debates are not all hot air or about filling time. Some points are made in a genuine way to highlight the problems faced by local communities and to pass on the experience of what is happening constitutencies to feed into the passing of positive legislation.</P>
    <P>We have all come through an election campaign, where for the first time I had the experience of knocking on doors at a reasonable hour, at tea time or a little later, to find that the parents had gone out for the night and young children were at home alone. I am not saying that behaviour is widespread, but make this point by way of explaining how dysfunctional families and local communities have become. It is important that we relate that development here in terms of this legislation in order that it is understood that responsibility for tackling this problem not only rests with the Garda but must be taken by the parents of the children who run wild across housing estates in many urban centres, many of whom are known to be drug users and to peddle drugs of one kind or another. They cause serious problems and mayhem in some of the housing estates in my local community.</P>
    <P>The reaction of the health board to such problems is to send in an over-worked social worker to prop up a local family experiencing difficulty. I admire the social workers concerned who sometimes work longer than their regular hours to assist families. They identify what is going wrong and make every effort to try to correct it. However, there are insufficient resources or inter-agency action in the health board system to tackle such problems.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Many members of the public find little understanding, at senior political level or at senior <Col N="811" /> Garda level, of the real difficulties they face on a daily basis. Not a day goes by but I am contacted in relation to anti-social behaviour in our estates, towns and villages. I constantly come across situations where people say there is no point in calling the local gardaí. That is not because the local gardaí do not want to respond. The fact is that the resources and staffing available to the Garda are not good enough to deal with the situation on the ground. Unfortunately, following from that people wonder if there is any point in ringing the local gardaí. Firstly, they may not come at all or it may be an hour or two later. Even when they do come what will they be able to do?</P>
    <P>Many Deputies in the House, myself included, are standing in the gap and trying to stop a situation arising where we will have vigilantism in our towns and cities. On a regular basis I am asked what I can do for people in this context. Increasingly people are saying they will have to look elsewhere to have things resolved. That is not acceptable and I and other Members of the House do not want to see that happening. We need to put more resources into the Garda Síochána to ensure gardaí can respond and that when they do they will be able to take effective action. Ourselves and local authorities have that responsibility. In Tipperary South we have done that. In Clonmel we have a local liaison committee where local councillors meet with the Garda on a regular basis. While that is helpful it falls down as a practical response and resolution to the problems we are experiencing.</P>
    <P>In relation to this legislation people say to me that the Oireachtas is prepared to respond to late night difficulties in our town centres but will not respond to difficulties with anti-social behaviour in our housing estates. People suggest that we are prepared to respond to late night town centre difficulties because people who own property in these areas are wealthy and can influence and put pressure on the Garda and on people with responsibility. I have a certain sympathy for that view taking the practical situation on the ground into account.</P>
    <P>I have raised this matter in the House over the last 18 months on numerous occasions. I hope the new Minister will look seriously at anti-social behaviour in our estates. He should look in particular at the appointment of community gardaí. Many Members, including Deputy McGuinness, mentioned how successful community gardaí have been in places such as Kilkenny. I have visited Waterford and Letterkenny where successful community Garda systems are in operation. Will the Minister add the community Garda dimension to this Bill? Gardaí at senior level have told me that if additional gardaí were available to them for community policing and activities the major part of anti-social behaviour could be stopped. In Clonmel the local Garda superintendent has requested the appointment of a sergeant and two gardaí for that purpose. I ask the Minister to look at that request, and at the appoint<Col N="812" /> ment of community gardaí, seriously and to include it in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Another element of community policing is the issue of gardaí on the beat. At the moment resources are stretched and there are simply not enough gardaí. Response comes largely through the patrol car. The patrol car will visit an area or estate and the individuals creating difficulties disappear but when the gardaí go after five or ten minutes the anti-social individuals reappear. I would like to see gardaí on the beat in local areas where they should be based. In Clonmel, for instance, a part of a newer area of the town has up to 6,000 or 7,000 people. If that was a separate town it would have its own local Garda station. Large local areas like that should have their own Garda base and their own gardaí on the beat. Those gardaí would build up a relationship with local people who could identify difficulties at an early stage. They could build up trust with local people and in that way reduce our difficulties. People like ourselves and people with responsibility generally do not understand the difficulties residents experience with incidents such as drinking alcohol in public places, the shouting of abuse, stone throwing and the breaking of windows. Many of these are not criminal incidents in the normal sense but they constitute a low level of constant difficulty which means people do not feel safe in their homes. That aspect of community policing should be included in the legislation.</P>
    <P>We need to put in place facilities for young people. While all major towns have swimming pools and local football, soccer and hurling clubs, more facilities are needed in specific areas, such as local housing estates. In the 1970s large housing estates of up to 400 houses were built without any facilities. Not only should that day be gone, with facilities being included in all new housing estates, but the estates built in the late 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s should be targeted for the provision of facilities. They should have clubs, indoor football and other recreation facilities so young people will have somewhere to go.</P>
    <P>The huge difficulty is that many of the people causing problems in housing estates are extremely young. They are being brought along by peer pressure. It started with the 16 to 18 year olds. As a result of the example they gave and the fact that they could get away with causing trouble, the age range dropped to 13 and 14 year olds. Unfortunately, there are now children as young as seven and eight years of age making life hell for ordinary residents in housing estates. The Minister should specifically provide in the legislation for community gardaí in housing estates and for the appointment of additional gardaí for that purpose. He should also target the provision of facilities in those areas.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to fast food outlets. They can give rise to many difficulties late at night. The opening hours of these outlets should be examined. Under the planning legislation my local authority has tried to ensure that these outlets <Col N="813" /> close at a reasonable hour. Unfortunately, those conditions have been appealed to An Bord Pleanála and have been overturned. I ask the Minister to ensure the opening hours of fast food outlets are reasonable and do not permit them to stay open until three, four or five o'clock in the morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised the new Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has brought this legislation before the Dáil in his first major action as Minister. The legislation is an insult to the Dáil. It is a slap up Bill posing as serious legislation. It is true the Minister was not in office when the Bill was drafted but he is running with it and described it in his speech as very important. He must, therefore, take full responsibility for its limitations.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, there is a crisis of alcohol abuse in the State. The Bill is said to be necessary to deal with the violent consequences of that abuse. Alcohol is an extremely dangerous drug. However, the Bill is a pathetic knee-jerk of an excuse for a real response to the violent incidents that take place each week as a result of excessive drinking at various times of the day but particularly at night. It is a cynical attempt by the Government to cover up the failure and incompetence of the previous Government to make any significant move to address what was, during its five years in office, a growing problem of alcohol related violence in society. This is yet another item of bitsy legislation which is meant to be an immediate response to a problem that has developed but is, in fact, a miserable response by any standards.</P>
      <P>The Bill, therefore, represents a continuation of the method of operation of the previous Government with regard to serious social issues such as this. The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, which significantly extended the opening hours of outlets selling alcohol, was introduced with no preparatory study of what the implications of this extension would be in terms of consumption of alcohol and the harm that might result from changes in behaviour as a result of extra consumption. During the Second Stage debate on that legislation and on the Order of Business, I called for a study to be undertaken by the Government before bringing such legislation before the House so the Members could vote in an enlightened state of knowledge as to whether the extension of opening times would contribute to a large increase in the consumption of alcohol or to an intensification of patterns of behaviour that might lead to increased violence related to alcohol consumption. However, with reckless irresponsibility the last Government ploughed ahead and pushed the legislation through the Dáil, with Deputies in complete ignorance as to its social effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill now before the House, as a response to what everybody agrees is a serious social problem, proposes to give powers to exclude persons from licensed premises and to close premises <Col N="814" /> where trouble has been evident. The subtext is that these measures are to deal with problems arising from over consumption of alcohol. This Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was famously associated with an exhortation to his party that it must be radical or redundant. A radical response to this serious crisis would be to go to the heart of the problem, rather than window dressing with this deplorable Bill. The problem with it is that it does not in any way begin to address the causes of violence on an increasing scale.</P>
    <P>The strategic task force on alcohol recently produced an interim report, which contained many interesting comments on this matter. It held up a mirror to society's behaviour with regard to alcohol consumption and cited some alarming trends. Between 1989 and 1999 <i>per capita</i> consumption of alcohol in Ireland increased by 41%, compared to a modest increase in three other EU member states and a decrease in another ten. Eleven litres <i>per capita</i> of pure alcohol are consumed here each year, compared to an EU average of 9.1. The report alludes to an Australian study which indicated that 34% of accidental falls can be attributed to alcohol. Over 62,000 were hospitalised due to accidents, poisoning and violence in 1997, of which about 23,000 were admitted to acute hospitals due to falls. I do not doubt that many of these incidents resulted from excessive consumption of alcohol.</P>
    <P>A pilot study of attendance in Irish accident and emergency wards shows that alcohol is a factor in 25% of cases. The task force's interim report states &ldquo;poor school performance, accidents, relationship problems and delinquency&rdquo; are among the difficulties faced by those aged 15 and 16 years who drink excessively. It continues:</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner highlighted the link between alcohol and the rise in street violence. He noted that in 2000 there were 62,000 incidents of public order offences of which 38,000 people were charged and the remaining 24,000 were cautioned. The vast majority of public order offences are alcohol related. This would indicate that at least 1,200 alcohol related incidents take place every week in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This points to a serious situation. Further evidence shows that a substantial proportion of admissions to psychiatric hospitals are related to excessive alcohol consumption. The report states, &ldquo;Research in an Irish general hospital reported that 30% of all male patients and 8% of female patients were identified as having underlying alcohol abuse or dependency problems.&rdquo; It points out:</P>
    <P>Alcohol related problems cost Irish society approximately &euro;2.4 billion per year. These include costs such as health care, road accidents, alcohol related crime and lost productivity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="815" /> The Government has produced the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 2002, in response to these problems. It proposes that persons may be barred from a licensed premises, even though it is obvious they will simply drink at another premises instead. The Bill's recommendation of closing a fish and chip shop for a few hours if there is trouble in its vicinity is a pathetic response to a national problem of serious proportions. It is incredible that this legislation in response to a serious problem is so limited in its scope. It deals with the symptoms and aftermath of alcohol abuse and how best to deal with serious disturbances and violence which have already occurred, but ignores the kernel of the issue: the problem of alcohol consumption.</P>
    <P>Alcohol is advertised relentlessly in the State by its manufacturers. It is incredible that this most dangerous of drugs is allowed to be relentlessly pushed in multi-million euro advertising campaigns in every corner of the land. Radio, television and other powerful media are freely prostituted to the biggest drug barons in the State. Although it cannot be denied that devastation is caused by gangsters who bring heroin into our communities, alcohol companies are the drug pushers who push their substances in the largest quantities. These multinational corporations peddle their wares legally. I wish to make clear that I am not a prohibitionist, but believe there should be an absolute prohibition on the advertising of alcohol. It is incredible that the Government should dare to come to the House with this miserable Bill which does not address the commercial behaviour of companies producing alcohol. Each day they seek to entice, cajole and seduce people to consume greater amounts of a dangerous drug.</P>
    <P>It is similarly scandalous and incredible that national sports bodies allow themselves to be bought by the alcohol industry. The FAI and the GAA, which organise sports with millions of followers in the State, are steeped in sponsorship deals with the alcohol industry. Excessive alcohol use, heavily encouraged by advertising in stadiums, is the antithesis of the fitness promoted by the actions of those who participate in soccer, Gaelic football and other sports. The sports governing bodies, which sell themselves to the drinks industry, allow their venues to be used to portray alcohol consumption as seductive, attractive and cool. These bodies are responsible for the increased alcohol consumption which results from alcohol being allowed to be portrayed in this way. They are thereby implicated in the further intensification of alcohol consumption. However, the Bill does not mention this fact. If alcohol advertising was completely banned and other measures were taken to reduce significantly excessive and dangerous patterns of drinking alcohol and the abuse of alcohol, many of the problems the Bill is supposed to deal with would not arise in the first instance.</P>
    <P>It is a betrayal of the country's youth in par<Col N="816" /> ticular that the national sporting organisations are in hock to the alcohol industry in this way. It is ironic that those who act in a disgustingly disruptive way towards their fellow citizens by having consumed alcohol have a particular Bill designed solely for them, while the companies who make profits beyond their wildest dreams from these people's abuse of alcohol do not even merit a line in the legislation. Therefore, the legislation is absolutely unworthy of support.</P>
    <P>The task force recommendations to which I already alluded clearly address these points. They recommend reducing the exposure of children and adolescents &ndash; I would include adults &ndash; to alcohol marketing; limiting where alcohol advertisements can be placed, that is, TV, radio, cinema, magazines, schools, youth centres, public transport, public buildings, etc.; ensuring the content of alcohol advertisements does not appeal to children or adolescents; and banning drinks industry sponsorship of children and adolescent leisure time activities, which I would apply to all sports and generally. I hope when replying to the debate that the Minister will tell Dáil why none of these issues is dealt with as a radical response to the situation which has developed. Instead of the culture of excessive alcohol consumption and pushing these advertisements, there should be encouragement for alternative community outlets such as combined sports and leisure centres and investment in community facilities to cater for the widest interests, past times and recreational activities, both passive and active, so they are not centred in the local pub.  </P>
    <P>The legislation on which this is dependent, the Public Order Act, 1994 is being seriously abused by the Garda Síochána. This was supposed to be introduced to deal with social disorder, thuggery and so on, arising in particular areas. However, it has most notably been used in opposition to political protest and political dissent against people quite legitimately and peacefully participating, for example, in anti-war marches. People involved in these protests are being dragged in front of the courts and charged under sections of the Public Order Act, 1994. Therefore, I object to anything constructed on that Act given the abuse of it.</P>

      <P>I wish to begin by congratulating Deputy O'Dea on his re-appointment as Minister of State and I wish him well. In his absence, I congratulate the new Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on his appointment. I hope he will take on the job with the same energy and enthusiasm with which he took on the general election so we may achieve results in some important areas where we failed to achieve results in the past three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of public order is one I have repeatedly brought up in this House to try to get action. I was encouraged when I saw the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill on the list of Bills to come before the House. Unfortunately, after reading the content I tend to agree with most of the other <Col N="817" /> Opposition spokespersons that this is little more than shuffling the deck chairs on the Titanic. This is a massive problem and a huge challenge to legislators and policy makers. The purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the law in order to deal more effectively with late night public disorder and disturbance, which mainly has its origins in alcohol abuse. The Bill has two purposes, first, to add an exclusion order as a legitimate penalty and, second, to give the Garda power to apply to the District Court for a closure order or limitation order on the hours so that certain premises can stay open if the Garda sees fit. There is some merit in both of these suggestions but it is a miserable response to what is a very difficult and complex problem. I hope this inadequate legislation will soon be followed up by much more comprehensive legislation because time and again this Government has said it will prioritise street violence and crime. We have witnessed tragic instances and circumstances on the streets of Cork, Limerick, Galway and rural centres, particularly at weekends and late at night.</P>
    <P>I want to put some of the facts on the record because it is important that people realise the scale and seriousness of the problem we as legislators face. It is regrettable that just alcoholism is mentioned in the explanatory memorandum and not drugs. I consider alcohol as an addictive drug and a substance which is abused on a regular basis. It is one of a number of drugs used. I would be the first to admit that alcohol is probably the primary cause of public disorder on the streets at night. However, there are other drugs which cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>These are some of the facts in regard to alcohol. There has been a 35% increase in consumption of alcohol since 1993. Between 1997 and 2000, there was a 300% increase in psychiatric treatment of teenagers with alcohol-related problems. Ireland has the worst under-age drinking record in Europe if one categorises the main problem of under-age drinking as binge drinking among young people under the age of 18. Alcohol consumption among all ages continues to increase steadily. To our shame, Ireland has the highest use of ecstacy in Europe. Some 18% of Irish teenagers smoke daily, the second highest in Europe. Ireland has the third highest use of cannabis in Europe, despite the fact that politicians say we must carry the fight against recreational drugs. We have the fourth highest use of stimulants in Europe, the fourth highest use of cocaine in Europe <i>per capita</i>, and the eighth highest use of opiates, including heroin, in Europe.</P>
    <P>The only reason that is still the eighth highest and not higher is because, so far, the main heroin problem has remained with the 12,000 or so heroin addicts in Dublin, though that is starting to change. It is important to recognise that heroin is spreading across the country.</P>
    <P>Let us be under no illusions here, we face a huge challenge in tackling substance abuse. One has only to ask any garda on the beat at night to know that there is doubtless a link between such <Col N="818" /> abuse and street violence and public disorder. My constituency office happens to be across the road from the main Garda station in Cork and I speak to gardaí on a regular basis about their experiences and the causes of the many problems with which they have to deal at night. They say time and time again that alcohol with sometimes the influence of other drugs is the lethal mix or cocktail of substances that drives what are in many cases young, shy and well-behaved teenagers to act in a way they would not normally dream of.</P>
    <P>It is important to state the facts about street violence. The only official figures we have from the Garda date to the year 2000 and if there is one thing the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform should do quickly it is to ensure we get figures more quickly than we have in the past. It is unacceptable to have to wait 18 months or nearly two years to get Garda figures. What is the point of introducing a PULSE computer system, whereby information is supposed to be at our fingertips, if we cannot even access the 2001 Garda figures now? It is absolutely ridiculous. The figures for 2000 are stark in themselves. There were 39,000 public order offences and a 130% increase in violent assaults, which the Minister of State has heard over and over again. The number of serious assaults increased from 737 in 1999 to 1,737 in 2000 and only one in three crimes is being reported. In Dublin alone last year, 5,000 people had to spend the night in hospital following violent attacks or assaults and if one compares that figure to that of 1,737 serious assaults in the year 2000 one can see just how many people are not reporting attacks. That is a very worrying statistic for a Minister or a Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I ask the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, to take note of it.</P>
    <P>Unhappy with Garda figures, Fine Gael decided to try and get some statistics itself and I present some of those it got back from the south side of Dublin from a survey for which Alan Shatter was largely responsible. There was a very large number of respondents and I have highlighted some noteworthy figures such as the 97% of respondents who do not feel safe walking in Dublin city centre at night and the 85% who worry that somebody in their household may suffer injury as a result of an assault. Of parents, 99% worry that a teenage child will be assaulted while out at night and 100% of those surveyed regard crime as a very serious problem which needs more attention from Government. In relation to solutions, 99% said they wanted to see more gardaí on the beat, 96% said the Garda was not adequately resourced or equipped by Government and 96% said the Government was not doing enough to prevent crime. It is also very interesting to note that 71% said victims of assault should be compensated by either the person who committed the crime or by the State.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a population which is nervous about walking the streets at night. I have heard many people dismiss comments like that as <Col N="819" /> exaggeration of the problem and say there is no fear factor out there, but we made an identical survey on the south side of Cork city and we got almost identical results. I am the first to admit that most of those who respond to a survey like this are concerned about crime and that one is therefore bound to get very high figures, but even taking that into account the figures are still startling. The result is that a large number of people are not going to socialise in city centre locations any more and I suspect the Minister of State will have found that when canvassing in Limerick for the general election. As I did in Cork, he will have found that people say they do not go into the city centre on a Saturday night because they do not want the hassle. They are nervous and say they drink locally, which in a small island country is unacceptable and spells out a total failure of policy on the part of legislators and of those responsible for putting laws, policies and investment in place to protect people. It is about time we started looking at more imaginative ways of dealing with the problem we face.</P>
    <P>There is no golden key that opens the door to the solution to street violence, crime, alcohol consumption and drug misuse, but I will outline some of the issues about which I feel strongly as a young person and as a young legislator. I have tried to break them down into medium, long-term and short-term solutions because any reasonable person cannot expect the Government to solve this problem overnight. I will talk about medium and long-term solutions first because I do not want to put too much emphasis on policing as that would be dangerous. We need to start setting clear targets to reverse the booze culture that has continued to develop and which has certainly existed since I took my first drink, which is quite some time ago now. We need to target certain areas which we have not targeted in the past, the first and most important of which is the family.</P>
    <P>I get frustrated when I hear people discussing solutions to social problems and saying, &ldquo;Let us get education to deal with this, let us add another subject to the school curriculum and get our teachers to lead young people and to change their mindsets about drink, drugs, sex and other damaging behaviour in which they may be involved&rdquo;. Parental responsibility has not been targeted during my time in this House and that is a great shame. If parents take on the responsibility of having children they need to be responsible for them until they are 18 at least and we need to put structures and support systems in place to ensure they take on that responsibility and are given all the assistance they need. When they do not make any effort to take responsibility they need to be held to account. That may be an unpopular thing to say to some parents, but if one has a 16 or 17 year old who is running riot on Patrick Street in Cork or O'Connell Street in Dublin on a Saturday night and is involved in a brawl for whatever reason, the parents of that young person, who may be a girl or a boy, a young man or a young <Col N="820" /> woman, have a responsibility and must be held to account to a certain extent.</P>
    <P>We need detailed debate in this House on ways in which we can do that because we should not hold parents to account in an unfair or draconian way. It is something we need to consider much more seriously if we are serious about supporting the family, which is the cornerstone of a healthy society and a positive upbringing for young people. We should then look at the education system and reinforce in schools the messages we can get across in the home through parents and family. Teachers should not be asked to do the job of parents because it is an impossible task for them to take on and it would be unfair to ask them to do so. They can, however, be asked to work with parents to reinforce the message and change the booze mindset of many young people, which is, why drink if one is not going to get drunk because that is the point of drinking? Under age drinking should also be targeted but I will address that issue later in terms of short-term solutions.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Joe Higgins on many issues but I agree with him that the role of alcohol advertising needs to be examined. It should not necessarily be banned but a much tougher line needs to be taken on the glorification of drinking and, latterly, getting drunk to liberate one socially in night clubs because that is damaging. We need to have guts to implement restrictions and regulations on alcohol advertising and, in particular, on the link between alcohol and sport. It is unfortunate that, on the one hand, sport is probably the most healthy way for a young person to expend energy and develop positively while, on the other, the abuse of alcohol has the opposite effect, yet alcohol and top level sports events are interlinked. That challenge should be faced and alcohol advertising and sports should be separated so that emphasis can be placed on sports as a positive way for young people to expend energy.</P>
    <P>Role models are needed for young people, many of whom do not listen to us, as legislators, because they think we are out of touch. I have a young brother who regularly tells me I do not know what I am talking about and do not understand if I give him hassle about going out at night. Projects based around role models should be financed and developed so that young people, who are looked up to by their peers, can provide leadership. For example, Niall Quinn did so effectively prior to the election when he called on young people to vote for the first time. Such leadership is needed now more than ever to counter drug and alcohol abuse, which leads to young people losing their self-respect and to street violence.</P>
    <P>Alternatives to going to the pub, such as sports facilities, should be provided. For example, the under age basketball club in my home town of Carrigaline has 450 members, yet it does not have a court. The club must use the resources at four local schools to facilitate the positive, voluntary work of its members. A youth work programme <Col N="821" /> is necessary and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, who had responsibility for youth affairs during the previous Administration, will agree the youth work structure is totally inadequate in comparison to other countries such as Canada and Australia.</P>
    <P>Short and medium-term solutions can be taken. Bouncers and security people on the doors of pubs and night clubs should be regulated immediately. The lack of regulation and training in this industry is unacceptable. Identity card schemes must be introduced for young people. If we are serious about tackling under age drinking, it is reasonable to ask a young person to prove his or her age before he or she is served alcohol, and publicans want such schemes.</P>
    <P>I have not referred to policing because so many others have done so. CCTV schemes should be extended to communities that seek them desperately. Let us support the Garda, particularly in terms of the community work in which they are involved through the juvenile liaison and youth diversion schemes. There are examples of fantastically successful youth diversion programmes in Scotland, for example. The Children Act, 2001, addresses some of these issues and it should be implemented fully.</P>
    <P>The number of gardaí on the beat should be increased. That means taking them out of stations and putting them on the beat at night on the streets, not necessarily increasing the overall number of gardaí in the force, so that when people go out at night at least they will feel there is somebody looking after their security. It is totally unacceptable in a country comprising many small cities and towns, other than Dublin, that people cannot go out at night, enjoy themselves and go home safely without worrying about getting hassled, verbally abused or beaten to within an inch of their lives, as happened in the case of two young people in Cork over the past year.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with my colleague, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe. I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and I look forward to many ground-breaking initiatives from him and his Department. We know what he has been saying over the past number of years and I know we will be in a position to support many of those initiatives.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment to the Department. I am confident that there is no person who better understands the issues adverted to in this Bill. His constituency is not unlike mine and the issues which are addressed in the Bill are certainly all-pervasive in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish I could put my hand on my heart and say that having listened to all the speeches in the House this Bill will make a huge difference to the lives of people. Based on my experience I am not filled with a great deal of confidence that such <Col N="822" /> will happen. We are quite good at introducing legislation but in many cases the enforcement of legislation leaves a lot to be desired. One of my colleagues from Dublin City Council, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is sitting on the other side of the House. He knows that the city council has introduced by-laws banning the consumption of alcohol in public places. By-laws have been introduced in the last two months to control the presence of dogs and horses in parks and public places. However, I see no great evidence of enforcement of those by-laws by the authorities. There is often a serious lack of connection between those who devise these laws and directives and those who implement them. If it was the case that having a high number of police and law enforcement agents would solve all the problems of society then Northern Ireland and South Africa would be two of the most peaceful societies in the world. I wish it were that simple. Deployment and management of resources must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>This Bill is aimed at countering the effects of alcohol on society, in particular the public disorder associated with its abuse in the vicinity of licensed premises and take-away food shops. Last weekend there was such a level of public disorder in parts of my constituency in and around public houses that the Garda stopped making arrests under the Public Order Act because they were overwhelmed by the numbers involved in public disorder. Instead they were forced to engage in mere fire brigade action just to contain the situation. Last Sunday I saw a queue of people filling the church to venerate a relic of Padre Pio while just a mile away there was a queue of about 100 people waiting outside a local public house and preparing to consume vast amounts of alcohol for the rest of the day. That public house was forced to close its doors during the day. These two events show the contradictions in Irish society.</P>
    <P>There is a vast amount of anti-social behaviour and I wonder if it is something that was invented only when the middle classes became concerned about it. Deputy Rabbitte and I were contributors one night on the Vincent Browne programme a few years ago. Vincent asked me, as only Vincent can, what was the biggest problem in my area. I said that it was anti-social behaviour. Vincent screamed and skitted at the top of his voice: &ldquo;Anti-social behaviour. What is that?&rdquo; I invited him to come to some areas of my constituency and try living there for a week with children as young as eight and nine years of age drinking from all hours of the morning and playing music until all hours at night and he would then know what constituted anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>Bank holidays are hated in some parts of my constituency and the Garda hate them also. From Wednesday prior to a bank holiday the Garda are forced to deploy extra resources on overtime in order to counteract the effects of the amount of drink being sold to youngsters by off-licences and public houses. I have seen youngsters heading off up the fields carrying trays of cans. As my col<Col N="823" /> league, Deputy John McGuinness, noted, they head up to the fields into an adjacent local authority area over which we have no control. The Garda endeavour to arrest them but the local authority, Dublin City Council, is powerless because it does not own the land where the activity, which includes robbing and burning cars, takes place.</P>
    <P>I wish to make some suggestions. I cannot understand why society is not prepared to grasp the nettle of a national ID scheme. I heard Deputy Coveney say that young people should carry ID but I believe that everybody should have ID. I would not discriminate against young people in this regard. It is long past the time when we should introduce a national ID system. It would prevent young people being harassed as they are at present. It would ensure that owners of licensed premises act responsibly in the manner in which they distribute drink. I wonder if publicans are ever reminded of their obligation not to supply drink to people who are obviously drunk.</P>
    <P>Being drunk seems to be a badge of honour. I heard an RTE reporter lauding the great Irish people who on the night before the Cameroon match were able to get drunk out of their minds and then queue up outside the famous bar in Portobello where everybody including Sky News goes and where they were again served. There is no control. There is certainly no control when people laugh about a leading pundit appearing on television pleading his tiredness and emotional condition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he did not. Operators of licensed premises have a responsibility and they should be reminded of it. How often do the gardaí visit these places? There are pubs in my constituency which rarely seem to see gardaí and many of those pubs seem to open until any hour of the night. People have told me they hear the clatter of shutters coming down outside such pubs at 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. and I have heard the same about take-away restaurants. As another speaker said, there are certain restrictions imposed on take-aways by the planning legislation but those are circumvented by the establishments pulling down their shutters and continuing to serve pizzas, curries and so on after hours. Responsibility must be taken by the owners of licensed premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Serving drink to minors is also a scandal. There has not been a single successful prosecution in Dublin in recent weeks against premises which have been caught selling drink to minors. They are being prosecuted but their barristers are able to identify loopholes in the legislation and their clients get off scot-free. Unless this Bill is tightened up loopholes will also be found in it and there will be no prosecutions. Until such time as <Col N="824" /> publicans are made to feel the pain they will not do anything. They need to be prosecuted vigorously.</P>
    <P>I did not want to see a complete ban on alcohol advertising but I am coming close to that position. Alcohol abuse is at least as insidious and more widespread than tobacco abuse. When one sees &ldquo;Pure magic&rdquo; emblazoned across the Irish flag by a certain drinks company, it raises questions about the subliminal messages the advertising industry is putting out on behalf of the drinks industry. There should be a voluntary attempt to curb the amount of alcohol advertising. The most innovative television advertisements are associated with alcohol and they must cost a small fortune to put together, therefore the companies are making a small fortune out of them. This matter should be pursued.</P>
    <P>Regarding the restriction of opening hours, when one sees a pub, either in my constituency or elsewhere, with three or four burly bouncers on the door at 10.30 a.m. one has to wonder at its ethos. It speaks volumes about our society when that has to be done.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Noel Ahern on his appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for the environment and wider issues of social inclusion. This is a multi-agency issue and it is only by adopting the kind of multi-agency approach envisaged by his appointment that we will ever get anywhere with this problem. It is some time since a drugs task force of which I am a member suggested that as much attention be paid to the abuse of alcohol by youngsters as to the abuse of drugs. It is only now that this is coming to the fore as something that needs to be tackled. In relation to other initiatives, I agree that the introduction of CCTV would make a huge difference. In Finglas, money was allocated for it but it was announced by three Ministers, most of whom were from my party, over the last ten years. The Garda authorities suggested 21 to 23 cameras but only nine have been sanctioned, which is nowhere near enough. The Garda inspector responsible went to various agencies &ndash; the city council, the drugs task force and the health board &ndash; and got them to make a contribution towards providing additional cameras. Red tape in the Commissioner's office means it has been impossible to establish whether it is regarded by them as appropriate that contributions like this should be made towards funding a CCTV scheme.</P>
    <P>Regarding the monitoring of this project, Finglas Garda station was built as a small country station early in the last century with a little extension tacked onto it in the 1960s. Finglas now has a population as large as the city of Limerick but it still has one tiny Garda station. If CCTV is established in Finglas it will be monitored, with luck, by the gardaí &ndash; though why it should be gardaí I do not know &ndash; from a Portakabin in an already inadequate car park beside the station. Issues such as the deployment of resources are <Col N="825" /> the key to this fight against public disorder. I could go on for another half an hour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Michael McDowell on his appointment to the prestigious position of Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He is an excellent choice and will do wonderful work. He is tackling the issues.</P>
      <P>Last year we changed the licensing laws by amendment under pressure from the vintners. I am from a rural area and there have been major changes in law and order on our streets after closing time. We were told we had to make that change because we were losing tourists and we had to have longer opening hours such as one finds abroad. However, those of us who go to foreign tourist resorts never see foreigners staying late in the pubs; the Irish and British tend to stay late. Drink is part of Irish culture and it has an effect on our rural areas. I sympathise with previous contributors.</P>
      <P>The Garda are getting more powers but we must also revisit the licensing laws which were amended last year. This Bill goes part of the way but it is insufficient. Sunday opening hours have caused much damage to our society. In the past pubs closed at 2 p.m. and reopened at 5 p.m. We must look at that as well as the fact that people are coming out of discos up to 4 a.m. That has done a lot of damage to our communities.</P>
      <P>Closing times should be more uniform. At present there is a lot of room to manoeuvre given the different closing times for different days of the week and bank holidays. We are seeing high levels of assault, lives being threatened and rowdy behaviour in discos, pubs and take-aways. Fast food outlets feature in the Bill and have been mentioned by many speakers. They will always be a source of problems because people congregate there in large numbers and can be provoked. There are rows in such places even without drink. We will not solve this problem by closing take-aways or penalising them further. The problem is related to drink and limiting the number of take-aways in a town will result in huge numbers congregating at them, causing rowdy behaviour and blackguarding.</P>
      <P>What have we done by extending the hours of drinking? People have only so much money to spend. Parents are going out later and coming home later and the result is there is less order in the home. That is due to the drink culture in Ireland. People will not leave a pub until the last minute or until we are forced to leave. That is our culture and we are disturbing the fabric of our society with these late hours. This has to be examined in some form or other. The high level of drinking results in more illnesses and assaults, which take up hospital beds, and higher insurance premiums. Our gardaí are put under severe pressure and are afraid to go onto the streets &ndash; they are being assaulted and their vehicles are damaged night after night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in a little country town one night recently <Col N="826" /> where 400 people left a disco. When they got on to the street two squad cars arrived because of disturbance in the area. The Garda arrested some of the individuals and took them to the Garda station. Rows broke out and the gardaí were embroiled in them and were injured. That is part of the problem with drink. I take a drink and do not want to be a spoilsport or a killjoy, as the Minister said in his speech.</P>
    <P>We see what happened in France during the past few days where there is a new Government with a more right-wing approach which is going to deal with law and order. We will have to look at it on that basis. I am not the most right-wing person in the House but law and order has broken down in our streets and towns. The breakdown of land and order has always been associated with highly populated areas but a problem is arising in our country towns and villages. Rowdy behaviour and blackguardism is increasing.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the role of drink in the problem, which has to be looked at realistically. We are now more educated which should result in a better society, but that has not happened. I am concerned about law and order. I am concerned also about pubs which in rural areas are mainly owned by families who are under severe pressure with the long opening hours. I appeal to the Minister, side by side with the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill which is good legislation, to revisit the licensing laws. There is support for that and those laws have to be looked at in the light the change that took place last year. That change was forced upon the Government by the vintners' association who stated there was room for change and longer opening hours.</P>

In my role as a parent of three teenagers my concerns, like those of most parents, are about their safety at night and the environment abroad, especially in urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has provided a useful forum for Deputies to unburden themselves of the persistent representations that were undoubtedly made to them throughout the general election campaign. It is evident from listening to the tenor of remarks from the Government's backbenchers that there is very little difference in their comments and those of Members on this side regarding the extent of public concern and alarm about the breakdown of public order and the extent of anti-social behaviour. That is different from saying this is a good Bill. It seems to be a minimalist Bill and I have an open mind as to whether it is worth proceeding with it. Already a number of lucid criticisms have been advanced and I look <Col N="827" /> forward to hearing the Minister's response in due course.</P>
    <P>For example, the new Opposition spokesman for Fine Gael, Deputy Deasy, made a number of interesting remarks. He also made a number of remarks that makes the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform eligible as a left-wing social democrat or even eligible for Deputy Joe Higgins's party. On that basis I look forward to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy's main point concerned the value of the Bill, <i>per se,</i> in terms of addressing the phenomenon on which so many Deputies have contributed. I look forward to hearing about that from the Minister because, clearly, he has inherited this legislation. It is apparent to anyone that the remark by my colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, that this legislation is the subject of general election focus groups in Mount Street rather than officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, cannot be gainsaid. The general election is over but it is clear the Government parties, in particular Fianna Fáil, were alarmed by the extent of public concern about public disorder on our streets and outside our places of entertainment. They got the message back forcibly that this is a major issue among what are described in the Minister's speech as &ldquo;ordinary citizens&rdquo;. I am not sure about the interpretation of &ldquo;ordinary citizens&rdquo; by the Minister or his officials. I think it is because &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; citizens have been affected that there has been a rush to legislate and a rush to respond.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, will agree with me, if not in the House then outside it, that in huge tracts of his constituency as well as mine this phenomenon has been a factor for years. There has been a breakdown of public order in parts of both constituencies and parts of working class urban areas for years. There have been terrible incidents of thuggery, violence and death and there has been very little response to it. However, when some of the better known names in the better off parts of this city began to manifest the same sentiments and when terrible incidents took place outside some of the more fashionable night clubs and drinking emporiums in this city, we got the type of response portrayed in this Bill. When it became a factor in the better off areas of the city, clearly the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform officials were persuaded by the Minister of the day that they had to do something about it. In other parts of the city and other parts of Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Galway, Waterford etc. this kind of conduct has been taking place for years and there has been no effective response to it. I unashamedly say, as did my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, there is a class bias in the approach to the formulation of legislation by the Department and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I refer to the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. We do not know the colour of the new Minister's legislation yet.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" />I do not want to fight the general election all over again but it is apparent to everybody that the performance of the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform measured against his own yardstick of &ldquo;are people safer in their homes when I leave office than they are now&rdquo;&ndash; that was his promulgation after becoming Minister &ndash; is that people do not feel safer in their homes and do not feel safer walking the streets of our cities. I am at a loss to understand how that has not permeated the Department because I do not believe the previous Minister ever came to grips with urban Ireland. I do not make that comment in any partisan way because he is a genuine public representative doing his job according to his own likes. I do not think he understands the circumstances in which citizens in urban areas are expected to live. It is more disturbing that there is no great evidence that the officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform understand these circumstances and the quality of life imposed on people in huge tracts of marginalised Ireland either. That worries me a great deal more.</P>
    <P>There have been no focus groups in Mount Street on the problems that beset working class areas of this city. If there were, we would have had legislation on it. There was a not very effective response to terrible incidents in Malahide, outside the Burlington Hotel and in a number of other areas I will not mention here. I will refer to that issue later. There has been no adequate response to the situation that besets my constituency where people are besieged in their own homes, where people who are different are selected for persecution, where women living alone live in fear, where people are fearful of crossing the street because of the activity of so-called joy riders and where there is open intimidation by gangs of young thugs who seem either to have nothing else to do or are intent on making ugly the environment in which they live.</P>
    <P>I received an e-mail today at lunch time which is typical of what I get. Listening to Deputy Carey and Deputy McGuinness and one or two others, it is clear that Government Deputies are getting the same thing. This one, mentioning a particular area and a particular public house and off-licence, states:</P>
    <P>To date, this publican has not responded to us in any way, which only serves to heighten our concerns. This weekend there have been extremely serious violent attacks in the vicinity of [they name the pub and off-licence] by roving gangs of youths both under age and under the influence of alcohol. These incidents are only added to an extremely long list of similar incidents which illustrates that this situation is getting out of control.</P>
    <P>They attach the copy of the letter that they sent to the owner of the premises in question in which they said: &ldquo;Unrestricted and unlawful sale of alcohol to minors has directly contributed to a dramatic increase in the following: vandalism, <Col N="829" /> intimidation, bullying of the vulnerable, severe harassment, violence, assaults, theft, loitering with intent, drunk driving, incitement to racial violence&rdquo;. That correspondence is not in any way different from the correspondence being received by Members on the Government benches. That is the reality of life in parts of urban Dublin and there does not seem to be any wish on the part of this House, the Oireachtas, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the outgoing Minister to address it. That leaves us with hundreds of thousands of citizens living and enduring a quality of life that is unconscionable in the times in which we live.</P>
    <P>There are no focus groups to highlight the absence of youth facilities. The Bill, whatever one might think about it, proposes certain measures to address miscreants after they have committed a crime. There is nothing preventative in the Bill. There is nothing that details the absence of youth facilities and recreation amenities that no doubt contributes to problems in areas where the characterisation is one of great disadvantage, early school drop-out and so on. There is no infrastructure or amenities. Usually, there will be an off-licence or a pub and, it seems, no action is taken against the wholesale sale of alcohol to minors. Deputy Carey observed that there has been no conviction in this city for the offence of selling to those who are under age. I do not know whether that is true, but it is effectively true in my constituency. It is going on wholesale and there is no response to it.</P>
    <P>It is this kind of environment that prompts me to question whether the spending of &euro;1 billion, which is largely public money, on building a sporting emporium at a site that is difficult to access is the best use of public money. A fraction of that money spent on sporting and other recreational facilities in the community would make a much more significant contribution to addressing this problem. However, that argument seems to have been lost and the idea abandoned, including, unfortunately, by the new Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who was very vocal on that point during the course of the election. Ministerial office can be deluding and seductive and obviously that is what has happened here.</P>
    <P>I do not see much in the Bill other than the proposals to be able to make exclusion orders and apply for closure orders. The closure order is already provided for under sections 13 and 14 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, for the offence of selling alcohol to underage people. Have there been any prosecutions mounted under that provision? I would like to hear the Minister's views on that. If that measure has not been effective in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, why is it proposed to replicate it in this legislation? I would like to hear the Minister address that point because it seems to be fraught with all kinds of difficulties. Who is to say the owner of the premises outside which an affray or breakdown of public order or the offence contemplated by this legislation happens <Col N="830" /> is responsible? Very often the pattern in this city is that young people are well tanked up before they go to the late-night drinking place where the contemplated crime is supposed to have happened. How, therefore, can this be efficacious? How can it be applied? We seem to have no difficulty coming forward with new legislation to meet this or that imagined or real problem, but enforcement does not seem to be something with which we are overly concerned. If a measure in one piece of legislation has proved ineffective, how is it supposed to be more effective in another?</P>
    <P>I am not sure I understand the relevance of exclusion orders. What does it matter to the ringleaders in a public affray that they may be excluded from a venue in the future? Many of them are visitors in any event, from a different part of the city, from a different city or from abroad. I do not know that the possibility of an exclusion order is something that will make them worry about whether they should or should not behave themselves. Many such offences are committed in such a fashion that an exclusion order would not have any meaning. The inference is that some of these dreadful incidents are the work of <i>agents provocateurs</i> and that if they could be weeded out, there would not be a problem because an exclusion order is something they would find unacceptable. I can see that it might be a problem if one was excluded from one's local pub because one might be separated from one's friends. However, given the kind and scale of problem with which we are dealing, an exclusion order would not be much of a deterrent. I do not see it as a major issue.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives additional powers to the gardaí. I would like to hear the new Minister on the whole question of the extent of alienation, among young people in particular, from the Garda. In the interests of society and gardaí themselves, it is imperative that we address this issue. That would be a suitable issue for the Fianna Fáil component of the Government to conduct some of its focus groups, inside or outside Mount Street, because it is a matter of the most grave concern that there is such alienation from the gardaí among young people and that there is such a conviction among young people that there is abuse of power by individual gardaí that reflects badly on the force generally and on the many hundreds of decent gardaí who are trying to do a conscientious day's work. That is a grave matter of concern.</P>
    <P>I want to make a proposal to the new Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform which, at the same time as dealing with the question of accountability of gardaí, would also serve to give a new dimension and important role to local government. Why are we virtually unique in not providing for democratic accountability when it comes to the Garda Síochána? Why do we suppose the Garda Síochána is different from the rest of us? We have seen in so many walks of Irish life, including politics, that we should not make <Col N="831" /> any such assumption. Even the Church, which is not a democratic institution, has to subject itself ultimately to some accountability but there is no effective accountability on the part of the Garda Síochána. The gardaí themselves admit that the Garda Complaints Board is virtually farcical. It is nonsense to recommend to a constituent that he or she should pursue a case to the Garda Complaints Board.</P>
    <P>I propose to the Minister that he statutorily gives expression to a requirement on the most senior gardaí of whatever district to present before the county council, the corporation or a sub-committee of the county council or corporation on a regular, structured basis where there can be an exchange of views between the elected members at local government and the senior gardaí. That would lead not just to improved accountability but improved policing, would enhance the stature and standing of the Garda Síochána and allow local representatives an opportunity to return to the issues raised with them by residents' associations everywhere. I see my colleague, Deputy O'Connor, in the House. He will confirm that everywhere we go residents' associations raise questions with us about the responsiveness and efficacy of the role of policing in society. I suggest to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that if he were to bring forward proposals like that on a statutory basis, it would lead to badly needed and productive reforms in policing in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity of speaking on the Bill. Last November I carried out a survey in Tralee and the findings of that survey confirmed what I expected, namely, that there was grave concern in the town which would reflect similar concerns in towns of its size across the country. It showed, for example, that 86% of the population feared walking the town after dark and that of the parents with teenage children, a staggering 65% feared for their safety when they were out at night. In the same period, between November and Christmas, six gardaí were assaulted on the streets of Tralee, including one female garda who was viciously assaulted. At the time I published these worrying statistics, the then Minister referred to them as balderdash, but the reality was otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tralee is a microcosm of what is happening throughout the country and there are a number of reasons for that. Since the 1950s, crime has almost doubled every decade and it is an increasing phenomenon that violent crime, where actual bodily harm is caused, is very much on the increase. The latest statistics up to 2000 &ndash; we <Col N="832" /> await with interest the statistics for 2001 &ndash; showed that the incidence of violent crime had increased by 131% over the previous year and that approximately 11,400 assaults were reported to the Garda.</P>
    <P>The most recent statistics for 2000 indicate that in accident and emergency departments throughout the country, approximately 5,000 people needed overnight care because of violent assault. If one compares the official Garda crime figures to those from accident and emergency departments and even some general practitioners, it is obvious that there is a large discrepancy. People who are attacked outside public houses and other places generally do not report the crime because they may not be badly injured, they are too embarrassed to report it or they do not want to get into further trouble with their assailant. There is a major problem, however, and while the Bill is well intentioned, I am not sure it will have the desired effect. I will refer to that issue later.</P>
    <P>A significant development in recent years which has contributed more to public disorder and the assaults we have witnessed is the extension of licensing hours, which was referred to by a number of speakers. There was no need to extend licensing hours, lobbying for which supposedly came from the tourism industry. The incidence of attacks on tourists here gets widespread attention from the international media but the extension of licensing hours has been counterproductive in terms of promoting Ireland as a destination for tourists. These attacks are widely reported and bad news travels fast. Even our competitors are inclined to subtly use the &ldquo;Ireland's streets are not safe&rdquo; message against us. Rather than being an advantage to our tourism industry the extended licensing hours have become a major disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State on being reappointed to his Ministry but if the Minister were here I would ask him to review the licensing laws with a view to at least restoring them to the former hours. I have met numerous publicans in tourist destinations across the country who would have no objection to the licensing hours being restored to their former times or something similar. That is worth considering with the Licensed Vintners' Association because all the trouble takes place when young people spill out on to the streets at 2 a.m. and it is impossible for the gardaí to control many locations at different times. I am most familiar with Tralee in which there are about six locations where young people gather. If there are six gardaí on duty at night there will be two in a car and four on foot patrol. Some of them are engaged in community duties in council estates in the town. There is no way two or three gardaí can cope with the number of young people on the street if trouble breaks out. If trouble breaks out there is a tendency for people to get involved even if they were not involved initially. The licensing laws will have to be looked at very closely.</P>
    <P>Gardaí are demoralised because of the lack of <Col N="833" /> support they are getting in terms of resources and equipment but also because of the criticism they receive, some of which emanates from this House. The Garda Siochána must be subject to the same scrutiny as any other group. They have gone through a very difficult period recently. The rank and file of the Garda Siochána are fine and responsible people. That is the reason they took their jobs. They are professional career people who must have a vocation for their job which is not an easy one. No-one in our job has to arrest or handle people. The Garda has an onerous responsibility. Any support either we or the Minister can give its members will be helpful.</P>
    <P>We need more foot patrols on the streets. This point has been raised by a number of speakers. I am convinced that the law and order promises in the Fianna Fáil manifesto in 1997 helped change the Government. However, that Government did not follow through on its commitments. It made a commitment to put more gardaí on the streets but it did not. There was an increase of only 8% in the number of gardaí in Cork city and county between 1997 and 2001. In the Minister of State's home city of Limerick there was an increase of only 4%. In the Dublin metropolitan area the increase was only 4% despite an increase of public disorder on the streets. The last Government did not deliver on foot patrols, gardaí on the beat, the extension of closed circuit television and a whole range of other measures. The Government promised that it would withdraw gardaí from routine civilian work and traffic duties so that they would not be pushing pens at their desks but would be out among the public. That has not happened.</P>
    <P>Public order must be addressed by a review of the licensing hours, a rethink of the number of gardaí on the beat and the proper equipping of the gardaí to allow them to cope with major public disorder incidents. There is also the question of providing proper alternative facilities for young people. In Paris young people gather in coffee shops where music is played but no alcoholic beverages are served.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG" hpid="Mr. English Mr. English">
      <NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate to be negative but I agree with Deputy Deasy that this Bill is a waste of time. It is worthless and it is not the answer to street violence. I have an interest in this as I have run a pub for the past couple of years. I cannot see this doing anything for me or the people on the streets. There is a breakdown in society in recent years, especially over the past five years, and it is a major crisis. By breakdown I mean there is a breakdown in respect. Many young people no longer have any respect. They do not respect their school teachers and they do not respect the gardaí. Lack of respect is the real problem in modern society. The Government is introducing ill-thought out legislation &ndash; which is simply being done to be seen to be doing something &ndash; rather than having the courage to admit <Col N="834" /> there is a real problem and there are no statutory implements to deal with it.</P>
      <P>The problem falls between the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science, Arts, Sport and Tourism, Environment and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It needs to be addressed in that context and not with legislation like this. This Bill is a case of wasting our time and resources and wasting the time of the gardaí. Why should the Garda need the power to close a place? There is no point in shutting the gate when the horse has bolted. Why are we not considering prevention? Why do we constantly move the problems from one place to another and sweep them under the carpet? These worthless powers which we are giving to the gardaí are neither needed nor wanted. The time of the gardaí is taken up with things of lesser importance than preventing crime. In the Louth-Meath area the gardaí have to answer about 10,000 alarm calls each year, the majority of which are mistakes. Surely we can look at other ways of dealing with these alarm calls. When I tried to open a bank account in my home town I had to go to the Garda station. Why are we putting so much pressure on our gardaí? When one applies for a gun licence or passport one must also go to a Garda station. We must find other ways of relieving the gardaí of these duties and allowing them to work on the street. They are trained to be on the street, it is where they are needed and where they want to be.</P>
      <P>The causes of the problem stem from the abuse of alcohol, drugs and other substances. There are no alternative venues for our young people. I spent a few years working in fast food take-aways in Navan in which 12 to 14 year olds used to hang out. They want something to do but they are not getting a choice. We must provide youth centres where they can hang out and have a chat. What happens at the moment is that a group of, say, ten gather on a street because there is no place to go. There may only be one bad egg among them but that bad egg can infect the others and they will all find themselves in trouble. We owe it to our young people to give them a choice.</P>
      <P>What percentage of the advertising budgets for our major sporting events, GAA, soccer and the Olympic Games, is drink related? What kind of a message are we sending out? I do not suggest there is no place for sponsorship in sport, but young people are affected by what they see portrayed through advertising. This is obviously the case or companies would not advertise. It is meant to promote for young people the idea that the inside of public houses and clubs is something akin to paradise. The current Baileys advertisement, for example, would encourage any young person to go into a pub. Nowhere in Government policy is the counter story being told. From behind the bar, I have seen the effects that drink has on people of all ages. We must highlight it. If a person buys a packet of cigarettes, there is a warning but there is none with drink and we must accept responsibility for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" />This is not the only cause of the problem. If we look at Kells, Navan or Athboy in County Meath, for example, we can see a direct correlation between crime and lack of facilities. There is a GAA club in these places, which I welcome as I follow the GAA, but it is extraordinary that most pitches have a bar, which is becoming as essential as the goalposts, and this is the root of the problem. As a 24 year old former bar manager from Navan, I have witnessed public disorder at first hand. I have got black eyes, a bruised nose and death threats and if I thought that this legislation would save anyone else from such abuse, I would wholeheartedly support it. However, nothing in this Bill gives me any hope. It mentions exclusion orders and a fine of &euro;650. However, if a man gets his Christmas holidays and three or four weeks' bonus pay, he will go out looking for a good time and could arrive at my pub. If I tell him that he cannot come in because of an exclusion order and that he may be fined a couple of hundred euro, he will laugh at me first and then beat me up because the threat of such a fine will not bother him.</P>
    <P>Much of the violence on our streets originates from those not in the pubs. Groups of teenagers often cause problems on the streets. A neighbour of mine recently had to get a Garda escort out of a cinema because a gang of youths threatened him. As he was put into a patrol car, it was kicked by the youths. We must go further than this Bill envisages. One reason I sought election was to tackle this problem and I am willing to work with any Government Department which is serious about it.</P>
    <P>We should stop codding ourselves with this legislation which will make no difference &ndash; even the Minister does not believe it will make a difference. We should go back to the drawing board and begin by consulting all the people involved &ndash; pub and club owners, young people, those working in casualty departments and members of the Garda &ndash; and draft legislation with them. It will not be easy but anything that is worth doing is worth doing right. We should withdraw this Bill as it is not fooling us or the public. If in two week's time, I was to meet someone on the street who was drunk, he would neither realise nor care that we spent days discussing this, nor would a nurse in a casualty department who lives in fear of violence every weekend. This is because the Bill is not relevant to people.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the new Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not here as I would like to extend my congratulations on his appointment. He is recognised as a politician of considerable substance and it is, therefore, unfortunate that his first Bill in the House is not <Col N="836" /> substantial but more concerned with optics than objectives. The explanatory memorandum states that its purpose is to strengthen the law to deal more effectively with late night public disorder and disturbance which mainly has its origins in alcohol abuse. It is a laudable objective, but, undoubtedly, this Bill does not meet it. I agree with much of the criticism that has been expressed. No town is without this problem from time to time, which is increasing and can be serious and chronic, particularly in terms of injury and death. However, it cannot be dealt with in the way presented in this Bill, which is why I regret that it is the Minister's first as it does not do justice to him or the Government.</P>
      <P>All of us can paint, and some have already, lurid pictures of what can happen late at night in our own communities. In my area when many young people, some very young, go out at night, particularly at weekends, they tend to tank up in the pubs on the main street until they close and then go to night-clubs or places with an extended licence on the seafront. Sometimes the extent of drinking is so severe that the gardaí, or others, must deal with young men and women who do not know who or where they are, with extremely serious implications for health. I am not convinced that an exclusion order is a practical way of dealing with this as it may not be possible to monitor one. People can move from pub to pub and in the cities we have giant super pubs where the staff, who are often casual and may not be from this country, will not be able to stop people with an exclusion order from entering.</P>
      <P>Individual pictures are one thing, but there is also the national picture. It is clear to outsiders and to ourselves that drink is central to our cultural, sporting and community life. It is no accident that the quintessential totemic image of modern Ireland is of the Taoiseach with a pint of Bass in his hand. That expresses our kind of culture and, unfortunately, it is reinforced by that unhelpful image which certainly strikes a chord. In presenting that image to ourselves, we are not looking at the full picture. We do not take on board the fact that the level of binge drinking among 15 and 16 year olds is the highest in the European Union. We do not see it in the same way as the enjoyment and craic when everyone was having a wonderful time in the pub during the World Cup. There is no balance between the two. It is time we started to realise that binge drinking, which is too often evident, is an investment in ill health and affects the condition of young people's livers in 20 years' time and what is happening in our accident and emergency departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During a debate last year on the liberalisation of pub hours and on the selling of alcohol, it is interesting that the Minister's leader, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, was strongly in favour of deregulation, but the Minister for Health and Children took the opposite view. We need to get a clear idea from the Government, which presumably is embarking on a five year term of office, of <Col N="837" /> its view on alcohol policy because so far there have been two developments in tandem that are contradictory and mutually exclusive. The Minister for Health and Children has launched various phases of alcohol awareness campaigns during the past 18 months, but I am not conscious that anything good has come of them. I do not think that is possible when alcohol consumption is encouraged and promoted and its advertising is so powerful in terms of the message it sells. It sells sport, sex and drink. Of what more attractive combination could one think, and it all comes when one has a pint of beer.</P>
    <P>If we have a policy on the advertising of nicotine and clear rules on what is acceptable and legal, why are we so tolerant of alcohol advertising? Why does our judgment not function when it comes to assessing the impact of advertising on people. I do not mean only young people but everyone who is constantly bombarded with advertising messages that sell products, which is what advertising does, but in this case a product that is dangerous, if abused, and has many implications in terms of people's health, to the extent that the Minister for Health and Children has argued trenchantly against liberalisation of opening hours, which leads to an increase in consumption.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Heath and Children was responsible for making it well known that the WHO report in 1994 concluded that when alcohol is less available, less convenient to purchase or less accessible, consumption and alcohol related problems are lowered. That seems an obvious comment, but it is an issue that was not addressed when the licensing hours were extended and it is not addressed in terms of how pubs are developing, with the advent of many large-scale pubs. There may well be an argument for having smaller pubs that are easy to manage and can be monitored in regard to the enactment of legislation, if this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>This legislation will not make a significant difference. It promotes the idea that if the Garda had additional powers, this matter could be dealt with, but that is not the case. What is needed is a much more strategic approach which would take into account of issues such as education, community development and the provision of recreational facilities. The young people in my town of Bray spend too much time in the pubs and too little time in recreation not because they necessarily want to make that choice but because there is no choice. There is no swimming pool in my town, which is the eighth largest in the country. In one of the biggest areas of the town, Ballywaltrim, there is one community centre, which belongs in the Third World. It is an old Nissen hut from the Second World War. It is rat invested, lets in the rain and is in the type of substandard condition one would not be surprised to find in Nigeria, yet this is the alternative that is being offered to young people. In terms of whether they will expend their energies in the <Col N="838" /> pub or find other forms of activity to get together and engage with their friends, there is no contest.</P>
    <P>The people who sell drink have an interest in ensuring that there is no contest, but we do not sell drink, we are here to legislate. What is disturbing is that the Government appears to be pursuing the same objective pursued by the previous Government, concentrating on the high profile Abbotstown project that will cost more than &euro;1 billion instead of ensuring that at local level there are good and enriching recreational facilities that provide for the needs of girls and boys, young men and young women. I do not detect that the Government has that commitment and until we see that commitment there will not be a significant change in terms of alcohol abuse.</P>

      <P>The Minister has the power, but I hope all that power will not corrupt. He has power to withdraw this legislation and he should exercise that power. I do not see the benefit of an exclusion order. If one is imposed, the perpetrator can go to another public house and display the same type of unsuitable behaviour. In 1994 the gardaí demanded clamorously that we give them public order powers and they specified the powers they wanted. They are listed in the existing legislation and are quite draconian. They cover such behaviour as intoxication in a public place, disorderly conduct, threatening abuse and sulking behaviour, display of offensive material, failure to comply with a Garda direction and wilful obstruction. Two people hanging around a corner could be arrested under the existing legislation. The gardaí have enormous powers but they are not implementing them. There is no sense in giving them new powers, which again would be useless and unimplementable The best approach is to examine and consolidate the public order powers available to the gardaí rather than introduce new ones. The gardaí say they cannot do something because they do not have the necessary powers, but when they are given the powers the situation does not improve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should start to address this problem from the other direction by providing amenities for our youth, which does not come under the Minister's brief, and by examining other matters, including closing hours. People can leave pubs at 1 a.m. or 1.30 a.m. at the weekend and go to night clubs, which are effectively drinking dens, mostly large barns, because of a lack of deregulation in the public house arena. In most housing estates and new areas in Dublin there are large drinking barns. There is a variety of clubs in the city centre that effectively are drinking dens. After people <Col N="839" /> are well tanked up, they leave pubs at 1 a.m., go to night clubs and stay there until 4 a.m. It is almost inevitable that there will be confrontations in night clubs because there is anonymity among large groups of people, assembling at a time when they are already intoxicated. This must be examined. The question of bouncers and their control, training and professionalism must also be examined. In relation to advertising, there is something wrong when we see Guinness using the Irish flag to advertise drink.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is my first opportunity in the House I would like to compliment the Chair on his appointment as Ceann Comhairle and I pay tribute to Opposition spokespersons also on their appointment. The Chair's first decision in my presence is good in that it allows people to elicit information. I hope I will be able to give as much information as possible.</P>
      <P>The current status of the live cattle trade is that we are again free to trade in EU and third countries subject to adherence to EU rules, in the wake of last year's foot and mouth disease crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in 2000 Ireland was heading for a record year as regards live exports. However, in the autumn of that year, the increasing incidence of BSE in some EU member states and the discovery of the disease in other <Col N="840" /> member states which had thought themselves BSE free gave rise to a crisis in consumer confidence in beef which lead to a ban being imposed on live exports from the EU by some third countries. The outbreak of foot and mouth disease exacerbated the situation. Despite these events, markets in the European Union are now re-opened and live exports have re-commenced, albeit at a more moderate level.</P>
    <P>As for proposed changes in the transport rules for live animals, I understand the Commission is at present preparing a proposal to amend Council Directive 91/628 on the welfare of animals during transport, which will take into account certain aspects of a report on the welfare of animals during transport adopted by the EU's scientific committee on animal health and welfare on 11 March 2002. I emphasise that this proposal has not yet been published.</P>
    <P>However, I have made it clear in discussions in the EU Agricultural Council that I am committed to ensuring the live trade is permitted to continue, while at the same time ensuring the high standards of animal welfare during transport, which Ireland has played a pioneering role in developing, are maintained. My deliberations on any proposal in relation to animal transport emerging from the EU Commission will continue to be informed by these principles.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and Deputy Morgan for withdrawing his request. I congratulate the Minister on his reappointment and also congratulate his Ministers of State, Deputies Aylward and Treacy. It is a nice mixture, from the lush fields of Cork to the stone walls of Woodford and the cereal plains of Kilkenny. I also wish former Deputies Byrne and Davern well.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister tell me what third countries we have a live trade with and which ones we traded with that are now excluded to us? What measures has the Minister taken or does he propose to take to reopen these markets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>At present we export to one third country, the Lebanon, to where we have exported almost 8,000 cattle to date this year. In previous years we exported live cattle to Libya and Egypt. Despite visits I made on a number of occasions to both countries they have not reopened for the live trade. Egypt has reopened for beef but the only country for live trade is the Lebanon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the importance of the live trade. Can he give any hope that the live trade to Egypt and Libya may be reopened? When did he last visit either of these countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister aware of a report from the EU scientific committee on animal welfare during transport that has been given to the Commission? It lays down certain criteria for the transport of live cattle. It is reported that sailings should only take place if winds are likely to be below force <Col N="841" /> five. This could have a negative impact on Ireland if introduced. Has the Minister made any suggestions to the Commission or made submissions outlining our unique position? If such measures were brought in they would terminate this section of our industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Live exports to third countries is a difficult issue for the future. That is mainly because of BSE which is still a problem in the EU and Ireland. The attitude of countries like Egypt and Libya is that the risk is too high whereas for beef or the dead trade the risk material is removed. Despite that we continue our efforts. I visited Cairo on a number of occasions over the last couple of years and also visited Libya. We continue to use all Government and diplomatic pressure to seek a live and beef trade with access to as many outlets as possible. We are 90% dependant on exports.</P>
      <P>The EU scientific committee has adopted a report on the welfare of animals during transport including the gale force five proposal. Any crossings of animals in gale force five or greater would be precluded. That report is with the Commission at present. As a member state we will have an input into whatever comes from the Commission before any findings are adopted. We take animal welfare seriously and we pioneered the upgrading of ferries with adequate ventilation. We ensure there is no cruelty to animals and that they are in a good state when they arrive at their destination. That is in everybody's best interest. Everything possible that can be done in regard to the live trade is being done.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the significant crisis in farm incomes, he will consider the establishment of a commission on farm incomes to undertake an indepth study of current income levels and to make appropriate recommendations as to the way in which income levels might be improved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13962/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Recent data indicate that aggregate farm income has recovered following a number of difficult years in the late 1990s. Aggregate farm income rose by 5.8% in 2001 with an increase of 7.5% being recorded in 2000. Indeed my Department estimates, based on the Central Statistics Office quarterly national household survey, that the average income per person employed in agriculture increased by 16% in 2001 and 10% in 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest household budget survey for 1999-2000 shows that almost 60% of farm household income now comes from non-farm sources, including off-farm employment, social welfare and other income. The increased availability of off-farm employment opportunities in rural areas has contributed to the future viability of many <Col N="842" /> farm families. Because of the increasing importance of non-farm income to farm households, I have established a steering group on farm household income to assess up-to-date and comprehensive data in this area. My Department chairs this group, with participation from the CSO, Teagasc and the ESRI.</P>
    <P>Farm incomes are of central concern to me. My Department operates a range of measures including market supports and direct payments under the Common Agricultural Policy. Direct payments amount to &euro;1.4 billion annually and account for 56% of aggregate farm income. The Agri-food 2010 plan of action sets out the Government's vision for the future of the sector. The plan of action envisages a dynamic agri-food sector in 2010 offering farm families attractive and sustainable livelihood options, thus maintaining the maximum number of families on the land.</P>
    <P>I am aware that low income remains a difficulty for some farm families. The revised national anti-poverty strategy launched by the Government in February 2002 includes a specific focus on addressing rural poverty and disadvantage. Its objective is to tackle social exclusion in rural areas in a comprehensive and sustained manner by ensuring the provision of an adequate income, through employment and income support, access to adequate services and infrastructure on a timely basis and co-ordination of responses and empowerment of local people and communities.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>I am satisfied that the necessary policy framework, underpinned by both national and EU funding, is in place, together with appropriate monitoring and review arrangements, to ensure viability of the maximum number of farm households. I therefore do not consider that the establishment of a commission on farm income is required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is welcome back. He certainly is the epitome of ministerial longevity and has won all the shoot-outs at the OK Corral. In any event, today is my last day to shadow the Minister.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that farm incomes are under pressure in both the beef and milk sectors and that the price of these commodities has fallen in real terms while farm costs have continued to rise? Would he also agree that between 1996 and 2002 farm incomes declined by approximately 4% in real terms? This is inconsistent with the commitment given in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness that farm incomes would increase living standards in line with the norm in our economy. Does the Minister agree that this has not happened? Will he also agree that there are a number of factors internally that can be handled at national level but that a number of factors require international examination?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister not agree that the ICMSA proposal was fair and accurate? It proposed that the Minister would establish a commission on <Col N="843" /> farm income which would meet with the relevant bodies and examine why average farm income in 2002 was &euro;15,457 as opposed to the average industrial wage of &euro;28,909. Could that differential be examined? Does the Minister not agree that a commission on farm income would ensure that those problems would be addressed in a fair, objective and impartial manner? The commission could report in six months. It would be extremely helpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>A good Kildare man. I welcome him to that portfolio. Farm incomes are extremely diverse, depending on the size of the holding and the sector in which farmers operate. There is a substantial income, for example, in dairying. The national farm income survey carried out by Teagasc shows the considerable variation in farm income by system of farming, from an average of &euro;27,922 in dairying to an average of only &euro;7,644 in some cattle rearing systems. There is a big gap between the systems.</P>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point about looking at the difficulties in a number of farming areas. I have established a steering group on farm household income which comprises senior departmental personnel, the CSO, Teagasc and the ESRI. I hope it will make a positive contribution to ensuring that young people will look on farming as an attractive option.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I met Commissioner Fischler on 27 February 2002 to put forward my views in relation to the mid-term review of the Agenda 2000 agreement. I told Commissioner Fischler that, since the Agenda 2000 agreement was intended to last for the seven year period 2000 to 2006 and since farmers and other operators in the agri-food sector need a stable policy framework within which to conduct their business, the fundamental aspects of the agreement should be preserved. I also set out my views on various options for change being contemplated by the Commission and other member states. The review is expected to be published on 10 July next.</P>
      <P>The Agenda 2000 agreement was beneficial to Irish agriculture. It is my intention to protect the benefit of that agreement to the greatest extent possible in the negotiations on the review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>What did Commissioner Fischler say in his reply to the Minister? Did he give any indication that he would take the Minister's suggestions on board or did he indicate what road he might take? Can the Minister confirm that the mid-term review will be published in mid-July? If it is published, when will agreement on it be reached? Is the Minister aware that there is concern in the agriculture sector at the suggested decoupling of livestock premia by the introduction of area aid payments? If this course is followed, it will almost certainly lead to a reduction in direct payments for livestock farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In the best tradition of bilateral meetings, I received a sympathetic hearing from Commission Fischler. He had a clear understanding that in the final outcome of Agenda 2000 there was a legitimate expectation that the agreement lasted for seven years, up to 2006. There was provision for a review but not for a fundamental change to it. I made that point clear. The Commissioner said he would publish his proposals in the early summer but the US published its farm Bill and that will have a large bearing on world trade, which will impact on the European Union. His proposals were, therefore, postponed until 10 July. I expect they will be published on that date.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct that there are rumours emanating from Brussels in relation to decoupling. That would be serious for Irish farming. If people get paid an area based payment without the need to have livestock, that will inevitably lead to a decline in numbers of livestock with a consequent reduction in jobs in processing. There is also a worry about shifting payments from the direct payments pillar to indirect payments through community, Leaders or REPS payments.</P>
      <P>We will fight the good fight on behalf of Irish farmers to ensure that the amount of money paid to them will continue when the review is complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister seen the comments attributed to the German Chancellor that direct payments should be abolished? If so, has he a view on them? Did he inform the Taoiseach of them? Will the Taoiseach raise the matter at today's pre-summit meeting in Seville? There is a great deal of concern in the agriculture sector about this review. It will be published in July and, according to the Minister, finalised by the end of the year. The issue should be finalised before the Nice Treaty referendum. It will cause great concern and difficulty and should be finalised. If memory serves, the last Government gave a commitment that it would not accept the decoupling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the suggestion made by the German Chancellor in relation to direct payments. I reject his suggestion. Direct payments are extremely important to Irish agriculture. They comprise approximately 56% of farm incomes and amount to &euro;1.4 billion per <Col N="845" /> annum. By any standard that is a huge amount of money to be circulated to individual farmers. We will insist that the direct payment system and the extent of payment continue.</P>
      <P>With regard to decoupling, it at least has the advantage that it would not be under threat in the WTO round because it would be confined to the green box. I cannot answer the Deputy's question about when the negotiations on the mid-term review will be complete. Negotiations take a long time in Brussels and although I would like if they were finished before the next referendum on the Nice treaty, I doubt that will happen. Offices in Brussels tend to close for holidays in July and August, but the referendum is not expected until October. I am aware of the concerns expressed by the Members of the House and I have explained them to Commissioner Fischler. I will work to ensure the best possible outcome for Ireland, just as I did during the Agenda 2000 negotiations.</P>

      <P>Applications for the potato sector under the capital investment scheme for marketing and processing certain agricultural products were considered at a meeting of the selection committee on 20 March. The committee considered all 25 applications received at the meeting, with a grant aid requirement of almost &euro;10 million. The funding available amounted to &euro;2.1 million. In order to allocate the limited funding available, applications were evaluated with reference to viability, target markets, their sectoral and regional impacts, particularly at primary producer level, and the extent to which they may improve the saleability of the primary product. The committee also took into account the significant levels of aid awarded to this sector under previous FEOGA schemes. Having considered all factors and the individual applications, the committee selected seven projects for the award of grant aid. Subsequently, my Department wrote to the unsuccessful applicants under the current tranche to inform them that their applications are being retained. If further funding becomes available, these applications will be considered along with all other eligible applications. While this allows applicants to proceed with work if they so wish, funding available under the scheme is limited and eligibility does not automatically confer entitlement to grant aid.</P>

      <Quest>the measures he intends to put in place to help alleviate the current crisis in the dairy sector, particularly in view of the unprecedented bad weather and falling milk prices.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The international market situation for milk products entered a period of decline in the third quarter of 2001 and this decline has deepened since then. Demand is weak for all products in all markets, primarily due to the economic slowdown in key international economies. In an effort to stimulate renewed demand I have pressed the EU Commission continuously for decisive action, utilising all the market mechanisms available at EU level for this purpose. In the past month I have exerted particularly strong pressure on the Commission and I have put a range of proposals to Commissioner Fischler, including the need to adopt a more aggressive export refunds policy, to prolong intervention for skim milk powder and to encourage greater utilisation of internal supports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that the Commission has <Col N="849" /> responded to my proposals by increasing export refunds for cheese by 15%, further increasing skim milk powder and whole milk powder export refunds by 10% and 5% respectively, increasing aid for the manufacture of casein by 52% and agreeing to continue intervention for skim milk powder in excess of the threshold of 109,000 tonnes by means of a tendering system. In relation to this tendering mechanism, I have asked the Commission to ensure it is used to ensure maximum stability for the skim market on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>These initiatives, taken in the last few weeks, follow a number of actions taken at EU level since the current market deterioration became evident last November. Export refunds for skim milk powder and whole milk powder were increased on five separate occasions and following the latest increase they stand at &euro;715 and &euro;1,078 per tonne respectively. Export refunds for butter were increased twice to their current level of &euro;1,750 per tonne and private storage aid was introduced for butter and cheese. In addition, the main internal support measures such as aids for the use of butter in the ice cream and pastry sectors and aid for the use of skim milk powder in animal feed continue to take up significant quantities. I am fully aware of the situation and I will continue to closely monitor the market for dairy products to ensure every possible action is taken at community level to stimulate demand and to protect the incomes of dairy farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Milk prices have fallen by more than 10p per gallon since September and all the major co-ops have said they will decrease the price of milk in the coming months. The unprecedented bad weather has led to an emergency situation whereby cows which normally produce up to four gallons of milk per day in June and July are now almost dry. Will the Minister take any immediate action to help these farmers? He must not understand how bad the situation is given that the answer he gave applied to a more overall view. I am talking about the immediate crisis currently facing farmers. It is raining every day, silage cannot be made and farmers have huge problems. I want to know what the Minister is doing for these people as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This year has been difficult for the dairy industry since at least last Christmas. I enumerated the various initiatives taken and assistance given in terms of export refunds, intervention, subsidies and so on. Nevertheless, there is over-supply and a surplus. Just last week I spoke again with Commissioner Fischler and got the 109,000 tonnes ceiling on intervention lifted so that additional product could be put into intervention. I met with the dairy executives a few weeks ago. I again met with representatives approximately ten days ago and I am fully conversant with the situation. I accept the Deputy's <Col N="850" /> comment that together with the difficult market situation, the weather is also contributing to the problems. At this time of year, farmers would have cows out but they are currently inside eating silage. They are finding it difficult to make quality silage for the winter. As I am very familiar with the problem, I have taken an unprecedented level of initiatives to try to ameliorate it.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of a number of co-ops reducing prices. In fact, one of the co-ops not so far from the Deputy's area, Glanbia, has said it will hold prices for the immediate future, which is good news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister accepts the situation is bad, will he not introduce some emergency measures to help the Irish dairy industry? The reality is that his predecessor, former Minister and Deputy, Ivan Yates, introduced a special package of measures to deal with an unprecedented crisis. Some people are on the threshold of financial disaster. The reality is that the dairy industry is the cornerstone of agriculture. Can the Minister convince the bureaucrats in Brussels of Ireland's special position? He must lobby in Brussels on behalf of these people to try to obtain emergency measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 48 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have devoted considerable effort to simplifying scheme applications and to improving my Department's level of service to farmers. I have introduced several measures using information technology to facilitate farmers in making their direct aid applications. These include the pre-printing of personal details &ndash; name, address, herd number and so on &ndash; on application forms, the use of bar-codes on bovine animal passports &ndash; this eliminates in most cases the necessity to list tag numbers on application forms, the provision of herd profiles to assist farmers in filling census forms for the extensification premium scheme, automatic processing of entitlement to slaughter premium without the necessity to sub<Col N="851" /> mit applications and removal of certain notification requirements in relation to bovine schemes where the information can be obtained from databases.</P>
    <P>I have been to the forefront in pressing Commissioner Fischler to simplify the direct payments regulations and to provide for a more proportionate penalty regime. As a result, some major changes have been introduced in the scheme provisions starting this year. EU regulations now provide for reduced penalties for submission of late area aid applications involving only permanent pasture, a reduction in the level of inspections in respect of bovine livestock applications from 10% of applications to 5% of farmers submitting such applications, no penalties for over-declaration of forage area where the area found is sufficient, no penalties for over-declaration of forage area for extensification premium purposes and more flexibility for amending and withdrawing applications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respect to the Minister, one almost gets a headache listening to the replies when talking about red tape. Will the Minister agree that in every walk of life, including personal, industrial or sales services, efforts are being made to be more user-friendly and that the agricultural area is the only one which is becoming increasingly difficult? Will he agree that compliance costs are increasing while benefits remain static? Is there any way a case can be made for a cut-off point, say, &euro;5,000, so that people who get direct payments would not have to comply with the same system as those who get greater payments? I believe people will decline from making claims due to the red tape involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Has any appeal been heard to date by the independent appeals office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>A couple of questions have been tabled on the appeals office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to red tape, there is a certain amount of bureaucracy and red tape. There is certainly much disquiet, complaint and vexation about this. The facts are that &euro;1.4 billion is spent on payments to farmers throughout the country, making up approximately 56% or 57% of their income. There is a requirement for accountability on control and so on but one does not want to overdo it. The Department has a protocol in regard to payments. There are regular meetings of the protocol body with the farming organisations. They have introduced simplification measures which I outlined and they will continue to do so. Under the review of the Common Agricultural Policy, decoupling and area based payments will wipe <Col N="852" /> out much of the requirement for individual livestock payments and get rid of much of the red tape. However, there is a downside to this. The Deputy asked if smaller farmers could make applications without having to go through so much red tape. There is such a requirement but the EU imposed so many conditions that many farmers did not respond.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the ideal situation would be to have an office in each county specifically designated to deal with forms at a pre-application level to ensure they are correct? This would allow a greater freeflow.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave a commitment to this House that the provisions of the Agricultural Appeals Bill would be implemented. However, it has been indicated that oral hearings will not be allowed despite the commitment to this House that the model used for the agricultural appeals system would be identical to that used in social welfare appeals? If that is the position we have been seriously misled and there has been a serious derogation of commitments given on the floor of this House. I accepted the commitment because it would allow for oral hearings, with non-legal independent advice, which would help people in processing appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the appeals office, that is the subject of Question No. 12, which I will be pleased to answer.</P>
      <P>I certainly gave a solemn commitment to this House that there would be a facility for oral hearings. I was pressed by Deputy Penrose on that matter and it is my understanding that it will happen.</P>
      <P>On the question of payments generally, the degree of accountability and requirement on applications to meet certain commitments, the facts are that recent countrywide meetings were very well attended. Surveys were carried out both by the main farming organisation and the Department.</P>
      <P>There was a relatively low response from farmers to these schemes. The response, in so far as there was one, showed that about three quarters of farmers were satisfied or very satisfied with the way the Department deals with these matters. Department offices throughout the country are staffed by people who are humane and friendly, a customer friendly service is extended and I expect that to continue. Having said that, I am still of the view that we can simplify applications further and be more helpful to applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the annual filling out of these forms is a terrifying ordeal for most farmers, particularly those in the west where many are in their 60s or older and do not understand these computerised forms? They are certainly not customer or user friendly. Is the Minister aware, as I have been told as recently as today, that to apply for a single agricultural grant to build an outhouse it is necessary to fill out 32 <Col N="853" /> forms, whereas in 1973 you needed to fill out only one? The Minister has stated that there is advice available, but there are fewer people to advise farmers now than ever before. Does the Minister agree this has implications for the referendum coming up before the end of the year? How can he expect the farming community to vote for the Nice treaty when they have the idea that all these problems are emanating from Brussels? It is a serious state of affairs and absolutely nothing has been done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated in his reply that the name, address and herd number are now on all forms. In light of the fact that the data is now being collected in Bandon, will the Minister have printed out on the forms the tag numbers of the cattle? That would simplify the system a lot more.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister taken a decision or is he prepared to take a decision to change the penalty system whereby, at present, a clerical error is considered in the exact same way as fraud? In relation to the levels of bureaucracy in agriculture, does the Minister agree that much of the interpretation is coming from the Department of Agriculture and Food here and that if this continues and persists the agricultural community will not support the Nice treaty? Europe is being blamed for what the Department is implementing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister promised that bureaucracy would be curtailed, but the agreement he made last September in Brussels is bringing in more draconian measures than ever. Does he accept that if a farmer makes a genuine mistake, he should not be penalised, just as, I am sure, a mistake by a Department official is not penalised? We have it on both sides that common sense should prevail. The number of applications that have come in for farm air pollution grants or other grants is down dramatically on what was expected simply because the whole system is so bureaucratic. As my colleague, Deputy McGinley, has said, there is so much form filling to be done that you have to employ a consultant to apply for an ordinary farm building grant. You can build a house anywhere in the country, but for a farm building you have to employ a consultant. It is bureaucracy gone mad.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the necessity of hav<Col N="854" /> ing conditions apply to grants and in many cases farmers complain about those conditions. They regard them as overpowering, especially for farmers who are not used to book work because they want to be out on the farm. Nonetheless, the Department and Teagasc go out of their way to help with public meetings, meeting farmers directly, and with information booklets. Following recent public meetings around the country we are assessing feedback received and addressing the most serious complaints. At all times we are subject to the EU because it is the EU which pays the vast bulk of the money. We have to go then to Europe and say that there are changes we want made and we will continue to do that. I have given a commitment before and I give a further commitment that, with the farming organisations and the protocol on payments, that will continue to be done. I also make the point that in the vast majority of cases there is not a problem and in the cases where there is a problem, the vast majority are the result of late applications, nothing else.</P>

      <P>A veterinary office was established in mid-2001 in Wicklow town to deal with, <i>inter alia</i>, aspects of DVO activity. This office is the responsibility of the SVI attached to the Tallaght office. All the DVO paper files for east Wicklow are held in the Tallaght office and the Wicklow office has a computer link to the Department's disease eradication network. The cattle movement monitoring system, CMMS, has also been activated in the Wicklow office and will be integrated with the animal health computer system, AHCS, currently in development.</P>
      <P>There are two veterinary inspectors covering the east Wicklow area. While one is located in the Wicklow office and the other in the Tallaght office, both officers carry out duties in respect of east Wicklow as and when required. They both report to the SVI based in Tallaght. There are also three TAOs and one CO in the Wicklow office. The Wicklow and Tallaght offices cover the Dublin and east Wicklow areas for DVO matters.</P>

It is basically a second-rate DVO office. Will he confirm that the Department never really wanted to put an office there and that it was agreed as part of the terms for the support of the last Government by my <Col N="855" /> good friend, Deputy Fox? The space the office has, its manpower and the approach of the Department to it makes it seem that it is something the Department has tolerated and which may be wound down. Will the Minister confirm if I am accurate in that because there is much dissatisfaction with the service, or lack thereof, which is provided? I assure the Minister that he need not tread as carefully as he would have done a few months ago. I am sure Deputy Brennan is not watching on the monitors.</P>

Extension of DVO facilities to Wicklow has been positive and my understanding is that farmer clients are very happy with it. The office will continue and farmer clients will be facilitated to the greatest possible extent.

      <P>For practical purposes, having an office in Wicklow is a huge improvement on the circumstances which previously obtained. With information technology, you do not have files and bags and baggage in the one office because you can deal with queries electronically. There is an IT link among the offices, a good service is available and I have not had any complaints about what Deputy Timmins refers to as its inadequacy. It is an adequate service and information technology should be available to improve services for farm clients. Such clients can call into the Wicklow office rather than having to travel to Tallaght or Naas and that is a major improvement on what existed.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year my Department commissioned the ESRI to examine the extent of poverty among farm, non-farm rural and urban households. The risk of poverty can be measured in terms of consistent poverty, which combines data on relative poverty with information on basic deprivation. Using 1998 data, the study shows that farmers had the lowest risk of consistent poverty of the three groups when measured at 40%, 50% or 60% of average income. At the 40% consistent poverty line, 1% of farm households were at risk compared to 4% for non-farm rural households and 4% for urban households.</P>
      <P>Relative poverty is another way of measuring poverty. Relative poverty is measured as the percentage of households at risk of being below the 40%, 50% and 60% of average income. The results of the study showed that, in 1998, farm households had a substantially lower risk of relative poverty than the other household groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's concern about poverty is evident from the commitment given in the revised National Anti-Poverty Strategy, published in February 2002. Its target is to reduce, and ideally <Col N="857" /> eliminate, consistent poverty in Ireland. In addition, the farm assist scheme was introduced in April 1999 to support low income families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware weather conditions in recent months have caused more serious problems for farmers experiencing poverty. We have already discussed the milk price decreases and the problems in the beef sector. Is he aware there are further problems in intensive farming sectors, such as mushroom production? Mushrooms are being imported from Poland and being sold in the UK as Irish products. Has anything been done about that? A farmer telephoned me in desperation earlier because his income from mushroom production will reduce by &euro;6,000 this year as a result of the decrease in prices paid by Monaghan Mushrooms to mushroom farmers? Is anything being done to prevent the illegal use of Irish labels in various agricultural sectors?</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the farm assist scheme, which is a fraud and an absolute farce. Many farmers cannot avail of the scheme because it is based on their income historically. If the scheme is to mean anything this year, it must take account the current weather conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the problems regarding labelling which have been experienced in mushroom production and food production generally. A number of different Departments have responsibility for labelling and I am examining that matter intensively and urgently to ensure a comprehensive system is introduced so that, at the very least, consumers will know precisely the source of the products they purchase.</P>
      <P>The farm assist scheme was introduced a number of years ago following consultation with the farming organisations. A good number of farmers availed of the scheme but, nonetheless, there are problems. Some farmers find it more difficult to take up the scheme than the old farmers' dole.</P>

      <P>I have had discussions with the new Minister for Social and Family Affairs and we have agreed to examine the farm assist scheme to ascertain how it can be improved and modified and take into account current difficulties. I am sure the Deputy is praying for fine weather, as am I, because it is needed urgently given that serious damage is being done.</P>

      <P>According to long range forecasts, the weather will not improve over the next few weeks. There are problems with crops that are in the ground and the planting season is being impacted upon. This means there will be a shortfall of many agricultural products later in the year, which will impact on the consumer. Has the Minister considered how he will address this difficulty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the dreadful weather <Col N="858" /> conditions, which have impacted on a number of sectors. For example, we were fortunate that we had a mild winter because farmers cannot put their cattle out and must feed them silage. Reduced yield is a consequent problem because cattle cannot feed outdoors and the temperature at night is also low. I have asked departmental inspectors to continually monitor and report to me on the matter. I hope the weather will improve quickly because a fine week could mean a great deal. I watch the weather forecast with great interest each evening and, unfortunately, it holds out little prospect of improving in the short-term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The contribution of non-farming activity to household income is increasing all the time and has now gone up to about 60%. Any plan for the future will need to take into account the total household income rather than the income from farming alone and I assume that is the reason the CSO and other agencies use the total household income.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hayes made a good point about premia and headage and it is important that they are paid. I have asked my officials to ensure that all moneys due to farmers will be paid. Last year because of foot and mouth and other difficulties, the advance payment of 60% was increased to 80% in order to help farmers and we will do that this year also.</P>
      <P>Deputy Timmins raised the question of climatic change. It is a huge problem and anecdotal evidence suggests that there is a change in our climate. Teagasc is the advisory body to the Department and is keeping us informed of the situation. Teagasc research has resulted in the modification of various crop varieties to allow them produce a better yield in Ireland. A livestock breeding programme also takes account of climatic matters.</P>

      <P>The total provision for public capital spending by my Department amounts to &euro;151.113 million gross, and &euro;115.409 million net, under various headings. It is too early in the year to be definitive, but at this stage I anticipate excesses on some headings and savings on others.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind that all figures are indicative at this stage, the following are the likely excesses. Under subhead A5 &ndash; office equipment &ndash; an additional &euro;900,000 will be required for networking costs associated with the relocation of part of the Department to Maynooth, software licences and upgrading of computer systems, as part of the Department's ongoing modernisation programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under subhead C6 &ndash; national beef assurance scheme &ndash; an excess of &euro;2.5 million is anticipated in 2002, principally in relation to the expenditure on the animal health computer system which was delayed last year due to the foot and mouth emergency. Under subhead M1 &ndash; farm investment &ndash; expenditure is likely to be some &euro;3 mill<Col N="860" /> ion higher than estimated for the remaining grants under the national scheme for the control of farm pollution, for which Commission approval was received late last year.</P>

      <P>It is too early in the year to be definitive about any area.

I am pleased that the national scheme for farm pollution will have in excess of &euro;3 million. The scheme is going very well.</P>
      <P>I stated in the House that I wished the national beef assurance scheme to be of minimal cost to farmers. It is very important that a country which has a 90% dependence on export markets has that statutory beef assurance. To date, it is regrettable that there has not been agreement between the farmers or the veterinary association with the Department for the implementation of that scheme. Our beef industry is far too important to be quibbled about. I call on the various farming and veterinary associations to come terms with that scheme.</P>

      <P>In relation to the national beef assurance scheme, I said there would be minimal cost. There is no such thing as a free lunch of any description but if a veterinary surgeon calls out to a farmer in an annual round test, examines the farm and signs off on the national beef assurance, that should not cost much.</P>

      <P>I have asked my officials to prepare an action plan in response to the report of the Organic Development Committee which I received in April this year. The committee, which I established on foot of a recommendation in the Agri-Food 2010 report, was made up a wide range of stakeholders representing the organic sector itself together with the processing and retail sectors, the mainstream farming organisations, consumer interests and the State sector. In its report the committee has highlighted those areas of production that have potential for development.

The committee also recommended the development of a national label for Irish organic produce.</P>

Our major problem is creating a market which will encourage farmers to diversifying into other areas.

      <P>There is potential in the organic sector. At one point those in that area were regarded as way-out or off the main stream of activity, but there is a niche market for organic products. In November 2000 I established a committee which reported to the then Minister of State, Deputy Davern, in April of this year. It made a number of recommendations, including setting up a steering group to act as a driving force for the development of the sector, a partnership expert working group to co-ordinate training, education and advice and research as well as an organic market development group under the co-ordination of Bord Bia.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are attractive grants under REPS for those in organic farming. For example, organic farmers participating in REPS can avail of additional payments under the organic supplementary measure. The payments are substantial. An organic farmer with 40 hectares can receive up to &euro;13,280 per year for the first two years and up to &euro;9,680 per year thereafter for as long as he or she is in REPS. Over &euro;28 million is allocated specifically to organic farmers under REPS. There is also &euro;8.252 million under the national development plan. We are serious about organic produce and supporting the organic sector. I am pleased the acrimonious row going on between different groups in the organic sector about standards has been fully cleared up because it was a distraction. I hope the potential demand for naturally produced food, for which we have ideal soil and climate, will develop over the next few years.</P>

      <P>I had hoped the Minister for Education and Science or the Minister for Finance would come in to respond but, perhaps, there are reasons they cannot be here. The matter relates to the role both played in the point at issue.</P>
      <P>On 5 June, three weeks ago, the then Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Finance agreed a deed of indemnity which entails the State or, more accurately, the taxpayer essentially picking up the tab for all institutional clerical abuse. This deal had its origins in the Residential Institutions Redress Act, the purpose of which was to provide some kind of mechanism whereby the victims of child abuse in various residential institutions could be financially compensated for the damage, hurt and severe injury done to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those institutions were largely funded by the State and managed by various religious congregations. The negotiations on the contribution which the relevant congregations would make <Col N="864" /> were protracted and stretched out over most of last year. The questions that arose were how much responsibility the religious orders carried for the high level of child abuse that took place within the institutions for which they had management responsibility and what level of contribution should be made to the proposed compensation fund so that the payment would be closely commensurate with the level of responsibility which both partners &ndash; the religious orders and the State &ndash; should carry. We know from information available on those negotiations that a strong view was taken by the Department of Finance that the responsibility should be shared on a 50:50 basis. The State had legal responsibility for those children in the institutions, yet it was certain members of certain congregations that inflicted the abuse, committed the crime and did so much damage.</P>
    <P>It was unfortunate that no court was asked to adjudicate and determine the level of responsibility which the State and the congregations should carry. However, the upshot of the negotiations was that the Government agreed to fund approximately 75% of the expected cost of the compensation awards which will be paid by the Institutions Redress Board and the congregations, in theory, would carry the other 25%. We were told that would amount to &euro;128 million. There was great fanfare and much publicity attached to the fact that these congregations were going to contribute that amount. There is still much vagueness about how that &euro;128 million is made up. There is still no definitive information on what land will be taken into consideration. We know that much of the land has already been transferred to various agencies and has nothing to do with the institutional child abuse issue. There are various vague promises that other land will be transferred and we need further information on that matter.</P>
    <P>Much of that sum of &euro;128 million was allocated to various nebulous headings such as counselling, record retrieval, etc. The whole thing was unsatisfactory. We were told that where a victim accepted an award from the Institutions Redress Board they waived their right to pursue a civil action and, therefore, the perpetrators would be indemnified.</P>
    <P>Apart from the paltry level of contribution made by the congregations, it was a fair enough approach to abuse that took place in the past where no substantial evidence remains to this day, as it relates to awful things that happened 40 or 50 years ago. That was generally accepted as a fair approach. However, we know from the deal agreed between Government Ministers and the congregations on 5 June that the scope of this indemnity is far wider than originally proposed. The State on behalf of the taxpayer has undertaken to indemnify all those in religious orders who perpetrated abuse in residential institutions up to 5 June. I do not believe the taxpayer is aware of that. In regard to cases which may not have been initiated yet, but where abuse took <Col N="865" /> place at any stage up to 5 June &ndash; not 40 or 50 years ago &ndash; the State is prepared to step in and take over full responsibility for that clerical abuse on behalf of the taxpayer. We are looking at a scenario where the State or the taxpayer is facing a bill which is likely to be in the region of &euro;1 billion. On what basis was the decision reached? Can the Minister give an estimate of the cost to the taxpayer?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain how this approach can help deal with the long running issue of child abuse in residential institutions given that it is essentially a cheap insurance policy for those perpetrators of abuse. It negates modern day thinking in terms of perpetrators taking responsibility for their actions. It is complete immunity for a very low price. Will the Minister explain how he can possibly justify that on behalf of the taxpayer?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a number of comments before responding. I apologise to the House for detaining it and also to Deputy Shortall. The Minister for Education and Science cannot be present but he asked me to give the Deputy his response. I have long regarded this method of Adjournment Debates as unsatisfactory. I proposed to the Opposition a means by which we should change it to allow for a proper debate and interaction between relevant Ministers and relevant spokespersons. So far, between all of us, we have not had the wisdom to advance those reforms to a point where we could make changes to these procedures in the House. I note the Fine Gael Whip is sitting opposite. Perhaps he will take up that issue with my successor with a view to moving it on. Until then I am stuck with the current arrangement, which means I have to read this statement.</P>
      <P>In October 2000 the Government agreed to establish a scheme through which victims of childhood abuse in institutional care could receive compensation for their injuries. The Government's decision to establish the scheme was taken without regard to whether the congregations who owned and managed the institutions concerned would participate. The decision was taken in the interests of people who, as vulnerable children, were committed for the most part by State bodies into institutional care and who suffered abuse and lifelong injury, notwithstanding the duty of the State to regulate the institutions.</P>
      <P>The compensation scheme was part of the Government's overall response to the horror generated in Irish society by the revelations of the abusive regime in many of the care institutions in the past. Other measures included the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, dedicated counselling services and amendments to the Statute of Limitation. The decision to set up the scheme was also taken against the background of over 1,000 cases in which legal proceedings had commenced in the High Court against both the State and various congregations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortly after the Government's decision, the <Col N="866" /> religious congregations announced that they wished to make a meaningful contribution to the compensation scheme. The Government agreed that such a development would be welcome. Apart from the financial contribution involved, it was considered that bringing the issue of childhood abuse to a resolution could best be achieved if both the congregations and the State took part. There followed a lengthy period of negotiation involving representatives of the congregations and the State. As Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods reached agreement in principle with the congregations in January of this year. That agreement was subsequently the subject of detailed negotiations out of which came the agreement referred to by the Deputy. The congregations agreed to make a contribution of &euro;128 million in the form of cash, counselling costs and real property to the compensation scheme.</P>
    <P>The cash contribution is to be made in instalments within one year. In the case of the property transfers, those which had occurred since 11 May 1999 &ndash; the date of the Taoiseach's apology to victims of abuse &ndash; were to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>In return for this contribution the Government agreed to grant an indemnity to the congregations. This indemnity applies only to those cases which are eligible to be dealt with under the compensation scheme set up under the Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2000, which are not actually dealt with in the redress scheme and in respect of which litigation is commenced within six years of the date of the agreement. It is the object of the redress scheme that all, or certainly the vast majority of, cases will be dealt with in this forum rather than in the courts. It is expected, therefore, that the indemnity will in fact apply to relatively few cases.</P>
    <P>It is misleading to say that the agreement with the congregations, <i>per se</i>, has implications for the taxpayer. The implications for the taxpayer arose from the fact children were incarcerated in institutions by public bodies for decades and suffered injury, often serious, as a result. The Government decided that the time had come for Irish society to acknowledge that injury and provide to the survivors the financial means whereby they could have some comfort in their lives. That decision was not contingent on the congregations' involvement. Their involvement, however, on the terms now agreed, provides the best basis for all concerned, survivors, congregations and Irish society, to move forward and bring closure to this difficult period in our past.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment as Minister for Transport and wish him every success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a new Deputy for County Clare who takes pride in our international airport at Shannon, I have to say that the Government's record of dealing with aviation issues over the past five years <Col N="867" /> is nothing short of a disaster. The events of 11 September last cannot be blamed for the problems of Aer Lingus, and Shannon Airport should not be used as a sacrificial lamb. In the Shannon region we have a valuable asset which must not be used as a pawn in any deals that emerge in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment in the 1940s, Shannon Airport has been a generator of opportunity and confidence. Shannon is called the airport of necessity because it was deliberately located where it was most needed in the national interest of generating opportunity for an area that was economically barren. The airport is a success story of which the nation can be proud. It is essential for the success of the region and is of future paramount importance for the growth of tourism in the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be aware of proposals from Aer Lingus management that as and from 27 October next both direct flights to New York and Los Angeles flights will originate and terminate at Dublin Airport. These flights operate seven days a week and are the only direct transatlantic service on the transatlantic route, that is, the Shannon-JFK route. With tourism numbers down by 21%, the change in this service could spell disaster for the Shannon region. Shannon airport has enjoyed a very special relationship with Aer Lingus on the transatlantic route. Aer Lingus has been the cornerstone of Shannon and we want to keep it this way for the future.</P>
    <P>Rerouting this service will have a very negative impact on the region, which will affect about 280 transatlantic cabin crew who are based in Shannon. About 150 of these are married and live locally with their families. This will also probably mean job losses in the Shannon region. It will also affect passenger numbers at the airport as Aer Lingus claims that first class business out of Shannon is not profitable. Aer Lingus cannot cope with first class traffic out of Dublin and first class passengers are three times more profitable than economy passengers. This will also affect overnight bed numbers in the region. This is why the Hotels Federation is up in arms on this issue. There must be concern that the Aer Rianta catering service at Shannon will not now be available out of Shannon and this business will be transferred to Dublin. This will have a severe economic impact on in-flight catering especially given that Aer Lingus is now looking for a survival plan.</P>
    <P>Are there further plans to reduce transatlantic services out of Shannon, particularly the Boston route? It is widely rumoured that the bilateral agreement will be up for negotiation later this year or early next year. Is that linked to the reduction in direct air services? The current bilateral agreement is a 50-50 arrangement. If all services are re-routed through Dublin, the long-term objective must be to change the bilateral agreement. Either way, is it up for negotiation?</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes in protecting the needs of <Col N="868" /> the entire nation and the Government. We ask the Minister to join us in ensuring a vibrant rural economy with a strong airline. The country would be much better off as a result. I ask the Minister to earnestly consider developing Shannon to its full potential. At present the Government has no vision for our international airport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Breen for his kind wishes, congratulate him on his election to Dáil Éireann and wish him well here. It is a difficult but exciting place to be.</P>
      <P>Issues relating to rostering and staffing are day-to-day operational issues for Aer Lingus and I, therefore, have no function in these matters. However, I understand from the company that the Deputy may be referring to possible crewing changes arising from a review of the Aer Lingus transatlantic schedule for next winter. A draft schedule for next winter is currently being finalised taking account of all the relevant issues, including competitive pressures, the ongoing need to reduce costs and market requirements.</P>
      <P>Any changes will respect the terms of the Ireland-US bilateral agreement under which Aer Lingus and all other airlines must fly as many direct services to Shannon in a 12 month period as they fly to Dublin. There may, however, be a change in the Los Angeles service which currently operates Shannon-Dublin-Los Angeles-Dublin-Shannon, with the Shannon leg being dropped due to cost factors. There will, however, continue to be a connecting service operated by Aer Arann. In addition, the New York-Shannon services will commence and terminate in Dublin for the coming winter rather than commencing and terminating in Shannon as heretofore. I understand from the company that the schedule will be finalised over the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>It is important for the Irish economy in general that a strong viable Aer Lingus emerges from the difficulties of the past year. The survival of Aer Lingus is also extremely important for the future of Shannon airport. Aer Lingus has made significant progress since the impact of the dreadful events of 11 September became known and a degree of stability has emerged as a result of implementation of the survival plan. However, the competitive and changing nature of the industry and the ongoing market uncertainties require a continuing focus on cost reductions and efficiency improvements. Unless this effort continues unabated, the airline remains vulnerable to market forces and is particularly vulnerable to unexpected economic or other external shocks. The airline, like its competitors, must become profitable and, in particular, must be able to respond flexibly and rapidly to changing market conditions if it is to have a viable future. For my part, I will fully support the efforts of the board and management in this regard over the coming weeks and months. My priority is to ensure that Aer Lingus is brought back to full health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate for me to use this opportunity to put on record the new Government's commit<Col N="869" /> ment to ensuring a viable Shannon airport, playing a major role in the ongoing development of the mid-west region. The programme for Government gives a commitment that as part of the process of transforming Aer Rianta, the Government will ensure that Shannon and Cork airports have greater autonomy and independence. I will look carefully at that in the weeks ahead to see how I can implement that commitment to give more autonomy to Shannon and Cork. There is a sound foundation from which to continue to build at Shannon Airport notwithstanding the impact of the events of last year. Over the two years, 1999 and 2000, traffic through Shannon Airport increased by in excess of half a million passengers, representing growth of more than 30% on 1998 levels. Passenger traffic for 2001 was 2.4 million, a marginal downturn on the previous year.</P>
    <P>There have also been significant infrastructural developments at Shannon. The new passenger terminal which opened in 2001 has effectively doubled that airport's capacity bringing it to 4.5 million. In addition, to assist route development Aer Rianta extended its zero charges incentive scheme for airlines which launch new routes into the three State airports following the events of 11 September. In the case of new routes at Shannon, Aer Rianta extended the period for zero airport charges from three to four years. In addition, Aer Rianta will provide marketing support for route development promotional activities.</P>
    <P>These initiatives are intended to help reduce the impact of the current global aviation downturn on traffic at State airports, including Shannon Airport, and to boost the Irish aviation and tourism sectors in the months and years ahead.</P>
    <P>So far this year, Ryanair has launched a new route to Paris-Beauvais from Shannon and Aer Arann Express has commenced a twice-daily flight from Shannon to Dublin. I was delighted to launch a new Air Canada service linking Toronto and Shannon last week. I understand that Continental Airlines has increased capacity on its Shannon-New York route.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, despite the current difficulties in the aviation sector, the future viability of Shannon Airport is secure and that it will continue to grow and prosper, continuing its valuable contribution to balanced regional development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for permitting me to raise this important matter as it has affected the rights of children and of many of our citizens increasingly over recent years. The time has come to review the operation of the family law courts and the balance of family law as they impact on the rights of children and estranged fathers. Whatever the rights and wrongs of particular marital breakdowns or separations, there is no doubt but that often the quality of care of the children is <Col N="870" /> adversely affected and on occasion the rights of the estranged father are set aside.</P>
      <P>It is important that the child at the centre of a marital breakdown or separation has continued contact with both parents. Even in circumstances where the court prescribes regular access, the order of the court is often incapable of implementation. The availability of suitable housing is frequently the cause but by no means the only cause of effective non-implementation of a custody order. It is customary that the father is required to make available suitable residential accommodation before he is accorded access. Frequently, the man who has left the family home and who may be paying maintenance or is unemployed cannot afford private rented accommodation. In current public housing circumstances, he has virtually no prospect of being housed by a local authority.</P>
      <P>Where the mother is so disposed, access can be denied because the father has no suitable accommodation in which to receive the children. Vindicating his rights and the rights of children to have contact with the second parent can be an expensive business often beyond the means of many fathers.</P>
      <P>There may have been excellent and even obvious arguments why the family courts should sit <i>in camera</i> and perhaps even, in many cases, should continue to do so. It is difficult to be definitive because we have so little information on the performance of the family courts. Surely it would be possible, in exceptional cases at least, to hand down written judgments or even elaborate decisions that explain the rationale behind the thinking of the court in a manner that would prevent the parties from being identified. Without this happening, it is difficult to reach informed conclusions. I would like to hear the Minister on whether he believes there is a case for justice in the family courts to be administered in public, with the obvious necessary safeguards to do with reporting, non-identification of parties and so on.</P>
      <P>Equality is supposed to be for all citizens. Parents of both genders in such circumstances as is contemplated here can and do on occasion use the children as pawns to advance their own case. Our legal aid system does not offer the possibility of adequate redress. Does the Minister not consider that the time has come to establish a civil legal aid system along the lines of the criminal legal aid system? As the system currently operates, it can be impossible to vindicate one's rights without being pauperised for the rest of one's life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will be familiar with an organisation called Unmarried and Separated Parents of Ireland. This is a group of men who have come together to explain the heartbreak that is frequently behind marital breakdown, separation and inability to meet their children in a suitable environment. They have not got the hearing they deserve. Perhaps that is not entirely the fault of the Government but their case deserves a hearing because there are serious <Col N="871" /> injustices and if the new Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform were to set his mind to it, improvements could be made now that we have the experience of recent years in terms of assessing the operation of the family courts and the experience to look back and build on for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for raising this important issue which deserves more debate in this House than we are giving it this evening because it is important to many people. I am standing in this evening for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I will convey to him what the Deputy said.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform asked me to point out that he would caution at the outset that he has no role in the administration of justice which is a matter for the courts. Thus, complaints that the courts, in using their powers under the relevant statutory provisions, make rulings which some people would disagree with are not for the Minister or the Government to respond to and to attempt to do so would be to interfere with the constitutional division of powers between the Executive and the Judiciary. What it falls to the Minister to do is to keep the operation of the relevant law under review and propose changes to the Houses of the Oireachtas where this appears desirable. That is what the Minister pledges to do.</P>
      <P>On the issue raised by the Deputy, I am aware of the views of organisations speaking on behalf of estranged fathers that the family law system is not treating them fairly. It is frequently said that many fathers in this situation are deprived of contact with their children as they grow up and suffer emotionally as a result of that. I fully agree that children should have the benefit of a family life which involves both parents even if the parents, sadly, are estranged from each other. This has to be subject to the overriding consideration that the welfare of the child must be paramount. The statutory provisions on guardianship and custody of and access to children are contained in the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964. This Act has been amended a number of times since it was first enacted and, in this way, has come to reflect changing conditions and social mores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of fathers differs depending on whether they are married to the mother of their child. Section 6 of the Act provides that the married father and mother are joint guardians of their child. Thus, they have the right to make decisions about the child's upbringing and general welfare as well as the duty to care for the child. In the event of the relationship between father and mother breaking down, if it proves impossible to reach a satisfactory arrangement about these matters or about who should have custody of or access to the child, application can be made to the District or Circuit Courts to make appropriate orders. As I have already said, the court, in <Col N="872" /> deciding the issue, must regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
    <P>Special provisions have been inserted into the Guardianship of Infants Acts by amending legislation over the years in relation to unmarried fathers. In this way, the law has kept pace with the changing social environment in which we see an increasing number of non-marital relationships where the couple are the parents. Under section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act, as inserted by section 12 of the Status of Children Act, 1987, an unmarried father may apply to the court to be appointed a guardian of his child. Alternatively, where there is agreement between the parents, they can make a statutory declaration under section 2(4) of the Guardianship of Infants Act, as inserted by section 4 of the Children Act, 1997, conferring on the father the status of guardian. Under section 11 of the 1964 Act, a guardian may apply to the court for its direction on any question affecting the welfare of the child. Examples of such proceedings are applications for custody and access orders. In making such orders and in determining whether an unmarried father should be appointed guardian, the court has to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. Furthermore, even if an unmarried father has not been appointed guardian, he can nevertheless apply to the court in relation to any matter affecting the welfare of the child.</P>
    <P>These legislative provisions are appropriate as they permit the court in cases of disagreement to decide on arrangements for the child's upbringing having regard to the child's best interests.</P>
    <P>One concern which has been expressed on a number of occasions by those speaking on behalf of unmarried fathers is that access orders granted in their favour are often flouted by the child's mother who does not, on various pretexts, allow access on the terms ordered by the court. I am concerned that this should happen because it means that an order of a court, which by definition has been made in the best interests of the child, is not implemented as it should be. In this context, section 5 of the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1986, makes it an offence for a person having custody of a child not to allow a person who is entitled to access under a court order to exercise that access. The gardaí are responsible for prosecuting offences under this provision and persons who feel they have been the victims of such behaviour should report the matter accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department is considering how the legislation relating to access orders is operating and whether amendment to the law might be desirable.</P>
    <P>I would also draw the attention of the House to an important commitment which we have included in our programme for Government. This is that we will change the <i>in camera</i> rule in family law cases to allow for general reporting of overall trends while continuing to respect the privacy of those involved. As the Deputy will know, this is an aspect of the administration of family law that <Col N="873" /> concerns fathers' groups and the Minister will follow up on our commitment in this regard.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Brennan, on his new appointment. I also extend those congratulations to the Leas Cheann-Comhairle on his appointment.</P>
      <P>The practice has been that one or two Ministers reply to issues raised on the Adjournment on behalf of a plethora of Ministers. Having been asked to stand in that capacity on more than one occasion, as Fine Gael Chief Whip I do not intend to allow that practice to continue for the foreseeable future. I do not want to be ungracious but it is simply not the done thing. I know there are compelling reasons that Ministers cannot be here, but I want it recorded that this will not be accepted.</P>
      <P>I thank the Leas Cheann-Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue which has received some public attention recently. It appears that a carefully organised gang, led by a Fagan-like character, has been involved in a series of bank robberies. The leader has gathered vulnerable people, some of whom are drug addicts or involved in the distribution of drugs, and until today very little was known by the public about what was happening. A member of my family went to the bank in Maynooth in recent weeks and found that it had been robbed a few days previously, as had the adjoining bank. It transpires that banks have been robbed in adjoining towns. In the last 24 hours it seems banks have been systematically robbed.</P>
      <P>This is not a new phenomenon; it occurs every so often. The public is brassed off at the contempt which some organised gangs have for society and law and order. There is no doubt that these gangs have no intention of being intimidated by anybody. They seem to think that they can continue in this fashion with impunity. They cannot and they shall not do so. It is for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to grips with this urgently. Given the international emphasis on organised crime, this is the one issue that must be tackled. It is no good trying to make our streets safe or introduce legislation because the legislation to deal with this problem is already there. I know that sin cannot be abolished and I know legislators cannot abolish the breaking of laws because laws will always be broken.</P>
      <P>The most interesting thing about these crimes is the precision with which they are carried out. The precision is almost military and is to such an extent that the perpetrators obviously take great pride in the way they carry out their crimes. I may not be up to date on this, but I have not heard anything about the recovery of the stolen money. I am sure that will come in due course. It is imperative that the necessary procedures are put in place, both covertly and overtly, to put a stop to the gallop of those who are perpetrating these crimes.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for raising the issue of serious crime in this debate. It gives me the opportunity to outline the Government's strategic approach to fulfilling its duty of maintaining a society where all people can feel safe in their communities, businesses and homes. With regard to the particular incidents of armed robberies mentioned by the Deputy, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been informed by the Garda authorities that a number of people were detained following a robbery in the Dundrum area yesterday. A file will be submitted to the DPP and, as the Deputy will appreciate, it would be inappropriate for me to comment any further on the matter now.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have also informed the Minister that, in relation to a series of bank robberies in the Leinster area, an investigation process was put in place whereby members of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, together with local district units, combined their efforts in order to tackle the problem. This joint approach has met with success in solving a number of such robberies with the result that persons are before the courts and a number of files are currently with the law officers. It would also be inappropriate for me to comment any further on these specific incidents.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue of robberies and aggravated burglaries where firearms are used, the most recently published statistics for the period 1996 to 2000 indicate that those recorded in 2000 were 30% less than the previous year, while the 2000 total was 58% lower than the corresponding total recorded in 1996.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The actual number of such robberies in 1996 was 481 compared to 203 in 2000. The detection rate rose from 28% in 1996 to 49% in 2000. For the same period, the number of robberies and aggravated burglaries where firearms were used decreased by 50% in relation to financial institutions such as banks, post offices and credit unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the first duties of Government is to protect citizens in going about their everyday business. That is why one of the early decisions of the last Government was to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 12,000. Steps were taken <Col N="875" /> to achieve this objective, including increasing the frequency of recruitment campaigns and increasing the capacity of the training college. The target of 12,000 will be achieved by the end of the year and is an historic high. An Agreed Programme for Government will complete the current expansion of the Garda Síochána and increase recruitment so that the numbers will increase by a further 2,000. The additional gardaí will be targeted at those areas of greatest need, especially areas experiencing a significant drugs problem.</P>
    <P>The overall Garda operational strategy to respond to serious crime has also been strengthened. All national support services &ndash; including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the National Drugs Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau &ndash; are now under the dedicated direction of a senior officer at assistant commissioner level. This new operational strategy will assist in a co-ordinated approach to investigating serious crime based on criminal intelligence. The dedicated approach at a senior level will facilitate the estab<Col N="876" /> lishment of co-ordinated teams in serious cases, as necessary, from each of the national support services. The case I mentioned earlier is a good example of this.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is right to express concern about the possible link between serious crimes and drugs misuse. The Government, as did the last Government, will ensure that tackling the problem of drugs misuse remains a major priority. The national drugs strategy, which sets out the Government's actions to be taken by all stakeholders involved in delivery, contains a number of actions which will directly impact on drugs-related crime. Garda resources in local drugs task force areas will be increased substantially in accordance with the overall increase in Garda numbers. Through the strategy, the aim is to increase drugs seizures by 25% by 2004 and by 50% by 2008. This focus on serious crime will continue under the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 20, 28 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the Bord Bia report referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>As far as beef is concerned, a substantial proportion of the imports come from third countries under a number of preferential quotas operated under the WTO. Much of this beef is re-exported after processing. In view of this, the consumption of imported beef here is lower than 25%. With regard to imported beef utilised in the catering trade, it is estimated that approximately 600 tonnes per annum is imported on payment of the full tariff, with some 90 tonnes being imported under the WTO arrangements I have mentioned already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, however, concerned about the level of beef imports and, in particular, I am anxious to <Col N="878" /> ensure that all such imports comply with relevant EU veterinary and labelling legislation. In this regard, there are stringent EU approval procedures in place which ensure that beef imported from third countries, including South America, complies with veterinary standards which are equivalent to those applicable to EU beef. As far as labelling is concerned, beef imported into the EU must be labelled with the country of origin and country of slaughter at the point of sale in retail outlets. The Food Safety Authority has recently briefed the environmental health officers, who are responsible for implementing the labelling regulations at retail level, to exercise greater vigilance in relation to misrepresentation of country of origin and any traders who misrepresent the true origin will be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>With regard to pigmeat, it is worth noting that, when the portion of the imports that are re-exported is removed from the equation, imports account for 23% of domestic consumption. Imports from Northern Ireland are part of what is essentially a single all-island industry which offers us many advantages. Furthermore, a large portion of imports is accounted for by cuts that are not available from domestic production in sufficient quantities because they are exported to more lucrative markets. Price is also a factor in imports and this is due in part to the better production efficiencies existing in other countries and to the fact that certain cuts that are less popular in the country of origin can be sold off cheaply. However, processors here should be aware that some users of imported pigmeat have indicated that their preference for imports is due to the better consistency of quality and delivery available from imports.</P>
    <P>It is not open to me under EU law to prevent meat imports provided that they comply with the relevant EU legislation. However, I believe that the effective promotion and marketing of meat by Bord Bia and the industry itself will help reduce meat imports. In this regard, Bord Bia carries out year-round promotional and market development activities tailored for the home market. Bord Bia's general promotional activities include media promotions, the schools programme, consumer education and the nutrition programme, including the health professionals' seminar and ongoing liaison with health professional groupings. In 2002 there will be eight media advertising promotions from January to December with clear objectives and follow-up research and evaluation. A series of consumer recipes-nutritional materials support each campaign. More specifically on pigmeat, the Bord Bia promotional activities are focused on pork and bacon cuts in surplus and work with the trade to identify how it can address competitiveness in areas showing strong import growth.</P>
    <P>In addition, Bord Bia, in association with the Restaurants Association of Ireland and the Irish <Col N="879" /> Hotels Federation and with the support of the farming community, has developed a voluntary year-round Féile Bia programme to encourage catering establishments to demonstrate their commitment to sourcing quality food. Participants are asked to outline their commitment to the programme by providing details confirming the quality and origin of food used in their kitchens. Caterers dealing with suppliers from recognised quality assurance schemes are invited to participate as are those dealing directly with high quality local providers. This initiative deserves the fullest support and participation.</P>
    <P>The meat industry itself needs to take some steps to ensure that the meat industry here is not undermined by imports. These steps include improving competitiveness of Irish production, tackling import substitution through better supply arrangements and increasing the level of further processing. Many of these measures are in the hands of the Irish industry itself but my Department and Bord Bia will continue to encourage operators along this route.</P>
    <P>Finally, while I am not aware of any instances where third country imported meat or poultry has been illegally labelled as Irish, it is clear that there is sufficient quantity of top quality Irish product available to fully meet demand. Recent experience, however, involving imported poultry meat from the Netherlands, which had originally been imported to that country from outside the EU, points to a need for more stringent attention to labelling within the EU in certain areas. This is a matter which I am taking up with the bodies responsible for labelling in this country and at EU level. I intend to carry out a review of the operation of the labelling regulations in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to the fire at the UMP plant in Ballaghaderreen in 1992 in which some 7000 tonnes of intervention beef were destroyed. My Department had placed insurance against such loss. As soon as the loss occurred, one group of insurers immediately repudiated liability and initiated legal proceedings. My Department counter-claimed and brought proceedings against a further set of insurers and against the brokers involved.</P>
      <P>A complex series of legal issues relating to liability, quantum and jurisdiction gave rise to 16 different High Court actions involving more than 70 underwriters and brokers both here and abroad. My Department and the Attorney General's office have been most active in pursuing this matter, ensuring the appointment of a single judge to hear all interlocutory applications etc. to expedite progress through the courts and on the advice of the CSSO and the Attorney General engaging a private firm of solicitors Matheson Ormsby Prentice on its behalf.</P>
      <P>Following an approach by legal representatives of all the insurers involved, settlement negotiations began in October 2001. An initial offer, made in February of this year, was rejected. Following further negotiations involving the legal representatives of the insurers, the brokers and the Department, an offer of payment of &euro;21,928,376.61 in full and final settlement was made on 5 April 2002. On the advice of solicitors, counsel and the Attorney General, and following consideration by Government, I agreed to settle on the basis of this significantly increased offer. Claims of each side will be struck out by joint request and each side will bear its own costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulatory valuation in 1992 of the intervention beef destroyed in the fire was &euro;25 million and this was paid to the EU in 1992. Intervention stocks are funded by borrowings, which are repaid over time from EU and sales receipts. In accordance with national financial procedures the loss incurred as a result of the fire could not be charged to the Department's Vote until the insurance issues were resolved. The time value of the money between the time of reimbursement to Brussels and the settlement now reached was of <Col N="881" /> the order of &euro;12 million. Legal advice to the Department was that, because of the complexity of the issues involved in these proceedings, there were limited possibilities of success in pursuing such an additional claim through the courts.</P>
    <P>In addition, the EU regulation governing valuation of losses was amended in 1993, some two years after the fire. The Commission has taken the view that this applies to prior losses. Discussions between the Department and the Commission were put on hold pending the resolution of the insurance claim. The Department had legal advice that this amount was not recoverable from the insurers and further discussion will now take place with the EU Commission having regard to the fact that the market value of this beef would have been much lower than any regulatory value.</P>
    <P>Legal fees, including witness expenses and experts fees incurred by the State to date amount to &euro;2.2 million. Debris disposal costs already paid for by the Department amounted to some &euro;1 million.</P>
    <P>Had the case proceeded to trial, it is estimated that it would have involved additional costs of some &euro;15 million and could have taken up a further three years from a current date to reach conclusion with uncertainty as to the final outcome on both liability and quantum.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that this long running complex legal dispute has been finally resolved on a basis which in the circumstances is a most satisfactory outcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of changes to the labelling regulations arose out of findings by the FSAI that chicken fillets imported from the Netherlands, and originating in non EU countries, had been incorrectly labelled by the Netherlands exporters. At present, EU labelling regulations do not require country of origin to be displayed at the point of retail sale of loose chicken products. Regulations governing the labelling of products for retail sale, including foodstuffs, is the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment and Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and is implemented under contract to the FSAI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The labelling regulations should provide for full information to the consumer in relation to product imported to the EU and put into free cir<Col N="882" /> culation by the importing member state and this should apply irrespective of the stage at which the purchase takes place. This is something which I am taking up with those responsible for labelling here in Ireland and the issue is also being actively considered at EU level.</P>

    <P>Mr. G. Mitchell asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food his plans to guarantee the quality of Irish foodstuffs; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [14063/02]</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The overriding principle in the production of food is the safety of the consumer. Only food produced to the highest standards of food safety and quality should be placed on the market. Responsibility for ensuring these standards rests primarily with the industry itself, with the role of the regulatory authorities being that of providing the assurances required by law. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has overall responsibility for the enforcement of food safety legislation in Ireland. It provides a single focus for all state agencies involved in food safety regulation, thereby guaranteeing the integrity of the control system governing the processing, distribution and retail of food.</P>
      <P>My Department is fully committed to ensuring that primary producers and the food industry in general pursue the highest possible standards of food safety and quality. Working in close co-operation with the FSAI and other Government agencies, my Department pursues this objective through the deployment of staff in monitoring, surveillance and inspection services through every link of the food chain within its area of responsibility. The Department ensures that EU and national rules are enforced at the primary production and processing stages and beyond that for some sectors. In addition, there is a wide range of systems in place to monitor and promote the quality of Irish food. For example, the National Beef Assurance Scheme was enacted in 2000 to guarantee the safety of Irish beef and beef products and to ensure high standards of production and processing throughout the whole industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the range of control measures operated by my Department, quality assurance schemes aimed at ensuring safe, wholesome, quality food produce are operated by An Bord Bia and An Bord Glas. Bord Bia operates separate schemes for beef, pigmeat and eggs and arrangements are in place to develop quality assurance programmes for the poultry and lamb sectors. These schemes operate in an integrated fashion along the production chain, thereby providing controls from farm to table. An Bord Glas operates a &ldquo;Quality Programme&rdquo; to ensure that horticultural produce is produced and prepared in line with best practice and current regulatory <Col N="883" /> requirements. The programme encompasses all the production sectors of the horticultural industry and is accredited to EN45011 standard. An Bord Bia has established a subsidiary board dealing specifically with quality assurance. Currently the Quality Assurance Board is in the process of seeking accreditation to the European Standard EN45011. This will enable it to carry out the functions of a certification body in accordance with the EN45011 accreditation requirements of the National Accreditation Board.</P>
    <P>An expert group was established by my Department to review quality assurance schemes in the food area and to make recommendations on achieving greater coherence and clarity. The main recommendation in the report was that all schemes should be accredited to EN45011 standard and that a set of generic national guidelines should be drawn up by the National Standards Authority of Ireland. This matter is being progressed with the NSAI.</P>

      <Quest>the number of cases of BSE reported to date during 2002; the way in which this figure compares with the same period during 2001; the counties and the numbers in which these cases were detected; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of 174 cases of BSE have been confirmed to date in 2002. This compares with 73 confirmed cases in the first six months of 2001. I am circulating a county breakdown for cases confirmed in 2002.</P>
      <P>It is not appropriate to compare figures from the first six months of 2001 with those for the same period in 2002, as the EU requirement for active surveillance for BSE increased significantly from 1 July 2001.</P>
      <P>In the period 1 January 2001 to 30 June 2001, the BSE testing requirement applied only to a random sample of fallen animals over 24 months of age, to animals over 30 months of age intended for human consumption and to casualty animals over 24 months of age. In addition in that period 278,025 animals over 30 months of age were slaughtered under the purchase for destruction scheme and did not, therefore, have to be tested.</P>
      <P>From 1 July 2001, the BSE testing requirement was extended to cover all fallen animals over 24 months of age. This fact, and the ending of the purchase for destruction scheme on 30 June 2001, greatly increased the number of cattle required to be tested from 1 July 2001. Indeed to date in 2002, a total of 266,480 rapid BSE tests were conducted, compared to 126,230 such tests in the same period in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="884" />Finally, despite the vastly increased levels of active surveillance, the age profile of the animals confirmed with BSE is increasing. No four-year old animals were identified as having BSE in 2001 or 2002. This indicates that the enhanced controls introduced in this country in 1996 are working, and that the disease should begin to work its way out of the national herd as older animals leave the system.</P>

    <P>The EU operates as a single entity in the WTO, with the negotiations carried out by the EU Commission in accordance with a mandate decided by the Council of Ministers. The current mandate was approved by the Agriculture and General Affairs Councils in September and October 1999 <Col N="885" /> and provides a satisfactory framework for protecting Irish interests.</P>
    <P>The WTO Ministerial Declaration agreed at Doha in November 2001 which launched the new round of negotiations is in accordance with that mandate.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to continue to ensure that the EU adheres to a common position in the WTO negotiations which protects the interests of Irish and European agriculture and agri-business.</P>

      <P>The position with regard to payments under the 2001 premium and compensatory allowance schemes is that some &euro;1.131 billion has been paid to farmers under these schemes to date. In fact, since 1 May 2002, almost 445,000 payments in excess of &euro;164 million have issued.</P>
      <P>Payments under the 2001 extensification premium scheme commenced on 7 June and some 113,600 payments totalling more than &euro;128 million have issued to date. The vast majority of clear cases have now received their entitlements and payments are continuing as queries are being resolved. Payment will be made in all eligible cases by 30 June in line with EU rules and Protocol commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Payment of the Euro Compensation top-up under the 2001 special beef premium scheme commenced earlier this week and payment of the euro top-up under the 2001 extensification pre<Col N="886" /> mium scheme is commencing today. Payments under these schemes will continue over the coming days and will be completed by 30 June 2002 in line with EU rules.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate the effects the adverse weather conditions are having on the farming sector now, the high level of payments which have issued since 1 May will help to alleviate any hardship being experienced at present.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the importance of providing services in an efficient, effective and user-friendly manner. In recent years my Department has made huge strides in the timely and efficient delivery of payments to farmers. We have set quality of service as an integral part of all our operations. We have met the target dates for paying eligible applicants under the various schemes that are set out in the Protocol on Direct Payments to Farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Irish beef industry is considering a rationalisation plan for the cattle slaughtering sector. This plan is in line with the recommendations of the McKinsey Study, the report of the task force on the beef industry and Agri-Food 2010 Plan of Action. These reports concluded that there is excess slaughtering capacity in the sector and that the removal of this surplus would result in substantial benefits to the industry in terms of reduced processing costs and <Col N="888" /> the more effective marketing of Irish beef both on the EU and third country markets. The recommended means of removing the excess capacity was by means of a special fund to be established and managed by the industry itself.</P>
      <P>The rationalisation plan under discussion in the industry envisages a modest reduction in the number of factories in the sector and takes account of the need for the geographic spread of such facilities. With regard to the implications for employment, the Beef Task Force concluded that the existing situation resulted in part-time working and the leakage of skilled employees to other sectors. The removal of excess slaughtering capacity would provide for more sustainable full time jobs and the development of a skilled work force as well as better career prospects in the industry.</P>
      <P>The Government accepts the need for the rationalisation of slaughtering facilities in the beef sector and has already decided under the national development plan to give priority to the beef sector in the context of rationalisation. My Department has had informal preliminary discussions with the beef industry on its most recent rationalisation plan. I should emphasise, however, that the funding of the rationalisation plan is entirely a matter for the beef industry itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>A combination of factors, including in particular its increasing profile as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy in the same family of diseases as BSE, has led to a more proactive approach to the eradication of scrapie from the national flock.</P>
      <P>Against this background, and on the basis of continued scientific uncertainty about the effectiveness of alternative strategies for dealing with the disease, flocks in which a case of scrapie is confirmed are being depopulated. In addition, those whose flocks are depopulated will not be permitted to re-stock with sheep for a period of two years from the date of depopulation. This policy is accompanied by a compensation package covering the capital cost of the sheep depopulated, and loss of profit for the period of two years during which re-stocking with sheep is not permitted, and for the third year in which re-stocking may commence.</P>
      <P>For the present, it is intended to continue to depopulate flocks in which scrapie is diagnosed. In 2002, however, this policy is being accompanied by a far more intensive active surveillance programme comprising a minimum of 45,000 rapid tests for scrapie at slaughterhouses and 4,500 tests at fallen animal collection centres. This will assist us in determining the incidence of scrapie and its geographical distribution, and will, along with any developments at EU level in the interim, provide the basis for a review of the present policy later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart altogether from any human health concerns that may or may not exist, the presence of scrapie in the national flock is a very considerable issue for the sheep sector. It is therefore clearly in the interests of the sector that everything possible is done to eradicate the disease. While breeding for genetic resistance might well be the best option when and if the science is clarified, for the present it remains the case that national policy <Col N="891" /> will focus on a multi strand approach of additional surveillance, depopulation where appropriate, and the continuation of research into the value of genotyping on an experimental basis.</P>

      <P>I presume the question by the Deputy refers to diversification of production in the arable crops sector, from the traditional cereals crops to other crops such as oilseed rape and protein crops. In general decisions made by producers will be influenced by the cost of production as compared to returns from the market, the rate of area aid available, and the suitability of the particular crop to Irish conditions.</P>
      <P>Under the Agenda 2000 agreement the rate of area aid for oilseeds was aligned with that for cereals, which from this year is &euro;383.04 per hectare. The effects of this alignment on production will be assessed as part of the mid term review of Agenda 2000. Protein crops which consist of peas, field beans and sweet lupins receive a premium of &euro;9.5 per tonne over cereals, which in Ireland translates into an additional &euro;57 per hectare over cereals.</P>
      <P>Oilseed rape traditionally has been used as a break crop in Ireland, on land used to produce wheat. The absence of crushing facilities here has meant that virtually all of the harvested crop has had to be exported, and this has reduced potential returns to producers. The area under this crop in Ireland has been insignificant with less than 1,000 hectares grown in 2001. Production of protein crops, although higher, only amounted to about 2,900 hectares. These figures should be looked at in the context of a total of some 240,000 hectares of land in the arable crops scheme.</P>
      <P>Production of oilseeds and a range of other crops for non food uses such as bio fuels, is permitted on set aside land without affecting the farmers entitlement to the set aside payment. The area of land used for this purpose in Ireland in 2001 was 350 hectares.</P>
      <P>It is not open to me, under EU rules, to provide additional incentives over and above the area aid, to produce these crops.</P>

      <P>The traceability elements of the National Beef Assurance Scheme have been fully operational since 1 January 2000. It was envisaged that other aspects of the scheme and in particular the inspection and approval of farms would be undertaken this year in tandem with the annual round of testing. In this regard, detailed discussions took place with Veterinary Ireland and its predecessor organisation as well as the representative farming organisations over a long period concerning the inspection of farms. It was decided that the inspections should be carried out by the veterinary surgeon at the time of the annual herd test and a protocol for the conduct of the inspections was agreed. However, while the necessary arrangements were made to have inspections commenced in tandem with the 2002 annual round of testing, only a small number of inspections have been completed to date because of resistance mainly from veterinarians whose union is seeking a centralised payment system for the costs involved.</P>
      <P>In this context, the legislation passed by the Oireachtas establishing the scheme clearly provides that the cost of securing a certificate of approval is the responsibility of the applicant. In any event, the Exchequer has already invested some &euro;43 million in developing the cattle identification and traceability system that underpins the scheme and costs continue to be incurred under this heading.</P>
      <P>The national beef assurance scheme was designed to provide additional assurances to consumers and customers of Irish beef by demonstrating strict implementation of high standards across the production chain. The scheme is an important element in the drive to maintain marketplace in a sector recovering from serious difficulty. I am disappointed with recent developments and I would strongly urge all parties to lend their support at this stage to the delivery of the scheme.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the statement to which the Deputy refers. I am acutely conscious of the difficulties that have arisen, particularly in the dairy markets over the past number of months, as a <Col N="893" /> result of a weakening in international demand, and have taken immediate action to address the situation.</P>
      <P>Specifically in the dairy sector, I have pressed the EU Commission continuously for decisive action utilising all the market mechanisms available at EU level to stimulate demand. In the past month I have exerted particularly strong pressure on the Commission and I have put a range of proposals to Commissioner Fischler. These included the need to adopt a more aggressive export refunds policy, to prolong intervention for skim milk powder and to encourage greater utilisation of internal supports. I am pleased that the Commission has responded to my proposals by increasing export refunds for cheese by 15%, further increasing SMP and whole milk powder export refunds by 10% and 5% respectively, increasing aid for the manufacture of casein by 52% and agreeing to continue intervention for SMP in excess of the threshold of 109,000 tonnes by means of a tendering system. In relation to this tendering mechanism, I have asked the Commission to ensure that it is used to ensure maximum stability for the skim market on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>These initiatives, taken in the last few weeks, follow a number of actions taken at EU level since the current market deterioration became evident last November:</P>
      <P>Export refunds for skim and whole milk powder were increased on five separate occasions, and together with the latest increase now stand at &euro;715 and &euro;1078 per tonne respectively;</P>
      <P>Export refunds for butter were increased twice to their current level of &euro;1750 per tonne; and private storage aid was introduced for both butter and cheese.</P>
      <P>In addition, the main internal support measures such as aids for the use of butter in the ice cream and pastry sector and aid for the use of skim powder in animal feed continue to take up significant quantities.</P>
      <P>I will continue to closely monitor the market for dairy products in order to ensure that every possible action is taken at community level to stimulate demand so as to safeguard the position of the processing industry and to protect the incomes of dairy farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the beef sector is concerned, cattle prices are reasonably satisfactory at present having regard to the increased premiums payable under Agenda 2000. My Department is making every effort to secure the re-opening of those third country markets, which were closed to Irish and EU beef following the BSE scares of 2000. The Egyptian market re-opened last year and, in recent weeks, a shipment of beef to Egypt has been prepared by one of our major exporters for Egypt. Naturally, I am hopeful that this initial <Col N="894" /> shipment will generate further business in this important market. EU markets are continuing to offer strong demand for Irish beef, which is helping the overall situation. In relation to beef, following the BSE crisis in late 2000, the Government took very decisive and crucial action to deal with the surplus of beef coming on to a weak market during 2001 and to deal with a range of problems associated with the banning of meat and bone meal as a feed. All of this, especially when taken against the background of increasing direct payments negotiated under Agenda 2000, contributed, and continues to contribute, to the maintenance of producer incomes in this sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland imports an extensive range of poultry meat from other member states and from third countries. The compilation of statistics in relation to such imports is in the first instance a matter for the Central Statistics Office. I have arranged for the relevant information to be sent to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Poultry meat produced in a European Union country may be traded freely between EU countries provided it has been produced in a manner that complies with the relevant health and marketing rules. Common rules apply throughout the EU and these include the requirement that product be produced in an approved establishment, the hygiene standards to be observed, labelling specifications etc. Where an additive has been included in a product this must be declared on the retail label. There is no prohibition on the inclusion of additives in a product provided that the additive is not a banned substance and does not pose a risk to animal and public health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Imports from third countries, that is non-EU countries, are subject to strict rules governing the importation of such products as established under EU harmonised legislation. In particular, the country of origin and the establishment in which the poultry meat was produced must be approved in advance by the EU Commission. The granting of approvals is dependent on such factors as the poultry health status of the country, adequacy of its veterinary structures, facilities of the production establishment and employment of good hygiene practices. Third country production <Col N="895" /> plants are inspected by veterinary experts from EU countries before approval is given.</P>
    <P>On arrival in the EU, third country poultry meat is subject to official inspection at the first port of arrival. This includes checks on accompanying documents and on identity and labelling as well as random physical checks on the product itself. If these checks indicate that everything is in order importation is authorised and thereafter the poultry meat may circulate freely within the EU.</P>
    <P>The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health of the European Commission constantly monitors events in member states and third countries which are likely to have implications for public health.</P>
    <P>The framework of veterinary checks provided for by harmonised EU rules, the implementation of those rules by my Department and the veterinary services of other member states, together with the constant programme of monitoring and review of public health risks provided for under the aegis of the standing committee, are intended to provide assurance that imported animal products are fit for human consumption, while allowing member states to fulfil their trade obligations as members of the European Union and the World Trade Organisation.</P>
    <P>In light of the serious animal disease outbreaks in the UK and the misleading labelling of imported frozen poultry fillets &ndash; it is clear that there is a need to re-examine these controls, and that the European Commission needs to re-focus its attention to some extent, on the potential threat to animal and human health from third country imports.</P>
    <P>I have made my views on this issue clear to my European colleagues and that I will continue to press for a review of the controls in this area as a matter of priority.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 43 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>The international market situation for milk products entered a period of decline in the third quarter of 2001 and this decline has deepened since then. Demand is weak for all products in all markets, primarily due to the economic slowdown in key international economies. Given the export dependence of the Irish industry the international environment has a particular impact.</P>

    <P>I am fully aware of the situation and of the concern of milk producers. I will continue to closely monitor the market for dairy products in order to ensure that every possible action is taken at community level to stimulate demand and to protect the incomes of dairy farmers.</P>

      <P>Implementation of the Nitrates Directive 91/676/EEC, which deals with the protection of waters from pollution by nitrates from agricultural sources, is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The Minister sought my views before briefing the Government some time ago on the issues associated with implementation of a number of EU directives on waste and water quality, including the nitrates directive. The views of my <Col N="900" /> Department were also sought on the Information Paper on Good Agricultural Practice and Protection of the Environment, issued by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, which addresses issues raised in discussions with the main farming organisations and other interests.</P>
      <P>Proposals for implementation of the directive are being developed by officials of the Department of the Environment and Local Government in consultation with my Department, the relevant agencies such as Teagasc and the Environmental Protection Agency and other interested parties, including the main farming organisations. My Department has participated in a panel of experts which was established to make recommendations in relation to the designation of vulnerable zones under the directive. During 2001 my Department participated in a number of meetings with the Department of the Environment and Local Government and other agencies for the purposes of assembling data required for implementing the nitrates directive. In addition, my Department participates on an ongoing basis in a liaison group, involving the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Geological Survey of Ireland and Teagasc, which was established to consider issues involved in the implementation of the nitrates directive and the development of proposals for an action programme or programmes, including regulations, for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Successful implementation of the directive is important for the many farmers who are beneficiaries of the measures included in the CAP rural development plan, under which funding was secured for compensatory allowances, REPS, early retirement and forestry for the period 2000-2006. The plan includes commitments in respect of the implementation the nitrates directive, and to ensure continued EU funding of these measures it is necessary for Ireland to deliver on those commitments.</P>

      <P>Ireland imports an extensive range of meat and meat products from other member states of the EU and from third countries. In accordance with our trade obligations as a member of the European Union and the World Trade Organisation, we are obliged to accept these imports, provided they comply with harmonised <Col N="901" /> EU control measures governing veterinary checks applicable to intra community and third country trade.</P>
      <P>My Department is responsible for implementing the veterinary regulations governing such imports. The imported products must come from establishments which have been approved by the EU Commission for trade-export within and to the European Community. Imports from third countries can only be brought into the EU through border inspection posts which have been approved by the EU Commission. Importers must be registered and provide prior notice to the Department of impending import consignments and present the necessary documentation including health certificates on arrival. Consignments which fail to meet the veterinary regulatory requirements at border inspection posts are re-exported or destroyed.</P>
      <P>In addition, all products placed on the market must comply with EU and national labelling laws. The labelling regulations are designed to provide information on the nature and characteristics of food products thereby allowing consumers to make informed choices about the food they buy. My Department is responsible for the implementation of the Beef Labelling Regulations, Council Regulation 1760/2000, while the general food labelling regulations for pre-packaged foodstuffs, Council Directive 2000/13/EC, come under the remit of the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment and are enforced by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland through the environmental health services of the health boards.</P>
      <P>I will continue to ensure through the EU Council of Ministers and other EU fora that the harmonised regulations governing imports are updated, if necessary, and strictly enforced across all member states. On a number of occasions I have raised at the Council my concerns in relation to these imports. My Department will also continue to take a pro-active role with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland in ensuring that consumers are not misled by inaccurate or fraudulent labelling and I intend to review the operation and implementation of the labelling requirements.</P>

      <P>The horticulture sector is assisted in various ways. There is a scheme of investment aid in commercial horticulture under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, for which up to &euro;19 million has been allocated. This scheme assists producers in the purchase of new specialised equipment and facilities. There has been a good take-up in the first round which will end shortly. I expect that a second round will be open in the autumn.</P>
      <P>There is also a scheme of investment aid for the potato sector under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, which has funding of &euro;5.5 million approximately in that period. Approvals in the first round amounted to &euro;1.2 million. A further round will be opened next year.</P>
      <P>A further scheme under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, is designed to aid the marketing and processing of agricultural products. Horticultural producers have obtained grant approval of some &euro;2.5 million under this scheme in the first round. The scheme will be opened again next year when further aid will be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" />In addition, producers are encouraged to form producer groups, which have the aims of producing quality product in an efficient manner. It is expected that up to &euro;3.5 million will be paid in aid to these groups this year.</P>
    <P>Support under these schemes includes assistance towards environmentally friendly production and improved standards for crops marketed. The regulations on the common organisation of the market for fruit and vegetables set out minimum marketing standards which must be complied with when product is displayed for sale. My Department carries out controls to ensure that these standards are met.</P>
    <P>My Department also provides funding to Teagasc and An Bord Glas to supply advice and assistance to horticultural producers. The effectiveness of these measures and the development of the sector will be kept under continuous review.</P>

      <P>The recent discovery by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland that certain imported poultry products into Ireland from the Netherlands contained bovine and porcine proteins which were in breach of EU labelling regulations has been brought to the attention of the EU Commission and the Dutch authorities.</P>
      <P>The FSAI report on the incident highlights the need for attention at EU level to the issue of imports into the Union from third countries, to the application of EU labelling rules and to those measures which ensure the strictest control of ingredients used in food production. The specific details reported by the FSAI mainly concerned the handling and processing of imported poultry product by Dutch processors. The FSAI also concluded that Irish produced poultry products which they also sampled were found negative for the presence of bovine or porcine DNA. Notwithstanding this position, I nevertheless initiated an immediate examination and survey of Irish poultry processing establishments and all results obtained to date have been negative in line with the FSAI findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incident does highlight the need for greater vigilance at EU level regarding the handling of imports and their labelling, once product is in free circulation within the EU. This is something that I am taking up with the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs which is respon<Col N="904" /> sible for the labelling rules in Ireland and the issue is also being actively considered at EU level.</P>

      <P>The previous rural environment protection scheme, which closed for applications in December 1999, included a supplementary measure under which farmers could receive payment for allowing public access to their land for environmentally friendly leisure and sporting activities. EU Council Regulation (EEC) No 2078/92, under which REPS was introduced in 1994, provided for such payments.</P>
      <P>The current REPS is governed by a different regulation, Council Regulation, EC No. 1257/1999, which makes no provision for payments for public access as part of the EU co-funded agri-environment programme. In recognition of this, my Department included in its proposals for the current scheme a provision for a public access measure as a state aid, in other words a measure funded fully from the Irish Exchequer. The Commission took the view, however, that a public access measure could not be allowed under the agri-environment title of the Council regulation even as a state aid. This ruled out the inclusion of such a measure in the current REPS.</P>
      <P>Participants in the first REPS who are currently in receipt of payment under the public access supplementary measure may continue to avail of payments under this measure until the end of their existing agreements.</P>
      <P>I am obviously very much aware of the matter raised by the Deputy. Unfortunately there is no possible solution within the regulations governing REPS.</P>

      <P>I introduced a scheme for the distribution of the balance of the Agenda 2000 milk quota among certain producers. Producers who satisfy certain criteria and who had been involved in the farm modernisation scheme or the reduced interest scheme for farmers in financial difficulty during the early 1980s or who were affected by an outbreak of animal disease in their herds during the late 1970s were eligible to apply.</P>
      <P>A large volume of applications was received under this scheme and processing of these is taking place at present. An application was received from the person named. My Department will not be in a position to confirm whether individual applications are acceptable until a full assessment of the accompanying documentation has been conducted. The assessment of all of these applications involves a considerable amount of work and I am unable to say when that work will be completed and when allocations will be announced. My Department will endeavour to have the applications processed as quickly as possible. Allocations made under this scheme will be effective from the 2002-2003 milk quota year.</P>

      <P>My Department has arrangements in place at main ports and airports to check compliance with the relevant import requirements as specified under EU legislation. The general conditions which apply to imports are as follows: the meat products must have been prepared and stored in an approved establishment, that is the processing plant-cold store, which has been allocated an approval number; and the meat products must be marked with a health mark containing the initials of the exporting country and the approval number of the consigning establishment within an oval surround.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consignment must also be accompanied to destination by the following: a commercial document which must bear, in addition to the health mark described above, a code number by which the competent authority responsible for supervising the establishment of origin can be identified if sourced from an establishment within the European Community; or in respect of imports from <Col N="910" /> third countries, a health certificate conforming to model certificates as set down in EU legislation and issued by the competent authority at the time of loading and which has been signed by an official veterinarian of the competent authority of the exporting third country; and, in the case of products containing meat derived from bovine animals slaughtered the United Kingdom, a health certificate which has been signed by an official veterinarian of the competent authority stating that the products conform to the relevant conditions laid down in Council Decision 98/256/EC concerning emergency measures to protect against BSE.</P>
    <P>In respect of bovine meat products additional labelling requirements apply under EU legislation requiring the compulsory labelling of beef at all stages of production and marketing up to and including the final point of sale to the consumer. The legislation was introduced in two stages. The first stage, which entered into force on 1 September 2000, requires operators or organisations to label beef with the following information: a reference number or code which enables the beef to be traced back to an animal or group of animals from which the it was derived; the approval number of the slaughterhouse and member state or third country in which it is located; and the approval number of the deboning hall and member state or third country in which it is located.</P>
    <P>The second stage which came into effect on 1 January requires the following additional compulsory indication of the origin of the animal or group of animals from which the beef has been derived: the member state or third country where the animal was born; the member state or third country where the animal was fattened; and the member state or third country where the animal was slaughtered.</P>
    <P>In the case of restaurants, compulsory beef labelling requirements apply up to and including the sale of beef to the restaurant itself. This ensures that the proprietor of a restaurant has all the relevant information concerning the origin and production of the beef he has purchased and that he can provide traceability of the product should an issue of public health concern arise.</P>

      <P>Ireland imports an extensive range of meat and meat products from other member states of the EU and third countries. In accordance with its trade obligations as a member of the <Col N="911" /> EU and the World Trade Organisation, Ireland is obliged to accept these imports, provided they comply with harmonised EU control measures governing veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable to intra community and third country trade.</P>
      <P>These measures constitute an essential control on the importation of animal products from third countries. In light of the recent serious animal disease outbreaks in the UK and the misleading labelling of imported frozen poultry fillets it is clear that there is a need to re-examine these controls. It is also clear that the European Commission needs to refocus its attention, to some extent, on the potential threat to animal and human health from third country imports.</P>
      <P>I have made my views on this issue clear to my European colleagues and I will continue to press for a review of the controls in this area as a matter of priority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The initial policy when the bovine tuberculosis scheme was introduced in 1954 was to eradicate bovine TB from cattle herds and this still remains the objective. Significant progress was made in the earlier stages of the scheme but the progress has stalled at a relatively low level of the disease.</P>
      <P>Given the experience in the past 30 years there is a recognition that the incidence of the disease in wildlife is a major impediment and that further technological advances will be needed to achieve further progress. Important short-term objectives are to ensure that the incidence of the disease is reduced to the minimum level attainable so that markets, in particular export markets, are not jeopardised and so that there is no serious threat to human life.</P>
      <P>In the context of the PPF, a package of measures was agreed with the objective of reducing the incidence of TB by 50% over the four years of the programme. The number of reactors being disclosed has been declining since 1999 and this downward trend continued in 2001. The number of TB reactors for the year at less than 34,000 represents a decrease of 15% and 24% respectively on the corresponding reactor figures for 2000 and 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant progress was made in the initial stages of the brucellosis eradication programme and Ireland was officially declared brucellosis free in 1986. Unfortunately, the disease was not fully eradicated at the time and significant num<Col N="912" /> bers of reactors were disclosed in the following years resulting in ongoing depopulations of herds. There was a further deterioration in the disease level from 1996 and consequently a series of measures were introduced during 1997 and subsequent years to seek to address the problem.</P>
    <P>The full impact of the measures is being kept under review but significant progress has been made since 1998. During 2001 some 3,142 reactor animals were identified compared with 3,729 in 2000, 4,545 in 1999 and 6,417 in 1998. The 2001 figure represents a 51% decrease on the 1998 figure. The number of newly restricted herds has fallen from 1,081 in 1998 to 553 in 2001, a 49% decrease. It is anticipated that the improvement shown in recent years will continue in the coming years but at a slower rate as the incidence of the disease continues to fall. It is expected that if current control measures are maintained, eradication of the disease will be achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of new export markets for Irish food produce is primarily the responsibility of the food industry itself. My Department, in co-operation with the statutory food promotion agency, An Bord Bia, will continue to assist the industry to establish new export markets for Irish food produce in both EU and international markets and to consolidate its presence in existing markets. Under the national development plan the Government has provided funding of &euro;61 million to enhance the competitiveness and innovative capabilities of the food industry. This funding will be administered by An Bord Bia and will be used to improve the market orientation of the Irish food industry in an increasingly challenging environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Operating under the umbrella brand, Ireland the Food Island, An Bord Bia implements a range of activities and programmes specifically tailored to increase awareness of Ireland as a producer of quality food. At export level it works closely with producers, processors and customers in target markets. For example, in the dynamic prepared consumer food sector An Bord Bia has targeted the retail and food service sector in continental Europe as an import strategic objective. In the sheepmeat sector, the focus is directed at the continued development of Irish lamb identification in the French market. An Bord Bia continues to develop trade in the Asia Pacific market. In the past year An Bord Bia has increased its commitment to the region, reflecting its growing importance as a market for food and drink exports. In March An Bord Bia undertook a mar<Col N="913" /> keting campaign to coincide with the visit of <i>LE Niamh</i> to a number of ports in the region.</P>
    <P>The Irish meat industry continues to export to a wide arrange of markets worldwide. An Bord Bia has developed a common identity mark for Irish beef which has been rolled out in Britain and is currently being tested for other markets. In Italy and the Netherlands they have invested significant resources in direct consumer promotions to promote consumption of Irish beef. Last year a major initiative was the organisation of the European Meat Forum to relaunch Irish beef on the European market. Over 160 European buyers and 18 trade journalists attended from ten countries.</P>
    <P>With regard to third countries, intense diplomatic, political and technical efforts are being undertaken to ensure market access for Irish food products. The Russian market for Irish beef, which was closed following the foot and mouth disease crisis, was reopened in 2001. Following intensive efforts, the Egyptian market was reopened to Irish beef imports last October. Particular attention is also being focused on the Gulf region, which is a significant market for Irish beef. The Japanese market for pigmeat, closed to Ireland, following the foot and mouth disease outbreak is also very important and following intensive efforts is now set to reopen.</P>
    <P>The success of these marketing and promotion activities is self-evident as the Irish food industry has achieved significant results in recent years. Since 1995 the value of output for the Irish food and drink industry has increased by 15% or almost &euro;1.9 billion to reach &euro;13 billion. Food and drink exports represent 27% of net Irish exports, while 50% of exports from indigenous Irish companies are food and drink products.</P>

      <P>The TB free status of the herd of the person named was withdrawn because of his failure to test cattle in his possession, for two years from 1 November 1997 to 28 October 1999, at a time when there was a high incidence of TB in his area. My Department wrote to the person named on 18 June 1999 advising him that it was his responsibility to ensure that all bovines in his possession had an annual TB test, and that none had been carried out in 1998.</P>
      <P>My Department wrote again to the person named on 15 October 1999. He was informed that because his herd had not been tested since November 1997 his herd number was being suspended. He was also informed that because he had not surrendered all cattle identity cards in his possession, as requested by an authorised officer, he was in breach of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, and payment of his cattle headage grant may be withheld.</P>
      <P>The person named had a clear TB test on 28 October 1999. He was advised by letter dated 9 February 2000 that if he had another clear test within 60 days of the last TB test he would regain his TB free status. He was also requested again to surrender all cattle identity cards in his possession and was advised that failure to do so was an offence under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 18 February 2000 he was informed by his district livestock office that his 1999 cattle <Col N="915" /> headage grants were being refused because he had failed to comply with the provisions of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966. He was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed by writing to my Department within 21 days setting out any facts which he wished to put forward to support his case. He asked for a review by letter dated 28 February 2001. His case was examined by the regional higher executive officer and the original decision was upheld. He was notified of the results of the review by letter of 10 April 2001 and was given an opportunity to appeal the decision to the independent headage and premia appeals unit. His case was examined in the appeals unit where the decision to refuse grants was upheld. He was notified of same by letter of 15 October 2001. At his request, his case was further examined at an oral hearing on 19 December 2001 but the appeals unit did not amend its original findings. He was informed accordingly by letter of 9 January.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the <Col N="916" /> person concerned made an application for exemption from VRT in respect of a UK registered vehicle, under the transfer of residence provisions. This was refused on the basis that the person was unable to satisfy the Commissioners that he had possession and use of the vehicle abroad for at least six months before transferring his residence to the State, as required in the relevant legislation. This refusal has been appealed under the terms of section 145 of the Finance Act, 2001, and a review of the decision in this case is currently being carried out. The person will be advised of the outcome of this appeal in due course and of the further rights of appeal under section 146 of the Finance Act, 2001, if this is appropriate.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for me to comment further while the appeal process is under way or to attempt to anticipate the outcome of such an appeal.</P>

      <P>I am aware of concerns that have been expressed in relation to the 2002 leaving certificate biology higher level examination paper. In accordance with normal procedures any concerns expressed to my Department are being forwarded to the chief examiner.</P>
      <P>The examination paper was designed to test candidates' knowledge across the range of the syllabus. The current biology syllabus is presented in ten sections and no section of the syllabus was omitted from the examination paper. There is a significant element of choice within the examination paper whereby candidates are required to answer four questions from eight questions provided in part 2 of the paper. Candidates are required to answer six questions from seven short questions in part 1 of the paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our examination system is acknowledged to be one of the most open, transparent and pro-candidate national examination systems in the world. Its mechanisms can take on board genuine con<Col N="919" /> cerns that interested parties including schools and students might have in relation to the examinations.</P>
    <P>Over and above any observations submitted, as a matter of course, subject associations and the teacher unions each year provide observations on question paper content to my Department in advance of each marking conference. All observations received in relation to a subject are made available to the chief examiner for consideration in the context of preparing the marking scheme for that subject. The marking scheme is developed at the marking conference by the chief examiner and the team of examiners who are drawn from teachers of the subject. In the case of biology, experienced teachers acting as examiners, are able to input their own considered views into the formulation of the marking scheme.</P>
    <P>As it has been the practice for a number of years to publish the detailed marking schemes used in the marking process, all interested parties will be able to satisfy themselves in relation to the marking process that applies in the case of biology this year. Any candidate who chooses to view his/her marked script will have access to the marking scheme and will be able to see at first hand precisely how the finalised marking scheme applied in his or her own case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The five residential schools for young offenders under the aegis of my Department are owned by the State and managed on its behalf by boards of management. The schools are currently governed by the terms of the Children Act, 1908, which will be replaced by the Children Act, 2001, when the provisions of the latter Act are commenced.</P>
      <P>The operation of the five schools is financed totally from the first level education Vote of my Department. Each school is allocated a budget from which all normal pay and non-pay operating costs are met. The pay costs of the teachers in each school are paid centrally by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current staffing levels of the unit in my Department with responsibility for the young offender centres are: one higher executive officer, two executive officers and two clerical officers. In addition there is an assistant principal officer, a <Col N="920" /> principal officer and an assistant secretary general who have responsibility for this area along with other duties. I am satisfied that the staffing levels in this area are adequate.</P>
    <P>My Department also has a child care adviser whose role is to provide advice and assurance to the Department in relation to the children in care in the special schools. In addition a member of the inspectorate has responsibility for inspection of the schools in accordance with provisions of the Children Act, 1908. There are also a number of other special support areas in my Department that provide a service to the centres as required. These areas include the building unit, legal services and external staff relations.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the overriding need to ensure that the quality of services provided by the schools for young offenders meets recognised standards. It is my intention that each centre will be independently inspected by an external agency as soon as possible. Independent inspection will give reassurance concerning the standard of care being provided, the efficacy of the systems and procedures being followed and the efficiency of each centre's operations. My Department has consulted with the schools and the social services inspectorate on this matter and a pilot inspection is currently under way in Finglas Child and Adolescent Centre. A report on this inspection is due shortly. I am confident that independent inspection will identify any weaknesses that may exist and give confidence that the children concerned are being cared for in a manner that accords with established best practice.</P>
    <P>Furthermore in order to ensure that there are adequate places available to accommodate children who have been convicted or placed on remand by a court. I have commissioned an independent review of the residential requirements for young offenders. The purpose of this review is to ensure that there are sufficient and appropriate residential places available to meet the needs of the target group into the future. The review will also indicate if existing places are being used optimally.</P>
    <P>Agreement has also been secured for an independent review of child care staffing levels and structures in the schools for young offenders. This review will indicate the staffing levels and structures required to enable the schools provide a high quality and caring service to its residents in an efficient and economic manner.</P>
    <P>The recently established special residential services board will have a role to play in ensuring the efficient and co-ordinated delivery of services for the young people concerned.</P>

      <P>Mr. Laxton examined and inspected the operations of the centre by reference to draft standards that were drawn up by my Department in consultation with the centres themselves and social services inspectorate.

      <P>I intend to review and finalise the standards for inspection following the outcome of the pilot inspection of the centre. I will then extend this process of independent inspection to all the young offender centres under the aegis of my Department.</P>
      <P>The process for implementing the report is set out in the draft standards. My Department will issue the report to the centre's director and the chairperson of the board of management. The board of management will be requested to provide details of its plans to implement the recommendations in the inspection report and the associated timescale within one month. Quarterly progress reports on the implementation of the report will have to be submitted to my Department and follow-up visits to assess the extent the actions promised have been undertaken may also be conducted by the inspector.</P>
      <P>The report of the inspection, when complete, will be made available. My Department will also forward it to the social services inspectorate.</P>

    <P>Later this year, when a financial allocation has been made for the primary school building programme in the 2003 Estimates, I will frame a further comprehensive programme of works.

    <P>I intend to bring greater transparency to the operation of the school building programme and to publish the programme annually.

      <P>The student at risk programme in the school to which the Deputy refers received funding in 2000 under the fund for the development of targeted educational responses to certain children at risk. The purpose of this fund is to develop preventative and supportive programmes that are targeted at children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage and social exclusion. Commitments to funding under this fund are given for one year only and projects that receive funding are advised that no liabilities should be entered into which assume the availability of funding in future years.</P>
      <P>Recently my Department announced the school completion programme. This school, together with its four feeder primary schools, has been invited to participate. The objective of the programme is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education. All the schools involved have been requested to come together with relevant local statutory, voluntary and community bodies, the city-county development board and the local drugs task force to form a management committee and to develop and submit a three year plan to tackle early school leaving in their area. This plan will form the basis for the allocation of funding. The management committee of the programme in the area could consider activities similar to those undertaken by the project in the school referred to by the Deputy as part of its plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Officials of my Department held discussions with the representatives of the managerial authorities in the second level sector in <Col N="927" /> order to ensure that schools would remain open, when the ASTI directive to its members to withdraw from voluntary supervision and substitution duties took effect on 4 March.</P>
      <P>Contingency arrangements were drawn up by the representative management groups, the joint managerial body, the Irish Vocational Education Association and the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools. Detailed discussions took place with officials of my Department, as part of the contingency plan, and my Department undertook to resource schools in order that they could employ staff to provide supervision and thereby remain open.</P>
      <P>Payments amounting to &euro;17.8 million have issued under the plan. The contingency plan acknowledges that supplementary allocations may need to be made to some schools at a later date if their approved outgoings are greater than the amount of the grant. Accordingly, final costs are not yet available.</P>
      <P>The contingency plan, by its nature, is flexible and does not specify a pupil-supervisor ratio. As it is recognised that the number of supervisors required would vary from school to school depending on local circumstances including layout, both internal and external, it is considered that school management authorities are best placed to assess the level of cover and the number of persons required on an ongoing basis. Responsibility accordingly for the making of appointments is a matter for school authorities. Information concerning the number of supervisors recruited by schools is not available to my Department.</P>
      <P>The management authorities have informed my Department that 500 schools have implemented the plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The staffing of a national school for a particular school year is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year. This is in accordance with an agreement on staffing entered into between the Government and the education partners. The enrolment of this school on 30 September 2001 was 527 pupils which warrants a staffing of a principal and 18 mainstream class teachers for the <Col N="928" /> 2002-03 school year. As the agreed retention figure for the 19th mainstream class teacher is 528 pupils, I regret that there is no basis on which I may sanction a continuation of this post at Holy Family junior national school, River Valley, Swords for the 2002-03 school year.</P>
      <P>The above staffing agreement can only be deviated from in instances where schools have rapid growth in enrolment numbers. Should the Holy Family national school achieve an enrolment of 557 or more pupils by September its board of management may apply to my Department's primary payments section for a developing school post. The organisation of classes within the school is a matter for its board of management.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 110 together.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned at the increase in alcohol consumption in Ireland in recent years. Earlier this year I established the strategic task force on alcohol. It has made a number of recommendations aimed at reducing the overall level of consumption. The current position regarding the content of labels on alcoholic beverages is strictly regulated. The most recent development at EU level in relation to labels on alcoholic products is that all alcohol products must now display a list of ingredients. Research provided to the strategic task force suggested that there is very little evidence of any effect on drinking behaviour and alcohol related harm by placing warnings on alcohol beverage containers. The research evidence in this area will continue to be monitored.</P>
      <P>While the term &ldquo;unit&rdquo; is used in the UK when discussing quantities of alcohol, the practice here and in most other jurisdictions is to refer to &ldquo;standard drinks.&rdquo;  Agreement has not been reached internationally to define the quantity of alcohol in a standard drink and currently there is no universally accepted measure. At present alcohol beverage containers are required to display the alcohol concentration and the volume of the beverage only. I would favour a requirement that the amount of alcohol in grams be displayed on the container. This has been raised at EU level but agreement has not yet been reached.</P>

      <P>The reports to which the Deputy is referring concern a recent investigation, carried out by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, on chicken fillets imported into Ireland from the Netherlands. This investigation found that a high proportion of the chicken fillets analysed contained ingredients <Col N="934" /> that were not disclosed or accurately stated on the products' labelling. It is not illegal to process chicken breasts by adding water and other ingredients as long as these ingredients are approved and clearly stated on the label of pre-packed products. The FSAI informed the Dutch authorities and the European Commission of its findings and detailed investigations are ongoing.</P>
      <P>With regard to the broader issue of origin labelling, in accordance with our trade obligations as a member of the EU and the WTO, Ireland imports an extensive range of meat and meat products from other EU member states and beyond. All products placed on the market, including poultry, must comply with EU and national labelling laws. The function of the labelling regulations is to ensure that purchasers are informed of the properties, ingredients, nature and characteristics of the food they buy. The information contained in food labels should be clear, unambiguous and should not make misleading and false claims. The general food labelling regulations for pre-packaged foodstuffs, Council Directive 2000/13/EC, come under the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and are enforced by the FSAI through the environmental health services of the health boards.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to work closely with the FSAI to ensure compliance with existing regulations and also to draw attention at EU level to any deficiencies identified in EU food labelling regulations.</P>

      <P>Additional funding of &euro;14.6 million has been made available in recent years to the health boards, including the SEHB, in respect of the provision of health related support services for children with an intellectual disability and those with autism. In addition to this ring-fenced funding, children with disabilities would also have benefited from the additional therapy posts which have been put in place in services for persons with physical or sensory disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many health boards and specialist service providers have been experiencing difficulties in <Col N="938" /> recruiting allied health professionals and specifically speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. This is due primarily to the general shortage of available staff in these grades nationally. Health boards and agencies have been and are continuing to undertake intensive recruitment drives at home and abroad. My Department has asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision or an enhancement in line with agreed service developments using the resources allocated to the services.</P>
    <P>In response to my concern regarding the high level of vacancies, my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The study was published in July 2001. The report recommends a significant annual increase in course places for these professions.</P>
    <P>An interagency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority. The HEA, following a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions, has allocated additional training places for speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy to respond to the training needs identified in the study. In addition, the Northern Area Health Board will shortly be undertaking a concerted overseas recruitment drive for various allied health professionals on behalf of all health boards.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the provision of services to people with an intellectual disability or autism in the south eastern region is a matter for the SEHB. My Department has asked its chief executive officer to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and to reply to him directly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that, in recent days, the communities most affected by the drugs problem have expressed a fear that the issue of drugs will be lost sight of as a priority for Government. Community concern, and it is a legitimate concern, is to ensure that the progress made by the last Government is not undermined in any way.</P>
      <P>I can assure the communities in question on that score. This Government, as did the last Government, intends to keep the fight against drugs to the forefront of the political agenda. This is clearly reflected in An Agreed Programme for Government which recognises the fight against drugs as one of society's great challenges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national drugs strategy for the period up to 2008 brings together all elements of drugs policy into a single framework. Responsibilities are clearly assigned across Departments and agencies. They will implement a series of 100 actions <Col N="941" /> across the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research.</P>
    <P>A number of these actions come within the remit of my Department and its related agencies. In order to advance these actions a number of steering groups and working groups have been established within the Department, the Garda Síochána and the Prisons Service. Consultations are also taking place with competent authorities where there is an agency overlap.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the agreed evaluation framework, it is proposed to report to the interdepartmental group on drugs on the progress being made towards key strategic goals in the strategy. It is intended that an annual report will be published on the nature and extent of the drug problem in Ireland and on progress being made in achieving the objectives set out in the strategy.</P>

      <Quest>the status of an application for asylum in the name of a person (details supplied) in County Wexford; and when a decision will be made in this case.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person in question entered the State on 13 December 1999 and claimed asylum. His claim was refused and he was informed of this decision on 12 June 2000. He did not appeal this decision. On 5 December 2000 a letter issued informing this person that it was proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him and gave him the following options: 15 working days to make written representations as to why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; to leave the State before a decision whether to make a deportation order in respect of him is taken; or to consent to the making of a deportation order. Representations were received on behalf of the person in question as to why he should be allowed leave to remain in the State. This involved a job offer but when my Department gave the person the opportunity to return to Romania to await the outcome of a possible work permit application, he declined the offer.</P>
      <P>Having considered the case file, my predecessor signed a deportation order in respect of the person on 11 April. My predecessor was required to take into account a number of factors under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999. On 20 May a letter issued to the person informing him that a deportation order had been made in respect of him and requiring him to present himself to the Garda Síochána to make arrangements for his deportation from the State. The person in question did not present himself to the Garda Síochána. Therefore, he is liable to arrest and can be detained without warrant for the purpose of arranging his deportation.</P>

      <P>The targets for completions under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, for the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes are 1,000 each per annum. In 2001 a total of 1,611 transactions were completed under the shared ownership scheme and a total of 272 houses were completed under the affordable housing scheme. Progress has been slower than expected under the affordable housing scheme, in part due to the time lag between land acquisition and construction and sale. Since the introduction of a site subsidy in June 2000, the number of transactions has increased. At the end of 2001, a total of 4,168 dwellings were in planning and 1,177 under construction.</P>
      <P>These figures will be supplemented by the significant numbers of affordable housing which will be coming onstream under the provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act which is now fully operational in respect of planning applications for housing developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the key requirements of the Government's integrated strategy on homelessness was that local three year action plans, detailing how accommodation, health, settlement and welfare services will be provided to homeless persons by all of the agencies involved, would be drawn up by homeless fora. This would include representatives of the local authority, health board and voluntary sectors.</P>
      <P>The three year action plan for the Dublin area was adopted in May 2001. It provides a clear framework for the planning and delivery of support and services to the homeless. The long-term vision of the plan is that by 2010 long-term homelessness and the need for people to sleep rough will be eliminated in Dublin. As part of the plan, effective preventative policies and services are being developed so that the risk of a person or family becoming homeless will be minimised. Where homelessness does occur it will be short-term. All people who are homeless will be assisted into housing that is appropriate to their needs.</P>

      <P>In 1998 the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund was established to develop youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The objective of the fund is to attract at risk young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance misuse.</P>
      <P>The main focus of the fund has been on the local drugs task force areas where integrated plans were prepared on the basis of detailed guidelines agreed by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. Development groups were set up in each area and comprised representatives from the relevant local drugs task force, the local authority and the VEC. These plans were submitted for consideration, via the task forces, to the national assessment committee, chaired by my Department. The plans were assessed against the guidelines agreed and recommendations were then made to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. An amount of &euro;54.1 million has been allocated to date to local drugs task force areas under the fund.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the objectives of the fund are being met through the ongoing monitoring of projects by the development groups, the statutory agencies and by the national assessment committee.</P>
      <P>An independent evaluation of the fund is currently under way. The consultants are examining the effectiveness and impact of the fund at national, plan and local level against the criteria used to establish the fund in 1998. The evaluation is due to be completed later this year.</P>

The purpose of this scheme is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.

      <P>Since its commencement a total of &euro;32.5 million has been allocated to the scheme which, to the end of 2001, has assisted 89,136 individuals. A sum of &euro;4.4 million has been provided for the scheme in 2002.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme grant aid is available towards the purchase and/or installation cost of: small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially monitored alarm system such as the pendant alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist.</P>
