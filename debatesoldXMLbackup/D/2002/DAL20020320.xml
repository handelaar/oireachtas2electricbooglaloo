    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 19, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My programme of engagements in the US commenced immediately on my arrival on Monday, 11 March, in Chicago where, at the invitation of the President of Northwestern University, I delivered the annual T.W. Heyck lecture. In the course of my lecture, I addressed a number of issues relating to the Good Friday Agreement. I also took the opportunity to refer to the view recently expressed that a poll might be called in Northern Ireland next year on the question of a united Ireland. I support the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement which allow for holding such a poll at a time when it appears there may be a majority in Northern Ireland in favour of such an outcome. The timing of a poll is obviously a matter for careful judgment and consultation between the Irish and British governments. I would share the concern of many observers that holding such a poll prematurely could serve to polarise the situation and distract from the work of healing and good and fair government that we are trying to achieve under the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>I also referred to the concern that has been expressed that the scope of change in the agreement is such that it risks making Northern Ireland a &ldquo;cold place&rdquo; for the Unionist community. I made it clear that equality is neither a Nationalist nor Unionist agenda. It is a right of both, as well as the essential basis for a stable system. Since the principles of equality and partnership are at the heart of the agreement, the challenge for us all is to improve the confidence and well-being of all communities in Northern Ireland and there is scope for common action to assure unionists of the benefits of the agreement. The lecture was attended by more than 700 people and was followed by a question and answer session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Tuesday, 12 March, I met with Mayor Richard Daley, as well as leaders of the Irish community at the opening of the new Fitzpatrick's Hotel, before departing for Washington. Follow<Col N="892" /> ing my arrival in Washington later that day, I attended the St. Patrick's Day reception hosted by our Ambassador, Sean Ó hUiginn and Mrs. Ó hUiginn. Guests comprised many prominent friends of Ireland in Washington as well as representatives of Northern Ireland political parties, including First Minister, Mr. David Trimble and Deputy First Minister, Mr. Mark Durkan.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday, 13 March, I chaired a breakfast meeting of the Ireland America Economic Advisory Board. The exchanges were focused on developments in the Irish and US economies, with a particular emphasis on the prospects of economic recovery and the possible implications of recent and current events on US foreign direct investment in Ireland.</P>
    <P>For my part, I drew special attention to the unique advantages Ireland continues to offer as an investment location and to the ongoing efforts being made in moving our economy further up the value-added chain. In that regard, I referred to the policies being pursued in the area of science and technology generally and research and development specifically. I also availed of the opportunity to brief the members of the board on key developments relating to Northern Ireland. Later that morning, following the traditional presentation of shamrock at the White House, I had a very positive meeting with President Bush, which was also attended by Secretary of State, Colin Powell and other key officials including Ambassador Haass. The President pledged his Administration's continued strong support for our efforts to implement the Good Friday Agreement, and his willingness to help the two Governments in every appropriate way. We also discussed the very positive economic relationship between our two countries, as well as a wide range of international issues, including the Middle East, EU-US relations, and the continuing war on terrorism. I took the opportunity to reiterate the solidarity of the people of Ireland with the people of the United States and indicated our continued support in the drive against international terrorism.</P>
    <P>Following our meeting and the reception hosted by the President, I attended a lunch on Capitol Hill hosted by Speaker Hastert. President Bush, Ambassador Haass and party leaders from Northern Ireland also attended, as did a large number of members of Congress. In my remarks, I took the opportunity to express appreciation for the support of both Houses of Congress for the peace process. In the afternoon, I met with Senator Kennedy, Senator Dodd, and later Senator Clinton and briefed them on recent developments. As a gesture of our appreciation for his strong and valuable support for Ireland, the Government decided that it would be very appropriate to mark the 40th anniversary of Senator Edward Kennedy's entry in to public life by the funding of a newly established chair in Trinity College Dublin, to be called the Senator Edward M. Kennedy chair in health services management. I am delighted that we were able to <Col N="893" /> honour Senator Kennedy in this way. Ted Kennedy has been a true and valued friend of Ireland over many decades and he has been steadfast in his support for peace and reconciliation. The chair and centre will provide leadership in an area which is both at the centre of Irish public policy debate and one which Senator Kennedy has had as a priority throughout his 40 year public career.</P>
    <P>That evening, I addressed the American Ireland Fund gala dinner where I was honoured to receive its annual peace award. I was delighted to have the opportunity there to acknowledge the important contribution of the fund for the unstinting support it has provided for peace and reconciliation, North and South. In the course of the several events outlined above, I had the opportunity for some exchanges with Northern Ireland party leaders. With regard to the remarks on the nature of this State, I do not believe that most people who live and work here would recognise the State as described by Mr. Trimble. I do not believe there is much purpose to be served at this stage in revisiting this controversy. The 10 April will mark the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. We have, I believe, managed the intervening period with determination as well as sensitivity in seeking to give full effect to the Agreement's provisions. We have faced difficulties and challenges but we have managed to address these together and to keep the process moving forward. We have peace in our country undreamt of several years ago. Our many friends in the United States are deeply mindful of the progress that has been made and support for our efforts there remains strong and committed. I very much welcome this.</P>
    <P>I met with the leader and deputy leader of the SDLP, Mark Durkan and Bríd Rodgers at Government Buildings on 6 March. Our discussions centred on recent political developments and the criminal justice review. We also discussed the issue of policing and the appointment of an international judge to investigate cases of concern. Also on 6 March, I met with a delegation from the Alliance Party led by the party leader, David Forde. We discussed recent developments and issues of concern to the party, in particular issues relating to the procedures in the Assembly.</P>
    <P>I had discussions with Prime Minister Blair on the margins of the EU Summit in Barcelona when we discussed a number of current issues and the continued implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. With regard to the implementation of the Agreement in this jurisdiction, considerable progress has been and continues to be made. Constitutional arrangements are in place which put the future of Northern Ireland firmly in the hands of its people. The institutional arrangements provided for in the Agreement reflect the multi-stranded and complex relationships between the peoples of these islands &ndash; in Northern Ireland, between North and South and between Britain and Ireland. The Government is playing its full part in ensuring that these insti<Col N="894" /> tutions are working productively and effectively on behalf of all of the people. We have also dealt with difficult and painful issues that arise in any process of conflict resolution. Prisoners have been released and steps have been taken in a process of putting paramilitary weapons beyond use. A new dispensation in the areas of human rights and equality is being created. Human rights commissions are in place in both jurisdictions and equality legislation provided for in the Agreement has been enacted. Measures continue to be taken to demonstrate our respect for the different traditions on the island, including funding of the Apprentice Boys maiden city festival and funding of the Ulster-Scots Agency which has as its remit the promotion of Ulster-Scots cultural issues.</P>
    <P>Throughout the process, the Irish and British Governments have worked together as partners. There is no doubt that work remains to be done. There are aspects of the Agreement and of the commitments made by the Governments at Weston Park which have yet to be fully realised. Violence, although greatly diminished, has not fully become a thing of the past as we all hoped it would. There are communities where paramilitary organisations remain influential, and a small number of dissidents continue to seek to use force to overturn the Agreement. They will not be allowed to succeed. We will continue to work with the British Government and with the pro-Agreement parties to secure the full implementation of the Agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a number of supplementary questions. Have the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Garda been briefed on the break-in to the Castlereagh police headquarters? Is the Taoiseach concerned about this event and will he comment on allegations that sections of the security forces in Northern Ireland were involved in the break-in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been briefed on the break-in, in regard to which there are widespread concerns that are shared by the British Government. I welcome the fact that the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. John Reid, has immediately called for an independent investigation to establish what happened. I do not have any specific information apart from what is in the public domain, because that is all the information the authorities had there. Naturally, I would be deeply worried if any highly sensitive information has fallen into the wrong hands, which is the major concern on this issue. It is essential the investigation is completed as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach have precise knowledge of the general nature of the sensitive information? Does it include the names of persons who in the past have assisted the RUC with its inquiries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="895" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know its precise nature, but files containing names and data were taken. I do not know precisely what role those named played and, pending the investigation, it is not known by the Secretary of State, Dr. Reid, either. The information is considered sensitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Focusing on his visit to meet President Bush, how did the Taoiseach indicate he would support the President's war on terrorism? Did he indicate that, as before, there would be free use of Irish airports? Is there to be further progress on legislation specifically dealing with counter-terrorist measures, such as the Criminal Justice (Suppression of Financing of Terrorism) Bill, the Criminal Justice (United Nations Conventions) Bill and the International Criminal Court Bill? The people accepted the latter by referendum at the same time the Nice treaty was rejected. Can the Taoiseach indicate whether he discussed these matters with President Bush, describe what assurances were given and tell us if he will consult with and seek the approval of the Dáil regarding any measures to give effect to his support of the President?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>President Bush and Mr. Colin Powell expressed deep appreciation for the help of this country and its people, particularly for our work in the UN which is seen to have been very effective and helpful. They thanked us for our domestic arrangements to co-operate to confiscate funds or assets across the financial system. They have been continually briefed by the ambassador regarding legislation. I briefed them again and they were extremely happy with that. There was no question of any extension of arrangements for flyovers, but the President recalled that when the USA sought co-operation it was available and he thanked me for that. There was no other stated position.</P>
      <P>I made the point, again, that we believe diplomatic options should be fully exhausted before we would get involved in military force elsewhere and that the primary responsibility for resolving international issues rests with the United Nations. I said that we welcome the resumption of dialogue with the United Nations on a number of issues, such as the Middle East resolution of last week and, of course, Kofi Annan's ongoing dialogue on Iraq.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In his comprehensive reply the Taoiseach referred to the peace process. Has his attention been drawn to a report which states that in the past year more than 700 people have been <Col N="896" /> expelled from Northern Ireland by paramilitary organisations from both the loyalist and so-called republican communities? Can the Taoiseach indicate, with regard to the proposed amnesty for the &ldquo;on the runs&rdquo; or those who are charged with or are being sought for offences against the security forces and against the State, if he intends to extract, from Sinn Féin and the IRA on the one hand and the paramilitary organisations on the other, a commitment that they will cease their harassment and intimidation and, in some cases, unauthorised punishment of persons they deem to be anti-social? Will the amnesty be conditional on their compliance with the rule of law? If anybody is guilty of anti-social or illegal behaviour, the police forces and the courts are there to deal with them.</P>

      <P>There are two aspects to Deputy Quinn's question. The first is the ongoing attacks. The latest figures show that almost two thirds of them now originate from loyalist quarters, a substantial change from what we have seen over the years. However, it does not matter where the violence originates because it is still thuggery and gangsterism and it must be dealt with. The best way of doing that is through support for and the widespread use, by everybody, of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. I welcome the recent reports which show that young Catholics are increasingly joining the force. Hopefully, everybody will come on the side of the force because that is the way of dealing with this problem.</P>
      <P>The second issue is the amnesty<i> vis-à-vis</i> the exiles. The debate is about the amnesty for the OTRs or &ldquo;on the runs&rdquo; as opposed to those who have been exiled over the years and, in some cases, who continue to be exiled. A fair case has been put forward that both issues should be dealt with together. I have made that clear to Sinn Féin and I had hoped to make it clear last week to some of the loyalist leaders but it was not possible. However, I hope to restate it to them on an early occasion.</P>
      <P>This issue is difficult for the British Government, as Members will be aware from comments made in the House of Commons and the House of Lords. There are two options for dealing with the OTRs. There is an administrative procedure which the British Government can follow but it is quite lengthy. It involves checking each case through the administrations of justice and policing in Northern Ireland to ascertain the status of the case and whether it can be cleared. The other option is legislation. It is probably likely that the British Government will continue to use the administrative system; I do not anticipate it introducing legislation in the short-term. The Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, reiterated to me in Barcelona on Saturday that it was his intention to honour his commitment, irrespective of which way he chooses to deal with it.</P>

      <P>I have a separate question relating to the Taoiseach's visit to the United States. The Taoiseach is quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i>, with regard to his discussions with President Bush, as saying he did not feel that the President was about to wage war on anyone unless he felt it was absolutely necessary. The Taoiseach added: &ldquo;I think he also made it clear that he doesn't have any immediate plan to start any action overnight. I think that's not where he is at this stage.&rdquo;  Upon reflection, can the Taoiseach give the House his view as to where he thinks President Bush is now? Does he intend to use the Security Council of the United Nations before he wages war on anybody else? Did the Taoiseach give President Bush any unilateral commitment that Ireland would be by his side irrespective of when he decides to wage war?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reiterate what I said to Deputy Sargent. The Government will continue to work with its EU partners and with others in the international community in an effort to ensure that tensions are resolved without recourse to military action. That is the option people in this country support. They do not see any other option unless the situation gets out of control, as it did in Afghanistan where there was nobody to deal with it. However, that situation does not apply anywhere else at this stage.</P>
      <P>American intelligence shows that thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people who have been trained in terrorist military camps are still at large. I have no reason to disbelieve that. The President, at some length and in detail, outlined to me what had been going on in the camps organised by the Taliban and in similar camps in other countries. He stated that in their view there could be up to 50,000 people who have been trained in terrorism and a small fraction of those have been knocked out in action in Afghanistan. As the Americans see it, based on their intelligence &ndash; the President feels strongly on this and I suppose nobody would be surprised at that after what has happened in the United States &ndash; this sizeable armed and dangerous group of people are out there and they will use their efforts in whatever way they can to deal with this. However, I did not detect that they were going to ignore the principle that the responsibility for resolving international crises rests with the United Nations or that they felt they should either ignore that process or ignore UN Security Council resolutions or the international community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same point, could I just clarify what transpired? Did President Bush, in the course of his long discussions with the Taoiseach, indicate that he wanted to go to war against Iraq? If so, did he give the Taoiseach grounds as to why the United States should go to war against Iraq, did he indicate that he intended to resurrect the UN Security Council motions concerning the legitimate concern that all peace loving countries <Col N="898" /> have regarding the accumulation of arms of mass destruction under Saddam Hussein, and did he indicate whether he proposed to resurrect the authority of the United Nations Security Council so as to revisit, under the authority of the UN, the inspection of arms of mass destruction in Iraq which are a threat to us all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked a number of questions. Everybody is affected by the threat of terrorism which has not abated and the international community must remain unified if we are to address successfully the issues arising out of what happened last September. That is the first point.</P>
      <P>The way to address this &ndash; this is a view which is far more that of the European Union &ndash; is through the UN. Kofi Annan made that clear last week. He has engaged again with Iraq and was widely supported. That, for now, removes the threat of the United States taking action.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>President Bush was very clear. He made the point that he wants to see the inspectors involved, but I do not think the President will tolerate a position where Iraq, as the Americans see it, plays games with the inspectors with the inspectors getting in every now and again, not really getting co-operation or not fulfilling the role which the UN wants them to play. The Americans' strong belief is that weapons of mass destruction are being processed within Iraq, that there are many things Iraq could be doing to help its citizens which it is not doing, and that the sanctions regime should be in place to turn the screw in terms of these issues. That is what the President said.</P>
      <P>I put forward our view, which we followed in the UN Security Council, that these issues should be dealt with internationally through Kofi Annan and his colleagues and that there should be co-operation to operate the sanctions regime in a way that affects the Iraqi people to a minimum and affects the Iraqi Administration to the maximum. That is the focus of the considerable effort being put in by Irish diplomats. It is the right thing to do, rather than just ignoring the effects of sanctions on the poor unfortunates and not turning the screw on the administration. There is clearly a difference of emphasis.</P>
      <P>That view, which I expressed, is widely held. If there is co-operation, the Americans would be happy to see that co-operation progress. However, the Americans will not ignore a situation or allow a situation develop anywhere where a substantial number of trained terrorists are allowed to involve themselves in terror camps and training and in the production of weapons of mass destruction. The Americans will not take as cosy a view into the future as perhaps they did before 11 September, and they regret that.</P>

      <P>That is not a question to be answered now because one does not know what the circumstances are. Ireland is a member of the Security Council and we will engage fully and actively with the Security Council to try to ensure that we can take the appropriate necessary actions. In the case of Afghanistan and when there was no other option, not alone did we support the action but we were one of the key leaders because we were in the chair of the presidency. We gave full support and full cover to the United States and will do so again. However, in the case of Iraq there is a process to be followed. That process has been set out in the resolution by Kofi Annan, which the Americans themselves have sided with since last week. That has to be followed. It is not a black and white position. If in the future there is no co-operation or interest on the part of the Iraqis in helping the United Nations and if they ignore the international community, the position will be different.

      <P>In his first reply, the Taoiseach said to me that the Government was doing everything possible to counter international terrorism. Can I take it from that that he is implying that there is no particular need for the three Bills which I listed that are designed specifically to bring us into line with international measures to combat international terrorism? Will those Bills be published before this Dáil ends? Will the Bills be enacted? </P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach mentioned that there were armed and dangerous people, can I take it he was not referring to the hawks in the Pentagon in that statement because it was a very general statement? Does the Taoiseach agree that there are measures being taken from time to time to combat terrorism that can be counterproductive, particularly the military actions involving the use of weapons such as the big BLU-82 bomb, which collapses lungs, breaks eardrums and pulls out eyes, as reported recently in <i>The Guardian</i> and <i>The Irish Times</i>? This is part of the American arsenal in the fight against terrorism. Is that to be condoned? In the light of that type of response to the threat of terrorism, can the Taoiseach say if the people and this Dáil will be asked to make a decision before any further Irish facilities, such as airports, are made available to the US military forces? That was the case in the Gulf War when Charles Haughey was Taoiseach. Will that be the position if there is further action?</P>

      <P>I was not referring to the Pentagon, as the Deputy asked with tongue in cheek. All wars and conflicts bring their own difficulties. I do not think the Deputy is saying the world should stand back and allow military dictators or people with access to large amounts of money to build up stores of weapons which can be used indiscriminately against humanity. It is sometimes stated that the actions of such people are not seen but we saw their terrible crimes in front of our eyes six months ago.

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the reaction to the recent controversial speech by Mr. David Trimble and to his insulting remarks directed at the State has distracted attention from a far more important part of the speech which related to a referendum on the future constitutional position of Northern Ireland? Would the Taoiseach agree that instead of concentrating on something that would entirely polarise the Northern Ireland community the emphasis should be on bedding down the Good Friday Agreement institutions and on representatives of the two traditions working together to tackle the social, economic, political, cultural and other problems of Northern Ireland? When that has been done we can turn our minds to other things.</P>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach further agree that predictions of a united Ireland within five or ten years, or even before the centenary of the 1916 rebellion, are dangerous nonsense and, for those of us who believe in a united Ireland in the proper circumstances in the future, possibly self-defeating? Is it not time such nonsense stopped?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I broadly agree with what Deputy Currie has said. I do not want to say anything about the first part of the speech. I have stated on the record that I regret the remarks and believe the analysis is unfounded. However, I <Col N="902" /> have said my piece on that matter and believe we should move on.</P>
      <P>Deputy Currie is right that the second part of the speech is more important. Deputy Currie will recall that it was argued that provision for a plebiscite on this issue every seven or ten years should be included in the Good Friday Agreement. At the time I was on the side of the ten year position because I felt that was an appropriately long period. Then it was felt by David Trimble it was wrong to put in that period because it might be too short, so it was not inserted. The wording is that when both Governments and the pro-Agreement parties clearly see there is a view among the people for this, they will take a different position.</P>
      <P>An analysis or examination of the public record at that time or the negotiations that went on will show that the issue would be dealt with in the long term rather than the short term, as the Deputy said, and certainly not within a decade. The feeling during the debate was that it would be the other side of a decade or the centenary in 2016 or whatever, but certainly not within a decade.</P>
      <P>The first review of the Agreement, which will deal with the most important aspects, is not for four years and nobody could have foreseen that it would be otherwise. However, to say before the review of the Agreement that the major clause should be deleted and a plebiscite held makes no sense and it certainly was not the basis of the prolonged discussions I had on this and many other issues. That was not the position.</P>
      <P>It is a dangerous thing to talk about, not to mind think of doing, because so much of the Agreement must not alone be implemented but enforced administratively. That will take a considerable number of years. The review itself, which will probably be held at the end of 2003, will highlight where things are and there is a checklist which will take another four or five years. To try to have a vote before that would be entirely unhelpful to the process and to combine it with the first Assembly elections since the Agreement in May 2003 would be a disaster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Taoiseach of something else I said on a number of occasions when I quoted the late Cardinal Conway. He was asked at the time of the Sunningdale Agreement whether he believed that if the agreement brought about equality in Northern Ireland, it would mean that Catholics would become Unionists or that because Catholics were being treated on the basis of equality, they would be spurred on to a united Ireland. The cardinal replied that he was quite prepared to leave that matter to history. While we would like history to be much shorter, does the Taoiseach agree that is the way things should evolve and it is dangerous to make these predications, although this has probably <Col N="903" /> resulted in some quarters from the oversell of the Agreement in terms of bringing about a united Ireland in the short term?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would make three points. First, these issues should be allowed to take their passage in time. It is clearly set out in the Agreement how that will happen. Following the full implementation of the Agreement, people can reflect on whether there is support for a plebiscite. Second, to combine it with an election would create friction and tension. The Assembly elections will be the first since the Good Friday Agreement. There are enough difficulties, whatever the outcome of the election in 14 months. A new First Minister and Deputy First Minister will have to be appointed and it will have to be ensured the institutions work.</P>
      <P>Third, many issues have been addressed and are working well such as the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Human Rights Commission and the criminal justice review. These are all important issues but, quite frankly, it will take the better part of this decade, unless I am totally misreading the situation, for them to work through the system.</P>

When the Taoiseach gave President Bush his full support for the so-called war on terror, was the Taoiseach giving the President backing for the United States continuing to arm and support the Israeli Prime Minister and war criminal, Sharon, as he slaughters innocent men, women and children in the Palestinian homelands, laying waste their territory and destroying their homes all in the name of the war against terror? Did the Taoiseach raise the battering of the Palestinian people and the consequences of the slaughter of innocent Israelis?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciated the opportunity to have quite a long discussion last week with President Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell on the Middle East and I was able to spell out what we believe. While the situation is difficult, there are grounds for some hope. Our people at the UN were very much involved in drawing up last week's Security Council Resolution 1397, which represents a landmark because for the first time it speaks of a state of Palestine. From the meetings President Arafat has had with me and other Members of this House, I know this was something he was very anxious to achieve. As I have done on many occasions, last week I again raised the horrific events and the enormous pressure that has been put on the Palestinians by the Israelis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was assured that the US is now again fully engaged with this process after being out of it for a long time, which we did not support. Special <Col N="905" /> envoy General Anthony Zini is back working in the region and Vice President Chaney is also there. It may only be a glimmer, but there is some hope that the international community may be able to help. It was also discussed at length at the weekend and the EU is very anxious to help. Through our roles in the EU and particularly in the United Nations, we will do all we possibly can to help ease the tensions. A point I made both to the President last week and at the EU meeting is that tit for tat killings never work.</P>
    <P>It does not stop a deplorable situation. What happens is that the situation gets worse. John Hume said on many occasions that in the case of an eye for an eye everyone ends up blind. That is the difficulty in regard to what has been happening in the Middle East. The lack of engagement by the international community was part of that, but we should at least be grateful that last week's UN resolution was a forward step whereby, for the first time, every country supported the United States in a resolution of this nature.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach was in the United States he met the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board. I understand the flow of American investment through the IDA pipeline has been almost cut off this year.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The flow of American investment will be low everywhere this year. While we moved from $7 million or $8 million to $27 million or $28 million in a short period, we must now work very hard, as will every other country, to try to maintain this investment in the future. The view of the advisory board is that things will remain very difficult this year. Senior business people do not think there will be an enormous improvement in the first nine months of this year. They believe it will be into next year before companies and investors begin to move. There is a retraction of investment in the United States and there is a large amount of restructuring taking place. There are many chapter 11 companies. Many companies who are expanding are using the sales of goods from chapter 11 companies and liquidation proceedings to restock. Because of this, stocking levels are not going through the system. It is thought that this will flow through the system in the last quarter or into next year. While some sectors are already showing growth across the board they do not think this will happen in a substantive way this year. That certainly will not lead to great flows in inward investment.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if his Department will move immediately to avail of a free site being offered by a developer in respect of a new primary school (details supplied) in County Cork and thereby save the taxpayer approximately ?1 million.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9376/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing school site to which the Deputy refers is not owned by my Department but by the Cork diocesan authorities as trustees of the school. Consequently, the legal arrangements for the exchange or disposal of the lands in question are a matter for the diocesan authorities in the first instance.</P>
      <P>The board of management of the school in question informed my Department last year that the trustees of the school had arranged to provide a new, fully serviced, site by agreement with a local developer in return for the existing school site which, I am informed, is required to provide access to lands owned by the developer.</P>
      <P>On 23 November, 2001 my Department received formal notification in writing from the board of management that the developer was prepared, in addition to the land transfer, to construct a temporary school on the site. My Department's approval was sought for this proposal. Less than one week later, on 29 November, 2001, my Department wrote to the board of management conveying formal approval for the proposal. A letter was subsequently received from the board dated 24 January, 2002 indicating that the proposal had been withdrawn by the developer.</P>
      <P>I re-iterate that the approval for the land transfer conveyed to the board by my Department on 29 November 2001 still stands. It is a matter for the board, in consultation with the diocesan authorities who are the owners of the land, to act on this approval. No further sanctions are required from my Department to give effect to the transfer and my Department has no further function in the legal arrangements to complete the transfer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, and in order to facilitate the immediate transfer arrangements in advance of a new permanent school being provided, I am prepared to approve grant-aid for temporary accommodation to be constructed on the new site, subject to proper physical access and services to the site being provided by the developer. Meanwhile, architectural planning for a new permanent school is continuing and my Department is currently awaiting the submission of the initial designs from the school's design team. I assure <Col N="907" /> the Deputy that the permanent school project will proceed through the remaining stages of architectural planning and to tender under the Government's expanded building programme as quickly as possible. There will be no delay on my Department's part in giving the relevant approvals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being somewhat disingenuous by laying the blame at the door of the diocesan authorities. Will he agree that it is entirely unacceptable that a school campus currently straddles the N22 through Macroom. If the opportunity to develop the site is not availed of immediately and fast tracked through design, planning, tenders and contracts &ndash; the Department is incapable of doing so under the current structures &ndash; the developer will walk away and a two and a half acre site will have to be purchased by the State at a location which is not as convenient as the present location, perhaps on the outskirts of the town, at a cost of approximately &euro;1 million. Will the Minister agree this case is a classic example of how the Department is incapable of responding in a speedy fashion, in the best interests of taxpayers, and is proof that the building unit in the Department of Education and Science needs to be radically overhauled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the Deputy's comments on the Department's capability and capacity. It is clear particularly in this case that the Department acted very speedily and gave approval within one week of the offer coming in. The Deputy has the wrong end of the stick and is mistaken in regard to the whole position.</P>
      <P>I instructed a senior official in my Department to speak to the developer and establish the exact position. The developer has confirmed he is prepared to provide the site and make the other necessary provisions. I asked my official to make it clear that my Department would make the usual provision for temporary accommodation while the arrangements for the new school were progressing. The position is that the developer wants to proceed urgently. In order to do so the school must be removed urgently and temporary accommodation provided, otherwise planning permission and so on must be sought. After making an offer, the developer looked again at the situation and was not in a position to provide the temporary accommodation, which is what he conveyed. We said we would be prepared to provide the temporary accommodation if the developer carried out the other aspects in regard to the diocesan authorities. That is the current situation and I hope the matter will be resolved quickly. The problem was that the developer did not believe he could provide the temporary accommodation in addition to the other arrangements, including road access and so on which he was providing for the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the developer's interests are not just in the existing <Col N="908" /> school being demolished in order to gain access to his site but that he is concerned that the time lag which is normal in the Department between moving from design to tender to contracts is so long-term that it will jeopardise the viability of his development proposals for the entire site? For this reason, the case requires a hands-on approach from the Department, almost to the point of it being a pilot project, so it can be fast-tracked if the Department is capable of doing so. I can confirm that there is no problem with the diocesan authorities making the site available. The problem is whether the taxpayer can be saved the &euro;1 million which would be needed to find an alternative site were this opportunity passed on.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to take this case by the scruff of the neck and bring all parties together to ensure this site is developed as quickly as possible so that the best interests of education in Macroom can be advanced, that children who traverse a busy national primary road no longer have to face that danger, and that children in substandard and temporary classroom accommodation in pre-fabricated buildings are moved as quickly as possible to a new school which the parents, board of management, staff and the Minister's Department agree is necessary and for which a site is being made available for free if we move quickly.</P>

The matter does not concern the Department, rather the diocesan authorities. I instructed one of my officials to speak to the developer to determine the cause of the delay. There was no problem proceeding on his part once matters got going because, if we put in the temporary accommodation immediately, the old school could be knocked and he could get on with his business while everything else was proceeding. I also said approval would be given for each stage of the planning and construction of the new school as soon as it was ready to proceed. We cannot jump without planning permission&mdash;</P>

      <Quest>his views on recent reports that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul is frequently requested to provide financial assistance to families who need a psychological assessment for a child; whether this is acceptable; his further views on whether the current 2% limit imposed on schools for funding from his Department militates against schools in disadvantaged areas where a far higher percentage of students would have difficulties; and if he will take urgent action to remove this inequity.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention that a full educational psychological service should be made available to all children in schools, free of cost, as soon as is practically possible. A full educational psychological service to schools includes programmes of screening, early intervention and systemic work as well as an assessment service where appropriate.</P>
      <P>I recently announced the acceleration of recruitment to the National Educational Psychological Service agency &ndash; NEPS. The Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission is completing a recruitment competition on behalf of NEPS and a substantial number of appointments are to be made in the coming months. I hope the service will be made available to all schools within the next 12 months.</P>
      <P>As an interim measure pending this welcome development, I announced funding last June for the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments. This scheme is primarily available to those schools that do not yet have access to the NEPS service. To allow all eligible schools the opportunity to access the available funding and taking account of likely incidences of disability, the number of assessments per school has initially been determined by the number of pupils to a maximum of two per 100 pupils enrolled. However, NEPS is completing a review of the operation of the scheme. NEPS will then make recommendations to me on any adjustments that might be appropriate in future. My objective will be to ensure that adequate resources are made available in cases where assessment is appropriate.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there tends to be a higher incidence of children in disadvantaged areas who need access to extra educational supports. My Department has provided a range of schemes to meet their needs and children do not need to have been psychologically assessed to benefit under these schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a laughable reply. We have just come through a period of the strongest economic growth ever experienced in this country. <Col N="910" /> After five years in Government, is the Minister ashamed by the fact that many children from poor families are dependent on the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to gain access to basic psychological intervention? Is he, as the Minister who came to power less than three years ago talking about concern for disadvantage, even remotely embarrassed by the fact that we are now in the position where people from the most disadvantaged backgrounds must go begging for charity to access psychological services?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has done wonderful work over the years, especially in disadvantaged communities. I supported it in that work when I was Minister for Social Welfare and it continues to receive that support.</P>
      <P>I have taken two initiatives in the area referred to by the Deputy. One is that we were to have 200 psychologists by the end of 2004. The Government agreed to allow us proceed to that number by the end of this year. That advanced the programme. The other initiative is that we have increased the number of psychologists bringing the total to almost 100.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should let me finish. The Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission is reaching the final stages of the recruitment competition for the next phase. It is hoped that, subject to the necessary sanctions or clearances, it will be possible to appoint more than 60 psychologists from this competition which will mean 160 will be in place. It has been estimated for some time that, if 200 were employed, we could cover all needs. We are well on the road to that.</P>
      <P>The other fund which I obtained from the Government last September is being used by NEPS to meet deficits where they arise. I agree with the Deputy that, if special deficits still arise in disadvantaged areas, they should be able to avail of the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Minister mean by saying &ldquo;if there are deficits&rdquo;? Does he not know they exist? Did he hear the reports in the media about the role the St. Vincent de Paul has to play in disadvantaged communities? Is it not clear that, in disadvantaged schools, the demand for psychological assessments will be much greater than 2% of the schools' pupils?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not talking about when there will be a fully functioning psychological service. I want to know what will happen in the meantime where <Col N="911" /> the Minister has imposed a limit of 2% of all pupils in a school as the number of children who will have access to psychological assessments in the private sector. What on earth is his basis for limiting these to 2%? Is it not the case that, because the Minister is doing that and because the demand for psychological services is much greater than 2% in disadvantaged areas, the St. Vincent de Paul must step in to fill the gap he has left? Is the Minister prepared to do anything to give people their rights in terms of those children in disadvantaged areas and to remove the stigma of those people having to seek charity to gain basic psychological services?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>the long-term consequences for the education system arising from the protracted dispute between the ASTI and the Government; and the initiative he plans to attempt to resolve the dispute.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9377/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the protracted nature of the ASTI dispute. It arises from the ASTI's insistence that it should be treated differently from any other public service union, including the other teacher unions, and to have its 30% pay claim dealt with outside the terms of the programme for prosperity and fairness and independently of the public service benchmarking process. In these circumstances, the Deputy will appreciate, the Government cannot endanger the social partnership structure, which has contributed so significantly to our current prosperity, to deal exclusively with the wishes of one trade union. As the Deputy will appreciate, all teachers including ASTI members are already to receive a 22% increase in pay plus whatever may be awarded to teachers under the benchmarking process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an effort to find a solution to the ASTI's 30% pay claim the issues were referred in the first instance to the public service arbitration board. On the rejection of the findings of the arbitration <Col N="913" /> board by the ASTI the parties agreed to refer the matter to the Labour Court. Once again, the ASTI rejected the outcome. The essence of both recommendations was that the ASTI should pursue its further claim through the public service benchmarking body. The ASTI has steadfastly refused to engage in that process. The non-participation of the ASTI in the benchmarking process, while regretful, has not hampered the benchmarking body in carrying out a full examination of the role of the teaching profession. The report of the body will issue before by the end of June 2002.</P>
    <P>The current action by the ASTI in relation to supervision and substitution is part of its campaign to have its 30% pay claim addressed. The ASTI issued a directive to its members to withdraw from supervision and substitution with effect from 4 March 2002.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>The directive applies to supervision at break times and before and after school and to substitution by permanent teachers for absent colleagues. On Friday, 15 February the ASTI made a new set of demands in relation to supervision and substitution which were: a minimum annual rate of &euro;2,500, that it be pensionable and available to existing pensioners in compensation for having done this for free over a number of years and that it be within the 22 hours weekly maximum teaching time.</P>
    <P>I met the three teacher unions on 28 February 2002. I indicated that the Government is not opposed in principle to the pensionability of supervision payments. In that regard, I offered to enter into a process at the end of the current school year to work out the details of an arrangement which would be consistent with the requirements for pensionability. I also indicated that the procedures provided by the conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers should be used to deal with the issue of an appropriate payment rate for supervision. These procedures include independent arbitration where the parties cannot agree.</P>
    <P>My approach was welcomed by the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the Teachers Union of Ireland but rejected by the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland. The ASTI central executive indicated that it will not enter into any further negotiations on this matter pending the settlement of its pay claim. At a meeting of the teachers conciliation council on 12 March the TUI and INTO requested that further discussions take place on the issue of supervision and substitution. These discussions will commence shortly with the assistance of a facilitator. The ASTI confirmed that it is precluded from dealing with this matter by the decision of its executive committee.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shortall dealt with the legacy of the Minister in relation to disadvantaged children in primary schools and the psychological service in the previous question. Does the Mini<Col N="914" /> ster agree that his legacy in terms of secondary schools &ndash; in particular the voluntary sector as regards the ASTI dispute &ndash; is one of a total breakdown of relationships between the various educational partners: among teachers in staff rooms, between principals and teachers, between parents and teachers and between teachers and pupils? The likely legacy of his tenure is that teachers will make a clinical interpretation of their contractual duties and will not get involved in the voluntary activities many of them did in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the so-called contingency plan, copies of which we have not seen, which appears to just throw money at the problem, what does the Minister think this plan has achieved given that teachers will find the Department of Education and Science offers greater remuneration to unqualified outside parties coming into schools to carry out substitution duties than to substitute teachers? Why are substitute teachers being paid some &euro;8 per hour less? Has the Department determined the prospect of school closures yet to emerge from this dispute and what is the financial cost on a daily basis? Can the Minister confirm that it is approximately &euro;170,000 per day?</P>

If he is telling me that it is currently being examined, that is synonymous with what the Minister has been doing for the past three years, which is nothing. Projects like this one have been left in stalemate. Is the Minister aware that of the total enrolment of 127 in this rural national school, some 17 are Traveller children? An additional 11 children have special needs, yet the resource teacher has to teach in a converted shed. Hygiene and sanitary facilities are basic or worse. Is it the Minister's intention to continue to allow these children to be additionally disadvantaged due to his inaction while he uses jargon that is worn to a thread? The Department has not properly financed such projects throughout this country and particularly in County Galway.</P>

      <P>I met with the three teacher unions for that very reason &ndash; to show a way ahead. I received agreement that the Government was not opposed to, and would not oppose, the pensionability of the amounts. That key issue was raised again and again. Having done that, two of the unions decided to go along those lines and work with us. However, ASTI decided that in any event, even though we were doing that, its main requirement was to go back to the main underlying pay claim. Therefore, it decided it would not discuss any of those issues further with us. We are currently discussing both the rate and the pensionability with the INTO and the TUI. ASTI is very welcome to be there. The other unions would prefer it to be there and so would I, but its members say they will not attend unless basic pay is to be discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not here to defend the actions of the ASTI, far from it, but the dispute is bigger than the Minister, his Department or the ASTI and its leadership. Some signal of goodwill from the Minister as the leading figure in the education system should be sent to ASTI members on the issue of pensionability. I accept that the linkage they are trying to forge between two disparate issues is not sustainable, but some signal must be given to moderate ASTI members that this issue can be resolved. In the lead-in to the ASTI conference, will the Minister, in the interests of salvaging something from the secondary school system, give some signal that his Department is prepared to negotiate on the critical issue of payment levels and pensionability for supervision and substitution? </P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot do that. We have invited the ASTI repeatedly &ndash; and the other two <Col N="920" /> teacher unions have asked it &ndash; to come to the table to put its case on bench-marking which will complete the allocation. As already stated, there will be 22% under the PPF and a possible additional percentage under the benchmarking process. I am quite confident that such a percentage will be forthcoming under benchmarking. The leadership wants to pursue that line but when one of the committees is consulted it is usually the case that it decides not to proceed in this way. That has happened on many occasions.</P>
      <P>I accept the general thrust of the Deputy's argument and I want to find a way to resolve this matter. I would prefer if a solution could be found. Unfortunately, however, the benchmarking process is ongoing and we cannot undermine it.</P>
      <P>There are processes in place to consider the issue of pensionability and also the rates payable in respect of substitution and supervision. However, the ASTI will not engage with those processes. That is the difficulty we face, despite the fact that we made this goodwill gesture. If I can find another goodwill gesture that falls within the overall PPF agreement, I will do my best to put it in place.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the continuing decline in the number of applications for science subjects in the 2002 CAO figures; and the steps he is taking to address this problem.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>A declining interest in the sciences, particularly the physical sciences, at both second and third level is a phenomenon that is not <Col N="921" /> unique to Ireland. Indeed, it is common to most developed economies.</P>
      <P>When the interim application figures for 2002 from the Central Applications Office are compared with those for 2001, they reveal a decrease from 5,097 first preferences for science-applied science degree programmes in 2001 to 4,863 first preferences in 2002. This represents a 4.6% decrease. However, in diploma and certificate courses, the number of first preference applications for science-applied science courses increased from 3,697 in 2001 to 3,955 in 2002. This represents an increase of 7%.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the importance of these subjects in a modern educational system and I have undertaken a number of initiatives to address the declining interest in them. New leaving certificate syllabi in physics and in chemistry were introduced in September 2000 and will be examined for the first time next June. As well as the addition of new up-to-date content, these syllabi have an increased emphasis on student practical work and on the interface between science, technology and society. These changes are intended to highlight for pupils the relevance of these subjects to their everyday lives. A new leaving certificate syllabus in biology has been produced and has been circulated to schools. At junior certificate level, a course committee of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, recently produced a draft of a new science syllabus. This draft will now be circulated among the education partners for discussion. At the end of this process a final draft of the syllabus will be submitted to my Department.</P>
      <P>An extensive three year in-career development programme for teachers of physics and chemistry was established in September 1999 as part of a comprehensive physical sciences initiative. The in-career development programme includes the provision of extensive support materials for teachers. An in-career development programme for teachers of biology has been put in place in the current school year.</P>
      <P>Laboratory resources are an important element and these are currently being increased. New laboratories are being installed in schools, while old laboratories are also being upgraded.</P>
      <P>Just over a year ago I established a task force on the physical sciences. The brief of this task force is to identify the issues contributing to the falling uptake of the physical sciences at both second and third level and to recommend additional measures to address these issues. The last full meeting of the task force took place recently and its final report is due shortly.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that the most significant figure here is the decline, by something of the order of 5,000, in the number of CAO applicants who are listing any of the science subjects as one of their preferences? This will obviously have serious repercussions for the future of the sciences at third level. It will also have an impact in respect of the number of quali<Col N="922" /> fied science teachers. In many ways, this is a vicious circle. What specific action is the Minister taking to promote the study of science at third level? What is he doing to encourage second level students to give positive consideration to a career, whether teaching or otherwise, in science?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined the position in relation to these matters in my original reply. It is important to recognise that there has been a 7% increase in the number of people taking diploma courses. We must be careful when considering the overall position. In 2000, a total of 63,500 students took the leaving certificate. This figure has decreased to 59,500 for the current year, which means that the number of CAO applications will be down in any event. I am not using this as an excuse, I am merely outlining the factual position.</P>
      <P>There is also a trend towards encouraging people to pursue technician courses and diploma courses, which is a good development. The new syllabi are designed to make it somewhat easier to be involved in the study of science. There is a problem with the sciences in that people regard them as difficult subjects. In recent years, it has been more convenient to pursue jobs in other areas. The syllabi have been reconsidered and new models are now coming into operation. I hope that this will prove helpful. As soon as the report of the task force is presented, I will make it available to Members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the figures relevant to this year's CAO applications are merely a continuation of a trend which, unfortunately, has been moving in the wrong direction for a number of years and that it is clear that the initiatives he outlined are not having the desired impact? Does he also accept that, if this trend is allowed to continue, our future economic prospects will be under threat? What plans does the Minister have to immediately introduce practical examinations in science subjects at junior and leaving certificate level? Everyone from the teachers' unions to the Minister to IBEC to Enterprise Ireland is expressing concern and the time has come to take action. One of the things which could be done is to introduce practical examinations as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I launched the new leaving certificate syllabi in physics and chemistry in September 2000 and these were widely welcomed. These will be subject of examination for the first time this year. When changes are made, a timeframe of implementation must be put in place and the impact will not be felt for a number of years. That is all the more reason for getting matters in train as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At junior certificate level, a course committee of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment recently produced a draft of a new science syllabus. I expect to receive this in the <Col N="923" /> near future and I will put it in place at junior certificate level.</P>
    <P>As already stated, the trend in this area is European-wide. Every country in Europe is experiencing similar difficulties. However, I accept that we must solve it for ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently authorised the authorities of Scoil Chiaráin, St. Canice's Road, Glasnevin, to invite tenders for the refurbishment of the school. As soon as the tenders have been received and assessed, my Department will be in contact with the board of management regarding the placing of a contract for the works in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>That sounds fine, but experience shows that these things do not happen automatically and that each stage is painfully slow. Approval for proceeding to the next stage does not mean that a school will be allowed move to a further stage. The request from Scoil Chiaráin has been with the Department for a considerable period and the school building is in extremely poor condition. When does the Minister expect to give final approval for this much needed building to go ahead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This major project has reached a very important stage. I have seen the school and it certainly requires urgent attention. On 28 February, I wrote to the school authorities informing them they could go ahead with the tender, having regard to the nature of the situation. The matter can proceed as soon as the tenders are received and assessed. There will be no delay in that regard.</P>

      <P>Without any delay. Part of the problem is that, in letting it go to tender, one is virtually automatically getting into a certain cycle which can involve delay. I am not saying there has not been delay in the past but there can be a limited delay at that stage. I am aware of the needs of the school in question, it is a rather disastrous situation and I accept that the tender should go ahead without any delay.</P>

      <P>In the current year the Government, for the fifth consecutive year, has substantially increased the level of funding available for investment in primary and second level educational infrastructure.

      <P>&mdash;begun by this Government and which, as the Taoiseach recently indicated, will be continued, has resulted in a record level of activity. Currently, there are over 80 major primary school projects either in construction or at tender stage. This compares with a total of only 30 in 1997. At second level there are 125 major projects incurring liabilities this year, plus five public private partnerships, compared with only 12 in 1997. Architectural planning is continuing on a further very broad range of both primary and second level projects. These projects will also proceed to tender and construction as part of the Government's expanded schools building programme.</P>

Does the Taoiseach intend at any stage, today or tomorrow, to indicate what is the way forward now that the people have rejected the Government's abortion referendum proposals? While the Taoiseach may ignore it at the Ard-Fheis, it is a proposal that emanated from this House and there are consequences arising from it.</P>

It will certainly not be done before the end of the Government's term in office, so it will be have to be dealt with by the next government.</P>

      <P>About ten days ago the Taoiseach appointed the Attorney General to investigate how an &euro;8 shelf company got the management contract for the aquatic centre at Abbotstown. The Taoiseach promised to report back to the House. It seems the Attorney General went to Los Angeles to celebrate St. Patrick's Day and conducted his inquiry by correspondence. At today's Cabinet meeting the ball was kicked into <Col N="933" /> touch and the Taoiseach and the Cabinet looked for further time. What is going on? Why is the Taoiseach not in a position to explain to the House what happened? How did an &euro;8 shelf company get the management contract for this project? Why is it costing so much? Why is no explanation given to the Irish people, whose money is being used to build this project? When does the Taoiseach think he might be in a position to inform the House on what is going on?</P>

What were the terms of reference of the inquiry undertaken by the Attorney General into the selection of a dormant shelf company to run the national aquatic centre at Abbotstown and will the Taoiseach make a statement on the matter? Has the Taoiseach yet received the results of the inquiry being undertaken by the Attorney General into the selection of a dormant shelf company to run the national aquatic centre at Abbotstown? Will he outline the main findings of the report, indicate if it is intended to lay the report before the Dáil and make a statement on the matter? Finally, what was the date in 2000 on which the Taoiseach brought the memorandum to Cabinet relating to the national aquatic centre at Abbotstown? Was he aware, when he brought the memorandum to Cabinet, that consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers had raised queries regarding the status of the company which had been awarded the contract and will he make a statement on the matter?</P>
      <P>For the Chair's information, my questions are the questions that were ruled out of order earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We asked the Attorney General last Sunday week to arrange with the Minister, Deputy McDaid, and his Department to report to the next Cabinet meeting on issues arising from the award of the contract for the aquatic and leisure centre at Abbotstown. While the Attorney General was away his officials worked on this report and, following his return, he spent all day yesterday working on it. He had been kept informed in the meantime. Today, he provided a draft report prepared by him and his officials on the legal issues surrounding the award of the contract and all the aspects therein. This report was prepared at the request of the Tánaiste, the Minister, Deputy McDaid, and myself. In a little over a week the Attorney General's office produced a substantial report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft report is being considered by Ministers as quickly as possible. The Government decided that persons, in respect of whom substantial issues were raised by the Attorney General's draft report, should be given an opportunity to make their observations on the report. That will be done today. In addition, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation will tonight meet <Col N="934" /> members of the board of Campus Stadium Ireland. He will inform them that the Government has agreed in principle to the recommendations that the roles of chairman and chief executive should be separated and that a full time chief executive and finance director should be appointed. The Attorney General will finalise the report in light of the observations received from the Minister, Deputy McDaid. This, together with a further report from the Minister, will be considered by the Government at its meeting next week or earlier, if that is possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that when the dormant shelf company was selected to be the management group for the aquatic centre the Taoiseach's Department forwarded a memorandum to Cabinet and the Cabinet agreed to the appointment of this company. Under normal circumstances, that memorandum would have gone to relevant Departments and, certainly in respect of a legal contract, it would have gone to the Office of the Attorney General. Is it not a fact that the Attorney General, whom the Taoiseach asked to inquire into this matter, had already signed off on the contract at the point when the memorandum went to Government? Is it not also a fact that no real inquiry has taken place, in the accepted sense of the word &ldquo;inquiry&ldquo;? No inquiry was conducted by the Attorney General. He met none of the participants and asked no question of any participant. He simply made inquiries by letter.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, after giving a commitment to let the full light of day shine on this matter, is still hedging and dodging the issue. Why can he not answer the questions today? It is ten days since we last raised the matter and the Taoiseach is still seeking more time and saying things will happen tonight. He also took the unusual step, as Deputy Quinn pointed out, of transferring responsibility, which he clearly had when he brought the memorandum to Government, from his Department to the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation so he could avoid answering questions in the House. This does not sound or look good. It is about time we had an explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan will agree that this matter has always been dealt with efficiently. The Minister, Deputy McDaid, has constantly reported to the House, as I did when it was in my remit to do so. It is not correct to state that the contract was signed when the memorandum was brought to Government. The contract was not signed until some months ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year, 19,828 people were made redundant, the highest figure since 1993. This year, the number of people who, since the beginning of March, have lost their jobs or who have been told their jobs will be lost are as follows: 375 at IGB/Ardagh, Ringsend; 300 at Flextronics in Tullamore; 260 at Youghal Carpets; 160 at EMC in Ovens; 95 at BD Medical Systems in Drogheda; 160 at Boston Scientific, Galway; 190 at SMTC Electronics in Cork and 364 in Wexford Electronics. The Tánaiste met recently with SIPTU and with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to discuss the possibility of reforming and improving the 1967 redundancy legislation by increasing the entitlement, in terms of redundancy payments, from half a week's salary for a year served to the recommended figure of three weeks per year served and to remove the age discrimination of 41 years of age.</P>
      <P>I raised this question previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder that there is a surplus of &euro;1.2 billion in the Social Insurance Fund, notwithstanding the raid for &euro;635 million by the Minister for Finance. I would remind the House that employers and employees pay into this fund outside the normal tax revenue measures of the Exchequer. Given these figures and the fact that the trend is accelerating rather than decreasing, will the Taoiseach give an undertaking to bring in emergency legislation next week to improve the terms and conditions of the redundancy payments, on the basis of the Bill prepared by the Labour Party and submitted to the Bills Office? This could be afforded without imposing a single extra charge on the Exchequer or on the taxpayer. Will he do so, given the plight of workers whose insurance fund <Col N="936" /> is being denied to them except at the measly rate of a half a week per year served?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach realise that 125 jobs a day have been lost since 1 January last? Does he realise this is due to a deteriorating competitive position in industry across a number of sectors? Has he discussed this with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment? Does the Government in its dying days intend taking any fire brigade action to improve the competitive position, particularly across traditional industry where jobs will continue to be lost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts put forward by Deputy Quinn about the job losses are correct but, as I stated on the last Order of Business, there are about 1,000 jobs a week still being created in this economy as there are almost 1,000 work permits a week being sought. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is conducting a review with the social partners and has made it clear that we intend to improve the arrangements. We have done something already on the tax side in the Finance Bill, and we will address some of the issues which the social partners have raised. The Tánaiste has answered this. There is a commitment to deal with this issue. I will not introduce legislation next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree with the sentiments expressed this morning by Mr. Joe O'Flynn, the regional secretary for SIPTU, on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, that many of the workers, who sadly have been notified that their jobs are now gone, having left school before the leaving certificate, have not had the opportunity of training or education to avail of the high-tech jobs which, fortunately, are still coming into this economy? Would he further agree with me that the very purpose of a social insurance fund with redundancy payments is to provide a cushion to enable workers to maintain a standard of living while they have the opportunity to look for new jobs or perhaps to seek retraining under the euphemism of life-long learning? If he agrees with that, because it is the frequently articulated policy of Ministers, why can he not agree to take a Bill which has already been drafted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give him a graphic example of a situation in which none of us would like to be. There were 364 jobs lost in Wexford. A person who worked for 16 years in that plant and who is under the age of 41 will receive the princely sum of &euro;2,500 under existing legislation. If our Bill was accepted by the Taoiseach, we could take all Stages in a half an hour because there would be no disagreement in this House and that worker, who has paid into that fund over 16 years, could receive a sum of &euro;15,000. Why will the Taoiseach not do that? What is stopping him? The money is there. They have paid for it. This House will give him the time to enact the legislation. I do not see <Col N="937" /> the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, around. What is holding him back?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I, and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment have already said there are sections of workers who do not get more than statutory redundancy. Deputy Quinn is well aware that the level of redundancy some workers get is far greater, but that is not the point. We are in discussions with the social partners on that. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has made that absolutely clear. It is an issue to be dealt with and we will deal with it, but it is not a question of ignoring the recommendations of SIPTU and the social partners who have been putting forward this case.</P>

      <P>I attended the European Council on 15 March and 16 March 2002 in Barcelona. I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. The conclusions of the meeting have been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. The meeting was a successful one in that it built on the work of the past two years in ensuring that progress was being made on the European Union's ambitious ten year Lisbon agenda.</P>
      <P>The meeting was also significant from Ireland's point of view in that the European Council welcomed the approach of the Government to the ratification of the Treaty of Nice and reiterated its willingness to contribute in every possible way to supporting the Irish Government in this process. The European Council will come back to this issue at the Seville European Council meeting in June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of our meeting in Barcelona was to examine if the European Union is on track to become, by 2010, the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. This goal, as embodied in the Lisbon agenda, was set two <Col N="945" /> years ago at the European Council meeting in Lisbon. Last year in Stockholm we added a sustainable development pillar to our agenda. The Lisbon agenda rests therefore on three pillars: economic, social and environmental. At Lisbon, European leaders decided to meet every year in the spring to review progress and make any adjustments necessary to reach our ambitious targets. We are now one fifth of the way towards our 2010 target date. By the time Ireland holds the Presidency in 2004, we will be nearly at the half-way mark. In Barcelona, we had a good discussion on the many and varied issues currently on the Lisbon agenda. We took stock of what had been achieved. We set a number of ambitious targets. All of us were aware of the need to take the decisions necessary to ensure increased competitiveness, greater social cohesion and for these to be done in an environmentally sustainable way.</P>
    <P>Last Christmas, in advance of Barcelona, the Government gave detailed consideration to the five priorities identified by the Spanish Presidency for the Barcelona Council, and the relevance of these issues to Ireland. In further considering Ireland's contribution to the Barcelona Council, I issued a joint letter to Prime Minister Aznar, with Prime Minister Persson of Sweden, seeking continued action throughout Europe to facilitate the growth and development of small and medium enterprises. Prime Minister Persson and I recognise that the creation of new jobs will largely depend on the development and enhancement of small and medium sized enterprises, and we sought progress in four key areas to assist SMEs: research and development, regulatory reform, entrepreneurship and biotechnology. I also wrote separately to Prime Minister Aznar, outlining Ireland's priority areas for Barcelona, including regulatory reform, research and development, greater labour force participation, social cohesion, and inclusive life-long learning. Both the joint letter with Prime Minister Persson and my letter to Prime Minister Aznar have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Barcelona marked the beginning of what I hope will be a long and productive relationship between the European Council and the President of the European Parliament. Pat Cox was very warmly received by the members of the European Council and the conclusions specifically welcomed the president's initiative for political dialogue and pragmatic change. The willingness of the European Parliament to enter into partnership with the Council will make achieving our 2010 goals that much easier. It means that the building blocks needed to reach our targets are being put in place.</P>
    <P>I should underline that the Lisbon agenda is not about making dramatic breakthroughs at European Council meetings. The goals we have set will not be reached overnight. The Lisbon agenda is, nonetheless, the framework within which we in Ireland and European Union citizens everywhere will achieve our future prosperity, well-being and quality of life. These are the bread <Col N="946" /> and butter issues of the European Union. They have direct implications for every citizen and every community here in Ireland and throughout Europe. Getting it right means that Europe will prosper and we will prosper in it. Since we agreed the Lisbon agenda two years ago, five million new jobs have been created in the EU. Many of the measures we agreed to take at Lisbon have been implemented or are in the process of being implemented. We successfully launched the euro notes and coins at the beginning of this year marking the culmination of more than ten years of work within the EU. However, our spring meeting this year took place at a time when the world economy has been experiencing a downturn, exacerbated by the events of 11 September and their aftermath. With signs of a recovery in sight, European leaders renewed their commitment to economic reform to increase the potential of the EU for growth and employment.</P>
    <P>Europe is going through its own very profound changes. It is expected that the accession negotiations will successfully conclude at the end of this year and that ten new members will join the Union in 2004. It is essential that these new members be fully prepared for the Lisbon agenda. To ensure that this is the case, the leaders of the accession countries attended a meeting with the heads of state or Government in Barcelona. They described their very considerable efforts to give effect to the Lisbon agenda.</P>
    <P>The Barcelona European Council was important for people engaged in small business, the backbone of our economic activity. In line with the approach adopted by Ireland, we underlined the fact that entrepreneurship and a well functioning internal market were the keys to growth and job creation. We made the point that the regulatory environment should encourage entrepreneurial activity and make it as simple as possible to set up new business, in particular through the use of the Internet. The forthcoming Commission action plan will give renewed impetus to the regulatory reform agenda at EU level.</P>
    <P>Over the two days of the Council, we agreed a wide range of measures. While the measures are too numerous to detail here, I feel a number merit particular mention. We asked member states to speed up the implementation of the European charter for small and medium sized enterprises. This will make it easier for small businesses to do business in Europe by cutting Europe's red tape. We also agreed that full implementation of all internal market legislation was a prerequisite for the proper functioning of the internal market. We agreed to make further efforts to meet a 100% transposition target by the spring European Council in 2003. This will represent a challenge for many member states, including Ireland. However, it is a challenge that is in all our interests to meet. Efforts by all member states in this area must be stepped up.</P>
    <P>On the social agenda, the European Council reiterated that the European social model is <Col N="947" /> based on good economic performance, a high level of social protection and education and social dialogue. We underlined that the Lisbon agenda goals can be brought about only by balanced efforts on both the economic and social fronts.</P>
    <P>The European Council stressed the importance of the fight against poverty and social exclusion. Member states were invited to set targets in their national action plans for significantly reducing the number of people at risk of poverty and social exclusion by 2010. We agreed that the reform of pension systems should be accelerated and we mandated the Council to examine more thoroughly issues of health care and care for the elderly for next year's spring Council meeting. To encourage the creation of better jobs and more opportunity, we agreed to a reinforced employment strategy and promoting skills and mobility in the European Union. To underline this, we decided that a European health insurance card will replace the current paper forms. The Commission will make a proposal on this before our next spring European Council under the Greek Presidency in 2003. We decided that there should be a one-stop European mobility information website which will be operational by the end of 2003.</P>
    <P>For consumers and investors, we gave impetus to the measures in the financial services action plan, setting a target of adopting seven directives this year. Action on these issues is important to give increased choice and lower prices. We agreed that there should be appropriate levels of protection for consumers of financial services. Also of benefit to consumers are the target dates that we set for opening the markets in electricity and gas. Perhaps the one area that received most publicity before the Barcelona European Council was the question of whether a target date could be set to open the gas and electricity sectors. We succeeded in agreeing 2004 as the date for freedom of choice of supplier for all European non-household consumers. We also agreed that before the 2003 spring European Council we would take decisions on further measures taking into account the definition of public service obligations, security of supply and in particular the protection of remote areas. This was a significant development. However, more needs to be done in this area.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the greatest challenge facing Europe is the creation of a true knowledge society. The Council marked real progress in this field. In particular, we called for the Commission's e-Europe 2005 action plan to concentrate also on network security and information, e-government, e-learning, e-health and e-business. This issue will come to the Seville European Council this coming June. We called for the sixth research framework programme to be adopted by June 2002. We also agreed that overall spending on research and development and innovation in the European Union should be increased with the aim of approaching 3% of GDP by 2010. Two thirds of this new investment should come from the private <Col N="948" /> sector. This will represent a challenge for a number of member states, including Ireland, where research and development spending by the State has increased dramatically but where there is much more room for private sector spending. In the research and development area, we also underlined the importance of enabling Community business to exploit the potential of biotechnology while taking due account of the precautionary principle and meeting ethical and social concerns. This is another issue we will address at our meeting next year.</P>
    <P>The working methods used by the European Council in this area were perhaps the most important facet of the Lisbon agenda addressed at the European Council. In Barcelona, we agreed that the focus of the European Council must be to give key political impetus to the actions crucial to the European Union's long-term objectives. As a result, we agreed that the calendars for the adoption of the broad economic policy guidelines and of the annual employment package should be synchronised. In this way, the European Council will be able to review and, where necessary, adjust the Union's economic, social and environmental policies as a whole.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will see, and as I signalled at the start of this statement, the Barcelona European Council conclusions reflect the fact that I outlined to the members of the European Council the Government's approach to the ratification of the Nice treaty, due to be completed by all member states by the end of this year in order to allow enlargement to proceed as planned. I informed our European partners that the Government remained fully committed to enlargement and to the ratification of Nice by the end of the year. I said that there was a general recognition and expectation that a second referendum would be held in the autumn. In the context of whether there was any assistance the European Council could offer, arising from the assurances we received at the Gothenburg European Council last June, I signalled that the Government would be seeking a declaration from the Seville European Council confirming that Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality was not affected by the treaties. As the conclusions show, the European Council welcomed my approach and reiterated its willingness to contribute in every possible way to supporting us. We will come back to this issue in June in Seville.</P>
    <P>While the Minister for Foreign Affairs will address the foreign policy aspects of the Barcelona European Council, I will mention just two issues on the international agenda. First, the Barcelona European Council welcomed the agreement on overseas development assistance, ODA, increases in time for the Monterrey conference on financing for development which is now ongoing. This agreement underlines the European Union's position as the world's major provider for development aid. Of course, we remain committed nationally to the UN target of 0.7% of GNP to ODA by 2007. In addition, we agreed <Col N="949" /> that the Economic and Finance Council will examine other means of debt relief for the least developed countries. Second, we adopted a declaration on the Middle East &ndash; the Barcelona Declaration. The declaration underlined the fact that the Middle East is in the grip of an extremely grave crisis. We called on both sides to take immediate and effective action to stop the bloodshed. We reiterated that there was no military solution to this conflict and that peace and security could only be achieved through negotiations.</P>
    <P>I also had an opportunity to have some brief exchanges with Prime Minister Blair on a range of Northern Ireland issues.</P>
    <P>We made significant progress in Barcelona but we acknowledge that more needs to be done. The Lisbon agenda, and indeed the European Union, touches each citizen of every member state in a real and material way. The positive outcome of the Barcelona Council is a clear demonstration that Europe works for all of its citizens. I believe it is further proof that Ireland's place is within the EU, as an active, contributing, involved member state, actively pushing those policies that are critical to the further social and economic development of both the EU and Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. The outcome of last week's EU summit in Barcelona presents a number of challenges to the next Government. First, having agreed in principle to a declaration respecting Irish military neutrality, our EU partners will be anxious to see that the other steps needed to secure the ratification of the Treaty of Nice are put in place. Second, the 15 heads of government have agreed to accelerate the liberalisation of the energy and gas markets, with the objective of creating the most competitive economy in the world by 2010.</P>
      <P>An examination of the Government's performance in respect of both of these issues makes it very hard to have confidence in its ability to deliver on either of them. Last week we witnessed a graphic example of the Taoiseach's well practised line in double speak. On Tuesday he was in Washington offering unconditional support for President Bush's so-called war on terror at a time it was clear the US campaign was to be widened beyond that mandated by the United Nations. Only three days later, on Friday, the Taoiseach was in Barcelona pleading with the heads of government of the other EU member states for a solemn declaration respecting Ireland's military neutrality.</P>
      <P>Against this background, is it any wonder many people were confused and sceptical about the Government's position on neutrality during the Nice referendum campaign, particularly given that the Taoiseach promised a referendum on this issue during the last general election campaign and reneged on the promise when he entered Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me make my position and that of my party perfectly clear. We support the concept of a <Col N="950" /> Council declaration that would respect the Irish position and confirm that nothing in the Nice treaty imposes a military or defence obligation on any member state. Such a declaration was among a number of measures aimed at securing the enlargement process proposed by Fine Gael last October in our consultation document on Ireland's future in the EU. The Nice treaty does not include provisions relating to defence policy but we must acknowledge the genuine fears of those who voted against the treaty because they believed that it might.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach made a mistake in not revealing his intention to seek this declaration in advance of the Barcelona Summit. It is this type of secretive approach that leads more people to feel alienated from the decision making process of the EU. He has yet to spell out what he would like to have included in such a declaration with the result that the people are not in a position to assess its likely contents. If I am elected Taoiseach, I undertake to debate the contents of the declaration in advance of the Seville Summit in June, at which it is expected to be endorsed by the heads of government.</P>
    <P>A second mistake made by the Taoiseach was his failure to map out a comprehensive plan for the ratification of the Nice treaty. The securing of a Council declaration on its own will not be sufficient. Fine Gael believes the declaration must be accompanied by a series of other initiatives. Fine Gael believes there is a need to immediately re-examine Ireland's security and defence policy. Fine Gael's policy on international terrorism and human rights violations is clear. Ireland is not and cannot be neutral in the conflict against international terrorism or in the struggle against ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of human rights.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael favours open Irish involvement in discussions on peace and security at EU level and our possible involvement in future peacekeeping and peacemaking missions. In this way we have an opportunity to influence our partners in the EU and to decide on a case by case basis for ourselves whether the EU should participate in certain missions. A decision to involve Irish forces must always be taken on its individual merits by the Dáil and the Government.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael rejects membership for Ireland of international alliances such as NATO because of the mutual defence obligations of such bodies. Just as Fine Gael will not enter an alliance that would oblige it to participate through mutual defence obligations, we will also not allow the veto of one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council to prevent Ireland from participating in missions if we believe they are appropriate, necessary and in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter. The terrorist attacks on the US on 11 September were an attack on democracy which may be followed by further terrorist attacks on democracies in Europe. It is timely that our position on neutrality should be re-examined. Fine Gael believes <Col N="951" /> a comprehensive White Paper should be produced, addressing Ireland's military neutrality in the new Europe and in an uncertain world.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Council declaration, the Government should make it clear that participation by Ireland's Defence Forces in future missions under the European flag as part of the rapid reaction force, will be subject to the exclusive consent of the House and the Government. Furthermore, Oireachtas legislation on Ireland's participation must be adopted, specifying the conditions for future participation by the Defence Forces in missions under the European flag.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs must be given new powers akin to those enjoyed by the Committee of Public Accounts, which will enable it to examine, track and report on all policy and legislative proposals made by the European Commission from initiation to adoption. The committee should also be empowered to monitor the conciliation process between the European Council and European Parliament. Furthermore, legislation should be introduced to require all future Government nominees to European institutions to be vetted and approved by the committee. The institutions concerned will include the European Commission, European Court of Auditors and European Investment Bank. Reports from the committee should be regularly debated in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Seanad should be specifically empowered to invite the attendance of members and representatives of the European Commission and the Council Presidency to report on legislative proposals and policies at European level. A procedure must also be introduced to enable Irish members of the European Parliament and members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs to attend Seanad debates and hearings on European matters.</P>
    <P>A Minister of State for European Affairs attached to both the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs with the power to attend Cabinet meetings should be appointed. This Minister would have responsibility for the co-ordination of Government and departmental policy in the area of European affairs. The comprehensive approach I have outlined would serve to create better public understanding of the implications of the Nice treaty and create the climate in which its ratification in a second referendum can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I will turn briefly to the other issue of significance arising from the Barcelona Summit, the liberalisation of electricity and gas markets. By any yardstick, the Government's performance in this area has been abysmal. With regard to the electricity sector the Government's inaction has incurred the wrath of both the European Commission and the OECD which carried out a major study of deregulation in Ireland last year. So bad has been the pace and structure of this deregulation that potential new market entrants are voting with their feet. In recent months several large <Col N="952" /> investors, including BP, Scottish Power, ePower and ATCO Power have all scrapped their plans to invest in the energy market.</P>
    <P>I issue the following warning to the Government: &ldquo;get your act together on energy liberalisation or this country will fall even lower down the competitiveness league and the electricity shortages predicted by the Institution of Engineers and others may become a reality&rdquo;. The outcome of the Barcelona Summit presents real challenges for the incoming Government. I look forward to meeting these challenges head-on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is that the Government is sleepwalking the country towards another referendum defeat. A completely<i> ad hoc</i> approach has been taken in the conduct of foreign and European policy over the past week or two. It all depends on who is speaking on behalf of Ireland at a particular time, to whom he or she is speaking and where he or she is speaking. The leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Noonan, mentioned the typical example of the Taoiseach meeting President Bush in Washington last week. At this stage I am not sure whether Ireland is a member of the coalition targeting Iraq. However, President Bush is clearly satisfied that we are part of that coalition and he can be satisfied only as a consequence of what the Taoiseach said to him.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, the Government believes any difficulties between the US and the countries cited by President Bush should be resolved by dialogue. This was the answer I got from the Minister, Deputy Cowen, when I asked the views of the Government on the axis of evil foreign policy approach of President Bush. What the Minister said appears to directly contradict what was said to President Bush in Washington. To confuse matters further, the Taoiseach avoided &ndash; or should I say evaded &ndash; answering the question as to whether the support committed was in relation to action sanctioned by the United Nations. This is no way to conduct foreign policy on behalf of the sovereign nation currently represented by the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach's attitude to President Bush seemed to be along the lines of saying, &ldquo;Begorra, whatever you are having yourself, sir, you can have it&rdquo;. That seemed to be the paddywhackery approach adopted by the Taoiseach during his St. Patrick's Day visit to Washington.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that the same <i>ad hoc</i> approach arises in relation to Europe. I am not sure which wing of the Government the Taoiseach was representing in Barcelona, but it is clear the Government still has no road map or agreed game plan as to how to deal with the referendum failure in relation to the Nice treaty. The Government has largely abdicated its responsibility to the Government we will have after the general election. I do not intend to re-enter the debate on the forum on Europe. When its chairman, Senator Hayes, came with members of the forum to the Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs, I complimented <Col N="953" /> him on his distinguished role in Parliament and elsewhere. However, when he produced his interim report it was clear the forum did not have terms of reference to enable it to deal with the treaty of Nice. Consequently the chairman's interim report could deal only with the broad discussion of issues relevant to Ireland's membership of an enlarging Union. It is as if we were living in a different world.</P>
    <P>Following failure of the Nice treaty referendum, we will impede or delay enlargement of the Union if we do not clear up the matter before the end of the year. This year we will have a general election, the time to form a new Government and the summer recess. The window of opportunity is closing. I am genuinely concerned over the actions, or should I say the lack of actions, on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>The spin doctors &ndash; I do not know how many of the 75 of them were involved &ndash; trumpeted what they suggested was a major victory for the Taoiseach at Barcelona because of a positive reaction in principle to the idea of an EU declaration. Let us get real. For the past six months European ministers and ambassadors have been telling us two things. There is no possibility of a change in the terms of the treaty of Nice and there is no difficulty about securing a declaration from the European Council. That has been obvious for so long that it is a fact of political life at this stage. The really interesting issues go beyond that. I presume the Taoiseach did not ask whether there is a way of going beyond a declaration.</P>
    <P>Some people talk about a protocol, but that is not realistic at this stage. Is there a possibility of a Danish type solution, an EU agreement with a commitment to a protocol in the next treaty? Was that explored and if not why not? The Taoiseach raised the issue of the EU declaration without warning. What is supposed to be in the declaration? Where is the draft declaration? Who will prepare it? Will it be subject to political scrutiny? For instance, has it ever been brought before the European affairs committee? We talk about the democratic deficit. We already have at least some organs of the Oireachtas in place to deal with issues. Why did the Taoiseach or his Minister for Foreign Affairs not come before the European affairs committee prior to the Barcelona meeting to discuss the idea and produce a draft of what was proposed. Was there even a debate at the famous forum about the declaration? Of course there was not. That is symptomatic of a Government that continues to carry on in the same old way and is devoid of any ideas beyond that of the declaration, which is commonly accepted to be nearly <i>passé</i> at this stage.</P>
    <P>Where is the domestic action that is within the competence &ndash; I should not use the word competence in relation to this Government &ndash; within the power of the Government to underpin an EU declaration? Last October, I proposed a range of measures. Where is the Bill to amend the Defence Act, specifying the conditions of any <Col N="954" /> future participation by the Defence Forces in missions under the European flag. These are the kinds of issues that came up in the referendum. Why have we not had a Bill? Where is the White Paper on neutrality? I have made it absolutely clear that the Nice treaty does not affect our neutrality, but there is a perception that it does. I want to see it off the table and one way to do this is to follow the lines I have been suggesting. Nothing of that kind has been done by the Government. I strongly recommended having a Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs and I suppose in the dying days of the Government it is a bit late, but is there even a commitment on the part of the Taoiseach, in the unlikely event of him being returned to power, to have such an office?</P>
    <P>I mentioned the democratic deficit. Where are the additional powers for Oireachtas committees? There has been talk, but nothing has happened. We do not have the additional powers, resources or finances. Talk without resources and commitment will not solve the democratic deficit problem. These approaches in relation to Oireachtas committees should be operational by now. I am concerned that we will go sleep walking back into the next referendum without having done that. Items within our power should have been done by now, so that we can demonstrate to the people that we have listened to the legitimate concerns they raised at the time of the referendum and have done something about them. I am frustrated that the Government has done nothing.</P>
    <P>Is it correct that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has refused the resources to fund additional powers for Oireachtas committees, either the Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs or the involvement of committees representing frontline Departments? If that is so, it is a crushing indictment of the Government. If we do not get this right this year, the country will face its greatest international crisis ever. Of all the issues that need support, resources and finances &ndash; not a huge amount &ndash; this is the one.</P>
    <P>At this stage we have a Government of no cohesion with different views, including euro-sceptics who openly expressed their views after the failed referendum without demur from the Taoiseach. We have a Government without leadership and that helpless approach to European affairs puts us in dire danger. My real worry is that when Fine Gael participates in the next Government the window of opportunity will have closed. It is eight months since the failed referendum and what have we to show for it? We have very little and that is a huge indictment of the Government. I know it will be up to Fine Gael to pick up the pieces in Government after the general election and to provide strong leadership for Ireland in Europe and that is a commitment our leader Deputy Noonan will give to this House.</P>

      <P>It is fair to say that in general most commentators regarded the Barcelona Council as satisfactory. Given that the centre right coalition <Col N="955" /> on economic liberalisation and other issues did not carry the day, the thrust of balance set out in the Lisbon agenda has, by and large, been maintained. In so far as the Taoiseach contributed to that outcome, I welcome it. I simply do not know how much he contributed but clearly it has emerged.</P>
      <P>I want to pick up on the two themes on which the two previous speakers concentrated. I presume the Taoiseach will reply in the absence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is that the case?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The dialogue we are now having is not unlike the dialogue the country is having with the Government. I am seeking responses to questions to a person who is not here. Perhaps we would have been more productive if we had faxed each other our various comments. It is a sad reflection, Taoiseach, even though I say this more in sadness than in anger. Nevertheless, someone will pick up on the points I am making. No doubt the officials are the people to whom the task will fall in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I understand the Taoiseach's reluctance to engage in debate until the very last moment. It has been the hallmark of much of what he does, but he has taken part in very positive negotiations resulting in the positive outcome of the Good Friday Agreement. He was there during the last round of talks over a period of ten years or longer and he got a satisfactory result in that regard. I would hate to think his reputation of achievement on the Good Friday Agreement, which is deserved, would be forever damaged by a failure to deliver a positive result in a referendum on Nice some time in the autumn of this year. I say this from a position of having supported the Nice referendum from the outset and having urged the Taoiseach not to call the referendum prior to June last year but to wait until the autumn. This would have allowed time for an informed debate to take place because the dialogue of secrecy which has characterised much of the European debate, not just in this country but in other countries, prevented many people from understanding fully all the issues involved and from recognising that legitimate concerns about the democratic deficit, the European rapid reaction force and neutrality were not central to or party to the terms of the Nice treaty. While the Government decided to have a referendum there was a question as to whether it was legally necessary. Whatever about its political desirability, it was incumbent on the Government at the time to ensure there was a proper debate, which sadly was not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to learn collectively the lesson of that experience. I put it to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs that it will not be sufficient for the Government to remain silent in terms of the former content of a declaration or <Col N="956" /> draft declaration prior to the general election some time in May. A Government will be formed around the end of May or early June and preparation will be made for the Seville Council, which will take place during the third week in June. Against that timeframe it simply will not be realistic, if the Government is re-elected or if there is a different Administration, to send a Minister for Foreign Affairs, Taoiseach and Minister for Finance to Seville to obtain a declaration, the purpose of which is not to achieve anything within the European Union <i>per se</i> or to persuade any of our partners in the European Union to alter or shift their position, but purely to reassure a concerned Irish electorate in regard to some of their fears on issues surrounding the process of enlargement and further integration of the European institutions.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the Taoiseach's characteristic way of dealing with issues, which on occasions has been extremely effective, in this set of circumstances I do not believe he has the luxury of delay, silence or procrastination, nor do I believe he has the sole obligation or responsibility to find a solution. However, he is Taoiseach for the time being and has the obligation and responsibility of leadership. Therefore, I invite him through whatever process, be it the forum, his position as Taoiseach or through this House, to begin to enter into dialogue about what kind of declaration we want with those people who voted against the Nice treaty. I include in that category the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ó Cuív and many people in the Fianna Fáil ranks, who apparently had reservations about enlargement.</P>
    <P>We should have a debate about the parameters of the declaration, its tone and the issues it should address so that when the Taoiseach or his successor arrives in Seville, following the COREPER and other forms of preliminary dialogue among professional diplomats, who are among the best in the European Union and of whom I am very proud although they can only be as good as the political directions given to them, he or she can say, hand on heart, that the format and draft of the declaration being sought from the leaders of the other 14 member states will meet with the approval of the Irish people. We must ensure a positive outcome to the referendum on the Nice treaty to be held later this year as it is key to the enlargement process.</P>
    <P>I am asking for the dialogue to begin now. We should get the draft out in the open for debate in the various quarters which opposed the Nice treaty for various reasons. I believe the place to do so, notwithstanding what Deputy O'Keeffe said, is, in fact, the forum. The interim report of the chairperson of the forum clearly establishes that enlargement is not opposed by any of the groups that participated in the forum. There were concerns about other aspects of the European Union project but not enlargement <i>per se</i>. The French Minister for European Affairs, Pierre Moscovici, said there can be no enlargement <Col N="957" /> without Nice and Nice is the path into the gate of enlargement. Therefore, Nice is the gate through which we must pass if enlargement is to take place. While President Prodi was less than helpful when he suggested that, legally, the Amsterdam treaty could accommodate an enlargement of a maximum of five states, it is now clear we are looking at the prospect of ten member states joining at the one time. There is no side door and there is no possibility of utilising the Treaty of Amsterdam and a one by one series of bilateral treaties of accession. These issues must be clarified and legitimately addressed by a large body of Irish opinion which is open to persuasion and which does not want Ireland to be sidelined or made redundant within the European Union. I want to initiate dialogue now. While the Taoiseach and I differ on many issues, there will be no obstruction from the Labour Party on the issue. There will be positive engagement and positive participation.</P>
    <P>I now want to refer to the second part of the concerns that emerged following the defeat of the Nice referendum which the Labour Party supported. This relates to the democratic deficit. Concerns were raised by eminent people such as the former Attorney General, John Rogers SC. He described quite accurately and graphically the lack of engagement by this House in the formulation and participation of directives and draft directives before they finally come to this House to be enacted into domestic legislation. It was not the most balanced critique of the democratic deficit but it put its finger on a deficit which undoubtedly exists.</P>
    <P>In response to that, the Labour Party drafted its European Union Bill and, in fairness to the Government, it accepted it on Second Stage last June. The Bill has not progressed since then and there has been no indication of movement by this Administration other than the indication, in the package of Dáil reform proposals, that contents and measures similar to those set out in our Bill, which now belongs to the House, would be brought into effect.</P>
    <P>As part of the dialogue between now and Seville this Government &ndash; we cannot wait until the new Government, whatever its composition, comes into office &ndash; has a second task to do, namely, give a clear commitment to enact as a priority the European Union Bill, or a variation of it because no Bill is perfect. The Bill goes a long way towards meeting needs. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe in his contribution put his finger on the main problem, namely, the lack of resources made available to the House and its staff to fulfil the very onerous requirements of the Bill. I say as a former office holder that the requirement for Ministers and their staff to appear before a committee of the House in advance of attending a European Council meeting to set out the opening position of the Government and to return to indicate what changes and compromises were made will be a whole new ball game. It has a number of implications. It means more ministerial time <Col N="958" /> and more departmental staff devoted to European affairs. We are not talking just about a Minister for European Affairs and a group of people in the Taoiseach's Department or in the Department of Foreign Affairs. We are talking about dedicated European units in each Department which has an active engagement on European issues, and that includes almost every one.</P>
    <P>There are resource problems in terms of political time in the House, its committees, Departments and Minister's offices, and in terms of staff time and assigning senior staff within Departments. That must begin with what was indicated in Deputy Noonan's proposal for the future, something which clearly should have been in place by now and which was intended when the Taoiseach announced the formation of his Government, namely, to have a Cabinet Minister with responsibility for European affairs. However, the manner in which the Taoiseach proposed it meant the proposal blew up in his face and was consequently abandoned.</P>
    <P>The third issue on which I wish to focus in terms of opening, widening and easing the path of comprehension and understanding and engagement by the people with the necessity to ratify the Nice treaty is the second part of the reservations expressed by many people who voted &ldquo;no&rdquo; or who chose not to vote in the referendum last June. It was that they no longer knew the end destination of the European Union and the ultimate end point in relation to the balance of sovereignty between this republic and a European Union entity. We do not have a noun to describe the constitutional structure of the emerging European project, but it is no longer sufficient to simply call it, as the Treaty of Rome describes it, &ldquo;an ever closer union of the European peoples&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That working phrase, that deliberate bit of obfuscation, which began in the early 1950s and effectively became redundant in 1989 with the collapse of the Berlin Wall, means we must find some form of finality or some degree of endgame so that we can say to people what the project will look like when it is finished, that it will not include Belarus or the Ukraine and will probably not include Turkey, that it will have a balance of sovereignty between the Commission, the Council, the Parliament and the national parliaments, that certain matters, such as taxation, will remain the sovereign responsibility of national governments and so on.</P>
    <P>I do not say that any of us, whether here or in the convention which has commenced its work, can put a clear picture in front of the people at present, but they must hear from the Taoiseach some indication of what he believes the endgame might be. He has the responsibility to assure people about what is to be shared, retained or held accountable to this House and about the way the Council of Ministers functions. We will not get the result the Taoiseach and the majority of parties in the House want unless we begin that dialogue now. Sadly, the contents of the declar<Col N="959" /> ation and of the Taoiseach's speech in no way go far enough to begin to open up that dialogue.</P>
    <P>I invite the Taoiseach to reflect on how we can go about achieving a shared objective. Every one of the Members present in the Chamber supports him in trying to get a second referendum through. We do not know on which side of the House we will sit, but we will support the same project. However, its success will be enhanced or diminished by what the Taoiseach does between now and the formation of the next Government. We are with him on this issue. We utterly oppose him on many other matters, but on this one we are with him. He should take courage from that, be brave and enter into dialogue. He has more friends on this issue than he realises. If he has enemies, they are behind him.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opening statement I reported substantively on the Barcelona European Council. I would like to take a few minutes to report on the foreign policy issues addressed in Barcelona and then say a few words in reply.</P>
      <P>In the wake of several weeks of almost unremitting violence, it is heartening to see some tentative signs of movement in the Middle East. The Heads of State and Government of the European Union stated the position on the Middle East at Barcelona in a declaration which sets out clearly the expectations the European Union has of both parties. The declaration lays down the steps the European Union feels are necessary to achieve peace and expresses our support for certain recent initiatives, such as Security Council Resolution 1397, the ideas of Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and the renewed engagement of the special envoy of the US President, General Zinni. The declaration also restates the EU's call on the parties to implement the Tenet and Mitchell plans. It reaffirms the willingness of the European Union to work with General Zinni and the other members of the so called &ldquo;Quartet&rdquo;, that is the Russian Federation and the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General.</P>
      <P>In the final analysis, responsibility for peace in the region rests with the parties to the conflict. As I said on Question Time today, we have called on the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority to assume their responsibilities and to proceed to the immediate implementation of the Tenet and Mitchell plans without further delay or preconditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Serbia and Montenegro the European Council welcomed the agreement brokered last week by Javier Solana between Serbian and Montenegrin leaders on a new union of Serbia and Montenegro. The union, once ratified by all parties, will replace the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and, coming after ten years of conflict and instability, marks an important contribution to the rebuilding of the Balkans. A key factor in the negotiations was the acknowledgement by both the Serbian and the Montenegrin sides that engagement, especially economic engagement, <Col N="960" /> with the European Union was vital to their shared future.</P>
    <P>The central role of the Union in the process of stabilisation, reconciliation and reconstruction in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, was underlined again in Barcelona. It was agreed that the Union should now explore options which would enable it, following elections and at the request of the country's Government, to take responsibility for the current operation there for the protection of international monitors. This development can also be seen in the context of the decision at last month's General Affairs Council that the EU take on, with effect from January next year, the future management of the police mission in Bosnia.</P>
    <P>This focus on the Balkans is very much in line with our perspective on the EU's efforts to mount humanitarian and crisis management tasks &ndash; the Petersberg tasks. The EU is already constructively involved in the efforts to bring peace and stability in the Balkans, including FYROM, in a diversity of ways, not least through the Stability Pact on South-Eastern Europe. In contributing to conflict prevention and crisis management in this way, the EU is playing to its strengths.</P>
    <P>There is a range of instruments it can use, including the civilian and military capabilities being developed as part of the European Security and Defence Policy. It was accepted, however, that the EU should not take responsibility for the FYROM operation until the permanent arrangements for EU-NATO co-operation are in place. These stem from the fact that the EU is not a military organisation and needs to rely on infrastructural and transport support from NATO to carry out some crisis management tasks.</P>
    <P>In Barcelona the foreign ministers discussed the recent presidential election in Zimbabwe which saw President Robert Mugabe elected for another term in office, an issue also discussed at the dinner on Friday evening. Based on the damning reports submitted by the Commonwealth observer team and the SADC parliamentary forum, we concluded that the election was not free and fair. The manner in which the election was conducted and the ongoing threats to senior opposition party members in Zimbabwe are completely unacceptable. We will continue to monitor developments closely and will consider possible further targeted measures against the Government of Zimbabwe.</P>
    <P>At the European Council we also decided to send a high level troika delegation to countries of the Southern African Development Community, SADC, in the near future to discuss the EU's concerns in relation to Zimbabwe. We will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Zimbabwe who have been gravely affected by political and economic decline and by looming food shortages.</P>
    <P>At Barcelona we also discussed recent developments in Angola. The foreign affairs ministers welcomed the ceasefire declaration by the Ango<Col N="961" /> lan Government and its intention to allow UNITA to reorganise politically following the death of Jonas Savimbi in February. We urged the parties to fully implement the provisions of the Lusaka Protocol by engaging in a political dialogue under the aegis of the United Nations in order to promote lasting peace and stability in Angola. The humanitarian situation in Angola remains desperate and we have asked the Government of Angola to facilitate the humanitarian work of local and international bodies to bring relief to the people of that country. Ireland is strongly of the view that there can be no military solution to the conflict in Angola. As chair of the Angola UNITA sanctions committee, we are fully ready to contribute constructively and creatively to all necessary modalities of the political process which we hope will emerge over the next phase.</P>
    <P>The European Council also discussed recent developments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo where a fierce battle for control of the strategic town of Moliro is raging between DRC Government troops and Rwandan-backed rebel forces. The DRC Government side has used the attack on the town as a reason to pull out of the inter-Congolese dialogue already under way in South Africa. The European Council expressed concern at recent developments and regretted the effect that these developments have had on the evolution of the inter-Congolese dialogue. The Irish Government urges the DRC Government to continue its engagement in the inter-Congolese dialogue, a political process to which the Congolese people attach so much hope and which is vital for the democratic development of the DRC. We also urge all sides to cease fire in south-eastern DRC and to abide by their commitments under the Lusaka ceasefire agreement and relevant Security Council resolutions.</P>
    <P>Finally on the subject of Africa, the European Council expressed its concern regarding the possible stoning of a woman in Nigeria. We urge the Nigerian authorities to fully respect human rights and human dignity in Nigeria, with particular reference to women.</P>
    <P>As I have already highlighted, there was substantial progress made at Barcelona on the EU economic and social reform agenda known as the Lisbon process. I have nothing to add other than to welcome the comment and acknowledge that it is an ongoing issue.</P>
    <P>The European Council welcomed the start of proceedings of the convention on the future of Europe. As the convention is just getting under way, the issue was not substantively discussed at Barcelona. The Seville European Council in June will discuss progress at the convention on the basis of a report by its Chairman, Mr. Valery Giscard d'Estaing. The convention provides an important opportunity to address the disconnection between the European Union and many of its citizens. The Irish Government's priority will be to ensure that concerns which were manifested in the context of our referendum last year <Col N="962" /> are brought to bear and that the Union is made more comprehensible, more accessible and that its relevance to the concerns of citizens is better understood.</P>
    <P>The European Council also heard a presentation by Council Secretary-General Solana of his report on reform of the way Council operates to make it more efficient and transparent. The issues raised in the report will be examined in a substantive way at the Seville European Council in June.</P>
    <P>Although enlargement was not a formal item on the agenda of the European Council in Barcelona, the meeting between the EU 15 and candidate countries on 15 March to discuss the Lisbon strategy and its implementation was significant. This represented another positive endorsement of the substantial progress made by candidate countries in their bid to achieve EU membership. It showed an acceptance on the part of the member states that candidates are now in a sufficiently advanced position to participate in the Lisbon process. Furthermore, it is hoped that the Lisbon strategy will prove a further incentive to candidate countries to continue their efforts to adopt and implement crucial economic, social and environmental objectives.</P>
    <P>The presence of the candidate countries in Barcelona and their active engagement in the discussions on the Lisbon process underlined once again the importance of completing the ratification of the Treaty of Nice so that enlargement can proceed on time.</P>
    <P>I said we would seek a declaration from the Seville European Council confirming our position in the security and defence area was in accordance with the treaties. This would not diminish our commitment to European security and defence policy which is consistent with Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality. As I have already stated, the European Council welcomed the approach outlined and reiterated its willingness to contribute in every possible way to supporting us and to return to this issue at the Seville European Council in June.</P>
    <P>I have listened carefully to what Deputies Noonan, O'Keeffe and Quinn have said. I take note particularly of Deputy Quinn's constructive remarks about what we want to achieve. I have already said that, regardless of what position I am in after the general election, I am a strong advocate of the European model and want to see progress take place. I have listened attentively to points made about how we can perhaps exchange and build on dialogue around the declaration. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Finance are keen on two points, not just on the contents of the proposals of the Bill on engagement and changing the structures of how we operate this House. I agree with Deputy Quinn that it is not a simple matter but it is one on which we must progress. The extent of that dialogue and parliamentary scrutiny can be negotiated. A number of Ministers have already appeared before committees, particularly the Joint Committee on European Affairs where the <Col N="963" /> Minister for Foreign Affairs has just been in attendance, to discuss this matter and there has been far more attendance at committees than ever before. I accept that we need to do more; there is an issue of resources and we must deliver on that.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties in communicating about Europe over the past ten years is that the resources committed to it were small and probably ineffective. This must be addressed or we will lose sight of it. We have been working on proposals to change that focus. This is the second strand. The third strand is the declaration. The research following the unsuccessful referendum on the Treaty of Nice showed that, apart from the fact that the people did not see it as enormously important to their lives, the European security and defence issue came out as the major issue. When people looked through the issues they were confused. They heard the debates and they had nothing against enlargement but the predominant issue was security and defence. I hear what people are saying and we can enter into dialogue on it.</P>
    <P>I have attended many meetings in colleges and elsewhere, perhaps the largest of which was in Ballymun, and there is a certain element of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side that is not interested no matter what one does. As soon as one says what the contents of the declaration is they will say they want a protocol or the Danish system and when one says that is not what the Danish wanted or got there is a difficulty.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 12 and 13, to delete &ldquo;AND THE REGISTRATION OF MARRIAGES (IRELAND) ACT, 1863&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;THE REGISTRATION OF MARRIAGES (IRELAND) ACT, 1863, THE FAMILY LAW (MAINTENANCE OF SPOUSES AND CHILDREN) ACT, 1976, AND THE VITAL STATISTICS AND BIRTHS, DEATHS AND MARRIAGES REGISTRATION ACT, 1952&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes a change in the Title to allow us to make these two amendments, one in relation to births, deaths and marriages, and the other in relation to the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1997. I will refer to those later. This amendment proposes to add them to the Long Title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulations made under section 25 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Ireland), 1880, provide that a person could search the indexes to the registers held in each superintendent registrar's office. As the indexes are an integral part of the register, being bound into the register, this gives access to the register itself. Registers being primary records of events registered have to be protected and searches are allowed only under the supervision of the superintendent or one of his or her staff. In addition, the need to afford privacy to persons registering <Col N="965" /> events means that, in practical terms, access to the registers had to be limited.</P>
    <P>At present, there is only one national index printed on paper and this means that only one person may access particular years for an event at any one time. The computerisation of the national index &ndash; dating back to 1845 for marriages and 1864 for births and deaths &ndash; currently under way, will provide simultaneous access to a number of parties, including genealogists, and will also ensure an accurate and up to date index to events is available. Copies of the records held electronically will be more accessible and easier to produce than at present. The electronic database of vital events will therefore provide a level of service which would not be possible in a paper-based system.</P>
    <P>It will be essential to protect the primary records after the electronic capture has been completed and to have them available for the investigation of any query in relation to the electronic record. Accordingly it is propose to store them in a central suitable environment. That relates to Deputy Hayes's amendment No. 39.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 38, 40, and 51 to 54, inclusive, amend Parts 5 to 7 of the Schedule to the Bill to provide for a change in the current system for searches of the registration records of births, deaths and marriages by members of the public. The present paper-based system provides for two types of searches, a particular search where a specified event is being sought and a general search of the indexes to the records over a period of six hours. There are different levels of fees payable for such searches &ndash;&euro;1.90 for a particular search and &euro;15.24 for a general search. Some 1.2 million searches and inquiries are carried out each year across the various events.</P>
    <P>The present access provisions and fee structure are based on searching in printed indexes which is a time consuming and labour intensive process. The new computerised system will facilitate a more efficient system of searching the records. Accordingly, it is proposed to replace the existing provisions in the Births and Deaths Registration Acts and in the Marriages Acts relating to searches with a new system that encompasses both electronic and paper-based searches and a new fee structure.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 38 and 40 remove references to general and particular searches in the case of the Births and Deaths Registration Acts, while amendments Nos. 51, 52 and 53 do likewise in relation to marriages. The proposed new system will be set down in regulations to be made by the Minister for Health and Children under the Vital Statistics and Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act, 1952, as amended by the new Part 9 of the Schedule as inserted by amendment No 54. Amendment No. 54 inserts two new Parts 9 and 10 to the Schedule. Part 10 amends the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.</P>
    <P>At present, the law dealing with the commencement of maintenance orders is contained <Col N="966" /> in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976. This Act was one of the first of the modern pieces of family law legislation repealing the Married Women (Maintenance in Case of Desertion) Act, 1886. It allows for stand alone applications for maintenance. Most applications under the Act are brought in the District Court. In the Circuit Court and the High Court applications for maintenance are usually made in the context of applications for judicial separation or divorce and the maintenance is only one part of a comprehensive ancillary financial relief claim.</P>
    <P>The jurisdiction in the District Court at present is £200 per week in respect of the spouse and £60 per week in respect of each dependent child. These limits are due to be reviewed to &euro;500 per week in respect of a spouse and &euro;200 per week in respect of each child. Most applications under the 1976 Act are taken in the District Court.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that a periodical payment order under the Act shall commence on the date specified in the order not being a date earlier than the date on which the order is made. As currently drafted, this provision opens up two ways in which the maintenance payer may operate the system in order to delay the date from which payments must be made.</P>
    <P>The first of these is that payment under the order cannot be commenced earlier than the date of the order to the original court, usually the District Court. This gives the maintenance payer the incentive to delay the original court hearing as much as possible. Secondly, in the case of an appeal, usually from the District Court to the Circuit Court, while the appeal does not automatically act as a stay of execution of the order, nonetheless, as a matter of practice a stay is usually granted. Thus, the maintenance award usually has effect only from the date of the grant of maintenance in the Circuit Court on appeal. This provides an incentive for the maintenance payer to appeal the District Court order.</P>
    <P>This contrasts with the provisions of the Family Law Act, 1995, and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996, which state that the court can specify that the order may take effect earlier than the date of the order, although not earlier than the date of application for the order. This, in effect, allows the court to backdate the maintenance order to the date of the commencement of the proceedings or to any time during the intervening period. This will provide some encouragement to the parties to process the litigation in a speedy fashion. The proposed amendment to section 4 is designed to introduce similar arrangements to applications for maintenance under the 1976 Act by providing that a court could order that periodical payments should commence from any time after the date of the original application.</P>
    <P>I understand there is a drafting error in amendment No. 51 and I ask leave of the House to correct it. In item 3 of amendment No. 51, which amends section 69 of the Marriages (Ireland) Act, 1844, the words &ldquo;Health and Children&rdquo; should be <Col N="967" /> substituted for &ldquo;Social, Community and Family Affairs&rdquo;. This error was a drafting oversight. The provision relates to regulations which may be made by the Minister for Health and Children in respect of searches of the marriage registers. Items 2 and 4 contain analogous amendments and refer to Minister for Health and Children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment first on the amendments tabled by the Minister in respect of the registration of births, deaths and marriages. I will then deal with the issue of maintenance.</P>
      <P>Members on this side of the House have had the opportunity to discuss these matters with a number of interested parties since the conclusion of Committee Stage two weeks ago. While many of the changes the Minister is proposing to make may, in the fullness of time, provide for a more effective and efficient register, a number of particular difficulties remain even at this late stage. This highlights the problem in rushing through amendments of this nature on Committee Stage or Report Stage.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Broughan stated in our discussion on these matters on Committee Stage, everyone accepts that there is a need for modernising legislation in respect of the registration of births, deaths and marriages. However, a number of particular difficulties have already been highlighted to the Minister by the Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations with which I have been in correspondence since Committee Stage. One of the major problems we face is that there are two registers. There is a register of all births, deaths and Roman Catholic marriages which dates back to 1863 and there is also a register of all non-Catholic marriages dating back to the same year. It is ridiculous that, in 2002, two such registers exist.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment on some of the observations made by people outside the House in relation to, first, the indexes and register and, second, the issue of death certificates. If the Minister is stating that he is accepting some of the changes I am proposing, I will be extremely pleased. At present, in local registration offices access to both indexes and registers is a public right set out by legislation. The Government is now proposing that, in the future, access to registration books will be denied. This does not take account of the practicalities in local registration offices. As the Minister is aware, indexes are bound into the registration books. The Government's action will effectively and inadvertently deny all public access to both the registers and the indexes. As long as the indexes are bound to the back of the registration books, the amendments in the Minister's name could lead to access by members of the public to the vitally important information in these books being denied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information to which I refer is not just important from the point of view of the Government, it is vital for people, at home and abroad, who are trying to trace their roots and for those <Col N="968" /> who are trying to keep contact with loved ones. This information is not merely a device which can be used by the Government to increase efficiency, it also provides people with a means of keeping in touch with relatives and others.</P>
    <P>The Government's new proposals, as outlined in item 1 of the new section, will create a curious division between those searching for Roman Catholic marriages and those searching for non-Roman Catholic marriages. The Government's amendments, if passed, would allow public searches in civil, non-Catholic marriage registers, but would not extend the same right to search of civil registers of Catholic marriages. While it is true that these two types of registers are governed by separate Acts, one cannot help but believe the legislation before us will be seen as somewhat sectarian. It will be ludicrous if we enshrine in our law two fundamental registers, one for Catholics and one for non-Catholics.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, no attempt is made in the amendments to bring together those two distinctive sets of registers which were both begun in 1863. An attempt may well be made in the much promised legislation about which we have been hearing for a number of years when it is published in a year or so. However, no such attempt is made in this legislation. I do not believe that is acceptable.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to refer is the Government's proposal to deny direct access to civil registration books of births, deaths and Roman Catholic marriages. This issue is particularly important for people travelling great distances to Ireland to meet their relatives and it must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I have tabled a number of amendments relating to death certificates with which we will deal later tonight. However, I ask the Minister to take on board the concerns of those outside the House about the late tabling of these amendments in his name. This type of behaviour underlines the fact that the select committee should have engaged in hearings before we decided to advance and make these changes. Amendment No. 1 makes sense because it merely adds in items of legislation that were previously excluded. However, I am concerned about other amendments in the Minister's name because I do not believe that adequately addresses some of the points I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I agree with and support the amendment relating to the issue of maintenance. The effect of the Minister's amendment would allow the District Court to set the time of the maintenance payment to act as an incentive for those people who bring a party to the courts. The maintenance award usually has effect from the date of the grant of the maintenance, which is good. I understand the amendment will allow the courts to backdate the maintenance order to the date of the commencement of the proceedings or to any time during the intervening period.</P>
    <P>I wish to address another matter that has been brought to my attention in respect of this area. I refer to the difficulty many mothers face in <Col N="969" /> respect of the non-payment of maintenance. Where an original summons has been made by a District Court and a judgment handed down, it is difficult for a person to continually apply to the court in an attempt to have the position rectified and his or her maintenance updated. For example, a working mother who is not being paid maintenance by her former husband must return to the original court on a daily basis to seek redress. In my opinion, a woman living in Tallaght should be able to go to the Tallaght District Court and have the order for maintenance made there rather than being obliged to return to the court in which the original proceedings were taken. That is a straightforward, common sense amendment which should be made to the District Court rules and it would greatly enhance the amendment the Minister is making to the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>My party is mystified as to why these amendments have been tabled. Why has a separate registration Bill not been introduced? Why has the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform not come before the House with a Bill designed to bring about a full-scale reform of the area of maintenance? During its five year lifetime, the current Dáil has not dealt with many important Bills. I include in this a number of significant items of legislation from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs such as the Money Advice and Budgeting Service Bill, 2002. Why could that Bill not have been tacked on to the Social Welfare Bill or, as was mentioned on the Order of Business, why could the redundancy payments issue not be tacked on to the Social Welfare Bill? That would be appropriate. Why could the promised Disability Bill not be tacked on to it? One might well ask why three Bills, effectively, are being attached to the Social Welfare Bill this year and why we have not had the opportunity for a detailed discussion on the registration issue. I note that the issue has been raised and I commend the Minister for coming some way towards responding to the case put by the Genealogical Association of Ireland in relation to the ease of searches on registers and the Irish diaspora who are interested in tracing their ancestry. Anything which improves our registration process is to be commended. However, we should have had the opportunity to tease out more fully the implications of a new registration Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the greatest disasters in our history was the destruction by fire, during the civil war, of ancestral records in the public records office. That was a major catastrophe which has deprived many people of detailed ancestral records prior to the late 18th century, apart from families who were registered for land ownership. Fortunately, because of our surnames and our Gaelic and anglo-Irish clan system, we retained a significant ancestral idea, location and history. Any move to facilitate easier access to registration documents is welcome. In relation to the maintenance aspect, <Col N="970" /> I welcome what the Minister is doing but perhaps there should be a full scale Bill on this from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who has responsibility in relation to the matter which the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is tacking on to the Social Welfare Bill. Broadly speaking, I have no fundamental problem with the Minister's amendments but it would be more appropriate for the Government to have brought in three separate Bills.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their comments. The provision in relation to maintenance is being brought forward at the request of the Law Reform Commission in response to public demand over many years. The problem was addressed in agreement with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. We are sometimes criticised in the House for not having &ldquo;joined-up Government&rdquo; but there was full consultation in this instance. My Department has considerable responsibility in the area of family law and the provision of &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo;, and personally I had some knowledge of this matter in my previous life as a solicitor. I encouraged my officials to proceed with the discussions so that the problem could be rectified.</P>
      <P>The heading of the Bill refers to &ldquo;miscellaneous provisions&rdquo;, indicating that there are other issues involved. From an obvious practical point of view, with the end of the present Dáil in sight, this would have to wait another year if it was not dealt with in this Bill. On the amendments in relation to searches &ndash; we will be discussing other amendments on the register of births, deaths and marriages &ndash; the problem is one of time pressure. If we were to wait for the ultimate Bill on the general registration office, it would delay the computerisation of the system, which is ahead of schedule. By passing these small amendments, it will facilitate earlier implementation than was, perhaps, anticipated. Otherwise, the rolling out of the computerisation process would be delayed and I am sure Members would not approve of that.</P>
      <P>On the points raised by Deputy Brian Hayes concerning Catholic and non-Catholic registers, that is not an issue in this Bill, which is not in any way changing the existing position in that regard. The ultimate Bill will deal with those issues. Deputy Hayes, in amendment No. 42, seeks to include the issue of marital status and the occupation of a person's spouse. I will be accepting amendment No. 45 in relation to marital status but not the Deputy's other amendment. We are willing to meet some of the issues which he has raised.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implementation of the review of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy &lsquo;Building an Inclusive Society'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This relates to the report which I am seeking in relation to the implementation of the national anti-poverty strategy, &ldquo;Building an Inclusive Society&rdquo;. The Minister will recall our discussions on this issue on Committee Stage. It is a useful amendment to provide that a major announcement such as the Government's extension of the national anti-poverty strategy, &ldquo;Building an Inclusive Society&rdquo;, should be contained within this Bill. That would allow us, on a regular basis, to review its progress. If the national anti-poverty strategy is to mean anything, it must surely mean that the committee of this House dealing with this area, and the House itself, would review progress on a regular basis. By providing for a specific report on the Bill before the House, it would allow us to see progress, over the next five years or so, on many of these issues. There is still considerable discussion as to the net points contained within the NAPS review and as to precisely what is the Government's intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage, I referred to the distinction between acceptance of the majority benchmarking group on social welfare and the Government's composition of that in the national anti-poverty strategy, where it sets out a target to be reached by 2007. That is not the same because it does not uprate the lowest rate of social welfare on a yearly basis. There are also many commitments, in a general way, in the national anti-poverty strategy. This would be a useful amendment, particularly in the year in which the review of the <Col N="972" /> national anti-poverty strategy has been initiated. It is an important amendment to make. If we are serious about our commitment to eliminate consistent poverty, where significant progress has been made by the last three Administrations, it follows that our seriousness about trying to reduce relative income poverty should also be addressed and this is the place to do it. I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. While the general targets of the national anti-poverty strategy addressed some of the key issues to be tackled to put an end to poverty, the key target of social welfare income was the most disappointing. The sum of &euro;150 per week in five years time seems an extremely modest target, particularly if one looks at the commitments that appear to have been made under the benchmarking body.</P>
      <P>Currently, one of the key issues in both urban and rural areas relates to programmes like RAPID and spatial disadvantage. Every day a new candidate seems to come forward to run in the general election in such places as Mayo and other western counties as well as deprived areas of our cities and towns because there is a perception that the Government has not come to grips with the issue of spatial disadvantage. The key problem with the RAPID programme in Dublin city areas is the lack of belief in the promised delivery of such things as extra policing in very deprived and disadvantaged areas. The Minister and the Department have not yet addressed these issues under the NAPS. I commend the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Government came into office, the Opposition criticised us. It took its cue from people outside the House, such as Fr. Seán Healy of CORI and others. If the Opposition was sitting on this side of the House, it might have difficulty fulfilling some of the recommendations of such groups. Fr. Healy of CORI, the National Women's Council and other organisations welcomed the review of the national anti-poverty strategy when it was launched by the Taoiseach and I, particularly in the case of Fr. Healy who gave a big welcome to the commitments made in relation to the &euro;150.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Broughan conveniently left out the fact that the commitment in regard to the &euro;150 is to reach the equivalent of &euro;150, in 2002 terms, by 2007. The new national anti-poverty strategy, Building an Inclusive Society, brings forward not alone significant targets which will be very difficult for future Governments to reach, but absolute commitments. I hope that no matter who is in Government after the election they will endeavour to reach those targets, particularly the &euro;150. The NAPS review process will merge with the EU process that requires each member state to produce annual action plans against poverty and social exclusion on a bi-annual basis. This will ensure that the strategy, while subject to ongoing <Col N="973" /> monitoring and evaluation, will be comprehensively reviewed every two years. That approach has merit because when the original anti-poverty strategy was announced just before the last election in 1997, we had to look again at some of the commitments virtually within months of taking office. Even at that stage what I regarded as very conservative commitments had been already reached, particularly in regard to unemployment.</P>
    <P>It is open to the Oireachtas to take part in the ongoing review of the national anti-poverty strategy by means of a committee of the House. It is important that the Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs looks at the national anti-poverty strategy and at the record of the incoming Government regarding its implementation. I would have thought the Deputies would see at least some merit in the national anti-poverty strategy review, which, after all, is the culmination of months of work by all the social partners in the various working groups that fed into the review on which ultimately the Government gave its considered view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that the Minister has not read in detail the comments of CORI which he used in a most selective way in response to this amendment. It is strange that he has not read them because if he had he would not hold the view that there is universal rejoicing within CORI on this particular document or among many other third pillar organisations. This is simply not the case and I wish to put the record straight.</P>
      <P>One of the key weaknesses CORI recognised in its immediate response to the national anti-poverty strategy is that it is vague and very general in many areas and leaves a great deal to be decided in the future in regard to the rights-based approach. While it acknowledged the recognition of social, economic and cultural rights contained in that view, it was very disappointed at the narrow focus of the application of these rights. It was also critical of the cumbersome and general way in which the document deals with the monitoring and evaluation response. We can all quote points that suit our arguments.</P>
      <P>What is important is not the powwow between the Minister and I, but the action that a future Government takes in this area. It is interesting that the Dáil has not passed a resolution supporting NAPS. I support it and regard it as a first step on the road to the elimination of poverty. The Dáil has not had an opportunity to discuss it. The first time it was discussed was in a select committee of the House when Deputy Broughan, the Minister and I engaged in a three-way debate. If ever an issue should be centre stage, it is the elimination of poverty. This document makes some progress towards that aim although it is general and vague in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to include this amendment in the legislation because of the year in which we are discussing it. The first review has taken place after five years and if it is not specified, we will not have proper review and monitoring in the <Col N="974" /> context of the House. That is why this amendment is worthwhile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I take issue with the Deputy in regard to what CORI said. Fr. Seán Healy wrote an article in <i>The Irish Times </i>entitled &ldquo;Government's Poverty Strategy is a Major Breakthrough&rdquo;. He went on to say that it contains a major breakthrough on income adequacy. He stated that, for the first time ever, a Government decided to benchmark the lowest social welfare rates at 30% of gross average industrial earnings. He further stated that CORI has been looking for that to happen for years and complimented the Government in regard to the key target on income&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;which is the most important of all the targets. While he may find fault with some of the institutional issues in the national anti-poverty strategy, by and large, his article is extremely complimentary. Although he went on to say that there is a lack of clarity on the status of the framework document, by and large, given all the issues referred to in the national anti-poverty strategy, he welcomes it. He said that for an anti-poverty strategy to be credible in the 21st century it needs to move towards a rights based approach to tackle the major issues underpinning poverty. It is crucial that society moves beyond charity and the whims of politicians. Obviously, he welcomes the statement and says that he welcomes the strategy. In conclusion he says that the review of the national anti-poverty strategy includes a major breakthrough on income adequacy. Though he goes on to say that more needs to be done, which of course is true, it is churlish of Deputies not to acknowledge the fact that the general reaction to the strategy was extremely complimentary. To a certain extent their criticism, including the reference to &ldquo;baby steps&rdquo;, does it a disservice. All the social partners were involved in the negotiations relating to the strategy. I have no problems with the reviews of the anti-poverty strategy as it is the job of Oireachtas Members to constantly review it, more often even than on a bi-annual basis.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;2.&ndash;The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the increase in the consumer price index since the commencement of the Act of <Col N="975" /> 2001 and especially the increase consequent on the introduction of the euro currency and shall compare those increases with the increase in payments under the Act of 2001.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In relation to the review of the national anti-poverty strategy, one of the difficulties we in the Opposition had was that we did not receive the major background paper &ndash; certainly, my office did not &ndash; which is characteristic of the Government.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 14 relate to the widespread perception by citizens that, despite what the Minister told us on Committee Stage, there has been major inflation, particularly in the prices of groceries and services such as insurance as well as in many other areas of basic human needs, since the introduction of the euro on 1 January. The improvements the Minister introduced, including his 9.5% increase in benefits have, to a large extent, been wiped out. The Independent Group newspapers are to be congratulated for the campaign they have run in relation to the euro rip-off which has developed over the last number of months, as is the Consumers' Association of Ireland. While the Minister will no doubt quote from the CSO figures that inflation actually fell in January and February when compared to the same period last year, most economists were asking him to disregard key products and areas of spending of the most deprived and disadvantaged families such as clothing, groceries and rents. Those areas show significant inflation, some of which undoubtedly materialised under the cover of the euro changeover. I gave the Minister a number of simple examples on Second Stage, including that of vending machines, where 10 cent or 15 cent was added to every product for no reason other than to rip off consumers.</P>
    <P>The great effort the Government feels it has made in the area of social welfare provision has, to a large extent, been negated by the euro changeover. As the year progresses we will see more clearly that there has been significant inflation, particularly in areas which affect our most deprived citizens. This simple amendment, together with amendment No. 14, asks the Minister or his successor to bring before the House a report on how the euro changeover has affected social welfare recipients. It is often felt that this whole area is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the Tánaiste and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, but it should be the responsibility of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. Perhaps under the new Government formed after the general election the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs will take a special responsibility in relation to price increases of products which affect the most deprived people.</P>
    <P>The Minister cited a report from the community sector, but one of the most damning <Col N="976" /> reports published during his tenure was the Vincentian Partnership report on the weekly income and spending of a typical three-person family in receipt of social welfare. When published last autumn, it proved conclusively that such a family was £80 short of basic income in that year. In the interim those families have been severely affected by the introduction of the euro and we simply ask that the Minister reports to the House on the impact of euro inflation on the most deprived families in the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is similar to the previous one in that it refers to a specific event that occurred this year, which was the introduction of the euro. That is not going to happen each year over the next ten years, hopefully, and that is why Deputy Broughan and I seek to include this amendment in the legislation. It will not cost the Minister and his Department a penny. It is a straightforward amendment which asks the Minister to bring forward a report on the effects of price inflation social welfare recipients have endured since the introduction of the euro.</P>
      <P>The Minister will get to his feet in a few minutes' time and discuss inflation. He will refer to the consumer price index. That is all very well, but in opinion polls being taken throughout the country ordinary people consider health and crime to be the most important issues in the context of the coming election with prices increasingly placed third or fourth. The Government is oblivious to the fact that we have seen massive rip-offs taking place since the introduction of the euro. It did not happen in December and it did not happen in the changeover period, it happened between July and December. Small incremental increases were made to the price of the pint and the price of foodstuffs. Anyone who shops on a regular basis will tell the Minister that the only winners from the introduction of the euro have been the shops and the manufacturers charging excessive prices.</P>
      <P>The Minister will say that the inflation has not come through in the CPI and that, therefore, the Government is oblivious to the fact. All these amendments seek is to have the Minister with custodian responsibility for social welfare recipients bring forward a report by going out into communities to find out what is happening, as opposed to what he thinks is happening or what his economists tell him is going on. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt is doing work in this area as we know. At a recent select committee meeting I asked the Minister to take a chunk of that work and, over a month or six weeks, to produce a report. If the Minister fails to accept these amendments, he will be saying there is no problem in regard to price inflation affecting those on low incomes when, clearly, there is.</P>

Deputies can criticise the CPI, but it is comprehensive and professional, unlike the other surveys that have been trotted out in recent times. While people might feel that prices have increased, we have to be very careful. The CPI collects over 55,000 prices covering 1,000 different items and prices go up and down from month to month.</P>

      <P>It is worth recalling that this Government has been in a unique position. It was the first Administration in the history of the State that did not have to operate under severe financial constraints. Let us think about that for a moment. Until 1997, every Irish Government, of whatever political hue, was short of money. There was never enough to do what needed to be done. The financial policy of every Government in our history was to do the best it could with the limited, inadequate amount of money it had available to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1997, that changed. That was the first year the full benefits of the Celtic tiger started to flow into the Exchequer. Suddenly, there was no shortage of cash. Suddenly, in place of the chronic deficit in current spending that had plagued the public finances for nearly a quarter of a century, <Col N="978" /> there was a current surplus, a surplus that was to grow over the next four years to a level that was almost embarrassing. It is worth pointing out that when this Government came to office five years ago, it inherited a surplus from the rainbow Administration. That surplus increased and Government action had little responsibility for generating subsequent surpluses.</P>
    <P>This Government faced a new test. Instead of having to cope with a shortage of money, like all previous Governments, it had the task of spending an abundance of resources. This abundance of resources should not have allowed the Government to abdicate responsibility for making choices. It should not have removed from the Government the responsibility for spending money well and ensuring the taxpayer always got value for money. Alas, however, that is exactly what happened.</P>
    <P>The Government abdicated its responsibility to make choices that would safeguard our future in favour of taking the easy way out &ndash; spending money for short-term, opportunistic gain or to gratify the egoistic whim of a leader with an edifice complex.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>These gains are now turning to dust and we are left to face the future. We are still left with a ludicrous standard of public services in health, education and public transport, with an infrastructure that has failed to keep pace with our growth and with an education system that is busy tearing itself apart and neglecting the urgent need to adapt and to provide a rapidly changing portfolio of skills to our young people. In terms of public services, we are back where we were five years ago. Nothing has improved during the five long years of this Government. This Government has squandered our boom.</P>
      <P>However, that is not all. The Government has failed not just in refusing to improve our public services and to lay a proper foundation for the tougher future that looms ahead of us. Even more culpably, this Government has flagrantly mismanaged the resources of the State. It has failed to realise that the dictates of prudent government apply in good times as well as in bad. It has thrown prudence to the wind, spending unbelievable amounts of money without a care for the results produced, if any.</P>
      <P>Value for money is a concept this Government has swept under the carpet, at enormous cost to the people. It has failed to apply even the most basic checks and balances in the administration of public money, the full consequences of which are only just beginning to appear above the surface. The shambles at Abbotstown is a scandal in itself, all the more so because it comes to roost at the Taoiseach's door. However, it also comes in a long line of misadventures that include, to mention just one, the &euro;50 million overrun on the Iarnród Éireann signalling project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="979" />The Government has failed in even the most basic of housekeeping tasks, which is to make sure that the money going out does not exceed the amount coming in. Public spending is out of control and is getting further out of control with every day that passes. The Minister for Finance budgeted for a 12% increase in public expenditure this year on top of the 22% increase last year. That is a total of 34% for the two years. The Minister revised the figures on 1 January and increased the 12% to 14%. The figure was again revised today at the finance committee and now the projection is that expenditure will increase by 14.6%. With each day that passes the Minister is getting more out of line with his targets and driving the country into bankruptcy. The cutbacks in spending promised in the budget are not being realised. The spending goes on and on, regardless of the consequences.</P>
    <P>The result is, incredibly, that at the end of our boom we are left with a looming deficit on current spending. This Government is surely summed up by the image of a Taoiseach who can sign blank cheques, closing his eyes to where the money goes and how it is spent. As we finally approach this long delayed election, the people would do well to ponder on this performance when they go to the polling booth to choose the next Government. This Government is intent on taking credit for the boom. We will make it face the truth, which is, that it has squandered it.</P>
    <P>At the recent Fine Gael Ard Fheis, I set out my party's vision of a forward looking, fair, compassionate and generous Ireland in which we plan for the future with care. Yesterday we launched the economic framework in which this vision can be delivered. This framework will underpin the policy programme which Fine Gael will put before the people at the general election. Our economic and social management will be driven by six key principles: first, competitiveness; second, maximising growth; third, fairness and social justice; fourth, prudence and safeguarding the future; fifth, efficiency, reform and value for money, and, sixth, social partnership.</P>
    <P>Despite the downturn of recent months, Fine Gael has strong confidence in our economy. We believe that with prudent economic policies, sensible legislation and a renewal of social consensus, significant growth rates can be sustained well into the future. However, growth cannot be sustained if we continue to pursue the short-term, opportunistic mismanagement of the past five years. Current spending has grown over the past five years by an average annual rate of 15%, far in excess of growth in the economy. I know the Minister and his ideological position. He knows that an increase of 15% in public spending cannot be sustained. The Minister is presiding over a farce and, what is worse, he knows it is a farce.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael will cap growth in current spending at a maximum of 2% over nominal GDP growth, that is, real growth plus inflation. To cut spending growth too quickly could create avoidable disrup<Col N="980" /> tion and worsen an already poor public service environment. As reforms are introduced, the rate of growth in current spending will be managed down.</P>
    <P>Where are the resources to come from, to improve our public services and social provision? Borrowing for current expenditure is not an option. Everybody now acknowledges that we must ensure a balanced budget over the full economic cycle. To that Fine Gael now adds a specific commitment &ndash; in Government we will never borrow to fund current spending. Raising taxes is not an option either. Our phenomenal recent growth is based on a low tax regime. To reverse that approach would be counterproductive. Fine Gael believes that an incentivised economy is the most efficient way to create the resources to improve services. Rates of capital, corporate or income taxes will not be increased during our first term of office.</P>
    <P>Reduced economic growth, however, can and will produce more revenue. We expect real GDP growth to expand in the medium term at an average annual rate of about 5%, following a dip to 3.5% this year. In the medium term we see inflation falling to 2.2% a year. Sustained growth of 5% per annum will generate increased resources for the Exchequer, which Fine Gael will target for improved services. We can also use resources better &ndash; stretch them further through getting better value for money. Delivering better public services is not just about more money. A Fine Gael Government will proceed progressively with public sector reform and will review the effectiveness and efficiency of all existing spending.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has been in office for five years. One of his most honest moments in office was when he stated at a press conference on the second last Estimates that he could not understand what the Department of Health and Children was doing with all the money he had voted to it because services were not improving. He hit the nail on the head. Unless we insist on value for money and proper accountability on how public money is spent and turned into better services, then we are going nowhere. That is precisely where the Government has been going for the past three years at least.</P>
    <P>Our prosperity belies an investment deficit in our economic, social, cultural, recreational and sporting infrastructure. This is the gap the national development plan should be filling. The plan is hopelessly behind schedule, significantly over budget and incurring very high rates of inflation. Incredibly, the Government has cut back on capital spending at a time when current spending is out of control. The economy needs the direct opposite and the Minister knows it. Capital investment wisely spent now will accelerate our return to above average economic growth. If we are to give renewed impetus to the NDP, we need extra investment rather than the cutbacks in investment over which the Government has pre<Col N="981" /> sided. In Government, Fine Gael will provide that investment through borrowing if necessary and better use of public private partnerships, but without a new approach new money will be wasted. There is a need for the State to act in a planned, professional way. Fine Gael will immediately undertake a root and branch review of the NDP, producing within three months a timetable setting out completion targets for all significant projects and legislation where needed.</P>
    <P>Economic policy is not just about the public finances. The way we raise revenues through taxes and the priorities we follow in spending those revenues defines the type of nation we are and want to become. Fine Gael believes that the ultimate goal must encompass both prosperity and the quality of life of all our citizens. We reject the suggestion that we must choose between the so-called Boston and Berlin models. With principled far-seeing economic management, we can create in Ireland a society that embraces both a US standard of income and EU levels of social and environmental protection. That is the direction I am confident the Irish people will choose when they are finally given the chance to exercise that choice in the election which is only weeks away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. As the Minister will probably be aware, many of us are canvassing and knocking on doors. There is real concern among the electorate. I have met many voters and they are tuning in for the upcoming election. They are concerned and are raising questions about where all the money went, what went wrong and what happened to the Celtic tiger. During the 1990s there was unprecedented growth and the economy was going well. The Government had the opportunity to invest wisely and to spend prudently for the future. That did not happen, however, and we have very little to show for the good times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, the quality of our infrastructure does not match our economic success. As the Tánaiste stated, we have Third World infrastructure for a first class economy. It just does not add up. The NRA announced its programme recently. It is behind schedule and some projects have been shelved. It was obvious to any of us tracking the progress of the national development plan, particularly in the area of infrastructure, that projects were behind schedule, deadlines were not being met and investment was not meeting targets. We were told continually by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and those responsible in that area that the plan was on schedule but, in fact, it was not. The spend may have been on schedule but construction inflation has taken its toll on moving the national development plan forward. There have been bottlenecks, delays in planning and delays in reaching agreement on various projects under the plan. In areas where we should be moving forward, the plan is behind schedule. For example, it now takes five hours to drive from Cork to Dublin. It took three <Col N="982" /> and a half hours when I was first elected to this House. I do not take that route anymore; I travel on overcrowded trains.</P>
    <P>Public transport, particularly in urban areas, has not improved. The level of service on bus routes is still the same as it was 15 years ago despite the fact that urban areas have grown substantially. There is no sign of the Luas, which should have been on the streets within two years of the rainbow Government going out of office. We saw a toy train on Merrion Square a number of months ago but that was the first sign of the Luas.</P>
    <P>We are told by Iarnród Éireann's television advertisements that we are going places. Yesterday there was another announcement in the newspapers by the Minister for Public Enterprise of a consultation document on our rail routes. The Cork-Midleton route was mentioned yet again. It is still an aspiration and still in consultation. That has been on the table for some time. The people are not fooled by Iarnród Éireann's advertisements telling us that we are going places. They know we are not. Any of us who travel on trains are aware of the conditions under which staff are working. We have asked questions of the Minister for Public Enterprise but there is no bright horizon for Iarnród Éireann. There is no relief for the hard pressed passengers who travel to the west and the south with Iarnród Éireann. The people see through these advertisements. They are not fooled by a sample train and track on Merrion Square.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan is right and he said it previously. This Government was elected to run the country, the health services and local government, but that is not happening. It is riding on the back of the Celtic tiger and the success of private industry. Inflation has gone up. We on the Opposition benches highlighted the effect the euro changeover would have on inflation. We highlighted the fact that the changeover was not being policed and that there were not enough checks and balances in place at that time. We were assured by the Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs that the Director of Consumer Affairs would name and shame all those who abused the changeover and engaged in profiteering. We see the results of increased prices, particularly in the services sector. We are paying for it now through a higher inflation rate. It is due to the mismanagement of the Government. It is another nail in its coffin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak on the motion. It is time to pause and see how the fiscal policies of the past five years have impacted on a large number of people. One can only view what has occurred in the light of the huge increase in revenue available to the Government over the past five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cannot state often enough that no one could have dreamt that any Government could have the sort of resources available to it which this Administration had. The growth in the econ<Col N="983" /> omy arose out of economic factors which came together at one time. These were low interest rates, low inflation and a workforce that was very employable. After years of successive Governments investing heavily in education, which obviously paid off in the IT sector in particular, we were positioned for the type of growth which we were lucky enough to get.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is taking all the credit. Fianna Fáil takes credit for everything that moves. Even before this election starts we will be told that Fianna Fáil will actually take credit for it if we have a nice fine day. When the Minister came to office one could see, irrespective of what side of the political spectrum one was on, that all the fundamentals of the economy were poised for growth in a very positive way. This has a domino effect &ndash; once more people go back to work, there is less social welfare to pay. It is my belief, a belief shared very strongly by Fine Gael, that personal taxation should not be increased. I do not think there is any need to do this. It is possible to do what we want to do in this country without increasing personal taxation.</P>
    <P>In light of an expected GDP of about 5% &ndash; if one is to believe the economists &ndash; there are a lot of things we can do within that framework to point the economy in a desirable direction. That is why the Fine Gael policy document on the economy released yesterday sets out our stall very clearly.</P>
    <P>There are a number of questions the Minister and other Government Members will have a lot of trouble answering at the doors over the next couple of months. In a time of unprecedented growth, the people will certainly ask why over 30,000 families cannot get a roof over their heads. This has not happened for years. How could the Minister have organised the system so badly that this is what actually happened?</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks about quality of life, a term which means the same thing to most people. It basically means that, one day, one hopes to own one's own house, have a job, get to and from work reasonably smoothly and go about one's normal business without harassment &ndash; in other words, that the security of the State would be such that one would feel free to walk anywhere. Instead of that, different circumstances obtain. Some members of society have certainly got rich in the past five years. There is no doubt about that but, for the vast majority of people, it is an endless struggle. It will have to be asked, in light of the fact that everybody agrees that times will not be as good and so dramatic as they have been in the past five years, what Fianna Fáil will do when the pressure is on given that they could not handle matters correctly when they had the money. One of the things I will always remember about this Government over the past five years is that if it could solve a problem with money, it solved it, but that was the only time it solved it. It appears that anything the Government's&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to say a few words on this very important motion which I strongly support. There are many different areas and aspects which one could cover in respect of this motion. Some of the issues that come to mind concern infrastructure and health. One could go down along a different list, but this evening I want to talk about infrastructure in particular and the widening of the gap between the rich and poor. One wonders what this Government did to tighten or narrow that gap.</P>
      <P>Having contested two by-elections and met a lot of people in my own county, one of the things that strikes me &ndash; which will strike the Government when it goes to the people in the next few months &ndash; is the way the Government has neglected the very poor and badly off sections of our community. Housing aid for the elderly is a simple scheme administered by the health boards. Very little funding has been allocated for this scheme. In fact, the health boards were not even able to deal with a new list of people last year. Over 300 people have applied in my area alone for the scheme and they cannot be dealt with because the money is not there. It is a good scheme designed to help the very vulnerable and older sections of our community. The Government claimed it would look after those people. The scheme is an example of one that could help those people and give them a much needed quality of life.</P>
      <P>In terms of essential repairs grants, the Government allocated £30,000 for a constituency the size of Tipperary South. If one goes across the country and checks how much the various local authorities got for essential repairs, one will see they got similar allocations. Does the Government care about those who are living in poor housing conditions when it is giving out only £30,000 for essential repairs? It is a joke to say that a £30,000 allocation to any local authority is adequate to meet the needs of an entire constituency.</P>
      <P>I have given two simple examples relevant to the motion of how the Government is not caring for the poorer sections of our community. Those of us who entered politics in the early 1990s saw the country beginning to get off its feet after the bad days of the 1980s when the economy was struggling. We were looking forward to an economy that would produce a lot of goods and jobs and result in improved infrastructure. What has happened? National plans have been drawn up. Deputy Clune spoke earlier about travelling on the Dublin-Cork road. The bypass of Cashel was planned and promised, but what happened? A number of weeks ago, the allocation&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this motion. This Government has fought with the nurses, doctors, gardaí, teachers and everybody in the country over the past five years. This is the first Government that had real money. I have to say it has spoiled its chance. It has even choked the Celtic tiger. He is dead now, gone. The tiger never arrived in the west of Ireland &ndash; he was choked in Kildare. He certainly did not come to the west.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to tell the Minister a little story. I was driving to the Dáil a fortnight ago when I encountered big Mercedes Benz cars. The Taoiseach and gardaí were present and I thought there was an emergency. I drove behind them. To tell the truth, I broke the law. I said: &ldquo;If they are going to be caught, I am going to be caught. If they are going to be fined, I am going to be fined.&rdquo;  None of us was fined, thank God. We got into Strokestown and there were traffic lights. I was delighted because it was the first time a Taoiseach actually drove into the West of Ireland. The rest of them used to come by helicopter into Knock airport. Anyway, there were traffic lights in Strokestown and I was delighted. It is not because there was too much traffic but because there is a stretch of road in Strokestown where, if two cars or lorries were to meet, there would be an accident. They now have to have traffic lights there so one car can pass through on the N5. That is how well we have done from this economy. This is how well this Government has looked after us.</P>
      <P>Today, I saw on the television how well we have advanced in this country. Due to the Government making such a mess of the NRA and the road down in Kilkenny, we now have to get the police to escort the cattle across the road. Have we not advanced? Are we not making progress when we have to get the police to escort the cattle across the road? Of course, we are. That could happen only in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government was good for two things. Rather than improving our health service, it appointed 75 spin doctors. The Government has spent £300 million on consultants' reports. Last year alone the Department of Health and Children spent £17 million on local advertising. Last week the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and I had a few words on this subject. I told him I hear him on local radio when I <Col N="986" /> get up in the morning. When I am eating my dinner, I hear him again and late at night I hear him yet again. Then I take the local paper and I see his head &ndash; like myself, he is losing his hair &ndash; looking out at me. This is all being paid for by the taxpayers. Spin doctors are spinning this publicity all the time.</P>
    <P>The people are waiting for this election. It is five years since we had one and I am looking forward to it. County Mayo will be like Vietnam. There will be battles in every part of the constituency.</P>

He wondered why we are letting them away with this and why they are on the radio every day of the week spinning about how well the economy is going.</P>
      <P>This Government has allowed the rich to get richer &ndash; I am sure they will look after the Government in return &ndash; but the poor have got poorer and the middle classes are being squeezed. The sooner the general election is held, the better because the people are looking forward to giving their verdict on the Government. We do not need to ask what the Dublin media thinks of the Government. They think the Government is wonderful and no wonder because it has given so many of them jobs.

      <P>The average person would regard the Minister for Finance as a practical man who has shown a great awareness of public concerns and has gone about his business in a practical way. He is to be commended for that. However, in the past two and a half years the Government has lost the sense of urgency necessary to deal with the economic problems now arising. High volume producers in this country face dark clouds. Napoleon called China a sleeping giant which should be left to sleep lest when it awoke it would move the world. Average rates of pay are currently $1 per hour in China compared to $20 here. If we do not do research and development in the areas of technology and environmental and health technology, and if we do not plough money into education, we will find ourselves at the back of the class in the next 15 to 20 years. The entry of new members to the European Union who have invested extensively in education and whose workforces are prepared to work at lower rates of pay than ours will present us with problems. The Government has lost its sense of urgency and focus in facing these challenges.</P>
      <P>The downturn in the trade figures is a cause of serious concern. In a recent interview Deputy Spring said he would not mind being appointed Minister with responsibility for trade in the next Government. Like Deputy McCreevy, I have been a Minister with responsibility for trade. Experience tells me that the Minister with responsibility for trade in the next Government should be given that task as a full-time job. It is only when one has led trade missions abroad that one sees the impact and success that can be gained by them in countries where we want to break into markets for quality products.</P>
      <P>The tax credits which were introduced in the budget are calculated at the rate of 20% of the relevant allowances. Previously a taxpayer received tax relief at the top rate of 40% or 42%. A bill of £1,000 for the VHI, for example, would entitle a taxpayer to relief of £420. However, tax credits are calculated at the rate of 20% so that the relief on £1,000 is now only £200 and the taxpayer must pay £220 more tax. To present tax credits in the way the Minister has done is a sleight of hand. From 2002, for example, the VHI must reduce its bills by that amount. However, the VHI has already increased its premia by more than 9%. Where is the real value of this tax relief?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever Government the people elect will be faced with a series of emerging difficulties which are becoming more urgent by the day. If the current trend of business closures continues and if we do not make an impact abroad, our net immigration could be transformed into a labour sur<Col N="988" /> plus. Investment in education and in research and development is critical to our future as a country which has been held aloft internationally as the jewel of European economies. We are in the lap of the gods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Nowhere have the Government's economic policies failed more than in rural Ireland. We see people leaving rural areas, particularly in the west and in my constituency of Limerick West, because farming is in difficulty. One can no longer make a living on a family sized farm as one did 20 or 30 years ago. Some say this is inevitable but that is debatable. Nothing is replacing the family farm.</P>
      <P>Infrastructure is not being put in place to attract people back to rural Ireland. The practice of constructing single houses in the countryside is coming under pressure. There is concern about ribbon development and the environmental effect of septic tanks. People are rightly concerned about these matters although, in many cases, I believe they are overly concerned. Policies which discourage the building of single houses in the countryside are not being compensated for by the provision of proper infrastructure in villages. We talk about cluster development and the development of villages, but this needs infrastructure. The most important piece of infrastructure for the development of a village is a sewerage scheme. One cannot build ten houses in a village if one does not provide a sewerage scheme. Septic tanks are not sufficient. The Government has singularly failed in this regard. It has paid lip service to the development of rural villages while not providing the necessary infrastructure. Rural development also needs modern water schemes. We are extremely concerned in my own area. We have lobbied for years for the development of the Shannon Estuary and the improvement of the N69 between Limerick and Foynes and onwards to Glin. It is recognised that there is an opportunity for development in the area. There is an excellent port in Foynes which could provide for marine industries. There is a 200 acre site in Askeaton which is serviced by Shannon Development and the IDA. When investors visit the region, they point out that there is an excellent airport at Shannon and an excellent port at Foynes but they cannot get to the port because of the standard of the roads.</P>
      <P>We hoped the NRA would give a substantial commitment to the improvement of the N69 this year and we are disappointed that has not happened. It is a disgrace not alone because of the opportunity that exists for development but because people must travel that road to work in Limerick, Aughinish, Askeaton and Foynes. It is also a scenic route that could aid the development of the tourism industry in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also extremely concerned about the village of Kildimo, which is on a fast section of that route. The people of Kildimo have been seeking traffic calming measures for the past ten years for the safety of the villagers. The NRA has also said <Col N="989" /> this will not be done this year even though Limerick County Council has all the relevant information. It is not good enough and I ask the Minster to examine the development of rural villages and the estuary on the Limerick side through improvements works along the N69 and in Kildimo village.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes the sound and successful economic and budgetary policies of the Government which have resulted in unprecedented growth in living standards and employment, enabling strong improvement in public investment and service provision in tandem with a continued easing of the burden of taxation and national debt and the establishment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am very glad of this opportunity to set out the Government's record of achievement since we came to office. This record will stand the test of time and the assessment of the electorate. What is just as important as the progress we have made is the fact that the Government's economic and fiscal policies have placed the economy in a strong position to take full advantage of the international economic upswing, which various indicators suggest has already begun.</P>
      <P>The key issue is which policies are best for the future. The Government has followed a strategy of building up our economic infrastructure and rewarding work and effort by putting in place a supportive tax regime. It has shared the fruits of economic growth fairly in the community by creating approximately 300,000 jobs &ndash; this is the best way to bring about real social inclusion &ndash; but also by directing very substantial extra resources to those outside the workforce. It has set about providing for our future through the National Pensions Reserve Fund and through radical changes I introduced in the tax system to foster individual pension provision. We have done this while running a budget surplus.</P>
      <P>These are sound, productive and forward looking policies. They seek to set us on a path away from the misguided high tax and high spend policies of the past, which I sincerely hope have had their day. We are the envy of Europe in this regard. We are celebrated in the international press for our achievements. I am asked regularly by international commentators for insights into our experience. The judgment of our peers abroad on how successful we have been is much different to the picture which the motion seeks to portray.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since coming into office on 26 June 1997, the Government has created an economic climate which has helped our economy to prosper and has put the fruits of our economic success to good use. We have delivered on our promises; achieved <Col N="990" /> a level of employment in the economy never seen previously; reformed the taxation system, especially personal taxation; improved our public services and infrastructure and distributed resources fairly; significantly reduced our national debt burden and run budget surpluses; and, made provision for the future by establishing the National Pensions Reserve Fund.</P>
    <P>The sound management of the economy has been one of the cornerstones of the Government's success. We have achieved one of the best economic performances in the world over the past four years. Since 1997 the economy has grown, in GDP terms, by an annual average of almost 10%. Living standards, in <i>per capita</i> consumption terms, have risen by almost one third. Involuntary emigration is virtually unknown and approximately 300,000 new jobs have been created. As a result, unemployment fell from 10.3% in 1997 to an average of 3.9% last year and long-term unemployment has fallen from 5.6% to 1.2%. This record outshines that of our main European partners.</P>
    <P>Our economic prospects are good provided we continue to pursue the right policies and secure our competitiveness. The Government's policies offer the best prospect of meeting those criteria. At budget time I indicated that I expected a GDP growth rate for Ireland in 2002 of just under 4%. This is still a reasonable estimate and compares favourably with the European Commission's forecast for this year for the European Union as a whole of about 1.5% GDP growth.</P>
    <P>While opinion is still divided as to the pace of the recovery in the international economy, the consensus is that the US economy is recovering. The recently published fourth quarter US GDP data supports that view. The recovery in the US will be a strong boost to both the EU economy generally and to our own. Looking forward, I am in no doubt that the economy is in good shape and is well positioned to take advantage of the improvement in the international climate as the year progresses so that we can return to our trend GDP growth level of approximately 5% from 2003 onwards.</P>
    <P>However, this is not to say we can take success as given. We must keep our eye on the ball. As a small, open economy with large-scale dependence on trade and foreign investment, it is imperative for our continued success that the economy remains competitive. That is why social partnership has been so important to our economic success as moderate and predictable wage developments have underpinned our competitiveness. It is crucial that an inflationary mentality does not take hold. Inflation will ease as the year proceeds because the factors causing the upswing now are largely transitional. We cannot take our success for granted and we must all keep working for it.</P>
    <P>The Government has used the fruits of economic growth to put the public finances on a more sound footing. We have also reduced the general government debt from 74% of GDP in 1996 to an estimated 34% at the end of this year. That is <Col N="991" /> a huge reduction of 40 percentage points of GDP. In 1996 interest payments came to 46% of income tax receipts while today's figure is 21%. This is a measure of the tax savings from reducing the debt burden. This year we will again have the second lowest general government debt ratio in the EU.</P>
    <P>We have run budget surpluses during our period in office. The Government has not sought to borrow to fund its tax and welfare commitments in any of its five budgets. This is a major achievement and will leave the public finances in good stead for the future. We have had unhappy experiences in the past of high borrowing levels and the difficulty which Governments had in bringing this under control, even in good times. All parties looking forward should understand the downsides of borrowing to sustain public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Government has used the benefits of economic growth to deliver on its promise of tax reform. A key part of our programme was our commitment to reduce personal taxation and to encourage people to take up work. In our five budgets, almost &euro;4.8 billion in tax reductions has been delivered. The standard rate of tax has been cut from 26% to 20%. The higher rate has been reduced from 48% to 42%. The initial entry point to taxation has been more than doubled. These changes delivered substantial increases in real disposable income for all taxpayers. Furthermore, the introduction of tax credits has made the income tax system more equitable. To be fair, Members opposite have acknowledged these positive achievements and do not have a fundamental issue with them.</P>
    <P>Following the last budget more than 690,000 income earners or 37% of those on Revenue's records are outside the tax net. The corresponding figures when we took office were 380,000 or 26%. I would remind the House that, of the &euro;4.8 billion in tax reductions in the Government's five budgets 43% has gone on increasing the basic tax allowances, or credits as they are now, including the PAYE allowance; a further 22% went in taking more than 370,000 taxpayers off the top rate of tax; over 16% went to reduce the standard rate of tax paid by all taxpayers; and just 11% went to cut the top rate of income tax. All taxpayers have benefited substantially from the major tax reforms and tax reductions the Government has carried out. The Government has been a Government for all taxpayers.</P>
    <P>In setting out the Government's record on taxation, I would like to remind the House of some of the key measures introduced in the budget. We took more low income earners out of the tax net altogether and a substantial number of those on middle incomes were moved from the top rate of tax to the standard rate. In addition, we took another large step towards achieving the aim of moving the income tax entry point to the level of the minimum wage. Both of these measures made further progress towards meeting the policy objectives of the Government and the social part<Col N="992" /> ners in this area over time, as agreed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>The last budget brought the entry point to the tax net for a single person to over &euro;209 per week and took 68,000 low income earners out of the tax net altogether. When we came into office the corresponding entry point was £77 or almost &euro;98 per week. The single standard rate band was also increased by &euro;2,605 to &euro;28,000 with relevant changes to the married bands. This took 57,000 taxpayers from the higher rate of income tax in 2002.</P>
    <P>The Government has also shown its commitment to the elderly in the area of income tax. When we came into office, the income tax exemption limits for those aged 65 and over were as low as £4,600 per annum single and £9,200 married. They have been more than doubled, removing a substantial number of elderly taxpayers from the tax net.</P>
    <P>As part of its tax rate reduction policies, and following an agreement reached with the EU Commission, the Government will have reduced the standard rate of corporation tax from 36% in 1997 to 12.5% from 1 January 2003. Business has responded to this reduction by creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs. Our corporation tax rate will help to ensure that Ireland will continue to remain an attractive location for foreign direct investment which has played a key role in Ireland's economic success over the past ten years. The Government has also helped businesses and shareholders in companies by reducing the rate of capital gains tax from 40% to 20%, resulting in a more than five-fold increase in the yield from this tax between 1997 and 2001.</P>
    <P>Our tax policies have sought to promote investment, reward effort, encourage risk-taking and secure equity in the distribution of resources as best one can. Our move to a tax credit system offers greater scope for marrying more coherently the incentive and equity aspects of our tax code for the benefit of all income earners. It will allow us to target tax reliefs better than we do now.</P>
    <P>The Government has delivered on its promise to improve our infrastructure. We have committed significant resources, especially to roads, public transport and housing. Capital spending has increased from just &euro;2 billion in 1997 to just over &euro;5.7 billion in 2002. Even with such a high level of investment in our infrastructure, more is needed in order to meet the growing needs of the economy and the Government is committed to this.</P>
    <P>The national development plan is key to meeting our infrastructure needs. Contrary to what some maintain, there has been an excellent roll-out of the NDP infrastructure programme over the first two years of the plan. The evidence of this is visible throughout the country as infrastructure projects of unprecedented scale, especially in the transport and environment areas, are either currently under construction or at various stages of planning.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="993" />Particular attention has been focused in recent times on progress in the NDP roads programme. Over the first three years of the plan the Exchequer has provided gross funding of some &euro;2.5 billion for the roads programme, which is &euro;260 million above that committed in the published operational programme. This has facilitated an excellent roll-out of the roads programme in the key first two years of the plan. The evidence is there for all to see. Progress is evident on the Dublin port tunnel, the M50 and the M1 to Dundalk and beyond, to name but a few key projects. We are committed &ndash; as will be clear from what is an historically huge level of investment in the roads programme &ndash; to ensuring that there will be no undue delay in projects that are essential for national and regional development. We are moving into the third year of a seven year investment programme with the objective of ensuring that by the end of 2006 there will be a transformation of our road network.</P>
    <P>In public transport, the Luas is proceeding apace. In addition, while not part of the national development plan, the Government has recently invited expressions of interest for the development of a metro system on a PPP basis. Additional rolling stock on the DART, the first since it opened, is now in operation providing significantly improved transport services in the Dublin area. Under the NDP, Iarnród Éireann is seeing the first major Exchequer public investment in railway infrastructure for decades. In public transport we have also seen improvements in Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.</P>
    <P>In the area of housing, my colleague the Minister for State at the Department of Environment and Local Government recently announced the fifth record year for housing output. Over 52,600 new homes were completed last year. We are building houses at a rate of more than 13 per 1,000 population, which is by far the highest rate of house building in Europe. In terms of social housing, over 5,000 local authority houses were completed or acquired last year, the highest level of output for over 15 years. Output under the voluntary housing programmes in 2001 was some 1,200 units, the highest level ever achieved by the sector.</P>
    <P>Reflecting this performance in implementing the NDP, it is estimated that during the three years from 2000 to 2002, over &euro;10.1 billion will have been invested in economic and social infrastructure under the plan. This is in excess of the commitment in the published operational programmes. More significantly, by the end of 2002, the Exchequer will have provided over &euro;750 million more than originally promised.</P>
    <P>The Government is also delivering on its promise to improve public services. We have focused in particular on health, education and social inclusion. We promised to develop a quality health service. Between 1997 and 2002 we have increased the gross allocation to the Department of Health and Children by over &euro;4.5 billion or 125%. In numbers terms, we now have more than <Col N="994" /> 4,000 additional doctors, nurses and other health-care professionals. Hospital waiting lists have been reduced by one fifth during the Government's term of office. Target specialities have seen a particularly sharp drop in waiting lists since December 2000. The waiting list for cardiac surgery is down by 49% and the ENT waiting list is down by 22%.</P>
    <P>Behind this waiting list reduction lies a huge increase in the throughput and workload of our hospitals. The number of medical procedures performed has almost doubled over the past five years from 422,000 per annum to 825,000 per annum. While certain problems continue to exist, nevertheless the increased expenditure on health services over the period has delivered a significant advance in the level of service provision.</P>
    <P>By targeting investment in health services strategically, the Government is committed to funding further significant improvements. As part of the health strategy, 700 new beds will come on stream in the current year at a cost of &euro;65 million. A treatment purchase fund to reduce waiting lists is also being put in place, with a budget of &euro;30 million to purchase capacity for public patients either in private hospitals or in hospitals abroad. By the end of 2002, the aim is that no adult will wait longer than 12 months and no child will wait longer than six months for any hospital treatment and that by 2005 no patient will wait longer than three months.</P>
    <P>The Government has also made targeted investments in services for people with disabilities for which the 2002 budget set aside an additional &euro;55 million. This includes provision for an additional 500 rehabilitative training places. There has also been a significant increase in the level of funding for services for the elderly. An additional &euro;49 million was provided for this in the 2002 budget. Also, a further &euro;10 million has been provided in 2002 to develop additional services to address youth homelessness, with particular emphasis on services for children in need of special care and protection.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly highlighted the fact that we also need to ensure that the very significant funding which is now being committed to the health services is accompanied by the highest standards of efficiency and effectiveness and the Government is committed to this.</P>
    <P>The Government also promised major investment in the area of education. We have delivered on that promise. Since coming into office, capital funding for building and refurbishing our schools has almost quadrupled. In 1997, only 30 primary school projects were under way. In contrast, there are currently 84 primary school projects either in construction or at the tender phase, with construction about to commence. In 1997, only 12 major projects were sanctioned at second level, compared with a record 125 such projects in 2001. Class sizes in primary and secondary schools are at their lowest level for many years. This year alone, an additional &euro;3 million is being provided <Col N="995" /> to appoint an extra 350 teachers at first level and 200 teachers at second level from the commencement of the next school year. There are now 20,000 more third level places, enabling far more children to prepare themselves for their future in a modern economy. An additional &euro;10 million was also provided in the last budget for a range of measures in the education sector to assist pupils with disabilities and to provide improved services in the special needs education area.</P>
    <P>However, providing resources alone is not the complete answer to improving public services. I am committed to ensuring that value for money is achieved across the major spending programmes. My Department is driving a number of reforms to improve the overall management of public expenditure and it will continue to seek the full co-operation of Departments in delivering both effectiveness and efficiency in the provision of services.</P>
    <P>My philosophy in relation to public spending is clear. When there is money available I am willing to invest it in our public services. However, I am not prepared to stand over an approach which would set our public finances on an unsustainable path. We cannot spend what we do not have. Significant pressures for additional spending over the next few years already exist. We must all work to ensure that the response to these pressures is based on the long-term interests of our economy. We need to achieve an appropriate match between spending and resources going forward.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to social inclusion. In the PPF, the Government undertook to progressively introduce social inclusion measures with a total cost in the year 2003 of &euro;1.9 billion. In the event, the combined cost of social inclusion measures introduced in the last two budgets alone, even before any account is taken of improvements provided for during the annual Estimates process, was over &euro;3 billion in a full year.</P>
    <P>Let us reflect for a moment on some of the key achievements in the social welfare area over the past few years. The lowest rate of social welfare payment now stands at &euro;118.80 per week for a single person, an increase of 43% since 1997. The old age contributory pension is now &euro;147.30 per week for a single person. This is an increase of 49% since 1997 and well in excess of the £100 per week target which we originally set in an Action Programme for the Millennium. The rate for a couple aged 66 years or over has risen even faster and now stands at &euro;261.10 per week, an increase of 54% over our five years in office. From April of this year, the monthly rate of child benefit will be &euro;117.60 for each of the first and second children and &euro;147.30 for each of the third and subsequent children. This is a virtual trebling of the payment rates and means that the PPF commitments in this area have already been exceeded. There have also been many other improvements in the social welfare area, such as relaxation of <Col N="996" /> means tests, accelerated increases in qualified adult allowances, extension of the free schemes and earlier implementation of social welfare increases, all of which combine to enhance the position of the elderly, carers, disabled and other vulnerable groups.</P>
    <P>The success of these measures in improving the living standards of the most vulnerable people is confirmed by the research data. The latest figures from the Economic and Social Research Institute show that the level of consistent poverty, as targeted by the national anti-poverty strategy continues to fall. It stood at 6% of the population in 2000, down from 15% in 1994. Particularly welcome is the very substantial fall in levels of consistent poverty among children, down from 23.5% of children in 1994 to just 8% in 2000.</P>
    <P>However, this Government recognises that challenges remain. We are determined to build further on the progress already achieved. To that end, following a very comprehensive review of the existing national anti-poverty strategy involving all of the social partners, the Taoiseach and Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs recently launched Building an Inclusive Society, an ambitious plan which seeks to continue the development of a more inclusive society. Among the central goals of that plan are an objective of reducing, and ideally eliminating, poverty in Ireland; a specific target of eliminating long-term unemployment and a new benchmark for the lowest social welfare payments of &euro;150 per week by 2007, in 2002 terms. These policy priorities, combined with a continuation of the sound economic and fiscal policies of recent years, provide the framework which will ensure everyone has both the opportunity and skills to participate in economic and social progress.</P>
    <P>The Government has not just used the fruits of our economic success to provide for today's needs. It has also begun to provide for our future needs. I established the National Pensions Reserve Fund because, in common with other industrialised countries, Ireland is set to experience a significant ageing of its population over the coming decades and this will give rise to a serious financial burden on the State. It will put a severe strain on the capacity of all Governments to fund social welfare and public service pension liabilities on a &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; basis. Today there is a ratio of five persons of working age for every person aged 65 or over. By mid-century, it is projected there will only be two persons of working age for every person aged 65 years or over. If we do nothing to anticipate that development now, the consequence will be either that taxes will have to rise dramatically when that time arrives or the value of pensions in real terms will have to be reduced.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the National Pensions Reserve Fund is, therefore, to move from sole reliance on pay as you go and introduce part-prefunding of our future liabilities. It is a long-term project from which we should not be deflected in the early years. Pension liabilities are as real as any <Col N="997" /> other and the fact that they will not arise until some point in the future does not mean they need not be addressed now. It is for this reason I provided for a statutory minimum contribution to the fund of 1% of GNP each year with the option to make additional contributions by resolution of the Dáil when circumstances allow. This is a level which will make a significant contribution to future pension costs and is a sustainable commitment.</P>
    <P>In addition to the statutory contribution, the Government has already set aside the net proceeds of the sale of the former Telecom Éireann and 1% of GNP in 1999 and 2000 to kick-start the fund. At the end of last year, the total value of moneys standing to the credit of the fund was &euro;7.7 billion. Under the tax code, I have made significant and radical changes in the incentives for individuals to provide for their own pensions. These changes make it more attractive to provide a pension for oneself, more feasible to retain control of one's pension portfolio and make pension products more portable. These changes will more than prove their worth when it comes to dealing with pension issues in the future.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund will help to smooth the Exchequer burden arising from our additional pension commitments and introduces a new strategic long-term element into budgetary planning. This is our nest-egg for the future. In my view, we should not deploy it to meet short-term priorities. The ageing burden is an inevitable cost. It is not something we can avoid or dispel, or over which we have any real measure of discretion. That is why we must save to provide for it and why we must start saving now.</P>
    <P>At the outset I reminded the House that the Government has fostered a climate in which it has been possible to deliver on our promises. In many cases, we have actually exceeded our commitments. There is no doubt we have improved the standard of living and the level of public services. We have also ensured the economy can continue to deliver good levels of growth so that we can make further progress into the future. I have no doubt that all parties wish to make this economy stronger, more productive and more capable of meeting our economic and social priorities. The Government's record shows that we have policies that work now and will work for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was reading the Fine Gael document today and rereading the budgetary documentation produced last December in the context of the Fine Gael documentation. I was struck, not for the first time, by the extent to which things have changed so dramatically in the <Col N="998" /> past year or so. In his budget of December 2000 the Minister was able to do extraordinary things. He was able to reduce tax, project an increase in public expenditure in excess of 20%, reduce the national debt considerably and even allow himself the odd peccadillo, such as the special savings scheme. One has to remark how quickly things have changed. In his budget introduced just 12 weeks ago, the Minister effectively jumped through every hoop conceivable to avoid the ignominy, as he clearly thinks it to be, of borrowing. He effectively camouflaged a budget deficit of close to &euro;2 billion by raiding every fund available and magically turned it into an apparent surplus of &euro;170 million.</P>
      <P>Then I listened to the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis a few weeks ago and heard the Taoiseach and the Minister make very interesting speeches. I am not sure whether the scripts provided tallied exactly with the way they were delivered, but it certainly sounded to me as if the Taoiseach was ruling out borrowing. Not only that, he attacked with great vehemence and vigour those parties &ndash; I presume he meant mine &ndash; which have engaged in what he called &ldquo;reckless borrowing&rdquo;. He ruled this out into the future. The Minister, unless I misheard him, appeared to go even further and suggested borrowing was a terrible thing which no responsible Government could possibly consider.</P>
      <P>Either I am missing something serious or the Taoiseach, the Minister and their party were either codding themselves or were looking to cod the people. It is explicitly clear in the budgetary documentation produced by the Minister a few months ago that the starting position in a few months' time will be an Exchequer deficit of close to &euro;3 billion. What exactly is the Taoiseach saying to us? Is he saying that the Government will turn that starting deficit into a balanced budget? If that is to be done, it will be necessary, as the Taoiseach and the Minister know, to cut public expenditure not just in real terms but in actual terms as well. Is the Taoiseach trying to pretend that the starting position is different from what we know it to be? I suspect he is either trying to cod himself or cod the public.</P>
      <P>For many years Fianna Fáil has been all things to all men and, for much of the life of the Government, it has been in a position to do that. Now is a time for real choices. If the Minister wants to avoid borrowing, he will have to engage in cuts, not just real cuts but actual cuts. If he wants to fund the national development plan, as he appears to be committed to doing, he will have to borrow and it will have to be real borrowing, probably quite substantial at that. If he wants to improve services, which he again claims he is committed to doing, he will have to find the money somewhere.</P>
      <P>In the document launched by the Fine Gael Party yesterday, a similar problem arises. It was a decent job of work and someone has clearly engaged in a great deal of honest endeavour and has done what I know to be tedious but nonetheless quite useful work.</P>

      <P>That was the good bit. I saw a headline in the <i>Irish Independent </i>today, which incidentally did not sit very comfortably with the story, to the effect that at last there was a party engaging in radical thinking. Whatever else the Fine Gael document may entail, radical thinking it is not. It amounts to something which could very easily be produced by the Minister of State's colleague in the Department of Finance. It is prudent budget management into the future. There is no policy change. It is roughly the same commitment in terms of capital spending for the next number of years and roughly the same commitment as the current Government would be likely to make in terms of current spending into the future, give or take one or two percentage points. I am sorry that the Acting Chairman is not in a position to respond because I know he would like to. Perhaps he will get the opportunity to do so tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Radical thinking the document certainly is not, but it will also clearly entail, perhaps not immediately or next year but certainly the year after next, a significant cut in the rate of increase in current expenditure from that which we have seen in the past two years, from the projected increase of 14% to something in the region of 9.5%. That sits uncomfortably with the central message which I took from the press conference given by the leader of Fine Gael that we would have the best public services in Europe, not tomorrow, not next year but perhaps in a number of years. The message appears to be the same as that coming from the Government, that even though one may cut expenditure and will not raise taxes, one can nonetheless have significantly improved services.</P>
      <P>As I listened carefully for 40 minutes to Members of Fine Gael list things which needed to be done and deficiencies in the use of public money in their constituencies &ndash; no doubt the same would be said by people on the Fianna Fáil benches &ndash; I noticed they did not draw the logical conclusion which surely must follow from that, namely, that we are not spending enough. That appears in the Fine Gael document and it will be said privately by Fianna Fáil Members that we spend a good deal less than most other European Union countries. Fine Gael has identified that we have the second lowest level of investment in public services and social security in the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with that analysis, but we must get over the thinking that we can get something for nothing because the public knows that is not the case. It is certainly true to say, and to this extent I go along with colleagues who have made this point, that additional money, public spending and resources do not necessarily mean one gets better services. Unfortunately, we have had all too much experience of that in recent years. However, surely it can also be said that, without additional <Col N="1000" /> money, resources, public spending and private spending for that matter, one will not get better public services. That is the bottom line and all colleagues in the House, whatever constituency they represent, know that to be the basic fact of the matter.</P>
    <P>There are, broadly speaking, three interlinked challenges which will face the Government which comes into power in six or eight weeks' time. One is how to deal with the health service, another is how to deal with the infrastructural deficit, in other words, the national development plan, and the other is the issue of improving public services. I wish to spend a few minutes on health to begin with.</P>
    <P>The reason I choose this topic is because, as I am sure others in the House will agree, it is the major issue which surfaces when canvassing. I have, as most of us have at this stage, been on the road for a very long time knocking on doors in my constituency and I will happily say that it is the only major issue of a national kind which arises regularly. One meets people who have had bad experiences in accident and emergency, with waiting lists or in trying to get an appointment with a consultant. I received a letter today from the Northern Area Health Board concerning two people about whom I was inquiring regarding orthodontic services for which they have been on a list since 1996. It told me that the list was being reviewed and that, when it was completed, the board would see whether it could give the people an appointment. They have been on the list for six years and that is apparently something we are meant to consider acceptable in this time of unprecedented economic opportunity.</P>
    <P>We all know there is a problem with the health services, and I include in that the Government and the Minister for Health and Children. What did they do? They clearly identified this problem a better part of a year ago as the major potential election issue and the Minister for Health and Children was charged with working out a way of dealing with it. In fairness to him and his Department, they clearly attempted to do so in good faith. During the course of last summer and for some months beforehand, they worked to produce the health strategy. The first warning signals occurred in Ballymascanlon when the Department and the Minister sought to brief the Cabinet only to have their efforts torpedoed subsequently by the Minister for Finance who made it quite clear that he thought that the case for additional health spending was not well made. The Minister and the Department ploughed on regardless and, in November, published the strategy amid a great deal of fanfare and acclaim.</P>
    <P>It is a glossy brochure of between 150 and 170 pages. There are several other additional glossy brochures going with it dealing with primary care, the resource requirements within the services, manpower and so on. I have read it all quite carefully and it amounts to a compelling case for additional resources and spending. The strategy is costed at £6 billion in additional spending, <Col N="1001" /> which is about &euro;7.5 billion, and £4 billion in additional current spending in 2001 terms. We have had hopelessly inadequate public debate about this. What the strategy argues for in effect is a dramatic increase in the level of both current and capital spending on health.</P>
    <P>It argues for increasing our spend from roughly 6.5% of GNP just a couple of years ago to very close to twice that figure, bringing us from the bottom of the EU league to very close to the top. Unfortunately, we have not had any real public debate on the matter. In November 2001, the Government signed off on the strategy but in December &ndash; just a couple of weeks later &ndash; the Minister for Finance, in his budget, provided virtually no extra finance. The figure was probably somewhere between &euro;40 million and &euro;70 million depending on what you care to take, but virtually nothing in the context of the overall funding requirements of the health service.</P>
    <P>Only a few days ago, just 12 weeks into a ten year strategy, the Minister for Finance wrote in the <i>Irish Medical Times </i>that the current rate of funding increase in the health service is unsustainable and that it does not require a brain surgeon to suggest that if we allow health spending to increase at its current rate, levels of taxation will have to increase in order to maintain the necessary balance in our public finances. He goes on to make it clear he has no intention of doing that. The Minister for Finance &ndash; the man who writes the cheques and advises the Government on the funding of the health service &ndash; is effectively tearing up the strategy within 12 weeks of its publication. The Minister is making it clear that not only does he deeply resent the funding he has had to provide over the past four or five years, but that he has no intention of providing funding into the future. He feels free to say this within 12 weeks of the strategy's publication and apparently there has been no comment on it. This is utterly unacceptable.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of the health strategy with which I do not agree. The two-tier model in the means of access to the health system is unacceptable. It is further unacceptable that one is admitted to hospital or accesses a service or treatment largely on the basis of whether one can afford it, less so on the basis of medical need. Medical need should be the only criterion for access to decent health care and the fact that the strategy does not deal with that issue in any serious way is a major flaw. The strategy is also deficient because the Labour Party favours a universal insurance scheme which would be part-funded by the State for those who cannot afford it. We disagree on that but let us leave it to one side.</P>
    <P>We are willing to accept that there are huge capacity problems within the service. We removed 3,000 beds in the 1980s and we need to put them back. This is provided for in the strategy and I agree that it must be done, but it will require money. We also agree with the need for additional assessment rehabilitation beds for <Col N="1002" /> older people. We agree there is a need to provide primary care centres &ndash; 200 of them perhaps &ndash; which will require a large amount of money. It will also cost money to provide GP co-operatives and the various other step-down facilities for older people that are clearly needed. Beaumont Hospital in my own constituency is largely &ldquo;blocked&rdquo; if that is the right word &ndash; I do not intend it to be derogatory &ndash; in the sense that it is full of older people who should not be there. We do not have the level of step-down care and the number of beds required to accommodate these people in nursing homes where they could access para-medical assistance or something less than that which is available to them in hospitals. The hospital beds are being badly used in a fashion that is detrimental to those who could better use them, including some of those who are required to spend time on trolleys in accident and emergency departments. We need all this additional capacity but we have had no debate and we have a Government which has no intention of engaging in it. This is the major challenge and priority for funding in the next four or five years and I see no sign that the Government is tackling it.</P>
    <P>I will go some distance with the Minister because I acknowledge that there has been progress on some levels but rather less on others. This is the first time since we joined the EU, or EEC as it was formerly known, that we have been required to provide virtually all of our capital spending on infrastructural requirements from our own resources. For much of the late 1980s and 1990s it was effectively paid for by the German, Dutch and Swedish taxpayers and our better-off colleagues in the EU. That is no longer the case. The money must now come out of our back pocket and, therefore, it has brought more focus to the argument than there has previously been.</P>
    <P>The national development plan is now into its third year and has seven years to run in total. It was not originally intended to comprise the entire capital budget but that is how it has ended up. Even if one accepts that as being inevitable, two things emerge when one examines it. First, in some important areas, roads being the most obvious, we are likely to overspend the amount of money committed without achieving what is required. In other areas, of which health is an example, we will neither spend what was provided for nor get what is required. I acknowledge there have been problems in relation to roads in the areas of construction inflation, planning and landowners who are reluctant to allow access to their property to allow the planning process to get under way. Nevertheless, the plan is hopelessly behind time in terms of planning and delivery. The plan calls for about 900 kilometres of motorway and dual carriageway of which less than 10% has been delivered.</P>
    <P>A story in the <i>Irish Independent</i> a few days ago set out a list of five projects which have been put on hold until the end of this year. These are projects that should have proceeded this year but which will not now be funded. They include the <Col N="1003" /> Ennis bypass, the Carrickmacross bypass, the Sligo inner relief road, the Castleisland to Abbeyfeale road and the Enniscorthy to Clonroche road. All of them were apparently close to the end of the tender process but are now shelved due to lack of money. When the Minister for the Environment and Local Government tells us that the money is there and the plan is being rolled out, we know from the NRA that this is not the case and that some of the more important projects have had to be shelved or postponed. The problem with this is that, in order to deliver projects of this kind in a coherent way, there must be an element of predictability about it. When one starts into the planning, tendering and route selection process, one needs to know it is going somewhere. What has caused us so many problems is that we proceed in fits and starts. Frequently, when we have assessed a project and selected a route, we leave it on the shelf for another ten years, until such time as we can progress it to the next stage. By the time we have done that, the original selection plan is out of date and inadequate for our purposes. The serious problem of unpredictability is one that undermines the way we have been trying to deliver this plan.</P>
    <P>There are still huge areas of the public service which are entirely deficient and some of them were alluded to earlier, public transport being a case in point. We are getting the first DART carriages in the 20 years since the service came into existence although the Government has promised them every year. I have listened to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and his colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise tell us that we will have longer new carriages and longer platforms but this did not happen until the past few months when we got a few additional DART carriages. It is great, but it is four or five years too late. Heaven knows how we are going to build the metro. It is not in the national development plan but no matter what price we put on it &ndash;&euro;8 billion or &euro;10 billion &ndash; I cannot understand how we can be asked to take seriously a Government which with a Luas system virtually ready to run says that it can now deliver a metro system which is infinitely more expensive, far more complicated and will require a great deal more planning. I find it difficult to take the Government seriously.</P>
    <P>When this Government took power, it inherited decisions in terms of expenditure reviews which the previous Government had made. The Comptroller and Auditor General recently undertook a review of those reviews, following which he discovered that many Departments were slow to start work on their schedules and were also slow in carrying out those they did start. The review went on to state that the level and value of work done fell far short of the level of coverage intended when the reviews started. We have not taken seriously the business of value-for-money expenditure reviews. Our failure <Col N="1004" /> to do so is partly responsible for our failure to deliver the improvements in public services we should have received from the money we spent.</P>

    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;2.&ndash;The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the increase in the consumer price index since the commencement of the Act of 2001 and especially the increase consequent on the introduction of the euro currency and shall compare those increases with the increase in payments under the Act of 2001.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;(Deputy Broughan).</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was discussing the issue of inflation <i>vis-à-vis </i>the euro and the implications for social welfare. My Department does not have responsibility in this regard; the major responsibility lies with the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Tom Kitt. As I said on Committee Stage, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has requested Forfás to carry out an urgent review of the implications of the euro, which is ongoing. Contrary to what Deputy Hayes has said, all the information available to the Department of Public Enterprise shows that in the final quarter of last year there was no evidence of any effort to put up prices.</P>
      <P>The CPI is a comprehensive and professional examination of pricing covering in the region of 1,000 items. Prices can rise or fall from month to month so one must examine the broader aspect over the longer term. For example, prices of essential items such as clothing and footwear have declined over the past year by 3.1%, but Opposition Deputies have not mentioned this fact. When the issue of inflation was raised during Question Time recently I referred to the fact that clothing and footwear prices had dropped by 11.5%. Although a number of items had increased, that represents a dramatic fall for those items. The February figures for clothing and footwear rose by 8.5% over January, but the year on year figure dropped by 3.1%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the items regarded as essential have gone down in price, year on year. People thought that while they might not see price increases in January as a result of the introduction of the euro, they would see them in February. In fact, <Col N="1005" /> however, the increase in February was much less than anticipated and on a year on year basis there has been a decrease this February. I have heard the anecdotal evidence about prices rising but, by and large, it is not appearing in the CPI.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>People might say the CPI is not relevant, although I do not know how they can say so. The index covers food and beverages, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, tobacco, clothing and footwear, housing, water, electricity, gas, furnishings, household equipment, routine house maintenance, health, transport, communications, recreation and culture, education, restaurants and hotels, and miscellaneous goods. Therefore, as well as covering many items, the index is both comprehensive and professional as opposed to some other surveys that might be quoted from time to time. No other survey is as comprehensive as the CPI which is the only one upon which we can act.</P>
      <P>In the last budget the Government raised social welfare payments in most cases by around twice the rate of inflation. Given the fact that inflation is ear-marked to be in the region of 4.2% and most of the increases in social welfare have been at least double that, with significant real increases, anyone on social welfare is well cushioned against any fluctuations that may take place. Given what has occurred in the first two months of this year, however, all the indications are that the projected inflation rate of 4.2% will be reached by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&ndash;The Minister shall report to both Houses of the Oireachtas on a proposal that social welfare increases shall not be taken into account for income assessment purposes in medical card applications.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment tries to relate what happens in social welfare increases to income assessment across all Departments. The previous amendment related primarily to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment whose role it is to examine price rises. One of the criticisms the Labour Party makes of this Government as it literally reaches its final days, is that it did not put in place a poverty proofing system across all <Col N="1006" /> Departments. The national anti-poverty strategy contains a commitment to have a national inclusion office in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The reality, however, is that no such system of poverty proofing has been put in place across all Departments. The background budget briefing and the budget speech of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, demonstrated that his civil servants carried out a cursory poverty proofing of budget 2002, which ran to a couple of pages. It did not deal with key issues and missed some fundamental ones.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to try to avoid the unbelievable situation that existed in the early months of this year whereby social welfare benefit increases took a number of citizens over the new limits for medical cards. That left them in a vulnerable situation and cancelled out the advances made by the budget. People aged 66 or 67 were fearful of losing their medical cards and had they done so they would have been worse off as a result of the budget. The Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, have failed to create a Government-wide system of poverty proofing. I hope the next Government will take a strong line on this matter by insisting that we will not have such anomalies between Departments, local authorities and health boards.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 simply requests that a report be produced to ensure, in respect of future budgets, that we will never again end up creating the kind of fear witnessed on the six o'clock television news a number of weeks ago among senior citizens from the south side of Dublin and other areas. These people were distraught at the incompetence of the Government in not ensuring that the budget, particularly the aspects of it relating to social welfare, was poverty-proofed. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 26 in my name is similar to that of Deputy Broughan in terms of seeking to bring about the type of &ldquo;joined-up&rdquo; Government to which the Minister referred earlier. The Minister seemed to suggest on Committee Stage that the issue of income eligibility for medical cards emerged at health board level and had nothing to do with the Government. That is false, it had everything to do with the Government. I accept that responsibility did not lie with the Minister's Department, but it did lie with the Department of Health and Children. I wish to refer to a publication entitled Relate issued by Comhairle, an independent arm of the Department which produces excellent publications. In the last section of the document in question, which deals with medical card income guidelines as a result of the budget, it is stated that in practice, the chief executive officers of health boards, in consultation with the Department of Health and Children, draw up income guidelines each year. It is clear there was no consultation and that someone did not get the message.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1007" />The Minister tried to side-step this matter on Committee Stage, when I provided direct evidence supplied to me by a south inner city partnership which brought the matter to my attention in the first month of this year, by suggesting that these things did not happen. I pointed out, however, that it did happen, that someone got their wires crossed and failed to inform the health boards concerned that, in some cases, the new social welfare increases would put people over the income threshold for medical cards.</P>
    <P>I wish to provide two examples. The first of these involves people aged 66 to 69 on old age contributory pension. Since 1 January their payments have risen to &euro;147.30, but the income limit for a single person living alone is &euro;144. As a result, people did not qualify. The second example involves widows and widowers aged 66 to 69, in respect of whom there is a difference of &euro;80 between their payments and the income guidelines drawn up by the Department of Health and Children and the relevant health boards. The idea that this matter has nothing to do with central Government and that the health boards got it completely wrong is false.</P>
    <P>There are examples, both in respect of the budget and the Bill before us of instances where people have lost out and will lose out this year. I pointed out in the debate on the Finance Bill that there were difficulties with the home carers tax credit. Under this measure spouses are entitled to work on a part-time basis and earn up to a particular amount each year. If they break this threshold, they lose part if not all the credit relating to their husbands' tax credits. Here we have an example where increases in social welfare payments have not been matched by an increase in the level of eligibility for the credit. The Minister for Finance voted down such a change two weeks ago when we debated this matter in the Finance Bill. There are classic cases involving the Departments of Finance and Health and Children where people are clearly not reading the literature provided by the Minister's Department or not paying attention to his input to the budget.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Broughan there is a clear argument in favour of bringing together Departments to resolve these problems and anomalies. The difficulties I have described, which were caused by the income thresholds set by health boards in consultation with the Department of Health and Children, existed. They were not figments of people's imaginations. It is clear that central Government made a mess of matters in the first two months of the year. I understand it took a Cabinet meeting to resolve this matter. After that meeting, a memorandum was sent to all health boards and the issue was ironed out.</P>
    <P>The difficulties to which I refer should not have arisen. If our amendments are accepted, there will not be a recurrence of these difficulties and, in addition, we will ensure that &ldquo;joined-up&rdquo; Government becomes a reality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If the parties represented by the two Members opposite return to Government, this will probably not happen again. We are discussing this issue because the Government, unlike Administrations of which their parties were members, has provided social welfare increases at a rate twice that of inflation. If we had given the normal increases, the medical card guidelines would not have had to be changed because the rates would only have gone up by the rate of inflation at the maximum.</P>
      <P>Cognisance should be taken of the fact that we have increased social welfare payments in the past two years by more than the rate of inflation, particularly considering people's eligibility for medical cards. This is the reason that, in this year's and last year's negotiations on social welfare increases, it was indicated by my officials and me and agreed by the Ministers for Health and Children and Finance that no one would lose out on their entitlement to a medical card as a result of the record increases in social welfare payments. Unfortunately, certain people in the media went off on a tangent without checking the facts and I am conscious that concerns arose among elderly people as a result. Subsequently, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, issued a statement to allay their fears.</P>
      <P>To date, in my personal capacity as a public representative and as Minister, I have not encountered a person who has lost their entitlement to a medical card solely as a result of the record increases in social welfare payments. I am not sure if the Department of Health and Children was contacted by people so affected but if it was, matters would have been put right immediately. There was &ldquo;joined-up&rdquo; Government in this instance because a decision was made that no one should lose out on their eligibility to a medical card as a result of the record increases in social welfare payments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&ndash;The Minister shall report to both Houses of the Oireachtas on a proposal that social welfare increases shall not be taken into account for income assessment purposes in assessing local authority differential rents.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, which is similar to amendment No. 4, seeks to take social welfare increases out of the equation when calculating increases in local authority rents. The Minister inquired about matters which have come to our attention in respect of medical cards. In the area we are now discussing, a number of cases have come to my attention where people feel they have been <Col N="1009" /> placed at a disadvantage. I refer, for example, to a lone parent who has a job, works hard and qualifies for family income supplement, FIS. This woman was assessed on her additional income and discovered she would be better off not working because her local authority rent has skyrocketed since her family income supplement increased.</P>
    <P>The local authority of which I am a member adheres to the 15% rule. However, it is easy to place families in a poverty trap where it becomes incumbent on the parents to consider whether it is worthwhile to continue working when their social welfare benefits are taken into account in relation to their rent assessment. I accept the Minister addressed this matter on Committee Stage. However, the major local authorities do not appear to have developed a uniform system of assessment. This means some families are particularly vulnerable. Those who have the initiative to go to work, to the extent they are permitted, are less well off when their local authority rent soars. I ask the Minister to examine this again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on Committee Stage &ndash; the Deputy also referred to it &ndash; there is a general guideline for local authorities that no more than 15% of any increase in pension income should be absorbed by an increase in rent. I understand that works fairly uniformly throughout the local authorities. I also referred to the issue of differential rents, which represent less than 11% of social welfare payments. This arises because of the record increases in social welfare payments. At one time, people complained that all of their social welfare increases were taken by the local authority but, thankfully, as a result of the change in timing, in particular, it is not now as acute and there is an effort to ensure people receive as much as possible of the benefit of their social welfare increases.</P>
      <P>In relation to FIS, as Deputies who are members of local authorities will know, with some exceptions, differential rents have to take account of virtually all income. If one starts excluding some income, where does one draw the line? The differential rents scheme is fair in that it discriminates in favour of the less well off. My Department maintains relatively close contact with the Department of the Environment and Local Government on this matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;2.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of introducing a system of benchmarking or indexation of all social welfare payments and benefits as <Col N="1010" /> advocated by the Final Report of the Social Welfare Benchmarking and Indexation Group.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is an old chestnut. We have raised it many times at Question Time and on Committee Stages of previous social welfare Bills. The Minister referred earlier to Father Seán Healy's praise of aspects of the review of the NAPS. CORI has been trying to promote a fundamental programme to the Minister, throughout the period of this Government, in relation to providing a decent basic income for every citizen. However, the method by which Father Healy and CORI wanted to pursue that laudable ambition would be subject to reservations by many economists. Nonetheless, the Minister and the Taoiseach indicated that we would have a Green Paper on basic income provision and I understood that was to lead to a White Paper and to legislation in that area to guarantee a basic income for every citizen. There have been major increases, due to the work of the voluntary sector and the trade union movement, in particular, in child benefit in recent years, which I believe the next Government will carry on. This Government reluctantly embarked on this course and then made a virtue of necessity in relation to those increases in child benefit. However, we have the beginnings of a viable basis to provide that every Irish child will have a reasonable income.</P>
    <P>On the broader income front, the Minister is passing out of office without making a fundamental commitment. He took the basic income idea and, like a good rugby half back, kicked it into the stand every time it came into his hands because it was too hot to handle and he was unwilling to make commitments for future years. My party has made fundamental commitments to the elimination of poverty, as the Minister will see if he watches the television broadcast of our national conference on Saturday. I also commend Fine Gael on its document published yesterday, indicating a fundamental commitment from that party. This side of the House is about to run with the ball on this occasion and to make an absolute commitment on the issue of basic income.</P>
    <P>In relation to the report referred to in amendment No. 6, it is disappointing that the Minister did not immediately accept the report in full rather than simply referring obliquely to it through the NAPS report. At the social affairs committee, officials from the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment stated their opposition to the concept of a basic income for every citizen. Despite Father Healy' s recent comments, the Minister has refused, over his five years in office, to address this basic issue. This amendment simply asks him to look at it one last time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to go over the same ground we covered earlier in this debate. The conclusion of the final report of the Social Welfare Benchmarking and Indexation Group on raising the lowest rate of social welfare to 30% of <Col N="1011" /> gross average industrial earnings by 2007 is not the same as the Government's proposal in the NAPS. No matter what the Minister may say in that regard, there is no commitment to update that every year in line with the increase in industrial earnings. The Minister's clever device, in relation to the &euro;150 in 2002 terms, was simply to get him over a problem with the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It is clearly not the same as what came out of the final report on benchmarking which I acknowledge represents some progress. Until the Minister makes that commitment, nothing substantial will be done on the relative poverty issue. I have acknowledged repeatedly that this and the previous Government have made great strides on the issue of consistent poverty. We should be proud of that but the next great challenge for Governments, over the next five to ten years, is to deal with the issue of relative income poverty. I accept it is a very difficult matter to establish at a time when wages are increasing by 6% to 10% and upwards but we must commit to it and achieve it in the coming years. The key recommendation in the report of the Social Welfare Benchmarking and Indexation Group is fundamental to that.</P>

      <P>Those parties set up all kinds of things but in the final analysis they gave only £1.80 to old age pensioners. They are in no position to lecture me in that regard. In relation to benchmarking, Deputy Hayes suggested that our commitment to the &euro;150 in 2002 terms by the year 2007 is not the same as 30% but Father Seán Healy thinks it is and has said so in the article to which I referred earlier. He seems to be satisfied with the commitments that are made and to which we will be holding whatever parties are in Government after the next election. The commitment in relation to a cash amount is more significant than percentages because it is quite possible that average industrial earnings will not increase as dramatically as heretofore and yet &euro;150 is a figure which, by all objective analysis, will be an extremely difficult target to reach.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare a report for both Houses of the Oireachtas on the implications of having the same commencement date for child benefit increases as for all other increases in benefits and assistance rates.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The payment date for the increases in child benefit became a very controversial issue for the Government. Many Deputies, including some Government Members, believed that the benefit was due to start a month earlier than is the case. The increases will probably come through around the time of the general election but there appeared to be widespread confusion in the House and among the media about the exact starting date.</P>
      <P>Given the massive resources that the Minister enjoyed over the past five years it is unlikely that there will ever again be a Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs who will enjoy growth rates of 10% per annum in real terms in a remarkably performing economy and who will have such massive resources to give out. The position could have been reached where all social welfare payments could have been brought back to January. The Minister could have set himself that target but he decided, or it was probably decided for him by the Minister for Finance as usual, that he would not spend the extra £70 or £80 million leading to a situation where a major benefit, the income of our children, is being paid five months after the general range of benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment before us seeks to make a report on the implications of bringing all social welfare benefits and pensions into line with income and tax changes on 1 January every year. The Minister has failed to increase the income of a very important group of citizens at the same <Col N="1013" /> time as others are getting their increases. I urge the Minister to look at this area again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will speak on amendments Nos. 8 and 27. In 1997, the Minister and his party criticised the rainbow Government for letting public spending get out of control. It was said that the Government had overshot spending in that year by £600 million of taxpayers' money. This is the man who criticised the Government for the modest increases in social welfare payments that year, to which he objected because he was totally opposed to overshooting public expenditure by £600 million in that year. That is in the record.</P>
      <P>The widespread confusion to which Deputy Broughan referred is largely due to the fact that the Government deliberately misled the House last December when the Budget Statement was being announced and when we had the short social welfare Bill. The Minister said then that the effective date of payment for child benefit would go from September in 1997 to April in 2002, the earliest date on which it is administratively possible to introduce these increases. Subsequently, the Minister said on Committee Stage of the Bill that the payment would not be made until 1 April and that was dictated by the budget. There was no reference in the budget to the payments coming in May, which we now know will happen. There are legitimate questions to be asked regarding this. On this matter, as in the Minister's St. Valentine's Day love-bombing, which he bestowed on some social welfare recipients, the Minister is deliberately stymieing the introduction of child benefit increases to ensure they coincide with the general election. The back-dated payments for April and May will be paid on the first Tuesday in May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the Minister has a problem regarding child benefit payments. As I understand it, the payments go from May to June in the administrative year but there is nothing to prevent the Minister from paying the increased additional amount on the first Tuesday of April, given the fact that the Bill will be through this House by the end of this week. There is no difficulty in that whatsoever, but the Minister is not doing that; he is giving the additional amounts in May, surprise, surprise, which will probably be a week or so before the general election. If ever there was pure exploitation of public funds, this is it. If the Minister were to be consistent with what he told the House in December, why would he oppose amendment No. 8, given the fact that I am asking that the word &ldquo;effective&rdquo; be inserted in to the Bill? This is the effective date, but of course it is not going to be the effective date, it will be the general election date, the cynical date the Minster has selected in conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, in order to love-bomb us a second time. The people will not be conned by that trick and if the Minister were really serious about making increased payments at the earliest possible time administratively, he could do so on the first Tuesday of April. That <Col N="1014" /> can still happen if the Minister accepts my amendment.</P>

      <P>It is galling to listen to Deputies criticising me and the Government on the issue in regard to the payment of child benefit when they presided over a situation where minuscule child benefit increases of £1.00 in 1997 were announced as being granted in December but were not delivered until September the following year. The Government has progressively brought back the child benefit increases from June of 2001 to April at a cost of £70 million.</P>
      <P>The Deputies ask why I do not bring all payment increases back to January and have a report to the Dáil on the implications. It would cost an extra &euro;103 million, not a sum one could sneeze at and that is the reason it was not brought back in one fell swoop. It is very illustrative to see what is now going out on child benefit. The figure is £1.14 billion, &euro;1.44 billion, in 2002 as opposed to £398 million. There have been huge increases over the lifetime of the Government and I do not see how the Deputies can criticise it in relation to child benefit. The timing of the payment is dictated by the capacity of the production process and other demands which must be met at this time. Since budget day we have been working flat out to meet the additional demands arising from the earlier implementation of the budget increases. There are many such increases, including child benefit, family income supplement and old age pension.</P>
      <P>In relation to child benefit arrears from early March to 26 April, payable in May, 380,000 single vouchers are needed. To facilitate the production of renewals and single vouchers, the supplier has been working overtime every weekend since the start of the year and it will be necessary to continue working overtime to enable production of the single voucher in time for May. I assure the Deputies that we looked at this high up and low down in terms of when it could be delivered.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the need to extend the free telephone allowance to elderly persons living in nursing homes, either for a fixed line or a mobile phone, particularly in cases where the allowance was previously obtained.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am very determined that we address this issue. There was a good exchange of views on the matter on Committee Stage between the Opposition and the Minister. It is nit-picking in the extreme that people living in nursing homes cannot get the free telephone allowance. I do not accept that for the past five or even 15 years we could not work out an administrative system whereby elderly people living in nursing homes, in rooms with their own telephone lines, could not get an allowance for either a direct phone or a mobile phone. The matter is made worse when we consider that elderly people who have this allowance lose it once they go to a nursing home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as I do that the demographic predictions for the next ten to 15 years show an additional 600,000 people over the age of 65. We will have to cater for an additional number of people moving into nursing homes, both publicly and privately funded, and this issue has to be addressed today. I ask the Minister to do that and to provide this allowance to elderly people in circumstances such as those described. The phone, be it mobile or otherwise, is a link. Just because someone is living in an environment with 30 or 40 other elderly people does not mean the allowance they had in their private home should not be extended to their new place of residence. I have received a large mailbag on this issue and people feel let down by the fact that a new administrative arrangement has not been worked out which would allow people this very small allowance, particularly as many of those who go into nursing homes had it previously. <Col N="1016" /> There are huge benefits to extending this measure. As the Minister knows, I am a great advocate of free schemes and I congratulate him for the extensions he has made in many areas, but an extension in this area would allow elderly people to stay connected to their wider family and friends and we should not discriminate against them by failing to recognise that in the social welfare code.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support Deputy Brian Hayes. Like him and, probably, the Minister, I have received a lot of representations about this. People who enjoy the telephone allowance find that when they come to live in a nursing home it is arbitrarily cut off. We had the debate before in relation to household benefit and it seemed at one point the Minister was preparing to change fundamentally the whole nature of the free schemes. He has made some fundamental changes by putting them into the social insurance fund and by talking in terms of a household benefit <i>per se</i>. One of the few advantages of that approach would be that citizens in exactly the circumstances Deputy Brian Hayes talks about &ndash; citizens who wrote to him and me, and probably to the Minister and his officials &ndash; who rightly feel very hard done by at the loss of what is a very small telephone allowance, would receive it.</P>
      <P>This is something the Minister should look at again as, undoubtedly, a future Government will, particularly given the circumstances of seniors living away from their former family homes who feel isolated and want to keep in touch with friends and family. The Minister has had the opportunity to introduce an innovative approach, but sadly it has not been taken up and those citizens who made strong representations to the Department before Christmas are very disappointed. I commend the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Many innovative changes have been made by the Government, none better than the decision to provide the free schemes to people over 70. This issue has been around for some time and it is one we looked at carefully to see if there was a possibility of extending the scheme. The way forward is to include mobile phones in the free telephone rental scheme, but that is easier said than done. There are major issues regarding mobile phone contracts and licences and the marrying of the existing scheme with mobile phones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moves are being made in my Department and my officials are looking at the whole issue, but that is for another day as the Deputies will agree. The original objective of the telephone allowance was to provide an element of protection and security for elderly people and the disabled who live alone or with people who are unable to summon help in the case of an emergency. We all remember that was one of the conditions for eligibility for the allowance. By and large, the latter condition is no longer there because people over the age of 70 are entitled to the allowance. When <Col N="1017" /> people go into a nursing home they receive daily support and have daily contact with staff and other residents. They are in receipt of other State support through nursing home subventions and the public health system, and the view in the Department is that the extension of the telephone rental allowance scheme to them does not fit easily with the scheme's objectives in that it does not provide an element of personal security.</P>
    <P>There is also the issue of control of phones. If there are 40 people with 40 telephones in the residence and the telephone rental is available to each, there is the question of access to the telephone and who can use it. These issues have been raised in the Department in the context of the availability of free telephone rental for such telephones. Again, while there might be a willingness to extend this to people in the nursing home <i>per se</i>, there are issues which need to be addressed. I like to think they would be addressed in the context of the broader extension of the free telephone rental scheme in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, like the others, seeks a report on the issue. Therefore, in accepting the amendment the Minister would not be doing anything radical. It does not incur expense on the State at this time but simply <Col N="1018" /> moves the issue forward in the context of this legislation. The Minister also made the argument about mobile telephone licences. He has a point, it is difficult. However, another scheme operated by his Department, the extension of the free travel pass to include private bus operators, is an example of the Department dealing with that dilemma. The scheme was extended to private bus operators on designated routes so that elderly people are now carried on those routes free of charge. With the right application, therefore, the Minister can overcome the problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about 40 different telephones and said there would be issues in regard to access to them. I have visited a number of nursing homes in my constituency. The people in single rooms already have individual telephones. There should be no difficulty working out a scheme which could save the Department money in the long run because it would not have to pay the same rental for all the telephones. It can be done with the right will. I will press the amendment. It is only right that we should speak up for people in these situations. They feel aggrieved, particularly those who had it and lost it. It is only right to put the amendment to a vote.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;3.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report in relation to increasing the weekly allowance to those seeking asylum in this country.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment asks the Minister to bring forward a report on the issue of the weekly allowance to those seeking asylum. As the Minister will be aware, the committee has discussed this matter for a number of years. I raised it in the last two Social Welfare Bills. I ask the Minister to expedite the long overdue report from his Department on this matter. While those seeking asylum in this country are entitled to child benefit and other supplementary assistance when they present to a local welfare officer, the basic rate needs to be increased radically. The Minister is aware that the working group he established has long gone beyond the point of making a recommendation. Therefore, the objective of this amendment is to come to a conclusion in respect of those matters and create a new and more appropriate rate for people in the circumstances I mentioned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has gone a considerable way in respect of bringing the contributory widow's pension up to the same level as the contributory old age pension. Will he inform the House of the total cost to the Exchequer of making that final leap? I think there is a difference of just over &euro;3 between both schemes. I am aware the Minister made significant progress this year but in terms of a policy issue, widows and their late spouses have contributed through the PRSI system. The contributory old age pension, which is the largest amount of money that can be paid in any of the schemes operated by the Minister's Department, <Col N="1021" /> is the appropriate rate of payment for widows in this category.</P>
    <P>While I recognise that a significant increase has helped to bridge the gap, a small amount more would make the gap even smaller. Will the Minister state in his reply the cost to the Exchequer if we were to make this commitment?</P>

      <P>In line with the objective outlined in budget 2001, we said we would bring the level of payments to recipients of widow's and widower's contributory pension aged 66 and over up to the level of the old age contributory pension. In the last two budgets, we brought that forward progressively. We are short of the old age contributory pension rate by &euro;2.50, £1.97. It would cost approximately &euro;9 million, £7 million, to equalise the two rates.</P>

      <P>It is a good scheme which operates over three years to get people back to work. It encourages them to get back to work so they will not lose any of their secondary benefits. I am aware that in the small print concerning these secondary benefits, there is a clause stating that if one's income goes over £250, or whatever the equivalent is in euro, per week, one loses these benefits. The anomaly lies in the following observation. The £250 income threshold is in no way related to family size. Therefore, in terms of the back to work allowance scheme, one with five children can be marginally over the £250 threshold and lose the fuel allowance whereas a couple with no children on £250 can retain their benefits. The problem is that on the issue of the secondary benefits and the existing income threshold, no differentiation is made on the basis of family size. I ask the Minister to address this in the context of this amendment.</P>

Obviously, if we are to make additional changes, they will have budgetary implications, but those two changes have ameliorated the problems to some extent in terms of larger families.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;3.&ndash;The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the introduction of a non-means tested carer's allowance.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment asks the Minister to report, for the final time, on the introduction of a non-means tested carer's allowance. In recent years there have been improvements in the disregard for carer's allowance, both for a single person and a married couple. However, the promise made to carers by the Taoiseach to bring the disregard for a married couple up to the level of the average industrial wage has not been honoured. The promise was made to a meeting of carers in Limerick by Deputies Willie O'Dea and Eddie Wade. The Government will leave office after the general election having failed to fulfil this fundamental promise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1023" />It is the intention of the Labour Party, if it participates in the next Government, to abolish the means test for carer's allowance. This is one of the six key pledges we have made to the public. We will replace the carer's allowance with a carer's payment, paid solely on the basis of need, to full-time carers. People who give care 24 hours a day seven days a week have a right to payment from the Government for work done at home. This should be a cast iron commitment. The Government is about to end and it has not addressed this question.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 23 seeks to address the rule that one may not be in receipt of more than one social welfare benefit. Although there are exceptions to that rule it pertains in general. Widows and lone parents often come to public representatives and express great bitterness because they cannot obtain even a portion of the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will say he has addressed these issues but the reaction of carers makes it clear that they do not feel he has met their needs. Candidates are preparing to stand in the general election on this issue and a leader of carers in Limerick is directing the campaign.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will seek to address this issue if it is in Government after the election. I am aware of the cost factor and the Labour Party has addressed this in our policy document. The Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention to the expenditure on carer's allowance over the years. This increase has been a major development and the C&amp;AG clearly anticipates a time when a future Government will deliver for all carers. A 1998 report by the Minister's Department said there are 50,000 carers, of whom 20,000 receive a carer's allowance. Voluntary bodies such as Care Alliance Ireland and NAMHI estimate there are 120,000 carers.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to report on the means test for carer's allowance and on the rule that people in receipt of another social welfare benefit cannot receive carer's allowance. These are two of the most pressing problems for carers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this Government will be passing away and with regard to the Labour Party being part of the next Government the old adage, &ldquo;Hope springs eternal&rdquo;, comes to mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any objective analysis of the record of this Minister will show that all the major improvements in carer's allowance have been made in my time as Minister and this Government's term of office. The expenditure on carer's allowance has gone from &euro;38 million to approximately &euro;120 million in five years. When I came to office 9,000 carers were in receipt of carer's allowance and when I leave office there will be approximately 23,500 in receipt of the allowance. They will all <Col N="1024" /> receive the free schemes and they will also receive a substantial respite care grant, neither of which was the case when I came to office.</P>
    <P>I have always said the carer's allowance on its own is not sufficient for people who are caring for people in the home. I query the Labour Party's position which is akin to their abolition of third level fees. I am surprised that a party which espouses socialist ideals would abolish a means test so that people who do not need the allowance can get the same amount of money&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>People who are well able to afford to look after a relative will be entitled to exactly the same amount as someone who is relying on a very small income, perhaps a social welfare payment. That is not fair or right. Whatever money is available should be directed towards people who most need it and not to millionaires or people with incomes of £100,000. The more an allowance is spread throughout the population the less one can direct at the less well-off. That is not to diminish the difficulties even a millionaire might have in looking after a relative. However, this is income support, supplied by the State. I do not see how someone can justify paying the same amount to someone at the bottom of the income scale as to someone at the top. I find it difficult to understand how a party such as Deputy Broughan's, which espouses the ideals of socialism, could do this.</P>

      <P>Apart from the changes we made in the carer's allowance we made a commitment over time to raise the means disregard until the payment was equal to average industrial earnings. The allowance is not far from that as it stands. If we are given the chance after the next election I hope we will continue on that road.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of who is in office after the next election I hope the Departments of Health and Children and Social, Community and Family Affairs will continue to examine the possibility of marrying the carer's allowance with the nursing home subvention and the home help scheme to provide a unified system which will take account of people's individual circumstances with regard to income, degree of disability and level of care required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>May I direct the Minister away from the millionaires to those in need of carer's allowance? I recognise the great work that has been done in regard to the allowance during his term in office, but there are more carers now than there were five years ago. Elderly people and others in need of care have a greater desire to stay in their homes than they had previously because of overcrowding in hospitals and so on. <Col N="1025" /> People are scared to go into institutional care and prefer to stay in their own homes.</P>
      <P>I refer to a carer who becomes a widow. The Minister will not be surprised that I mention this because I have raised it at every opportunity during his tenure and still have not had success in this regard. If a woman who cares full time for a doubly incontinent, bed ridden patient in her own home becomes a widow and continues to be a carer, she is disqualified from receiving carer's allowance as soon as she is in receipt of the widow's pension. There have not been 100 such cases in the past five years, yet the Minister has refused to heed my representations. His officials can afford to smile, but I will continue to press this issue because I have dealt with two such cases in my constituency over the past five years.</P>
      <P>In one case the woman concerned was in receipt of carer's allowance because her husband was a small farmer earning a meagre income. When he died, not alone was she disqualified from receiving carer's allowance because she was entitled to the widow's pension, she was put under more strain because she had to employ someone to do the farm work because she was a full-time carer. She cannot receive carer's allowance because the Minister refuses to allow a double social welfare payment.</P>
      <P>Provision should be made in the case of a carer who becomes a widow and continues to provide full-time care. I have asked the Minister to examine this issue, but he has blanked me thus far. I would like something to be done about this before he and I retire from the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a point regarding those who are better off. As Deputy McCormack rightly said, those who are not well off and earn less than the average industrial wage are badly treated in this regard. Even taking account of the new income disregards, the Minister still falls some way short of the average industrial wage in the provision of carer's allowance. He cannot honestly say he has addressed this and has certainly not achieved the average industrial wage despite a firm commitment from the Taoiseach that it would be reached.</P>
      <P>The key point, however, is if one is a full-time carer, one should receive payment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have received representations from Care Alliance Ireland, the Carer's Association and all the other wonderful representative associations and the fundamental point they make is unquestionable. If one is a full-time carer, one should receive a payment. People want recognition for their very important work in the health system where they look after carees in their own surroundings voluntarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's comment in regard to creating a partnership between carers, health <Col N="1026" /> boards and local health staff, but it is a recognition issue. No matter who one is, if one is doing the job, one should be fully recognised by the State. I acknowledge what the Minister said regarding a double social welfare payment. However, it would be incongruous if an individual who has a large pension or other earnings was in receipt of a full carer's allowance while somebody in receipt of a social welfare benefit received only a portion of the carer's allowance. It would be just if that person was in receipt of the full carer's allowance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I differ with Deputy Broughan on this point. If a Minister has a pot of money available to him or her, it is fairer and more equitable if the money is allocated to those less likely to generate a weekly income or who care for somebody in their homes. If one has money, one should concentrate on giving more to those less well off rather than dispersing it throughout the general population, thereby giving money to some who do not necessarily need it and also providing them with an absolute right to it. This would also dilute the money available to those in need of care.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy McCormack for his comments on the changes that have been made. I accept there will be an ever increasing number of carers and carees. We tend to forget there are carees who need significant assistance when we debate the issue of carers. Moves are being made to marry the various State aids, both financial and otherwise. When a needs assessment is conducted, various issues are thrown up.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue of double payments, the social welfare system is not designed to pay somebody to look after somebody else. It aims to provide a low income for those least well off in society. To a certain extent, many of the issues raised by Deputy McCormack are more appropriate to the Department of Health and Children. That is the reason we are working in partnership with that Department.</P>
      <P>On the issue of income disregards, a couple with two children earning a joint income of &euro;28,600 or an individual earning &euro;23,600 can qualify for the minimum carer's allowance and the attendant free schemes. We are substantially on the way to achieving the average industrial wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person with an income of &euro;23,600 can qualify for carer's allowance, why can a widow with an income of one tenth of that not qualify for the allowance? I cannot understand the logic behind this. I accept it is not the practice to make two social welfare payments, but there is nothing written in stone. The only change I seek is that in the case of a carer who becomes a widow, she should be eligible for carer's allowance because she continues to be a full-time <Col N="1027" /> carer. I do not know how much the widow's pension is annually, but it is much less than &euro;23,600. I seek carer's allowance for full-time carers, who are the most deprived in our community, not for millionaires and others who are well off.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage, I asked the Minister to consider this area again. Deputies receive ongoing complaints from widows with young and teenage children that despite the improvements in pension benefits in recent years, they still find it difficult to make ends meet. I am asking for the extension of the free schemes. On a number of occasions, the Minister has pointed out the difficulty of distinguishing between the different types of single parent families. However, widows suffer the trauma of the death of a partner and then have to raise a family with very little support from the State. I accept the Minister has introduced the widowed person's grant and the bereavement allowance, but there is still a feeling of dissatisfaction that we hear at our clinics, especially from widows with young children who feel the State should be more supportive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. The argument I make in favour of extending the free schemes to widows and widowers is that in the main they are people who have paid into a social insurance scheme. This is an unexpected event that happens in their lives and the State should help them by giving additional support. The free schemes are already in place, they work and they are effective. As a secondary benefit they can be targeted at people in very difficult circumstances. No new structures need to be put in place and these are schemes that have a track record over 20 to 30 years. More than three and a half years ago, my party tabled a specific motion at plenary session in the Dáil on this idea and the Government rejected it. This can work and would be cost effective. For instance, if a man tragically dies at 50 years of age having paid into the social insurance fund for more than 30 years, his wife and children are left without any support from the State. The argument can be made purely on the basis that these people are contributing into <Col N="1028" /> a social insurance fund and if they cannot avail of that fund when unexpected events occur, when can they avail of it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned earlier, I have sympathy for people in such circumstances. During my time as Minister, I have considered many ways to give additional assistance to widows, which is why we agreed to raise the widow's pension for people over 66 to the level of the old age contributory pension and we are very close to succeeding in that regard. I also introduced the increased bereavement grant and the widowed parent grant. We examined the issue of the free schemes last year and there were fairly serious equity issues concerning the treatment of different categories of one parent families. The difficulty is that we would be extending the free scheme to a huge number of people who would not previously have been considered. The free schemes have generally assisted elderly people over 66. An exception was made for widows between 60 and 66 whose spouses qualified for it before they died. With that exception and the exception of people with disability, the free schemes tend to apply to people over 66. This matter will be considered again, but there are serious policy issues that cannot be easily overcome.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue was also discussed on Committee Stage. I ask the Minister to consider this in the short time available to him. Whoever is framing next year's Social Welfare Bill should try to make progress in this area. The Minister can take credit for the introduction of the widowed parent grant. <Col N="1029" /> It has been brought to my attention, both in my constituency and by colleagues, that where people apply for the bereavement grant, they do not automatically get the widowed parent grant. It was increased substantially in this year's budget and we all welcomed that. However, there needs to be a more user-friendly way of drawing down both schemes at the same time.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister said one regional office of his Department runs the bereavement grant and another runs the widowed parent grant. I ask the Minister to consider marrying both grants to avoid people not being aware of one or other grant. Information I received in a reply to a parliamentary question shows that since the scheme was introduced in April 2000, the Minister and the Department have attempted to inform people about it. There were 862 payments in 2000, 1,208 in 2001 and 80 payments already in 2002. However, I believe there are more than 1,208 widowed parents with dependent children in the country. I do not believe all of them are getting this new grant. It is a significant payment since the budget increase.</P>

      <P>In page 6, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of introducing a new infancy payment to cover the considerable capital and other costs associated with the birth of a child.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to a proposal my party made in regard to an infancy payment, particularly on the birth of the first child. We believe the State should make some contribution towards the excessive capital costs associated with the birth of a child. While child benefit has increased in recent years, no additional payment is made to parents on the birth of a first child. This is something which should be considered. A number of eminent sociologists produced a report last year suggesting that in the first six months of a child's life parents must provide in excess of £3,500 on capital costs alone. The State needs to recognise this fact in terms of a payment at birth.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 29 relates to the old chestnut of the different rates of child dependant allowance, of which there are three. It is incongruous in this day and age to give a dependent child of a widow &euro;19 and a dependent child of an unemployed person a different rate. The differentiation needs to be ironed out. We have moved progressively from 13 rates approximately 15 years ago. However, we need to rationalise the existing child dependant allowance primarily because it is still the only payment which can be targeted for very low income people. Child benefit increases in the main are a very important attempt to take children out of poverty. However, child dependant allowances should be targeted even more at people on very low incomes. The three existing rates need to be rationalised because it is unacceptable in this day and age that they exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 31 relates to the child dependant allowance to children up to 22 years of age in full-time education. There was some attempt in the budget to give child dependant allowance to children over 18 years who wish to complete their secondary school education. There was a commitment in this regard under the PPF <Col N="1031" /> which involves very small amounts of money. The Government was wrong not to have delivered fully on the commitment in the budget. I am aware the PPF has another year to run but surely it would not break the bank if the Government were to go the extra mile on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments. Deputy Hayes's point in regard to amendment No. 28 is well made. I know he has had some recent personal experience in the area so the issue is obviously close to home. We are all familiar with low income families who on the birth of a child try to access whatever supplementary benefit is available through the local director of community welfare. They usually receive an amount equal to the cost of a pram and some other basic necessities for a young child. The system should be rationalised so that there is a special payment on the birth of a child, as is the case in France and other EU countries.</P>
      <P>We discussed amendment No. 29 at length on Committee Stage and during other Social Welfare Bills, as did the Acting Chairman when she was spokesperson on this whole area. Perhaps during the next round of child benefit increases additional resources will be targeted at low income families. The child dependant allowance is one of the best methods that can be pursued in that regard. Governments of all hues have made a decision in regard to child benefit. Perhaps when the current three year child benefit programme has run its course we will consider rationalising child dependant allowances into a single higher allowance. I also support amendment No. 31.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We considered the issue of infancy payments in recent years. However, given the major commitment in regard to increases in child benefit, it was felt that providing major increases over a three year period, two of which are almost implemented, would be a significant input into the cost of child rearing. I accept other countries have an infancy payment. We have something similar following multiple births but not in regard to other births. Perhaps the issue could be considered when the current round of child benefit increases next year. There is a commitment to an increase in child benefit during the lifetime of the national anti-poverty strategy review which is up to 2007. There is a significant additional cost over and above the cost already indicated in the three year plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the rationalisation of child dependant allowance, it was agreed by the previous Government and by me that it would be better to put whatever resources are available into child benefit because there was no incentive to work or indeed to get married in providing money by way of child benefit. However, the loss of child <Col N="1032" /> dependant allowance for anyone taking up work or getting married would have significant implications, particularly for people who are less well off. The rationale to continue to fund child support through the route of child benefit is more realistic in assisting children out of poverty. Perhaps the issue could be looked at again when the current round is finished. The NAPS review extends the existing commitment to 2007.</P>
    <P>On child dependant allowance for children up to 22 years of age who are in full-time education, we have gone some way in this regard. I would like to think that in the next budget and before the PPF runs out the gap will be closed in that respect.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 8, after line 45, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.&ndash;The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the introduction of a parental leave benefit to be funded from the social insurance fund.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister on his final flurry through the House on social welfare issues of a key failure of his Administration to introduce parental leave benefit. This side of the House was very angry before Christmas when the social insurance fund was raided to balance the Government's books in a phoney and unfair way because citizens and workers had paid into the social insurance fund over many years. This was unfair action on the part of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. There was a great deal of scope before the end of this Administration to bring forward paid parental leave. It is the policy of the Labour Party as enunciated at our previous party conference in Cork city that, if we have any influence on the next Government, one of the first items on our agenda will be to bring forward paid parental leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions rightly criticised the previous budget for its failure to initiate a simple parental leave payment, even on the basis of a few days a year. The Minister has failed to do this. I have examined his record and I do not wish to be unfair to him. He will probably be remembered for the decision he took on pre-1953 contributions which was an important advance and for which he deserves commendation. However, he had the opportunity to come forward with another series of innovations, one of which would have been paid parental leave. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions and major trade union bodies in the public and private sec<Col N="1033" /> tors are upset that he did not deliver on this issue. The Taoiseach certainly gave some indications that he was going to do something about it, but the Minister's time has passed and, unfortunately, it will be up to the next Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>If a Government is genuinely concerned about family friendly policies, it must provide the money for them. While the law allows parents to take parental leave, no benefit attaches to it. If one's income is substantial, one can afford to take that leave, but people on modest incomes cannot. As Deputy Broughan rightly said, there must be a benefit through the social insurance fund to allow such people take parental leave.</P>
      <P>What is the current surplus in the social insurance fund after the raid of last December? There is scope in the fund for this initiative. The money belongs to employers and employees who put it into the fund. It is the very least they can demand at critical times. Issues such as the birth of a child, when a child is sick or when it is necessary to take extended time off work to be with a child should be central if we are concerned about family friendly policies.</P>
      <P>The phrase &ldquo;family friendly policies&rdquo; is often just a buzz word to indicate policies which mean nothing to people working and struggling to cope with rearing children and all its attendant difficulties. A modern economy which makes a contract with people must have at the centre of that contract flexibility in allowing parents time off to be with their children at various times in their lives. The way to do that is to have a State benefit and that should be funded through contributions to the social insurance fund. I agree with Deputy Broughan that we should have made much more progress on this. I accept parental leave can be taken, but unless benefit attaches to it, people on modest incomes will not be able to afford to take that time off work.</P>
      <P>We are going to have an issue in 15 years' time or so because of the increasing disincentives to having children brought about by the way the tax code has been administered and radically changed through tax individualisation by the Minister's colleague. One of the incentives we need to include in the social welfare code is this benefit which will provide some flexibility for parents who want to take time off work at various times in the development of their child or children. Unless there is some monetary value attached to that, it will not happen and the hassle and pressure in family life will continue to grow.</P>
      <P>It is one of the failures of the current Administration in this area. The Minister has not developed family friendly codes and he is responsible for family policy. This is the area in which he could have done most. Unfortunately, in five years he has not delivered in this area.</P>

      <P>Everyone is in favour of paid parental leave and it is not just a great Labour Party proposal. This has been the subject of intense deliberation by a working group set up under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and its report will be issued soon. It is true to say there was no agreement among any of the participants as to how this issue could be dealt with. I take it from what Deputies Broughan and Hayes said that they are in favour of a social welfare based payment, but there is a strong argument that parental leave should be paid by employers. Perhaps Deputy Broughan, who never appears to be in favour of the employers, should take up that cudgel and rather than placing the burden on the social insurance fund which exists for the rainy days and the time when&mdash;</P>

Perhaps it is better to insist on parental leave being paid by employers rather than it coming out of the social insurance fund. That has not been decided upon, so there are major policy decisions relating to this issue.</P>
      <P>On the point raised by Deputy McCormack, I understand there is the basic maternity benefit and, if employers want to pay additional money to their employees in that respect, that is a matter for them.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated his strong support for this type of amendment. He said we need to have comprehensive legislation in relation to registrations. It is an issue that comes up occasionally, particularly through an organisation called the Irish Adopted People's Association. There is a feeling, particularly among the older membership of the association, that they have an absolute right to their own identity, particularly in relation to medical matters and genetic-type disorders which people can only be aware of if they are aware of their ancestry. I accept their view that the right to one's identity is a fundamental human right.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment because of the significant reference to registration, amounting almost to a mini Bill, at the end of this Bill. It is something the House should address at some stage, particularly in light of the fact that in recent years Irish couples have adopted children from other parts of Europe and the wider world. Each of those children should have a fundamental right to go back to their native place, family and clan at some stage in their lives and find out exactly who they are.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 41:</P>
      <P>In page 20, to delete line 27 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) date and place of birth;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I thank the Irish Council of Genealogical Organisations which has given me a great deal of advice on these matters. They are very detailed and intricate matters and, as I said earlier, legislation in this area goes back to the 1840s and 1860s as the Minister is aware. There is quite an amount of tidying up to be done when the Bill comes before the House.</P>
      <P>What I refer to here are amendments to the death certificate register. I propose to insert the date and place of birth as well as marriage status, name and occupation of the person's spouse and I am asking the Minister to consider inserting a surname at birth of a married, widowed or divorced woman. I will set out why I think we should make those amendments to the death certificate register as outlined in Part V of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we link the birth and death certificates. Without having the date and place of birth on the death certificate we are making a difficult situation more confusing for people who wish to find out where they and their relations are from. I ask the Minister at this late stage to consider this amendment. It has been put to me by people who are working in genealogy that it is an important amendment, not only because it links the birth and death certificates and makes it easier for people to find the information they are looking for but also because this explicit refer<Col N="1038" /> ence exists in death certificates in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There could be an argument made about greater harmonisation between North and South and equally that we should be trying to achieve one registration regime throughout the island of Ireland in terms of genealogy. The Minister is well versed in North-South co-operation in his constituency and I put it to him that the insertion I am trying to make here is exactly the same insertion that is in the Northern Ireland registration Acts which go back to 1973. Most of our legislation goes back well before that.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the Vital Statistics and Birth, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act, 1952, parties to a marriage are required to record on the civil record of their marriage their dates of birth. In this they are not given an option. The Minister provides an option in the Schedule to this Bill. The option, as I understand it, is the date of birth or the age. That is not given in the 1952 Act where no option exists between date of birth or age.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendments Nos. 41, 42 and 43, at the moment if one wants to get a death certificate, one must attach the notification from the newspaper to the application. A widow must send a newspaper notice to the office in order to get the death certificate and I am aware of cases which have arisen where proof required swearing an oath that the said person is the spouse or next of kin and is entitled to the death certificate. Some clearing up needs to be done here. The Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations makes the argument that death registration in future should record a deceased person's place and date of birth and the surname at birth of a married, widowed or divorced woman. This is the only way to ensure that, in future, having searched the index, members of the public will be able to locate the record of death that they require. Returning to the Minister's earlier amendments, he argued for easier access. By putting more information in the death certificate, we will help people make those links along the way.</P>
    <P>Regarding the deceased's marital status, I am led to believe the proposed details to be recorded in future would cause nothing but confusion. Currently a deceased's marital status is recorded but this Bill proposes to record only the occupation of a deceased spouse. The occupation may be an important statistic for the Government but it is of vital public interest that death records clearly record whether the deceased was married, widowed or divorced. Given the changes that have occurred in society, I emphasise that this is updating existing law. I know the Minister's argument in this respect. He is putting in place a new public service number allowing easier access for his Department and all the Departments of State, which I welcome, but equally we must acknowledge that there are people trying to track down <Col N="1039" /> long lost family or friends who have a right to this information. We have to make it as user friendly and accessible as possible. We have to put the right information in the certificates to ensure there is a link from birth to death.</P>
    <P>The Minister has accepted amendment No. 45 concerning marital status but more needs to be done, even at this late stage. If the Minister undertakes to re-examine this matter in the Seanad I would be prepared to accept that. We are setting standards for the future and we have to get them right. It would have been better if the committee had hearings on this issue, but it could not do so because the Minister stitched it on at the end. I know why he did so and I am not opposing that but we should not rush this matter. If the Minister gives me a commitment to re-examine the arguments I have made in relation to amendments Nos. 41, 42 and 43 for the debate in the Seanad I will look upon that in a sympathetic way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We have looked at this matter and we received representations from the society. The view both from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Health and Children, under whose aegis the general registration office operates, was that the capture of the information relating to the date and place of birth of the deceased person and the surname at birth of the married, widowed or divorced woman is not necessary.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the experience in Northern Ireland but there they do not have the PPS number or universal identifier. Ultimately, the purpose of the PPS system is to ensure that all life events are linked, so to impose more requirements to link birth and death on one certificate would complicate the issue. That information will be readily available however because the PPS will link all the life events of a particular person. The advice to me is that that is not necessary.</P>
      <P>As regards the issue of marital status, that was an oversight on our behalf and we have agreed to accept amendment No. 45. The occupation of the deceased person as a parent or guardian is dealt with in amendment No. 46.</P>

      <P>Yes, changing &ldquo;parent&rdquo; to &ldquo;parents&rdquo;. As regards giving details of death, I am told that the Deputy is confusing a late registration of death which requires proof of death, such as a newspaper notice. It would not be required, in the normal course of events, to produce the notice from the paper.</P>

      <P>The PPS, the famous new number the Minister is introducing, is a welcome <Col N="1040" /> development but not everyone will have access to it. It will be accessible from the Minister's Department, every other Department and presumably also through the registrars. There is an inconsistency in the law, however, because of the distinction between Catholic and non-Catholic registrations. Am I right in saying that the PPS number will only apply to Departments?  </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I am making. Therefore, the new information I am trying to get on this will be of huge benefit to non-departmental people working in this area. Without access to computerisation, which the Minister's Department will have, and rightly so, it will be even more difficult. Other legal issues arise. I have been informed that some question marks have been raised about Irish death certificates which have a dubious international reputation because they lack an amount of detail contained on such certificates issued in other parts of the world. I am not sure how valid that claim is but it does not seem to be good international practice if Irish death certificates lack information that such certificates from other countries contain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's point on linking, which would be of benefit to genealogists, the system will be totally computerised and that will make the issue of following family trees easier than it has been up to now. Given that fact, there will be no need to complicate the issue of linking birth and death on one certificate. It is something that we will look at, however. We are trying to bring forward amendments that will allow us to roll out the system. I will look at this matter between now and the Seanad debate. To be honest, however, I cannot see how it can be accommodated in any other way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter because I have been contacted about it by many of my constituents in County Mayo. The high cost of insurance is a nationwide problem, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses. I have been inundated with letters from my constituents in recent weeks recounting one horror story after another regarding the high cost of insurance. In some instances, I was informed about companies which have been insuring businesses, some of which have never submitted claims, for many years, but which will not now issue them with a quote. The Small Firms Association is outraged by this and has made allegations that there is some form of collusion among insurance companies. I am disposed to agree with the association in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reports have been carried out and consultations have taken place with the affected groups. However, it is time the Government did something to protect small employers. A man in the town where I live who employs a number of people and whose insurance costs were quite reasonable until last year recently received a quote which will mean those costs will rise by 400%. Many other small employers are being treated in a similar manner. What will happen is <Col N="1044" /> that many of these employers will no longer be able to offer people work and unemployment will rise as a result.</P>
    <P>Action must be taken about the type of claims being made and the awards granted. The insurance companies will have to stop the practice of settling on the steps of the court and should be obliged to take matters before a judge. A register must be drawn up of those people who make a living out of making claims against businesses of all types. This type of behaviour can only be stopped if some action is taken in respect of the awards granted by the courts. Anybody who has a serious complaint or suffers a serious injury should be compensated. However, the cowboys making claims against businesses are creating problems.</P>
    <P>The talk and reports must stop and action must be taken. Small employers must be protected. I accept that somebody must take on the claims, but somebody must also take on the insurance companies. I accept that the Minister of State will reply by stating the marketplace is governed by European law. However, we must protect the small businesses and employers who give people work. They must be given the support they need. The Department must make every effort to tackle insurance companies with regard to public liability insurance.</P>
    <P>I refer to another issue which I have raised previously with the Minister of State. Insurance companies are charging young drivers more to insure their cars than those cars are actually worth. Something must be done to try to protect the people concerned and help them obtain insurance cover. If there is a need to take on the insurance companies, the Minister of State and the Government must do so immediately in order to protect jobs and the interests of those who provide them. Action must be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being faced by employers, particularly small and medium enterprises, in obtaining insurance cover in respect of public liability. These difficulties were apparent in the latter part of last year, but are becoming even more acute this year to date. I am aware that the problem is twofold: first, there have been large increases in renewal premiums; and, second, companies are not able to obtain cover at any price, in some cases. Various reasons have been put forward for the large increases in insurance premiums now taking place and also for the particular difficulties being experienced by those seeking public liability cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Insurance costs are mainly determined by the number and level of awards to policyholders. In this country the incidence of claims &ndash; to which Deputy Ring referred in his wide-ranging contribution &ndash; has been relatively high and we all <Col N="1045" /> know that the cost of settling those claims is also high by any standards. It is estimated that the delivery cost of settlements, made up almost entirely of legal costs, now runs at approximately 40% of the cost of claims and in some cases may even be higher.</P>
    <P>Additional factors have impacted negatively on the cost and availability of insurance cover, including public liability cover, in the recent past. Insurance is a cyclical business and, following several years of a &ldquo;soft market&rdquo; involving technical losses for insurance companies, the cycle changed and prices, therefore, went on an upward trend.</P>
    <P>The tragic events of 11 September last in the United States of America have had a huge impact on the international insurance market. Following those events, losses being incurred by international reinsurers are resulting in very large increases in the cost of reinsurance cover bought by insurance companies here in Ireland and elsewhere. In that regard, on 1 November we were informed that the liability relating to the tragedies in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania was $60 billion. On 1 March we were informed that this had increased to $115 billion and that the insurers providing the cover and the reinsurers providing the reinsurance cover on the insurance risks had total technical reserves of $15 billion, leaving a net shortfall of $100 billion and rising. It is against that background that I speak tonight.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there has been a reduction in reinsurance capacity in the marketplace, including in the London market, where insurers and brokers here had been able to place some of the risk. A number of serious collapses occurred in the UK insurance industry in the past year. On 17 June Independent Insurers Limited ceased trading and, prior to this, a number of syndicates went out of business. This has aggravated the situation going forward.</P>
    <P>Insurers are also reassessing the risk in relation to certain types of cover. The area of liability cover seems to be particularly badly affected by this reassessment. Investment income gains, which were relatively high in the past and could be used to offset insurance losses, are now greatly reduced. This is causing further upward pressure on premiums. If interest rates on borrowing are high, those charged on deposits will also be high. Investment income is high when deposit interest is high and if interest rates are low across the board, investment income on liquidity drops immeasurably. Recent High Court judgments in two cases have the potential to increase greatly awards in personal injury cases, necessitating a strengthening of reserves by insurers in respect of outstanding cases.</P>
    <P>When considering what action my Department and the Government can take to address the problem I must, first, point out that the pricing <Col N="1046" /> and underwriting of insurance are matters for individual insurance companies and European Union law prevents us from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of the risks that insurance companies are prepared to underwrite. In other words, we cannot control the price they charge for particular risks, neither can we say what risks they should cover. That is a matter for the market and Governments across the Union are prevented from interfering in this area. However, in view of the seriousness of the situation, especially for small businesses, I am making arrangements to meet once again with representatives from the Irish Insurance Federation and the major insurance companies in the Irish marketplace. I will be encouraging them to develop, in consultation with their clients, innovative strategies for controlling risk. It is my hope such strategies will contribute to a moderation of prices.</P>
    <P>We are pursuing initiatives aimed at reducing the delivery cost of compensation. With regard to delivery costs, the Government has decided to establish the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. An interdepartmental implementation group is now considering how best it can be established. I await its final report in order that the board can be established as quickly as possible. I expect significant savings in the current high delivery costs of personal injury compensation can be achieved, thus permitting a reduction in insurance premiums in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board has completed a considerable amount of work, including an examination of premiums charged and claims incurred by various categories of drivers &ndash; a matter to which Deputy Ring referred. The board has ratified the text of its report and its printing is now being arranged. As a result of the research carried out by the board, there will be greater transparency in relation to the Irish motor insurance market. One of the benefits of this should be to encourage more insurers in other EU countries to enter our market to provide not just motor insurance cover, but also other types of cover. While the Irish market is open to competition from providers in other EU member states since the transposition into Irish law of the third directives in 1994, there has, in fact, been a low level of entry by such providers. I hope the situation will improve following the work of the MIAB and through the establishment of the PIAB.</P>
    <P>I commend Deputy Ring for his wide-ranging address on this very serious issue which is dear to the hearts of Members of this House and Seanad Éireann. It is a serious issue, nationally and globally, and I will require the full support of all Members of this House if we are to make any progress on resolving it.</P>

        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>: </b>I wish to share my time with Deputy Howlin, Deputy D'Arcy and the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne. I welcome the opportunity to raise the issue of the closure of Wexford Electronix. This is the fourth occasion in the last year that I have spoken on the Adjournment in relation to job losses in County Wexford. Including Wexal, Wienas, Emlam Weavers and now Wexford Electronix, the total loss is over 1,000 jobs, which has severely affected families right across the county. The closure of Wexford Electronix presents significant problems for Wexford town, in which it has been one of the largest employers. It will cause severe hardship to many families in that town. In many cases, husbands and wives or partners worked in the company and the loss of both jobs will cause major problems in terms of mortgage repayments and very poor prospects of getting alternative employment in future.</P>
      <P>We wish to make a particular case in relation to redundancy payments. The current payments are derisory, at a half week for each year of service up to age 41 and a full week after that age. For example, an employee with 16 years service would get about &euro;2,500 under the current statutory redundancy payments system, which has not been changed since 1967. That is an insult to any worker losing his or her job. The Taoiseach was asked today about legislation which could be rushed through this House in a very short time, but his answer was &ldquo;No&rdquo;. I appeal to the Taoiseach, who is my party leader, to have a change of mind and heart, to look at this situation very seriously over the next week and to consider the introduction of a Bill to increase statutory redundancy payments to at least three weeks for every year of employment. That change is necessary and the Taoiseach should lead it.</P>
      <P>I ask him to think again, to review the situation and to have compassion for the families who are losing their jobs in County Wexford. We have been hit very severely over the last year and we cannot take any more. If we cannot offer people jobs, we, at least, should be in a position to offer adequate redundancy payments to those who are losing their jobs. The current payments, dating from 1967, are a total insult and it is time the legislation was changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for selecting this item for the Adjournment debate tonight. It underlines the importance of this matter for County Wexford that four Wexford Deputies are to contribute to this short debate. Until about 18 months ago, Wexford Electronix was the largest employer in the county, with over 550 employees. The figure last Christmas was 364. All those workers now face redundancy and, because the company is in receivership, they can only look to statutory redundancy payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" />On the Order of Business today, as Deputy Browne said, the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, asked the Taoiseach to accept a Labour Party proposal. We have a draft Bill before the House to increase statutory redundancy payments from the miserable half week per year served up to age 41 and one week per year served over age 41 to something more realistic &ndash; not overly generous, simply three weeks per year served. That would give some degree of cushioning to those who are now facing unemployment, retraining and the search for a new job. The 364 employees of Wexford Electronix face dire prospects. Wexford has already lost 1,000 jobs in the last 18 months. Deputy Browne instanced the case of people who have worked for the last 16 years in this company. Those under 41, the majority of workers, will qualify for maximum redundancy payments of &euro;2,500. That is a derisory sum for those faced with mortgage payments and normal expenses.</P>
    <P>Those people did without their bonuses and the last two pay rounds in an effort to keep their company afloat. They are now being insulted in terms of the amount of money available. Justice demands the redress of this old law dating back to 1967. I ask the Government, and particularly the Taoiseach, to amend the 1967 Act. A single one line amendment, by all party agreement, could take place before the end of this Dáil to ensure justice for these people. The money is available; the social insurance fund is in surplus to the tune of &euro;1.2 billion. It will not have any impact on taxation or Exchequer spend. It simply involves justice for people who have worked hard in their jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the other speakers in expressing our appreciation for the opportunity to raise this important issue. We would prefer if this issue had not arisen but we have no option but to address it. The decision to close Wexford Electronix, making 364 employees redundant, is a most disastrous situation for the employees and their families. Their income will be severely reduced; they will have to go on the dole. In some cases, their houses will be put at risk in the absence of mortgage protection. The education of families will also be at risk, especially in relation to third level education which is so important nowadays. Family living standards will be drastically reduced, creating untold hardship in many families. The current redundancy legislation which only allows a half week per year of service is an absolute disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having suffered the loss of their jobs, the least employees could expect is a decent redundancy payment, having contributed, over many years, through PAYE income tax and PRSI. As Deputy Howlin said, ample funds are available. Already this year, the Minister for Finance has dipped his hand into the fund to the extent of &euro;650 million. <Col N="1049" /> The employees who are being made redundant in Wexford should be allowed a reasonable redundancy payment. The Taoiseach's attitude on this matter this morning was most disappointing. He never even gave it a thought. His Fianna Fáil party colleague, Deputy Browne, has already pointed out that, in the Wexford constituency, we have lost over 1,000 jobs in the last 12 months. All those employees have suffered the same fate. That is a scandalous situation. I fully support the Labour Party proposal to amend the 1967 Act to provide for a payment of at least three weeks for every year of service. That is not asking for much.</P>
    <P>I point out to Deputy Browne and the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, that it is not enough to preach here in this House. As members of the Fianna Fáil party, it is their job to confront the Taoiseach and the relevant Ministers to ensure that the legislation is amended. I will stay here in the House next week until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. and I am sure Deputy Howlin will do likewise in order to do so. All that is required is a small amendment and I appeal for this adjustment to be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an indication of how strongly I feel on this issue. When 364 jobs are lost in any town it is a sad blow, and I join with my colleagues in asking that people in Wexford Electronix be treated with some respect at this stage.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Howlin said, there were 500 people working in the company not too long ago. When the bad news came at Christmas I called 11 meetings to which I invited the local representatives. I am pleased to say that my colleagues here attended all meetings with the unions, and the receiver was quite encouraging and obliging at all times. The receiver, at our request, probably gave the best possible opportunity to a prospective buyer to come in and have a look at the business working on the ground. The receiver claimed that the workers were the most committed and the easiest to deal with in his time as a receiver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While some 1,000 jobs have been lost in the county as a whole, PFPC has provided 300 jobs in Wexford and Lake Region and Fingal Fish have provided 150 and 105 respectively. Clearstream has opened in Enniscorthy and the advance factory building boom is still going ahead in New Ross and tourism jobs are being provided. However, that is little consolation to those in Wexford Electronix. The excuse was trotted out to us by industries who went to other areas to locate that we did not have a third level insti<Col N="1050" /> tution. We have one now but it will not be up and running for a while. This, again, is little consolation to those people who have lost their jobs.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Tánaiste to take a personal interest in the workers of Wexford Electronix, whom she met at my request some time ago, with a view to a decent redundancy package. I understand that the Government is talking with the social partners on this and I ask tonight for expedition. Redundancy should not be the end of it, we need a replacement industry for the people of Wexford Electronix.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the appointment of a receiver on 13 December 2001, Wexford Electronix was advertised for sale in January of this year. The final outcome of this process, which is nearing conclusion, will determine the future of the company. In agreement with key customers, the plant is to remain open until the end of March 2002. The Tánaiste visited the plant, accompanied by the chief executive and regional manager of Enterprise Ireland, on 22 January last, to assess the situation on the ground and to meet the management and staff of the company, as well as trade union representatives and local representatives. Enterprise Ireland has remained in close contact with the company and the receiver to facilitate any potential takeover or restructuring of the company.</P>
      <P>In relation to redundancy payments to workers, to date 14 claims for payment of statutory redundancy lump sums out of the social insurance fund have been received. These payments will be made as soon as documentation regarding the receivership of the company is received. A further 350 claims for payment out of the social insurance fund are expected in the Department shortly. Again priority will be given to the payment of these claims when they are received in our Department. With regard to the insolvency payments scheme, under which amounts of outstanding wages, holiday pay etc. may be claimed from the social insurance fund, I understand there will be over 360 employees involved in total. To date, claim forms in respect of 15 employees were received on 20 February this year. The originals had to be returned to the receiver, on query, due to incomplete information. The staff of the insolvency payments section have been in phone contact with staff from the receiver's office, who are working on site in Wexford, in relation to the completion of the forms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to minimum notice compensation, also payable under the insolvency payments scheme, appeals by employees will have to be made before the Employment Appeals Tribunal and amounts determined by the tribunal. Whenever these determinations are issued and claim forms received via the receiver, the insolvency payments section of the Department will process <Col N="1051" /> the claims as quickly as possible. On the overall issue of the statutory redundancy payments scheme, the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967-2001, oblige employers to pay redundant employees what is known as a statutory redundancy entitlement. The amount is related to the employee's length of service and his or her normal weekly earnings, based on their gross weekly wage, average regular overtime and payment-in-kind, all added together, subject to a ceiling of &euro;507.90 per week. The ceiling was increased from &euro;380.92 to &euro;507.90 per week with effect from 1 April 2001, following consultations with the social partners. The scheme covers any employee, who is between 16 and 66 years of age with 104 weeks &ndash; two years &ndash; continuous service and who is insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts and is normally expected to work for 18 hours or more per week. Part-time workers, with less than 18 hours per week, do not have to be fully insurable but must satisfy the rest of the conditions. Employers who pay their workers their redundancy entitlement and give them proper notice of being made redundant, at least two weeks, are entitled to a 60% rebate from the social insurance fund, into which they make regular payments themselves through PRSI contributions.</P>
    <P>Calculation of a redundancy lump sum payment is based upon the following: a half week's pay for each year of employment, between the ages of 16 and 41 years; a week's pay for each year of employment over the age of 41 years; and, in addition, a bonus week. All calculations are subject to the ceiling that I mentioned earlier, which at present stands at &euro;507.90 per week.</P>
    <P>Our Department has been reviewing how, among other things, the operation of the statutory redundancy scheme could be made simpler and more efficient. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions and SIPTU have developed proposals to enhance the levels of payments made under the scheme. The ICTU-SIPTU proposals include the following: the qualifying period should be reduced from the current two years continuous service to one year; lump sum payments should be increased to three weeks for every year of service irrespective of age; one additional week to be increased to two weeks; and the weekly pay ceiling to be increased to £500, &euro;634.87, and automatically indexed thereafter. The Tánaiste met ICTU on 6 March last, where its proposals were outlined to her. The Tánaiste is currently consulting with the other social partners involved to seek their observations with a view to obtaining agreement by all sides on how the current statutory redundancy scheme should be evaluated in the wider context of social partnership. I assure this House that every effort will be made to make the necessary payments to the <Col N="1052" /> workers of Wexford Electronix as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I also want to assure the excellent Deputies, all four of them, who have spoken here on behalf of the people of Wexford and the workers of Wexford Electronix that I take very seriously the requests they have made and the continuous efforts they have made to save the company and support industry and development in their county. The full resources of the Department and its State agencies will be given and they will do their utmost to ensure that a replacement industry is found for this location as rapidly as possible.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Helicopter Tendering Process.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Early last year the Minister for Defence authorised an advertisement for tenders from his Department for the supply of helicopters to the Defence Forces. On 6 December 2001, the Minister announced in a press release that he had considered the report of the technical group that had been established in his Department to evaluate tenders received for medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps from four different companies whom he named.</P>
      <P>He went on to state that the report demonstrated that all four aircraft on offer met the technical requirements and the Minister had decided all tenderers would be given one week in which to make a best and final price in regard to the helicopters. Subsequently, in a press release on 17 January 2002, the Minister announced that on that day he had authorised his Department to open negotiations with Sikorsky International Operations, Connecticut, USA, for the purchase of three medium range helicopters, S92s, for search and rescue purposes with an option of a further two helicopters for general purpose military transport. The press release recorded that the Minister's decision followed from a detailed examination of the tenders received from the four different companies, including Sikorsky, CHC Scotia of Scotland, EH Industries Limited, UK and Eurocopter of France. The Minister stated that he hoped the contract negotiations would be completed in a matter of weeks, that the White Paper on Defence which was approved by the Government in February 2000 recognised the urgent equipment modernisation requirements in the Air Corps, and that the purchase of medium lift helicopters was a positive indication of the Government's commitment to ensure all branches of the Defence Forces, Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are fully equipped to carry out their day to day roles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this side of the House, the urgent need to provide the Defence Forces with the helicopters they required was recognised and we are supportive of the Minister's endeavours. We regard it as a matter of great urgency that the helicopters be supplied and I draw the atten<Col N="1053" /> tion of the House to the fact that the three medium range aircraft which were to be ordered initially were for search and rescue purposes. The remaining helicopters related to an option to purchase two aircraft for general military transport purposes. There is a great need to provide helicopters to perform search and rescue operations off our coast and to provide a far better service than we have at present. We need those aircraft to provide the level of service to which we are entitled as are ships which get into difficulty off our coast.</P>
    <P>The matter of the purchase of these helicopters again came before this House on 13 February because Eurocopter had taken proceedings against the Minister in the High Court complaining that information to which it was entitled under the Freedom of Information Act had not been supplied. It is now alleged that, instead of proceeding with the negotiations with Sikorsky, the Government intends to re-tender the contract for the supply of helicopters. It is reported that, having gone through the lengthy tendering process of 2001, the Minister proposes to terminate discussions currently taking place between his Department and Sikorsky as a consequence of alleged irregularities in the manner in which the Minister dealt with the original tendering process. This is of serious public concern. If there is to be a new tendering process it will put back by another 12 months' progress to provide helicopters which are badly required by the Defence Forces and it will mean hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money has been wasted in the tendering process to date. It would be a considerable setback in meeting the needs and expectations of the Defence Forces. It is of the utmost importance that the Minister clarifies the current position to the House tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shatter for raising this important matter and I am very happy to have the opportunity to outline the position from my point of view.</P>
      <P>On 17 January 2002, I authorised my Department to open negotiations with Sikorsky International Operations Incorporated, Connecticut, USA, for the purchase of three medium range helicopters, S-92s, for search and rescue purposes. The negotiations were also to include an option, exercisable within three years by the Department, for a further two helicopters for general purpose military transport. The decision followed a detailed examination of the tenders received from the four companies &ndash; Sikorsky USA, CHC Scotia Scotland, EH Industries limited UK, and Eurocopter France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The offer from Sikorsky was deemed to be the most strategically and economically advantageous tender, taking account of the award criteria set out for the tender competition. Those criteria included functional characteristics, technical <Col N="1054" /> merit, all maintenance and on-line technical support, after-sales service and warranty terms on offer, cost and ready availability of spare parts, tender prices and life-cycle costs over a nominal 20 year period. I am satisfied that, on the basis of the facts presented to me, the offer from Sikorsky would provide best value for money from the taxpayers' point of view. The timeframe proposed by Sikorsky would see the delivery of three search and rescue helicopters by the end of next year.</P>
    <P>Following my decision of 17 January 2002 Eurocopter sought the reasons for the acceptance of the Sikorsky tender and the rejection of its tender pursuant to Article 7 of EU Public Procurement Directive 93/36/EC, as amended. A reply issued from the Chief State Solicitor's office to solicitors acting for Eurocopter in this matter on 6 February 2002. In addition, solicitors acting for Eurocopter submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, seeking documentation relating to the tender competition. Eurocopter subsequently issued judicial review proceedings alleging, <i>inter alia</i>, that I was in breach of my obligations under Directive 93/36/EC, as amended, to furnish the characteristics and relative advantages of the tender selected. The proceedings sought certain information and documents from me on the tender procedure and award. The judicial review proceedings were adjourned, with consent, last Friday 15 March 2002 until 15 April 2002, for mention. The request under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, from Eurocopter has been progressed as far as possible by the Department at this stage and documentation relating to the competition has been passed on to solicitors acting for Eurocopter.</P>
    <P>My Department is continuing to deal with the Chief State Solicitor's office on the judicial review proceedings and it is my intention to be as forthcoming as possible in this regard. However, as the matter is due to come before the courts again in mid-April, I do not wish to say anything further at this stage. I should say, however, that to date no proceedings have been issued challenging my decision to open contract negotiations with Sikorsky.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department held discussions with the representatives of the managerial authorities in the second level sector, in order to ensure that schools would remain open when the ASTI directive to its members to withdraw from voluntary supervision and substitution duties took effect on 4 March 2002. Arising from these discussions a contingency plan was prepared and agreed between my Department and the managerial authorities. As part of the contingency arrangements, my Department undertook to resource schools in order that they could employ staff to provide supervision and thereby remain open. In addition, my Department undertook to recoup the cost to the management authorities in advertising for, recruiting and training personnel to provide supervision services in schools on a temporary contractual basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supervisors who contracted for delivery of supervision services are being remunerated at a daily contract rate of &euro;68.56, £54, based on a minimum of two hours' supervision. Where further supervision above these two hours is required this is being remunerated at &euro;34.28, £27, per additional hour. This is the equivalent to the hourly rate offered to teachers. To put schools in funds for the purposes of the contingency arrangements, an initial payment was made to schools by my Department on 28 February 2002, and was based upon six weeks of the annual <Col N="1058" /> grant, calculated on the basis of &euro;1,270, £1,000, per whole time equivalent teacher post per annum, with a stipulation that further payments of the grant will be made to schools at the appropriate stages of the contingency. In addition, funding was provided to cover employers PRSI, holiday pay and administrative costs. In aggregate, the sum dispersed to schools was approximately &euro;7 million, £5.5 million. I am not in a position at present to provide the Deputy with details of funding provided to schools in County Galway.</P>
    <P>The contingency plan acknowledges that supplementary allocations may need to be made to some schools at a later stage if their approved outgoings are greater than the amount of the grant. Accordingly, the final costs are not yet available. The joint managerial body, JMB, placed advertisements on behalf of the managerial authorities in the national media over the weekend of 16-17 February. In addition, the JMB organised training on a regional basis and operated a telephone help-line for schools. My Department has recouped &euro;114,258.47, £89,985.86, to the JMB to offset the cost of providing these services to date.</P>
    <P>The current position is that the INTO has accepted my Department's proposals for payment on the basis of &euro;34.28 per hour. The TUI and ASTI have rejected them. The ASTI issued a directive to its members to withdraw from supervision and substitution with effect from 4 March 2002. The directive applies to supervision at break times and before and after school and to substitution by permanent teachers for absent colleagues. On Friday, 15 February, the ASTI made a new set of demands in relation to supervision and substitution. These were minimum annual rate of &euro;2,500; that it be pensionable; available to existing pensioners in compensation for having done this for free over a number of years; that it be within the 22 hours weekly maximum teaching time.</P>
    <P>I met with the three teacher unions on 28 February 2002. I indicated that the Government is not opposed to the pensionability of supervision payments. In that regard, I offered to enter into a process at the end of the current school year to work out the details of an arrangement which would be consistent with the requirements for pensionability. I also indicated that the procedures provided by the conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers should be used to deal with the issue of an appropriate payment rate for supervision. These procedures include independent arbitration where the parties cannot agree.</P>
    <P>My approach was welcomed by the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the Teachers Union of Ireland but rejected by the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland. The ASTI central executive has since decided not to enter into any further negotiations on this matter pending the settlement of its pay claim. At a meeting of the Teachers Conciliation Council on 12 March, the TUI and INTO requested that further discussions <Col N="1059" /> take place on the issue of supervision and substitution. These discussions will commence shortly with the assistance of a facilitator. The ASTI has taken the view that it is not prepared to deal with this issue within the teachers' conciliation and arbitration scheme, which is the agreed industrial relations forum for processing these matters.</P>

      <P>The growth of all-Irish schools in recent times has been one of the most constructive developments in relation to the achievement of the greater use of Irish at school and in the community. A particularly encouraging aspect of this development is the fact that it is rooted in the realisation by many parents of the unique educational value of Irish and of Irish culture and in their wish that their children should access fully our priceless linguistic and cultural heritage. My Department facilitates the establishment of new all-Irish schools and all-Irish streams and units, where a clear need for such provision can be established. I will continue to operate a policy of being favourably disposed towards the establishment of all-Irish facilities where the need for them has been demonstrated. The Education Act, 1998, provides strong support for the maintenance of Irish as the primary community language in the Gaeltacht and for the realisation of national policy and objectives in relation to bi-lingualism in Irish society and for the promotion and development of Irish culture.</P>
      <P>I recognise the need to respond in practical ways to the needs of all-Irish schools. Most urgent among these needs is the provision of suitable texts and other teaching materials. Currently, four teachers are employed under the aegis of the Donegal Education Centre to design materials specifically for the teaching of Irish in Gaeltacht schools and in gaelscoileanna. These are designed to meet the requirements of the revised primary school curriculum in relation to the teaching of Irish. All materials designers are from the Gaeltacht and have wide experience of teaching Irish in Gaeltacht and-or all-Irish schools. They work under the general direction of designated inspectors from my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last December, I announced the setting up, under Section 31 of the Education Act 1998, of An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta. An Chomhairle has a range of functions in relation to education through Irish. Its remit includes planning and co-ordinating the provision of textbooks and aids for learning and teaching through Irish, advising me on the pro<Col N="1060" /> vision and promotion of education through Irish, providing support services to all-Irish schools and conducting research related to Irish medium education. I am happy to inform the Deputy that I launched An Chomhairle just over a week ago and that it has held its inaugural meeting. I look forward eagerly to seeing the benefits that will flow, in due course, from its work. An Chomhairle will work closely with Foras na Gaeilge and with the National Education Centre for Irish to be built in Baile Bhuirne in the Muskerry Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Expenditure in 2001 in respect of capital works in primary schools in County Galway grant-aided by the primary buildings unit of my Department was &euro;3.6 million. In addition, all recognised schools received &euro;3,809 per school plus &euro;12.70 per pupil under the devolved grant scheme for primary school buildings.</P>
      <P>Capitation grants at the rate of &euro;101.58 per pupil are also being paid to all schools in County Galway in the current school year. Children with special educational needs attending national schools in County Galway are currently supported by 88 full-time and 73 part-time resource teachers. Traveller children attending national schools in the county are supported by 21 special dedicated classes and a further 56 resource teacher posts. In the past 2 years, my Department has allocated some &euro;200,000 to schools in the area for the purchase of special equipment to assist children with disabilities. All resource teacher posts allocated to national schools attract an initial start-up grant of &euro;635 and a further annual grant of &euro;317. Each special class also attracts a set-up grant of &euro;635. A total of &euro;1.05 million was paid to 230 schools in Galway in 2001 in respect of information and communications technology grants.</P>
      <P>The level and condition of facilities and accommodation will vary considerably from school to school. Because of past under-funding in the capital area, many primary schools do not have an appropriate level of facilities. However, it is the intention of this Government to improve the accommodation situation in all schools, including schools in Galway, through a planned and systematically applied programme of capital investment. In pursuance of this objective, the allocation for primary building in 2002 has been increased to &euro;153.6 million, which is an historically high level of investment.</P>

All buildings projects currently in architectural planning will proceed to tender and construction as speedily as possible as part of the Government's expanded school building programme.</P>

      <P>The proposal to establish a commission <Col N="1062" /> on education and learning was announced by me last year in the context of the ASTI dispute, and this was subsequently endorsed by the Labour Court. The essential purpose of the commission is to take a broad look at the role of primary and post-primary education in meeting the needs of children and young people in a continually changing and evolving society. Draft terms of reference for the commission have been prepared and include such issues as legal and management structures within which schools operate, developments in education and teaching, the role of the teacher, teacher training and accreditation, support systems for schools and lifelong learning.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>The loading on all school buses is determined by the relevant sections of the road traffic regulations &ndash; construction, equipment and use of vehicles &ndash; which are laid down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Under PSV &ndash; public service vehicle &ndash; regulations, the licensed carrying capacity of all vehicles engaged in school transport is based on a ratio of three pupils for every two adult seats. Under existing regulations, passenger seat belts are not compulsory in buses, including those operated under the school transport scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Safety on school transport is of paramount importance to my Department and Bus Éireann, <Col N="1063" /> which operates the scheme on behalf of my Department. Great care is taken to ensure that loading does not exceed the maximum legal carrying capacity of the vehicles.</P>
    <P>The safety aspects of school transport, including the three for two seating ratio and the provision of seat belts are being examined by the school transport section of my Department together with Bus Éireann and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. This report has just been completed and copies are available from my Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Submissions are invited from all interested parties. When the submissions are received and examined consideration will be given to the question of what improvements can be put in place to further improve the safety of the children who use the service.</P>

      <P>The total operating cost of Finglas children's centre in 2001 amounted to £5,007,811, &euro;6,358,608. The average number of children in Finglas children's centre for each month of 2001 will be sent to the Deputy separately. While the centre is staffed and resourced to cater for 40 young people, this capacity is obviously reduced during periods of renovation and refurbishment without a corresponding reduction in costs. The single most significant cost in residential childcare relates to staff. However, it is not reasonable to make care staff and teachers redundant during periods in which capacity is reduced. The average cost per young person resident is therefore higher during periods where there is a loss of capacity. The average number of children accommodated in the centre during 2001 was 24.19 and the related average cost per person resident was £207,020, &euro;262,861. As explained previously, the more meaningful average cost to use in making year to year or inter centre comparisons is that based on 40 places which was £125,195, &euro;158,998. The Deputy will be aware of the Government's commitment to early intervention and prevention as set out, for example, in the Children Act, 2001, and the principle that detention should only be employed as a matter of last resort. Where detention occurs there is an onus to ensure that best child care practice is achieved. The foregoing information should be seen in this light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the Deputy has concerns regarding the Finglas children's centre. I am most anxious that these concerns and others are dealt with during the independent inspection of the <Col N="1064" /> centre that is currently under way. It is important therefore that the Deputy would accept my invitation to meet with the independent inspector and inform him of her concerns. This inspection is being carried out against standards and criteria that have been agreed to by the five centres within the remit of my Department and the social services inspectorate. A copy of these was sent to the Deputy some time ago. When the inspector has completed his work and reported to my Department, I wish to assure the Deputy that I will take whatever action is necessary to ensure that the centre provides high quality care for the young people resident there in a cost effective and caring manner.</P>

      <P>The Sonnagh school closed in 1959 and pupils were transferred to Kilnadeema national school. The school transport scheme was not established until 1967. While a service previously operated from Sonnagh past the home of the pupils in question, my Department could not have given a definitive commitment to provide transport from Sonnagh village from 1959 onwards. The matter was last considered in 1998. The family concerned resided 1.3 miles from the nearest pick-up point. My Department was prepared to allow an extension of the existing service to bring the family to within 0.8 miles of the pick-up point. The family, however, indicated to Bus Éireann that this would not be acceptable.</P>
      <P>As a rule, primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than 1.5 miles to travel to a pick-up point. Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way, or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route. Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the school transport scheme as the cost involved on a countrywide level would be prohibitive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>At primary level, schools' running costs have been traditionally met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of primary schools, including insurance costs. The capitation grant has been increased substantially since the Government took office in 1997. It has been increased from £45 per pupil in 1997 to £80, &euro;101.58, per pupil in this school year. In addition a further increase of &euro;10 per pupil will apply from September 2002. This constitutes an increase of some 95% over that period and is a reflection of the Government's commitment to improve funding to the education sector.</P>
      <P>In the case of secondary schools, it is a matter for the managerial authorities of the individual schools to arrange insurance cover on school property and against public liability. Grant aid towards voluntary secondary school funding costs is provided by my Department by way of per capita grants and may be used for this purpose. In recent times, significant improvements have been made in the level of per capita grants at post primary level. The standard per capita grant has been increased from £177, &euro;224.74, in 1999 to its current level of £202, &euro;256.49, per pupil. A further increase of &euro;10 comes into effect from September, 2002, bringing the per capita rate to &euro;266.49. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra &euro;20,873 per annum, and a total capitation grant of &euro;133,245 towards general expenses.</P>
      <P>In addition to the standard per capita grant, I have already shown my commitment to increasing funding for secondary schools and in this regard I established the school services support fund. Under this fund, all second level schools will receive an increase in the support grant from £20, &euro;25.40, per pupil to £78, &euro;99.04, per pupil over this school year and the next. I enhanced the schools services support fund in December 2001. This equalisation measure for voluntary secondary schools was designed to reduce the historic anomalies in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. Under the enhanced school services support fund, all voluntary secondary schools will receive an enhanced grant of £65, &euro;82.53, per pupil, subject to a maximum enhanced grant of £5,250, &euro;6,666.12, per school. For voluntary secondary schools, not embraced by the 1978 secretary scheme, the grant will be further increased to £85, &euro;107.93, subject to a maximum enhanced grant of £7,000, &euro;8,888.17, per school. The impact of this improvement is that the maximum combined increase in funding in 2001, under this equalisation initiative, in the case of secondary schools, not embraced by the 1978 secretary scheme amounts to £12,250, &euro;15,554.29, per school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently announced a further equalisation measure for voluntary secondary schools. Under the terms of this measure the annual support services grant for secondary schools will be <Col N="1066" /> increased by a further &euro;28 per pupil, with effect from September 2002. This measure is a further enhancement of the funding that was approved for voluntary secondary schools in the free education sector last December and is designed to further reduce the historic anomalies in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level, particularly in the way back-up services to schools such as secretarial and caretaking, cleaning and insurance costs have been funded. Taking into account increases in the grant that will take effect from September next and which have already been notified to schools, this further increase will enhance the annual support services per capita grant to &euro;116.88 per pupil from September next and to &euro;127.04 from 1 January 2003.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Maths and science form a very important part of the modern curriculum. I am <Col N="1068" /> very conscious of concerns in relation to attitudes to these subjects and the uptake of science subjects in the senior cycle of second level schools and at third level. I have taken a number of steps to encourage interest in these subjects and to develop teaching and learning in them. With regard to the provision of up-to-date curricula, new leaving certificate syllabi in physics and in chemistry were introduced in September 2000 and a new syllabus in leaving certificate biology has been circulated to schools. At junior certificate level, the NCCA has recently prepared a draft of a new science syllabus which will now be circulated among the education partners for discussion. New mathematics syllabi were introduced in September 2000 at junior certificate level, while at primary level, the primary school curriculum published in 1999, provides a significantly revised programme for mathematics and an entirely new programme for science.</P>
      <P>I have also ensured that the revision of curricula and syllabi has been supported by a comprehensive in-career development programme for teachers. This has programmes for teachers of physics and chemistry, as part of the physical sciences initiative, for teachers of leaving certificate biology, and a developmental project in science in over 200 primary schools. During the next school year all primary teachers will receive three days in-service training in science so as to facilitate implementation of science in all primary schools from September 2003. Similarly, in-career support for teachers has been provided for mathematics at junior certificate level and primary schools.</P>
      <P>Laboratory resources are an important element in the delivery of a modern science curriculum. As a further part of the physical sciences initiative I have taken a number of steps to develop these resources in our second-level schools. Schools have been provided with capital grants to a total of £10,500 for the purchase of laboratory equipment, including ICT equipment. A special annual <i>per capita</i> grant is being paid to schools in respect of each pupil taking a physical science subject at leaving certificate level. Schools that currently have a capital project in architectural planning will have their science laboratories upgraded as an integral element of the capital project.</P>
      <P>Just over a year ago I established a task force on the physical sciences. The brief of the task force is to identify the issues contributing to the falling uptake of the physical sciences at both second and third level and to recommend additional measures to address these issues. I understand that the task force has also given consideration to issues relating to the teaching and learning of science at primary level. I expect to be presented with the final report of the task force shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department also contributes to various initiatives to encourage interest in mathematics and science, including the science, technology and innovation awareness programme, primary science day, science clubs which are being piloted in <Col N="1069" /> a number of primary schools, and the work of the science and mathematics Olympiads.</P>
    <P>A number of third level institutions have also initiated a variety of schemes at local level to encourage students to pursue third level science related courses. The substantial investment in research by this Government under the national development plan is also playing a significant role in the development in scientific and technological education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1997 the funding allocated to primary and second level schools has been increased substantially in accordance with the Government's commitment to giving education a clear priority in the allocation of resources as set out in the policy document, An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
      <P>At primary level, schools' running costs have been traditionally met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of primary schools. The capitation grant has been increased substantially since the Government took office in 1997. It has been increased from £45, &euro;57.14, per pupil in 1997 to &euro;101.58, £80, per pupil in this school year. In addition, a further increase of &euro;10 per pupil will apply from September 2002 in respect of the 2002-2003 school year.</P>
      <P>Special enhanced capitation rates are paid in respect of children with special needs who attend special schools or special classes dedicated to children with particular special needs. These special rates can range from &euro;359.34 to &euro;579 per pupil depending on the particular level of need involved. These rates will also be increasing by &euro;10 per pupil with effect from September 2002.</P>
      <P>At post-primary level the main <i>per capita</i> grant amounts to &euro;256.49, £202, per pupil. The grant was increased from £177, &euro;224.74, to £184, &euro;233.63, in 1999. It was further increased by £8, &euro;10.16, to £192, &euro;243.79, in September 2000, and to £202, &euro;256.49, in September 2001. A further increase of &euro;10 is due from September 2002 in respect of the 2002-2003 school year which will bring the rate per pupil to &euro;266.49.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The available data does not facilitate valid comparisons to be made between the levels of grants paid and the actual costs of running schools at primary and post-primary levels. However, it is accepted that the maintenance costs for second level schools are much greater on a unit cost basis than those in primary schools. In general, second level schools are larger than primary schools and this would lead to higher unit <Col N="1070" /> costs in second level schools for heat, light, power, maintenance and cleaning.</P>
    <P>In addition the second level capitation is required to cover a different range of expenditures. Second level schools provide a broader curriculum, including technical subjects where the costs of materials may be greater than at primary level. In addition, specialist equipment and rooms are required for some subjects, leading to higher maintenance-replacement costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has not made any proposals to reduce or roll back entitlement to learning support teacher assistance in primary schools. Indeed, I am proud to be part of the Government which, in 1999, made the resources available to extend the learning support teacher service to every school in the country with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above.</P>
      <P>In the year 2000, as part of my Department's reading initiative, learning support guidelines were provided to all schools with the aim of ensuring that all children achieve appropriate levels of literacy and numeracy during the course of their primary education. The learning support guidelines recommend high levels of co-operation between class teachers, learning support teachers and parents in supporting children who are experiencing learning difficulties.</P>
      <P>In selecting pupils for remedial education, priority should be given to those pupils who achieve scores at or below the tenth percentile in standardised tests in literacy-numeracy. In order to allow for measurement error, consideration may be given to selecting pupils who achieve scores up to and including the 12th percentile. Once schools are satisfied that the needs of pupils who have very low achievement or serious learning difficulties have been met, a limited degree of flexibility may be exercised in the deployment of the learning support teacher. The principal teacher has overall responsibility for the school's learning support programme and for the operation of services for children with special educational needs.</P>

      <P>According to my Department's records, <Col N="1071" /> there are 344 whole-time teachers under the age of 25 employed in voluntary secondary, community and comprehensive schools in the current school year. This compares with a figure of 40 for the 1999-2000 school year. There are 1,435 teachers in the 26-30 age range, 4,242 teachers in their thirties, 5,503 teachers in their forties, and 4,823 teachers over 50 years of age.</P>
      <P>This year, 959 second level teachers are in receipt of the 35 year allowance compared to a figure of 820 two years ago. Corresponding figures for the vocational sector are not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>These figures quoted above clearly show that more young teachers are being appointed in our second level schools. The appointment of younger teachers to whole-time positions has come about as a direct result of the increase in the number of teaching posts which have been approved at second level since this Government came into office. The introduction of the early retirement scheme for teachers has also been a factor in this.</P>

      <P>I am pleased that my Department is participating in the Government's programme on public private partnerships, PPPs, and specifically in the pilot programme of infrastructure projects.</P>
      <P>I believe that PPPs have significant potential in relation to developing new ideas on design which arise from the output-based approach; testing value for money over the life-cycle of the projects rather than just construction; making better use of educational facilities outside of school hours; allowing educationalists to concentrate on their core functions; optimising the allocation of risk in areas such as planning, design, construction, maintenance and operation of education facilities.</P>
      <P>I signed the first PPP contract in November last for five new post-primary schools and all are progressing on site. The advantage of participating in the pilot programme is that my Department can test the process under these criteria. The feedback to date from the education institutions included in the programme has been extremely positive but we need to see the completion of the construction phase of the projects, and the commencement of the operation phase, to get a fuller picture.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>In early 2001, the planning and building unit of my Department initiated the EU tender process for a pilot project to undertake a comprehensive inventory of accommodation of 115 primary and post-primary schools in County Kildare. The survey will include the production of site and building survey drawings and general building condition reports and the compilation of the resulting information on a geographic information system, GIS, database. It is intended that this inventory of school accommodation will be used for the long-term planning of capital provision through a precise and detailed identification of need in each of the individual schools surveyed; to enable priorities for capital provision to be identified; to enable the Department to identify schools with spare accommodation; for the long-term planning for the provision of schools in any particular location, such as, by interfacing with any existing database showing planned demographic growth; and as an information resource for the public.</P>
      <P>The EU tender process for this project has been completed. The successful surveying teams commenced work in January, 2002 and over the next number of months, each school in the pilot area will be visited by suitably qualified personnel who will assess and report on site conditions, space norms within the schools and the overall condition of each school. Ultimately, all the data accumulated will be stored electronically on the geographic information system database and will be used to prioritise capital funding for first and second level school building projects. It is intended to use the experience gained in this phase of the project for a more focused expansion of the inventory nationwide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as &lsquo;top-up' grants.</P>
      <P>The action group considered that the target group of &ldquo;those most in need&rdquo; could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education, that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22. The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students aged 23 and over, subject to specific conditions. My Department forwarded full details of this initiative to the local authorities and vocational education committees, in July 2001, with a request that payment be made with effect from the 2000-01 academic year.</P>
      <P>Finalised data in relation to both the 2000-01 and 2001-02 academic years on the numbers benefiting under the initiative, and the total expenditure involved, are not available within my Department, as a number of local authorities and vocational education committees have yet to complete the assessment process in respect of students applying for the special rates of maintenance grant.</P>
      <P>I have given a commitment that the eligibility criteria for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed with a view to extending eligibility. That review is now under way and a first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in its first year of operation. In this regard, I have already indicated that the scheme will be extended to ensure that additional, suitably qualifying mature students will benefit from the special rates of maintenance grant.</P>
      <P>In relation to psychological services, the national educational psychological service agency, NEPS, currently provides a service to all post-primary schools and approximately 1,800 primary schools. Its first priority must be to expand its service as quickly as possible until all schools have access to it. This service is more than an assessment service, as it includes consultancy work with parents, teachers and school management.</P>
      <P>Consideration of specific enhancement projects will be possible after this initial expansion phase has been completed. In the development of its service, NEPS will take account of the numbers of at risk students in each area and will welcome discussions on proposals for addressing areas of particularly great need.</P>

      <P>The figure referred to by the Deputy is based on the statistical returns which colleges are obliged to submit to the Higher Education Authority every year. The information is obtained from students when they register and not all students have their accommodation arrangements finalised at that time.</P>
      <P>The relevant colleges approve some of the hostel accommodation, which is dedicated for student use. In addition some overseas students who attend colleges to participate in short-term modules may also use this type of accommodation due to the temporary nature of their attendance.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the difficulties which students have been experiencing the Government introduced a special tax incentive to encourage the provision of student rented residential accommodation in Section 50 of the 1999 Finance Act. A recent survey shows that 3,315 bed spaces have been provided as a result of the tax incentive to date. The survey also indicates that an additional 14,514 bed spaces are to be provided under the scheme.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Section 50 tax incentive scheme, this Government introduced &ldquo;Rent-a-room&rdquo; relief in the 2001 budget. It allows homeowners rent out a room in their homes and have rental income of &euro;7,618, £6,000, a year tax-free.</P>

Under the terms of the contingency plan agreed it is necessary for the boards of management of each school to develop an interim policy on extracurricular activities. It was agreed that this policy would be predicated on the need to lessen disruption for the duration of the dispute. The policy should provide for a balance between the need to minimise substitution requirements and the need to continue to promote certain non-classroom activities.</P>

      <P>The national reading initiative was launched on 21 January 2000 with a budget of £2.5 million as a one-year initiative with two briefs. It is designed to raise awareness in the general public of the importance of reading and to lay the foundation for improving the quality of the teaching of reading in the formal and non-formal sectors. The initiative was a community-wide endeavour, collaborating with schools, libraries and voluntary community groups. Opportunity was given to local groups across all sectors to apply for funding to design, organise and run community-based projects aimed at increasing reading use and-or improving reading standards. The bulk of the money allocated for the initiative, over £2.4 million, has been spent. It is anticipated that the evaluation report will be completed in the coming months and consideration will be given to publishing the report at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Officials of my Department held discussions with the representatives of the managerial authorities in the second-level sector in order to ensure that schools would remain open when the ASTI directive to its members to withdraw from voluntary supervision and substitution duties took effect on 4 March 2002. Arising from these discussions a contingency plan was prepared and agreed between my Department and the managerial authorities. As part of the contingency arrangements, my Department undertook to resource schools so that they could employ staff to provide supervision and remain open. In addition, my Department undertook to recoup the cost to the management authorities in advertising for, recruiting and training appropriate personnel to provide supervision services in schools on a temporary contractual basis.</P>
      <P>Supervisors who contracted for delivery of supervision services are being remunerated at a daily contract rate of &euro;68.56, £54, based on a minimum of two hours supervision. Where further supervision above these two hours is required this is being remunerated at &euro;34.28, £27, per additional hour. This is the equivalent to the hourly rate offered to teachers. To put schools in funds for the purposes of the contingency arrangements, an initial payment was made to schools by my Department on 28 February 2002, which was based upon six weeks of the annual grant, calculated on the basis of &euro;1,270, £1,000, per whole time equivalent teacher post per annum, with a stipulation that further payments of the grant will be made to schools at the appropriate stages of the contingency. In addition, funding was provided to cover employers PRSI, holiday pay and administrative costs. In aggregate, the sum dispersed to schools was approximately &euro;7 million, £5.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contingency plan acknowledges that supplementary allocations may need to be made to some schools at a later stage if their approved outgoings are greater than the amount of the grant. Accordingly, the final costs are not yet <Col N="1080" /> available. The joint managerial body placed advertisements on behalf of the managerial authorities in the national media over the weekend of 16 and 17 February. In addition, the JMB organised training on a regional basis and operated a telephone help-line for schools. My Department has recouped &euro;114,258.47, £89,985.86, to the JMB to offset the cost of providing these services to date. Information concerning the number of supervisors employed is not readily available as these personnel are recruited directly by the school authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has statutory responsibility for the provision of residential places for children up to the age of 16 years who are referred by the courts. There are five young offender centres under the aegis of my Department. They are:</P>
      <P>Trinity House, Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin</P>
      <P>Oberstown Boys Centre, Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin</P>
      <P>Oberstown Girls Centre, Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin</P>
      <P>Finglas Child and Adolescent Centre, Kildonan Road, Finglas West, Dublin 11, and</P>
      <P>St. Joseph's Special School, Ferryhouse, Clonmel, County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>The centres provide residential care, education and training programmes for the children remanded or committed by the courts. The focus of these programmes is to change the offending behaviour of the children and prepare them for reintegration following release. Individual care plans are devised to meet the needs of each young person in order to ensure that these are addressed in a holistic and comprehensive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young offender centres provide residential accommodation for up to 162 children, which includes up to 31 remand places. The current operational capacity of the centres is 125 children. The reduced operational capacity is caused mainly by refurbishment and redevelopment work. The operational capacity of these facilities will fluctuate from time to time to facilitate refur<Col N="1081" /> bishment and new developments. Capacity is also reduced where a centre is required to make special arrangements in order to cater for a particularly difficult child. The total number of vacant places in the centres currently stands at 12. They are six in St Joseph's, Clonmel, four in Trinity House and two in Finglas Children's Centre. My Department has commissioned an independent review of the residential requirements for young offenders. The purpose of this review is to ensure that there are sufficient residential places available to meet the needs of the target group in the short, medium and longer term. A consultant has been appointed and it is expected that his <Col N="1082" /> report will be available shortly. The outcome of this review will inform future development plans in this area.</P>
    <P>The total number of permanent staff employed in the centres is currently 376. In addition to this there are 12 part time and 56 relief staff employed. The number of staff vacancies in the centres currently stands at 32. This number includes relief staff vacancies and a number of recently sanctioned positions to staff new pre-release units to be opened shortly at Trinity House and Oberstown girls centre.</P>
    <P>The following tables set out the operating costs of the five centres for the past five years.</P>

      <P>The decision to the postpone in-service in post-primary schools relates to provision planned to take place within the school day only. This decision was taken, in agreement with the school management authorities, in order to reduce the need for substitution cover and thus alleviate pressure and minimise disruption in schools in the current situation. To ensure that adequate support will be available to teachers to enable implementation as planned of all revised syllabuses and also to provide ongoing professional support, a range of support materials and resources for teachers is being developed by the various subject support services and my Department. Full details of these materials will be made available by 30 April 2002.</P>

      <P>At present, the courses run in the State <Col N="1083" /> that allow for appointment to a permanent post in a primary school are the Bachelor of Education degree and the full-time, 18 month graduate diploma in primary teaching. Both of these courses are run in the colleges of education, which specialise in the training of primary teachers. The graduate diploma course was introduced as a response to a shortage in the supply of primary teachers and has been provided by the colleges of education for the past number of years. The most recent course commenced in February of this year. Discussions will be held in the near future with the colleges of education in relation to providing another course in 2003.</P>
      <P>The Government has taken effective action to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers and to alleviate the current supply difficulties. As part of a range of initiatives to improve teacher supply, the intake to the Bachelor of Education programme in the colleges of education has been increased dramatically in recent years. Since 1999 over 1,000 students have been admitted annually to the programme. This represents a doubling of the number admitted to the programme in 1996. The total intake to the colleges of education in the 2001-2002 academic year increased to a record 1,461. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are currently some 3,750 students enrolled and pursuing various stages of primary teacher training programmes in the colleges of education. The number of places made available on the graduate diploma courses since 1997 is 1,453. Between 2001 and 2002 it is projected that some 2,300 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated. Other initiatives to increase the number of trained personnel have also been introduced. Bachelor of Education graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the Higher Diploma in Education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers. Since September 2000, teachers employed in a temporary capacity holding a degree and the Higher Diploma in Education are paid on the trained basic scale for teachers. Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU trained teachers previously had to acquire the necessary competence in the Irish language within three years of their first appointment to a primary school. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have provided that these teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language. In addition, for the period of two years from 1 September 2000, teachers trained outside the EU whose qualifications are accepted by my Depart<Col N="1084" /> ment will be granted provisional recognition for five years on the same basis as EU trained teachers.</P>
    <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dun Laoghaire, which is recognised by the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, are also recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers. These Montessori trained teachers are also granted restricted recognition to teach in a temporary or permanent capacity in certain special schools and special classes. The decision to grant fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State restricted recognition to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers. All aspects of primary teacher training are the subject of ongoing review between my Department and the colleges of education. My Department is also examining further options to address the teacher supply issue in consultation with relevant interests.</P>

      <P>A working group was set up in autumn 1997 to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy school bags. The terms of reference of the working group were to consider the issue of heavy school bags and in particular the extent of the problem; the factors which contribute to the problem; and possible implications of the problem, particularly for the health of pupils.</P>
      <P>The group was also asked to formulate proposals to alleviate problems associated with the weight of schoolbags. The group presented its report in July 1998. The group's report outlined a number of recommendations that had implications, not only for my Department, but also for schools, parents and publishers. I have asked my officials to forward a copy of the report to the Deputy. The report acknowledged that many of the solutions belong at local school level and one of the main recommendations related to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard my Department, at primary and post-primary levels, initiated an awareness raising campaign by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-primary schools. Information leaflets and posters were also distributed to all schools, highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outlining a range of local measures that could <Col N="1085" /> be adopted in order to alleviate the problem. It is a matter for each individual school to choose those measures that would be most suited to its individual needs.</P>

      <P>Sa bhliain 1999, chuaigh Ollscoil na hÉireann, Gaillimh, chun cainte leis na hollscoileanna eile a bhfuil ceantar Gaeltachta ina n-abhantrach ar mhaithe le moltaí a dhéanamh maidir le forbairt an oideachais tríú leibhéal sa Ghaeltacht.

      <P>The adult literacy services are delivered locally by the vocational education committees with funding provided by my Department. Within the constraints of its grant for this purpose, each VEC is free to decide on the manner of delivery, including the location of literacy centres and whether literacy tutors and organisers should be full or part-time staff. In April 2001, my Department introduced a structure for the employment of full-time literacy organisers, covering communications, recruitment, pay and conditions. A structure for part-time organisers is in course <Col N="1086" /> of preparation. Returns from vocational education committees to the Department for the service for December 2001 show that, of literacy tutors and organisers, 57 and 61 respectively are full-time and 1,193 and 80 are part-time. There are also 4,136 voluntary tutors.</P>

      <P>There has been no delay in implementing workplace literacy programmes. The National Adult Literacy Agency has trained a number of tutors to provide literacy in the workplace and has promoted the availability of the service among employer organisations. A pilot project has started in a large firm in the Dublin area and last year five pilot projects programmes ran successfully for workers in the local authority sector in co-operation between my Department, the National Adult Literacy Agency, the vocational education committees and the Local Government Management Services Board. Half the cost of the programme was paid by the local authority national partnership advisory group, a network representing local authority trade unions and management and half by the Department. It will be expanded further in 2002 and it is intended to eventually make it available to all local authorities that wish to participate. The scheme is tailored to the needs of the participants, which includes scheduling the timing of the tuition in agreement with the employers.</P>

      <P>A full design team was appointed in August 2001 to redevelop Malahide Community School. A stage 1 &ndash; site suitability, briefing and site &ndash; report and stage 2 &ndash; outline sketch scheme &ndash; report was submitted to my Department on 21 December 2001. This report outlined eight possible options for the re-development of the school. A new build option involving the demolition of the existing junior and senior blocks was recommended as the optimum architectural solution. This recommended option is, however, the most expensive. As my Department is charged with the responsibility of ensuring that the best value for money is obtained from any investment in a school, it could not justify committing itself to this option without exploring further some of the refurbishment and extension options. Accordingly, the design team was asked to explore some of the refurbishment options further. This information was submitted in mid February 2002 and is currently being assessed by staff in the building unit. My Department must be convinced that the design solution will provide a building, which is viable from an educational, architectural and economic point of view. I can assure the Deputy that in the redevelopment of Malahide Community School my Department will make every effort to ensure minimum disruption to the school's daily activities and the issue of additional external playing facilities required by the school will be addressed also.</P>

The Government is determined to address the historical deficit in education infrastructure. However, it is clearly not possible to wipe out in the lifetime of one Government the cumulative deficit of generations and to deal with emerging needs at the same time. The Government is committed to continuing the work it has started and to building on the substantial progress that has already been made in order to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met. Projects for the provision of new and improved accommodation at primary and post-primary schools currently in architectural planning will proceed to the invitation of tenders on a phased basis under the Government's expanded building programme.</P>

      <P>The report of the national social work qualifications board of July 2000 provides baseline information on social work posts in Ireland, based on a survey of the position as at 1 September 1999. The survey concluded there were not enough qualified social workers available to fill available posts and that an increase in the number of graduates from professional social work courses would be required in order to meet future demand. The report outlined how any increase in training places is intrinsically linked to practice placement opportunities. Quality practice placements are at the core of social work training and constitute 50% of course time. The report noted a crisis in supply of practice placements due to a lack of formalised structures and resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On foot of this report, my officials are engaged in detailed discussions with the Higher Education Authority, the Department of Health and Children and the national social work qualifications board in regard to training places for social workers. The Department of Health and Children is putting arrangements in place to ensure an adequate supply of quality practice placements. A considerable expansion in provision has been <Col N="1090" /> agreed, with an additional 35 places being provided in the current academic year to bring the total number of places available to 137. Further expansion is planned for the 2002-03 and 2003-04 academic years. The national social work qualifications board is currently undertaking a follow up survey on the position pertaining as at 1 September 2001.</P>

      <P>The Central Applications Office has made available interim application figures for 2002. It should be noted that late applications can be received up to 1 May 2002 and that applicants can amend their preferences up to 1 July 2002.</P>
      <P>In relation to applications for courses in the science and applied science category, the figures can be broken down between applications for diploma and certificate courses and degree courses. In absolute terms, when the interim application figures for 2002 are compared with those for 2001, they reveal a decrease from 5,097 first preferences for science-applied science degree programmes in 2001 to 4,863 first preferences in 2002, which represents a 4.6% decrease. In terms of diploma and certificate courses, the number of first preference applications for science-applied science courses increased from 3,697 in 2001 to 3,955 in 2002, which represents an increase of 7%.</P>
      <P>In terms of the proportion of first preference applicants in all subject areas, the interim first preference application figure for diploma and certificate courses in science-applied science for 2002 stands at 8.1%, which is an increase on last year's equivalent figure of 7.2%. In relation to degree courses, the corresponding proportion for science-applied science has declined from 10% in 2001 to 9.5% in 2002. In this regard, of the first round degree offers made in science-applied science in 2001, 2,130 had first preferences in science-applied science, which implies a ratio of 2.4 first preferences to first round offers. A constant level of first round first preference degree offers for 2002 would result in a ratio of 2.3 first preferences to first round offers.</P>
      <P>I am concerned to ensure that every effort is made to maintain participation rates in the sciences. In this context, I set up a task force on the physical sciences, under the chairmanship of Dr. Danny O'Hare, to identify the issues contributing to falling uptake of the physical sciences at second and third level and to recommend additional measures to address these issues. I expect to receive the task force's final report shortly.</P>

      <P>The 1995 OECD international adult literacy survey found some 500,000 Irish adults between the ages of 16-64 scoring at the bottom literacy level while 16%-17% of under 25 year olds surveyed were at this level.</P>
      <P>The national adult literacy strategy was given top priority in the White Paper on adult education, Learning for Life, published in 2000. Investment in this area has increased 16 fold since the OECD report was published, from just over &euro;1 million in 1997 to &euro;16.460 million in the current year. The funds are being used to expand the scale and scope of provision, support awareness promotion, outreach, the development of referral networks and flexible provision, and to promote quality. New forms of provision, such as family learning, workplace learning, provision for special needs and for those for whom English is not the mother tongue, form part of the strategy, as well as optimising the use of TV and radio, so that people can access help in the privacy of their homes. The TV and radio programmes have been supported by the provision of free learner packs and a freephone helpline manned by trained tutors provided by the national adult literacy agency. Videos of the TV series are being made available free in adult literacy centres, training centres, libraries and video outlets.</P>
      <P>Since the adult literacy budget was increased, participation in VEC literacy schemes has increased from 5,000 in 1997 to 22,733 in December, 2001. In addition to this, 235,000 people per week availed of help in their own homes through watching the second TV literacy tuition series, READ WRITE NOW. Preventative measures are in operation in first and second level schools. The results of the OECD PISA survey were published in December 2001. This was a survey of literacy, maths and science attainment levels of 15 year olds across 32 countries. While the maths and science results showed Ireland performing around the OECD mean, the results for reading literacy were particularly good, with Ireland ranked fifth out of all countries surveyed, and with only 11% of students performing at or below the bottom literacy level &ndash; level 1. This compares with 16-17% of under 25s in the previous OECD adult literacy survey performing at level 1.</P>

      <P>My Department has a library with a staff of one information manager, one cataloguer, two HEOs, one EO, one SO and three COs. All its staff but one are established civil servants recruited in the normal way through the Civil Service Commission. One member of staff with a professional library qualification was recruited by my Department through a process of open competition. There are no vacancies in the library at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the bodies under the aegis of this Department, although they are independent of the Department, I do have ministerial responsibility in respect of certain administrative matters relating to the Offices of the Attorney General, Chief State Solicitor, Director of Public Prosecutions and the Central Statistics Office. The Office of the Attorney General maintains a library in its premises on Merrion Street. It is headed by a professional law librarian, a permanent, full-time civil servant, and provides access to all relevant information sources useful to the work of the office. In addition to the law librarian, the library's full complement of staff is a systems librarian, a research librarian, a know-how officer and a clerical officer. Additionally, three legal researchers working on contract with the office are attached to the library. Currently the research librarian, the systems librarian and the know how officer positions are vacant. The Civil Service Commission is running two competitions seeking professionally qualified librarians to fill the research and the systems librarian posts. Previously, both these positions were filled on a contract basis but both are now permanent Civil Service posts. The office is waiting for the Civil <Col N="1096" /> Service Commission to issue an excluding order for the purposes of enabling the office to recruit, on a contract basis, a know how officer.</P>
    <P>The Chief State Solicitor's Office has a library with a staff of one librarian and one clerical officer. There is a vacancy for an assistant librarian which it is in the process of filling; the Civil Service Commission will advertise the vacancy within the next month. Vacancies are filled in the normal way through the Civil Service Commission. The Law Reform Commission has at its disposal a well resourced library with a staff of two &ndash; a legal information manager and a cataloguer. Staff of the library are recruited by the Law Reform Commission having received the consent of the Attorney General and with the approval of the Minister for Finance in accordance with the terms of the Law Reform Commission Act, l975. There are no vacancies at present.</P>
    <P>There are two libraries in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions &ndash; one in Merrion Street and one currently being established in Upper Abbey Street. In Merrion Street there is a law librarian and a staff officer looking after the library. The law librarian was recruited through an open competition run by the Office of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners. The staff officer took up duty through an internal transfer within the office. The library in Upper Abbey Street will be staffed by an assistant librarian and the library assistant. These are in the process of being recruited through an open competition recently run by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. At this stage, we are awaiting assignment notices from the Civil Service Commission. I have granted approval and both candidates have received security clearance. Temporarily, a clerical officer has been assigned to assist in setting up the new library. The clerical officer was also recruited through an open competition run by the Office of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners. In time, he will be re-assigned elsewhere in the office.</P>
    <P>The Central Statistics Office has libraries at its Cork and Dublin offices, where a wide range of Irish and international statistical publications are available. The staff in the CSO libraries are civil servants in general service grades, recruited through the normal channels via the Civil Service Commission.</P>

      <Quest>the basis of the information contained in the recent report from the Central Statistics Office which showed that County Laois has the lowest per capita income in the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office issued a report, &ldquo;County Incomes and Regional GDP 1999&rdquo;, in January 2002. The release was in two parts. The first part related to household incomes in counties and regions while the second part dealt with gross value added, that is, the output of goods and services in each of the eight regional authority regions. In the first part Laois featured as the county with the lowest <i>per capita </i>household income in 1999.</P>
      <P>Estimates were provided of (a) primary income, that is, wages and salaries, self-employed income, rent of dwellings and interest and dividends; (b) total income derived by adding social transfer payments to primary income; and (c) disposable income obtained by subtracting income taxes from total income. Laois was the county which in 1999 had the lowest total income and disposable income per head of population.</P>
      <P>Household income is calculated in accordance with the national accounts definitions. It includes the value of own farm consumption and earned income in kind as well as the imputed rent of owner occupied dwellings, that is, the estimated rent that the owner-occupier would have to pay for the dwelling if it were rented. The social transfers include the imputed value of some non-cash transfers such as secondary and university education, free medical drugs, free fuel and transport for the elderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county estimates are derived by allocating to counties the various components of household income included in the national income and expenditure estimates. The allocation is done by <Col N="1098" /> sector of economic activity. Various sources are used for the association, such as CSO surveys and information from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Teagasc for the agricultural sector; CSOs census of industrial production for industry; information on wages and salaries or employment from semi-State bodies, for example, Bord na Móna, ESB, CIE, etc.; data provided by the public service &ndash; including education &ndash; on wages and salaries by county; CSOs QNHS for estimation of rents; and information from various Departments on social transfer payments.</P>
    <P>The latest release covered the year 1999 although the national accounts are available for the year 2000 with quarterly estimates available up to the third quarter of 2001. However, the regional and county data must, of necessity, be published somewhat later than the national estimates as the results of detailed surveys, such as the census of industrial production, are necessary in order to make the estimates at county level.</P>

      <P>The precise information requested by the Deputy is not available. The farm structure survey provides information on the number of farms with over one hectare of land farmed and a breakdown of the number of full-time and part-time farmers is also available. In this context, full-time means farmers whose sole occupation is farming; those who answered that farming was either a major or subsidiary occupation are classified as part-time.</P>
      <P>The relevant farm structure survey figures, starting with the 1991 census of agriculture, are set out in the following table. Earlier farm structure survey figures are not directly comparable with these.</P>

      <P>The following tables set out the regional data on gross value added in current terms for the years 1997 to 1999 and the regional levels of employment and unemployment for the years from 1997 to 2001, together with the corresponding annual percentage changes.</P>
      <P>Corresponding statistics on the number of jobs created are not available; the annual change in the number of persons in employment reflects the net balance between jobs created and jobs lost. The tables on GVA show GVA at current basic prices and GVA per person at current basic prices in each of the regions. The annual percentage changes include the effects of price changes. GVA measures the value of goods and services, or part thereof, which are produced within a region. The GVA shown is measured at basic prices which means that product taxes are excluded while product subsidies are included.</P>
      <P>GVA is not a measure of household income. It differs from household income in three main respects. First, GVA includes profits of companies and company profits which accrue to non-residents are considerable. Second, the workforce which produces the GVA in a region may not live there and may bring their incomes home to a neighbouring region. Third, personal income includes items such as social welfare benefits and factor income from abroad which are not included in GVA.</P>
      <P>Details of household incomes are available in the CSO release, &ldquo;County Incomes and Regional GDP 1999&rdquo;, which was published in January of this year.</P>

      <P>I should point out that the provision of State support in respect of industrial development is a day to day matter for the industrial development agencies under the aegis of my Department and not one for which I, as Minister, would have a direct function. The relevant agencies are IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development, FÁS and the county enterprise boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not clear from the text of the question what the term &ldquo;region&rdquo; means in this context. I assume the Deputy is referring to the Objective 1 and Objective 2 regions, which only took effect from 1 January 2000 under the provisions of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. On that <Col N="1103" /> basis, the information is therefore presented on the basis of the two regions from 2000 to 2001 and on the basis of all one region from 1997 to 1999. It should also be noted that figures for 1997 are cumulative for that year &ndash; it is not possible to provide a breakdown of the information from June 1997. Figures for 2002 are not yet available.</P>
    <P>The information sought by the Deputy is contained in the tabular statements which are included in the Official Report. Agency expenditure in support of industrial enterprises takes the form of direct grants to companies and, where appropriate, financial support for capital expenditure, including property. All figures are shown in punt equivalents as this was the currency that pertained during the period 1997-2001.</P>

      <P>My Department, through the industrial development agencies under its aegis, provides support for the establishment and development of indigenous enterprises nationally. The 35 city and county enterprise boards provide support on a national basis for the establishment and further development of micro <Col N="1105" /> enterprises. The boards, which were established nationally in 1993, provide a source of support for small businesses with ten employees or fewer.</P>
      <P>The function of the boards is to develop indigenous enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity at local level. The boards provide a single point of contact at local level and complement the activities of the other industrial development agencies. The boards support individuals, firms and community groups, provided that the projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability.</P>
      <P>In accordance with its legislative and policy basis, Enterprise Ireland provides support to indigenous companies that are market led and export driven and operate primarily in the manufacturing and internationally trading services sectors. Assistance is provided in accordance with EU limits for support. Enterprise Ireland's strategy is to work with companies on a case by case basis, to assess the development needs of each individual company. A business plan, covering a three to five year period, is required by Enterprise Ireland to assess all projects, which must also meet certain defined criteria. Levels of financial support are determined by the regional location of the project. Any expenditure incurred on a project prior to the initiation of discussions with Enterprise Ireland is ineligible for support.</P>
      <P>Given the absence of specific details with regard to the company referred to in the question, it is not possible to provide a specific response to the issue raised. However, I can confirm that Enterprise Ireland can assist with the establishment of injection moulding companies which fulfil the following criteria &ndash; they have a real potential for growth in export markets and they intend to develop value added products. Should the company in question wish to pursue possible assistance from Enterprise Ireland, I will be happy to supply contact details directly to the Deputy if he wishes.</P>
      <P>FÁS, the training and development agency under my Department's aegis, may also be able to assist the person in this instance. Any person who wishes to establish &ldquo;a wholly owned Irish company&rdquo; may contact FÁS for advice on human relations development related issues on running a business, including &ldquo;owner manager development&rdquo;. In addition, a customised training budget is available from FÁS to provide limited training grants to a person who wishes to establish a business subject to normal conditions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112, 113, 115, 122 and 123 together.</P>
      <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies. EU law prevents both me and the Department from intervening on the matter of premium levels or in respect of the risks insurance companies are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk.</P>
      <P>The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors, both domestic and international, to explain these increases, including the high cost of settling claims, the general reduction in investment returns, recent court decisions regarding the calculation of compensation losses in personal injury cases and the affects of the 11 September attacks in the United States of America.</P>
      <P>Representations being made to me suggest that many businesses seek insurance cover from sources outside Ireland. Availability from these sources has contracted, as capacity in the international market has been impaired following the events of 11 September last.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by businesses in getting cover, even at very high premiums. I am arranging to meet the Irish Insurance Federation once again and representatives of the main insurers here to discuss these difficulties. I will be encouraging them to develop, in consultation with their clients, innovative strategies for controlling risk. It is my hope that such strategies will contribute towards a moderation of prices.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, I am awaiting the report of the interdepartmental implementation group set up to progress the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, so that the board may be set up as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, has just finalised its report and arrangements for both printing and publication are currently being made. Further work to improve health and safety standards in the workplace is also in progress.</P>

      <P>A group was <Col N="1108" /> established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness with terms of reference to &ldquo;examine the issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, including the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing up-rating or indexation of payments having regard to the long-term budgetary, PRSI contribution, distributive and incentive implications, in light of trends in economic, demographic and labour market patterns.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The group consisted of the Departments of Finance, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment as well as representatives of the employer, trades union, farming and community and voluntary pillars. The group was chaired by an independent chairperson.</P>
      <P>In the light of the various issues examined, a majority of the group considered that a target of 27% of gross average industrial earnings, GAIE, for the lowest social welfare payments was not an unreasonable policy objective to be met in full by 2007.</P>
      <P>As set out in paragraph 8.4.5 of the report the view of my Department, along with the representatives of the Department of Finance and the employer pillar, is it was inappropriate to establish a formal benchmark and that the existing arrangements which have seen real increases, that is, in excess of inflation, in welfare rates should continue to apply. Essentially, it would be left to the discretion of the Government to determine the level of welfare increases from year to year having regard to the range of high priority demands on the Exchequer and to the issue of affordability, sustainability and compatibility with the social economic and employment needs of the economy on a continuing basis.</P>

      <P>The activity to which the Deputy refers is often called &ldquo;gifting&rdquo;, which has some of the characteristics of pyramid selling. Pyramid selling is covered by the Pyramid Selling Act, 1980. However the Office of the Attorney General has considerable doubts as to whether such &ldquo;gifting&rdquo; schemes are covered by the Act. The gardaí who enforce the Act take the view that these schemes are not covered by the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main difficulty with any legislation seeking to deal with a complex problem of this kind is <Col N="1109" /> to steer a course between making very specific provisions which may be circumvented by future developments of the targeted schemes and, on the other hand, catching bona fide arrangements such as savings and spending schemes. We are, however, still exploring the legislative option as well as administrative steps which might be taken.</P>
    <P>One of the options which I intend to explore is the possibility of dealing with &ldquo;gifting&rdquo; schemes under gambling legislation. I have asked my officials to explore this possibility with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In the meanwhile I repeat my previous warnings that people should be extremely cautious in investing their money in schemes which appear to be too good to be true.</P>

      <P>The task force recommended a series of actions to be taken at both enterprise and State level. The main recommendations requiring State action include: (i) the designation of the Health and Safety Authority as the central co-ordinating State agency; (ii) the establishment of an advisory committee on workplace bullying within the Health and Safety Authority; (iii) the introduction of three codes of practice on workplace bullying and harassment under (a) the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, (b) the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 and (c) the Employment Equality Act, 1998; and (iv) the development of a dignity in the workplace charter.</P>
      <P>Progress to date includes the establishment of the advisory committee and a bullying response unit, within the Health and Safety Authority, the development and launch of the dignity in the workplace charter, which has been endorsed by the ICTU, IBEC and CIF, and which has been widely distributed by the Health and Safety Authority.

      <P>All fishing vessels which are engaged in commercial sea fishing are legally required to have a sea fishing boat licence. I have introduced a new scheme to provide for the licensing and registration of small inshore fishing <Col N="1114" /> vessels. The scheme is open to all inshore fishermen around the coast who for various reasons have not previously applied to be registered. As a concession to the normal conditions for the licensing of fishing vessels, the scheme allows vessel owners to provide replacement capacity on a phased basis. In addition, I am seeking the approval of the European Commission for amendments to the scheme that would provide that vessel owners will only be required to provide 50% replacement capacity in respect of their vessel in the context of the creation of a new inshore segment in the fishing fleet. While I am not providing grant aid for the purchase of tonnage, I have substantially increased investment support for the inshore sector and over &euro;2 million has been earmarked this year for initiatives for the inshore sector around the coast. These initiatives will help enhance the earning potential of inshore fishermen and support the sustainable management and development of the sector into the future.</P>

      <P>The safe loading, unloading and transportation of cargo is a matter for the master and owner of a vessel and it is their responsibility to ensure compliance with all relevant requirements relating to such operations. I understand that the question relates primarily to loading ramps of the type used to load vehicles from the quay to the vessel. I am advised that the vessel in <Col N="1115" /> question is a combined passenger and cargo vessel that operates between Galway and the Aran Islands. I understand that, in general, fixed loading ramps are fitted to vessels in which the carriage of vehicles is part of the vessel's operation, as in the case of a roll-on-roll-off vessel where the owners drive their own vehicles on and off the vessel. I am informed that as the vessel in question is not intended for such operations, it is accordingly not fitted with fixed loading ramps. However, I understand that the vessel is used to transport vehicles such as tractors, cars and small trucks on an irregular basis as cargo. I am advised that the vessel's design, including stability considerations, is suitable for the transportation of such vehicles and I am also advised that arrangements for loading and unloading these vehicles are satisfactory.</P>

      <P>The vessel in question is a class IIA passenger vessel that has been certified by my Department to carry 96 passengers in summer and 66 passengers in winter. The vessel is permitted to operate between Galway and the Aran Islands. The vessel does not hold a loadline certificate, which is the certificate necessary for any vessel which proceeds to sea carrying cargo. Accordingly, the vessel may operate as a passenger-carrying vessel in place of the normal ferry operating to the Aran Islands, but it may not carry cargo.</P>
      <P>My Department has advised the operators that their vessel would require a loadline certificate to carry cargo that would not be regarded as passengers' personal effects and baggage. However, I have also been advised that the vessel is currently undergoing survey for the renewal of the passenger ship's certificate and that the owners have requested a survey for the issue of a loadline certificate to the vessel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 to 138, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Immediately on coming into office in January 2000, I moved quickly to take effective measures to ensure that the national salmon resource is managed in a sustainable way for the benefit of all legitimate stakeholders. The report of the salmon management task force 1996 is a key document that has informed my consideration of this matter.</P>
      <P>One of the key recommendations of the task force was the establishment of a national commission involving representatives of all interests in salmon. In March 2000 I established, on a statutory basis, the National Salmon Commission to assist and advise me in respect of the management of the national salmon resource. I asked the commission to give me urgent advice on the introduction of a carcass tagging scheme for salmon. Subsequently, on the advice of the commission, I introduced the tagging scheme commencing on 1 January 2001. The purpose of this scheme is to provide a verifiable count of the catch by all sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following further advice from the commission I introduced a prohibition on the sale of salmon <Col N="1117" /> caught by rod and line and a bag limit of one salmon per angler per day until 31 May in each year.</P>
    <P>Commercial fishing for salmon is permitted only within six nautical miles of the baseline and within the set season for each type of fishing engine. Within the season there are restrictions relating to the days and times of fishing operations and the types of fishing gear that may be used. Furthermore, the number of licences that may be issued by the regional fisheries boards for the various types of fishing engines is limited by the provisions of the Control of Fishing for Salmon Orders. This effort limitation regime is in line with the recommendations of the task force.</P>
    <P>Another of the recommendations of the task force was the introduction of a total allowable catch for the taking of salmon and it recommended that this be set at 900 tonnes in 1997 and that this be shared in the proportions of 64% to the drift net fishery, 18% to other commercial fishing engines and 18% to the recreational rod fishery. However, it is clear from the scientific advice from the Marine Institute, based on latest stock assessment data, that reductions in overall fishing effort are now required in order to sustain and rebuild salmon stocks.</P>
    <P>Informed by the scientific advice, I recently announced a number of management measures in relation to the commercial fishing sector in 2002 and beyond. These measures include: (a) the introduction of fishery district quotas for the taking of salmon by all commercial fishing engines to deliver a percentage reduction over catches in the baseline years of 1997 to 2001; (b) a review of the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order is under way by a subgroup of the National Salmon Commission working with my Department and the fisheries boards. The review is examining the changes needed to deliver significant rationalisation of categories and numbers of commercial fishing licences. Subject to the emerging advice, any changes will be put in place for the 2003 season; (c) in the context of the introduction of district quotas for commercial fishing engines I am prepared to consider in principle some adjustment in the current effort limitation measures for 2002. In particular, I will positively review the case for the introduction of safety days as requested by the sector itself; (d) a review of the case for standardising the length of offshore drift nets from 732 metres and 1,372 metres to a standard 1,000 metres in all districts.</P>
    <P>I have also raised with my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the concerns of fishermen regarding seal predation on salmon stocks.</P>
    <P>The National Salmon Commission has unanimously adopted my proposals for the introduction of fishery district quotas to be administered through the salmon tagging scheme. My Department is currently consulting the commission regarding the necessary changes to the regulatory framework for the tagging scheme. I have also mandated the chief executives of the fisheries <Col N="1118" /> boards to meet with the representatives of the commercial salmon fishing sector to discuss the practical administrative arrangements for the tagging and quota system for the coming season. Moreover, I have asked that the means of sharing the quota in each fishery district among the various kinds of commercial fishing engines be developed also in this context and in consultation with local BIM development officials.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the scientific model for analysis of salmon stocks will continue to be refined in the light of data relating to marine survival, catches, spawning escapement and habitat. A key element of this approach is the installation and operation of fish counters on salmon index rivers. The Marine Institute informs me that, in co-operation with other stakeholders, it has installed counting systems on 22 rivers since 1995. My Department is currently working with the Marine Institute and the fisheries boards to ensure that the operational, data management and quality assurance issues related to the counter programme are addressed in order to allow for the scientific model to be refined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 69 and 134 on 21 November 2001 in which I outlined the discussions at ministerial and departmental level with Mr. Orri Vigfusson who is chairman of the North Atlantic Salmon Fund, NASF. As I explained in that reply, the NASF, as a lobby group, works to conserve and restore salmon stocks by focusing in particular on voluntary quota buy-outs with commercial salmon fishermen through a mix of public and private funding.</P>
      <P>I am committed to a sustainable commercial salmon fishery having as its central focus quality and value rather than volume. Taking all factors into account, however, it remains my firm policy objective to reduce the commercial salmon catch while enhancing the price dividend for fishermen through quality and marketing strategies.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the scientific advice of the Marine Institute that reductions in overall fishing effort are required in order to sustain and rebuild salmon stocks on a fishery district basis. Accordingly, I have recently announced the introduction of quotas for the taking of salmon by commercial fishing engines on a fishery district basis. The quota system will come into operation for the 2002 and later fishing seasons. These proposals have been unanimously adopted by the national salmon commission.</P>
      <P>The introduction of district quotas to reduce the level of commercial catch this year will not be accompanied by compensation. I have spelt out my reservations about national buy-out as a cost efficient workable instrument. It is clear that buy-out is most attractive to those who take few salmon. It is not an effective means of achieving the objective of a restoration of salmon stocks. Accordingly, I have ruled out buy-outs as the way forward. I believe that the focus on this issue has been an unhelpful distraction and the raising of expectations about bonanzas has not served the interests of the sector or indeed the resource. The introduction of quota to achieve catch reductions is in my view the best instrument available to achieve the objective of a restoration of salmon stocks.</P>
      <P>I will continue to support, subject to available Exchequer funding, local catchment based setaside proposals with matching funding. In other words, the only context for incentivisation schemes will still be through an agreed local scheme involving commercial fishermen and all other stakeholders who stand to benefit from increased escapement. I have urged local groups and the regional fisheries boards to develop proposals for such schemes.</P>

      <P>Harbour works orders are issued under section 134 of the Harbours Act, 1946. However, since being incorporated as a State port company in March, 1997, Dublin Port Company operates under the Harbours Acts, 1996, and the facility of a harbour works order no longer applies in its case.</P>
      <P>Dublin Port Company owns the foreshore in question and, as such, the relevant legislation is section 10 of the Foreshore Act, 1933, as amended.</P>
      <P>A new application for permission to reclaim 21 hectares of Dublin port was made on 8 March 2002. The application was accompanied by an EIS. My Department has forwarded the EIS to its consultants for examination to confirm that it meets statutory minimum requirements and constitutes a basis for me to make a decision on the application. The consultants will report in due course and I will then consider whether I can accept the EIS as being adequate. If I find it to be acceptable, it will be necessary for Dublin Port Company to go to public consultation and interested parties will have one month in which to make submissions.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware, from my responses to previous questions on this issue, that in the case of privately owned foreshore, I am only allowed consider applications for permission in the context of impacts upon shipping, fishing and the environment. In order for me to fully consider the impacts upon the environment in a case such as this, I must be satisfied that the development has planning permission before any reclamation work is undertaken.</P>
      <P>Deputies will appreciate that the environmental consequences of reclamation taking place and planning permission being subsequently refused would be entirely different from the environmental consequences of the planned development being developed under planning permission. In the former case we would be faced with a wasteland existing at the entry to Dublin port &ndash; a situation which I think everybody would find unacceptable &ndash; while in the latter we would have a modern, planned and approved commercial development.</P>
      <P>I expect to have the initial report from my Department's consultants within four to six weeks. Assuming that it is satisfactory, the public consultation process can then commence. It is a matter for Dublin Port Company to decide on when it will make an application for planning permission.</P>

The vessel owner may sell this capacity to a third party or use it to licence and register a new vessel without any deduction being applied. There are no limits applied to the length of time this capacity may be held off the register.</P>
    <P>In the context of the planned review of fishing vessel licensing policy, which will be commencing shortly, I will ask the review group to examine the policy in respect of the national reserve for sheep quota and make recommendations in relation to its application to the management of fleet capacity.</P>

    <P>Mr. Ring asked the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources the situation in relation to the tonnage for boats; and if a date has been set for boats to be registered by, in particular for boats used for oyster dredging. [9300/02]</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>All vessels that are engaged in commercial sea fishing, including oyster dredgers, are legally required to be licensed and registered. As a general policy 100% replacement capacity, tonnage and power, is required in respect of vessels being introduced into the segments of the fleet governed by EU regulation, pelagic, beamer and polyvalent segments. Oyster dredgers are normally licensed and registered in the specific <Col N="1129" /> fleet segment which is not governed by EU regulations.</P>
      <P>A moratorium on the introduction of vessels into the specific segment of the Irish fleet was introduced in April 1999. This moratorium applies to vessels targeting wild stocks. It was considered necessary to adopt this policy in order to protect wild bi-valve mollusc stocks, due to their importance for inshore fishing. Accordingly, the Department will only consider licensing vessels in the specific segment targeting wild stocks, where a vessel of similar size and exerting no greater fishing effort is removed from that segment.  In the case of fishing vessels engaged exclusively in aquaculture activity, the Department will consider licensing such vessels in the specific segment, subject to certain conditions.</P>
      <P>While there is no particular deadline in respect of the registration of fishing vessels generally, the owner must apply to have the vessel registered directly following the licensing of the vessel.</P>

      <Col N="1133" />The European Union wishes to convey its solidarity to the family of Ms Betancourt, as well as to the Government and people of Colombia.</P>
    <P>The European Union wishes to reiterate its full support for democracy in Colombia in the face of terrorist acts which attempt to disrupt the electoral campaign.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The kidnapping of Ms Betancourt had been preceded a few days previously by the kidnapping of Senator Jorge Eduardo Gechen Turbay, following which President Pastrana broke off talks with the FARC and ordered them to leave the clearance zone which had been ceded to them to facilitate the peace process.</P>
    <P>The European Union stated its full understanding of the decision President Pastrana felt obliged to take and profoundly regretted FARC's lack of willingness seriously to advance the peace process as demonstrated by its grave provocations, which, together with the continuing violence by the paramilitaries of the AUC, has disappointed the hopes of the Colombian people. The EU renewed its urgent appeal for respect for international humanitarian law and the protection of the civilian population, while reiterating to the Colombian people the EU's support for any viable initiative to establish a genuine dialogue with a view to ending the conflict.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the breakdown of the peace process, the EU's economic and social support for peace in Colombia remains in place and on 25 February 2002 in Bogota the Spanish Presidency and the Colombian Government signed an agreement to finance a peace laboratory programme in the Middle Magdalena region. The agreement was signed in the presence of the Jesuit priest and human rights defender, Fr. Francisco de Roux, who directs the foundation which will implement the programme. The EU will contribute &euro;35 million, while Colombia's share is &euro;7.4 million. The investment will finance a wide range of development projects to help give a better future to the ordinary people of Colombia.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that this question refers to the Deloitte &amp; Touche report on Ireland Aid procurement practices, which was mentioned in a recent article in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this report dealt mainly with controls over procurement, and found that these are adequate, properly applied in accordance with <Col N="1134" /> the relevant guidelines and directives and effective in practice, it referred in passing to the issue of staffing arrangements in Ireland Aid in the context of the expanding aid programme. The consultants said that their discussions pointed to a need for significant changes in the manner in which Ireland Aid is managed and staffed. The lack of long-term career paths for development professionals under the current arrangements seemed to them to seriously undermine the capacity of Ireland Aid to develop structures required to meet the challenges posed by projected future growth in funding. While recommendations as to appropriate structural changes were outside the scope of their assignment, the consultants saw urgent implementation of necessary change as a priority.</P>
    <P>Ireland Aid is fully seized of the importance of creating long-term career paths for development professionals and has been engaged in discussions on this subject with the Department of Finance. The objective is to achieve arrangements under which professional staff would be given, <i>inter alia</i>, longer contracts and a new grading structure. Some progress is being made in this respect. This is also one of the issues with which the review of Ireland Aid has concerned itself. The review committee has recently completed its report and this will be published in the very near future.

      <P>Since the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF, was published in February 2000, I commenced AER V, a competition to support the construction of 255 MW of renewable energy based electricity generating facilities more than doubling any previous offer. The competition was oversubscribed and I have made conditional offers of contracts for 362 MW.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike the previous four competitions, planning consent was a pre-condition of entry into AER V. The previous four competitions delivered 130 MW. I am confident AER V can outperform the total achieved under these four competitions. In addition, in the small scale wind category, I allowed a higher bid price; reduced the project size cap from 5MW to 3MW and prohibited any person with an interest in a large scale projects from bidding for the higher prices in the small scale category. This step has allowed bona fide small-scale local community projects to compete with a reasonable expectation of success. I believe these are significant steps forward in optimising the contribution from renewable energies and wind energy in particular. The next step is to deliver my overall target of 500 MW by 2005. <Col N="1136" /> I expect to move to the next support measure, AER VI, shortly.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives, since the publication of PPF, include the procurement of a digitised wind resource map to assist both planners and developers and proposed investments in grid infrastructure for wind energy projects. In addition, the Irish Energy Centre, which is co-funded by my Department, has put out to public consultation a significant draft investment programme in renewable energy technologies. These mutually reinforcing measures will hasten the optimal contribution of renewable energy sources as set out in the PPF.</P>

      <Quest>the total State investment made in each region since June 1997 in respect of telecommunications; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Investment in telecommunications networks and services is a matter for the companies who now operate in a fully liberalised market. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy. However, I have, in recent years, put in place a number of initiatives, which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in regional Ireland.</P>
      <P>In 1999, under the National Development Plan 1994-1999 and INTERREG II, &euro;26 million &ndash;&euro;13 million in each region &ndash; was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. A total of 13 projects which rolled-out broadband nationwide to a value of &euro;70 million in both public and private funding were supported and are completed. These projects entailed the roll-out of broadband services in the Border, midlands and west region and the south and east region.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the figure allocated to telecommunications initiatives was approximately &euro;200 million. A first call for proposals was run in 2000 and on foot of submissions received, I signed nine contracts at the beginning of last year which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure. The projects involved will be completed over the next two years and will entail overall investment of &euro;160 million in broadband leveraged from grant assistance of approximately &euro;55 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of this &euro;55 million, approximately &euro;1.2 million has been spent in the BMW and &euro;3.4 million in the south and east region to date. Details of these programmes are available on the Internet at www.ndpcomms.gov.ie. At the beginning of August 2001 I announced a second call for pro<Col N="1137" /> posals. The deadline for receipt of proposals was 19 October 2001. In all, 31 proposals have been received. These submissions were independently evaluated and the results of the evaluation finalised at the beginning of this year.</P>
    <P>On foot of the evaluation a number of local authorities have been asked to enter procurement to establish firm prices for their proposals. Once procurement is completed, and subject to satisfactory pricing, contracts will be offered for these projects. It is anticipated that this will take place over the next two months. These proposals involve the construction of metro area fibre optic networks in 19 towns around the country. Networks in other towns are under discussion with the relevant local authorities.</P>
    <P>A number of private sector tenders received in response to the call for proposals are being clarified and may be offered contracts in the coming weeks. Arising from the Government strategy, which I announced on 8 March, a second phase of 48 additional towns will be pursued through a public private partnership model. In addition, a sum of &euro;76 million has been spent in 2001 and 2002 on property purchase and telecommunications infrastructure for the Digital Hub and MediaLabEurope projects located in the Liberties-Coombe area of Dublin. My Department is also funding 32 CAIT projects in the BMW region to a sum of &euro;2.3 million and 39 projects in the south and east region to a sum of &euro;2.8 million.</P>

      <P>I have pursued a policy of promotion of the generation of electricity from renewable energy technologies. This policy is grounded on issues of security of energy supply, fuel import substitution and reduction of emissions from fossil fuel electricity generation. To date, these efforts have been focused on developing the renewable energy industry onshore. In that respect progress has been very satisfactory and we are well on the way to achieving the challenging target of 500MW by 2005, which I set in the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy published in September 1999. Currently there are 125MW of renewable energy projects up and running. I recently announced the winning bids in the fifth alternative energy requirement competition under which contracts for 363MW of renewable energy are being awarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in the context of developments onshore that I am currently considering the appropriate policy response to offshore wind. Offshore wind is undoubtedly a technology with great potential. A number of studies of the costs and technical <Col N="1138" /> issues are already in train to ensure potential is harnessed efficiently. In addition, I have asked the Irish Energy Centre to examine all the implications of supporting a smaller scale demonstration project in Irish conditions in the short-term.</P>

      <P>Iarnród Éireann plans to renew the Limerick-Ennis line by end 2003, as originally planned in the safety investment plan. So far, 2.4 miles were relayed in 1997 and five miles in 2000. To date &euro;2.5 million has been spent on the line under the national development plan. The balance of 16.2 miles is to be completed over the period 2002-03 at an estimated cost of &euro;11.2 million. When the track renewal work is completed speeds and journey quality will be improved.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have recently initiated a strategic rail review. This review will examine a range of proposals for railway services in various parts of the country and develop a 20 year blueprint for the future of the network to meet the increasing demand for public transport. Clearly any decision with regard to future funding priorities to maximise the development of the rail network must await the outcome of this review. Therefore, as the Deputy will appreciate, any decision with regard to the Ennis to Athenry line will be taken in the context of the outcome of the strategic rail review.</P>

      <P>I established the renewable energy strategy group in November 1999 to consider the obstacles that could impede the further development of our wind energy resources. In its report, Strategy for Intensifying Wind Energy Deployment, the strategy group recommended, among other things, that a small-scale wind energy category should continue to be supported under my Department's alternative energy requirement <Col N="1139" /> programme. This is the typical project promoted by Meitheal na Gaoithe.</P>
      <P>In AER V, I reduced the upper project size for the small-scale wind energy category from 5 MW to 3 MW and I prohibited anybody with an interest in larger scale projects from availing of the higher prices offered in the small scale category. This has allowed bona fide small scale developers to enter the competition with a reasonable expectation of success. I announced the results of AER V in February of this year. I am delighted that 19 projects were successful in the small sale wind energy category. This represents a total installed capacity of 36 MW with projects ranging in size from 0.65MW to 3MW installed capacity. The successful applicants, including local companies, community groups, farmers, and individuals, have been informed that their projects have been selected to receive a conditional offer of a contract to supply green electricity to the ESB.</P>
      <P>I have already announced my intention to move to the next support measure for renewables, AER VI, in the coming months. I will consult the various industry representative associations with regard to the terms and conditions of this scheme, including continued support for a small-scale wind energy category in the competition. The market mechanism applied &ndash; competitive tendering &ndash; is essential to comply with the European Commission's clearance of the power purchase agreements which it has determined constitute State aid. Grid connections are a matter for the ESB or Eirgrid in the first instance. In the event of any dispute the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, allows for appeals to the Commission for Electricity Regulation and its decision is binding on the supplier under section 34. I have no statutory function in the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann has been undertaking in recent years a programme of track renewal works on the Dublin-Kilkenny-Waterford line. In excess of &euro;22 million has been invested in the programme to date. The final eight miles of track will be completed this year. Iarnród Éireann expects <Col N="1140" /> the work to result in a reduction on journey time of up to ten minutes.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann will shortly begin to take delivery of a new fleet of 80 diesel rail cars, which will start to enter service towards the end of this year. These new railcars will be used both to replace older rolling stock and to increase capacity on existing services. Iarnród Éireann is also examining tenders for the supply of up to 67 new mainline locomotive hauled carriages. When the tendering and contract process is completed, it will take about two years for these carriages to be delivered and put into service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 194 together.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the military authorities that a military board, the Reserve Defence Forces Review Implementation Board, on which the FCA is represented, has been set up at Defence Forces headquarters to formulate specific plans for the implementation of the recommendations of the Reserve steering group. I established the special steering group in 1998 to undertake a study of the Reserve and the group reported to me in September 1999. Under the aegis of the military board, structures have been put in place in each brigade and in the Naval Service to facilitate consultation with FCA and Slua Muirí personnel throughout the country. Given the dependence of the Reserve on voluntary service, I was anxious that there should be an ongoing process of consultation before proposals are finalised.</P>
      <P>The military authorities have advised that the process of formulating revised structures for the Reserve Defence Force is ongoing and the draft Reserve Defence Forces Review Implementation Board report is expected to be submitted to the Chief of Staff shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three-brigade structure and a Defence Forces training centre. The Reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and restructured and it is envisaged that the implementation of these changes in the Reserve Defence Force will take place over a period of approximately six years. The full organisational and establishment details of the new Reserve Force will be deter<Col N="1143" /> mined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process. In order that senior Reserve Defence Force officers can serve and influence Reserve activities at the highest level in brigade headquarters and the Defence Forces training centre, the steering group recommended the creation of four new lieutenant-colonel appointments. It is intended that these appointments will form part of the integrated element of the Reserve and personnel appointed to these appointments would hold them for the duration of their integrated service. While the mechanism for appointing personnel to these appointments has not yet been established, it will form part of the implementation process.</P>

      <P>As stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 175 of 12 February 2002, the 2001 area aid application of the person named has been fully processed and the area determined for payment is 67.99 hectares.</P>
      <P>The person named applied for premium for 38 animals under suckler cow premium 2001. Payment of his 100% entitlement under this scheme has issued. The person named was paid &euro;4,742.92 on 19 March 2002 under the area-based compensatory allowance scheme in respect of 27.92 hectares of more severely handicapped land, lowland, at &euro;88.88 per hectare and 32.08 hectares of mountain land at &euro;57.14 per hectare, maximum eligible area in this case is 60 hectares, and including an additional sum of &euro;428.34 under a compensation package agreed with the European Commission for farmers experiencing losses under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme. The additional sum is equal to 90% of the difference between the average sum of the headage payments to the person named under the 1998, 1999 and 2000 headage schemes and the amount payable under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for premium for seven cows under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. In processing the application for payment, problems arose concerning animal tag number PMA922549. Further clarification was required regarding the breed of this animal. The animal died inside the six months retention period and was replaced as required under the terms and conditions of the scheme, but the death was not notified to the SWS Bandon. The district livestock office of my Department has been in contact with the herd owner advising him to have the details regarding this animal updated on the Bandon database. The application will be processed further when this matter has been finalised.</P>

      <P>Regulation 42 of the Animal Remedies Regulations, 1996 imposes a legal obligation on farmers or other persons in charge of animals to maintain an animal remedies record in a format specified under the regulations. This record of all administrations to food-producing animals of veterinary medicines, which are either subject to a veterinary prescription or have a withdrawal period, constitutes an important element of the overall controls on the use of veterinary medicines and is particularly necessary in facilitating controls designed to ensure that specified withdrawal periods are observed.</P>
      <P>It is primarily a matter for farmers or others in charge of animals to maintain the animal remedies record in the manner specified. In order purely to facilitate farmers in the bovine sector in meeting their legal obligations, it was decided to avail of the opportunity afforded by the issue of herd registers to include a section for recording veterinary treatments in the specified manner. This was not done in any other sector and was never intended to set a precedent in the bovine sector itself. It is not, therefore, intended to extend this facility to other sectors of the farming community.</P>

      <P>The person named is a participant in the early retirement scheme introduced under EU Council Regulation 2079/92, which she entered in joint management with her husband.</P>
      <P>It is a provision of the Council regulation that any national retirement pension to which a scheme participant, or his or her spouse-partner in a joint management situation, becomes entitled must be offset against the early retirement pension. The regulation makes no distinction between contributory or non-contributory national retirement pensions. The husband of the person named was awarded a contributory old age pension from 5 June 1996 and this was offset against the early retirement pension from that date.</P>
      <P>The recent announcement related solely to the manner in which the rule mentioned above was to be applied to the national widow's or widower's pension under the new early retirement scheme introduced in 2000. The European Commission agreed that these pensions should not be regarded as national retirement pensions until a recipient reached the normal national retirement age of 66 years. Once these pensioners reach the age of 66, however, the amount of their early retirement pension must be reduced by the amount of widow's or widower's pensions that they receive. This was already the position under the previous early retirement scheme.</P>

      <P>The breeding of Irish sport horses is a matter for the Irish Horse Board Co-operative Society Limited, IHB. This is a breeders' organisation, which is registered as a co-operative under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1978. The IHB, which has a membership in excess of 10,200, sets its rules as a co-operative and is answerable in the first instance to its membership. The issues raised in the documentation provided, in particular, the methodology used by the IHB for the selection of stallions for inclusion in its studbook and the operation of the inward buyer scheme, are operational matters for the IHB itself.</P>

      <P>I take the question to relate to farmers with commonage land who had no stock in 1998, and their eligibility for quota following the publication of the commonage framework plans.</P>
      <P>All farmers in REPS with commonage will be required to abide by the provisions of the particular framework plans for their commonages. These plans will determine the level of stock they may carry. The stocking level will be calculated on the basis of their 2001 quota, including any quota frozen in the 30% interim destocking or quota frozen under the first rural environmental protection scheme. There will be cases in which environmental or social considerations, such as the setting up of young farmers, would justify the giving out of quota to farmers who have none at present. I am drawing up plans for the use of surrendered quota, i.e. quota returned to the national reserve on a particular commonage when farmers die or leave farming, for this purpose. My Department will examine each case on its merits and will take account of the recommendations of the relevant commonage framework plans.</P>
      <P>However, in relation to &ldquo;dormant&rdquo; commonage shares no quota can be allocated unless prior agreement is got from the European Commission to a change in the rules. As announced, I intend seeking such an agreement from the European Commission at the mid-term review.</P>

      <P>As stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 360 of 30 January 2002 the person named submitted an incomplete 2001 area aid application in that he had omitted to send in a map for new parcels of land on which he is claiming area aid. He subsequently furnished maps and these have now being entered on the Department's electronic database.</P>
      <P>The person named applied on 78 animals under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. At an inspection, carried out on his herd on 13 November 2001, it was not possible to establish if his holding and that of his wife were managed separately. Furthermore, 23 problems were found with identification and registration requirements for animals inspected. My Department wrote to the person named on 22 February 2002 setting out the inspection findings and advising that both herds would be amalgamated for the purposes of payments of premium in 2001; that one application under each of the livestock premia schemes should be submitted in future; that one animal with no tag would be deleted from his claim, two other animals with no tags and an absent animal would be rejected and a reduction in payment of 2.34%, in accordance with the terms and conditions governing the scheme, would apply to the payment in respect of his eligible animals under the amalgamated 2001 suckler cow premium applications. The person named was also advised that he could have this decision reviewed by writing to my Department, within 21 days, setting out any facts which have not already been made known to my staff. To date no reply has been received from the person named.</P>
      <P>The person named has made two applications in respect of special beef premium on 20/12/01 and 21/12/01 in respect of 21 animals. The applications were selected for inspection. It was noted that one animal from the latter application was absent without explanation on the day of the inspection. This animal will be deleted and a reduced payment will apply on the remaining eligible animals. However, the recommendation at the suckler cow inspection of 13/11/01 that this herd number and that of his wife be amalgamated for premium purposes has to be implemented prior to processing of payment of special beef premium. The person named was notified of the decision on 22/02/02 and given 21 days to have that decision reviewed and has made no application for review to date.</P>
      <P>Advance payment under the slaughter premium scheme 2001, to the amount of &euro;1,102.40 has issued to the person named in respect of 26 animals. One of these animals also qualified for the additional national envelope slaughter premium top-up advance of &euro;18.28.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1154" />As maximum payment has already issued under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme to the wife of the person named no further payment is due to the person named under that scheme.</P>

      <P>The person named included 46.91 hectares in his 2001 area aid application. An area of 46.05 hectares was determined which is some 0.86 hectares or 1.87% less than the area claimed.</P>
      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%. Therefore, in this case no area aid penalty has been applied, leaving the area determined for payment purposes at 46.05 hectares. Payment of his full entitlement under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme has issued to the person named.</P>
      <P>The person named submitted two applications for special beef premium on 25 October 2001 and 13 December 2001. The 25 October 2001 application has been processed and now that the area aid problem has been resolved, payment will issue within the next two weeks. The 13 December 2001 application has been processed and payment is scheduled to issue at the end of March 2002 provided the terms and conditions of the scheme have been observed.</P>

      <P>The conditions governing the rural environment protection scheme, which have been approved by the EU Commission, specifically require the beneficiary of the scheme to attend the appropriate training course. It is not permitted for any other person to attend the course on behalf of the beneficiary. In the case of joint participants in REPS, however, one participant may be nominated to attend the course. He or she must then complete the full course.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the fact that some participants may have other commitments and to minimize any inconvenience to them and make the courses more accessible, my Department has agreed that planning agencies who are approved to conduct training courses may run courses during the day, on evenings or a combination of both.</P>
      <P>It is open to any scheme participant to amend their plan to reflect a change to joint participation with another person(s). In all cases where plans are amended, a complete amended plan is required, in this case in the joint names of the participants. Future REPS payments would issue in the name(s) on the plan.</P>
      <P>Participants who may be contemplating such a change should discuss the implications in detail with their REPS planner. In particular, they should note that joint participation means that in the event of one participant being unable to continue farming for whatever reason, the other will be required to continue and/or would become liable for any debt/penalties/etc incurred under REPS.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 227 and 229 together.</P>
      <P>Commission Decision 87/293/EEC, as amended, authorizes the methods of grading pig carcases in Ireland. These methods are the Hennessy Grading Probe, HGP2, and the Fat-O-Meater, FOM. The European Communities (Pig Carcase (Grading)) Regulations, 1988 to 2001 is the national legislation corresponding to this decision. In addition to the foregoing legislation, which is specific to Ireland, Council Regulation 3220/84 and Commission Regulation 2967/85 as amended in both cases set out the general framework for pig grading in the EU.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the HGP2 as a method in Ireland, and the formula for calculating the lean meat content included in the method, follow on an application by my Department to the EU Commission for its approval. This application and the evaluation of its acceptability are based on trials conducted here by Teagasc. Calibration of equipment is carried out at the manufacturer's premises and cannot be tampered with thereafter. Some <i>in situ</i> training of operatives by my Department has taken place.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the correct operation of the HGP2 and other aspects of the grading legislation is a matter for the management of pig slaughter plants. The grading arrangements in place at plant level are subject to occasional checks by my Department. The provisions of the legislation have been communicated to plant managers.</P>

      <P>The annual submission of a payment application form is a mandatory requirement of the rural environmental protection scheme. Failure to do so results in termination of participation and the recoupment of all payments made previously.</P>
      <P>To receive his third-year payment in full, the person named should have lodged his application by 1 November 2000. If he lodged it by 31 December 2000, he would have received a reduced payment for the year. If he had lodged it by 31 October 2001, he would have received no payment for the year but could have remained in the scheme.</P>
      <P>On 13 September 2001 my Department sent the person named a reminder letter, warning him that to stay in REPS he had to lodge his third year payment application form by 31 October 2001. It was made clear to him that otherwise his participation would be terminated and he would have to refund the payments he had already received.</P>
      <P>As he failed to lodge the form within the time specified, notwithstanding the reminders he was sent, my Department had no option but to terminate his participation in the rural environment protection scheme and seek to recoup all moneys received to date.</P>

      <P>Advance payment under the slaughter premium scheme 2001 to the amount of &euro;254.40 has issued to the person named on 25 February 2002 in respect of six animals. Balancing payments will commence in April 2002 when the quota position has been established.</P>
      <P>The person named submitted one 2001 special beef premium application in respect of a total of two animals. Advance payment totalling &euro;217.60 issued to the person named on 24 October 2001.</P>
      <P>The person named was not an applicant under the 2000 cattle headage scheme. The animal-based headage schemes were replaced in 2001 by the area-based compensatory allowance scheme. The new scheme, which was approved by the European Commission, provides that applicants must meet a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare of the holding in the year preceding application. However, farmers who are unable to meet that minimum stocking density but who traditionally qualified for headage grants in respect of cattle and/or sheep may continue to qualify for payment, provided their land is being utilised and is not in danger of being undergrazed.</P>
      <P>According to my Department's records, the stocking density of the holding did not meet the minimum requirement under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme. My Department wrote to the person named on 7 November 2001 with a view to establishing the type of farming activity being pursued. A reply was received with details of the stock on the holding.</P>
      <P>As the stocking density was 0.11 livestock units per hectare, the person named would not appear to qualify for payment under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme. A final decision on all outstanding cases will be made soon.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 120 animals under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme. As he holds 102.7 suckler cow quota rights, his maximum entitlement is limited to his quota. At an inspection carried out on his herd on 14 October 2000, irregularities were found in his application that resulted in payment being due on 98 animals less a penalty of 4.7%. My Department wrote to the person named on 28 February 2002 advising that his application would be processed for payment on 98 animals and that this payment would be subject to a 4.7% reduction penalty. He was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed by writing to my Department within 21 days. He has now agreed to accept this decision and his application is being processed on that basis.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for premium for seven cows under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme for non-suppliers of milk on 19 April 2001. His 80% advance payment issued on 4 December 2001. In processing the application for balance payment, the records for the person named as provided by his co-op showed that he held a milk quota on 31 March 2001 for 7,355 gallons. The application was then processed as for small-scale milk suppliers. Applicants qualifying for this scheme must be producing cow's milk for disposal from their holdings and have a milk quota of less than 32,478 gallons on 31 March 2001-1 April 2001. They must have suckler cows surplus to the cows needed to produce those quotas. The number of notional dairy cows needed to produce the milk quota is that quota divided by 876 gallons. The number of cows required to fill a quota of 7,355 gallons is 8.39. The applicant stated that the total number of cows, both dairy and suckler, owned and maintained on his holding on the date of application was seven. As 8.39 cows are required to produce the milk quota, no suckler cow premium payment is due in respect of the 2001 scheme and the advance payment is now deemed an overpayment. However, if his co-op can provide evidence that the person named has not supplied any milk for disposal from his holding for an unbroken 12 months period from the date of lodgement of his application, this matter can be reviewed further.</P>

      <P>The person named has submitted no applications under the 2001 special beef premium scheme under the herd number quoted above. However, as stated in my reply to a previous parliamentary question, a new herd number was issued jointly to the person <Col N="1163" /> named and another person on 4 April 2001. The two persons involved were informed in writing by the Department of this decision on that date. Both herd numbers previously held by these parties ceased to be valid from 4 April 2001.</P>
      <P>The spouse of the person named made applications for special beef premium under an old herd number on 24 September 2001, 2 October 2001 and 21 December 2001. As this is no longer a valid herd number, the application can only be processed under the new herd number and both parties must sign the application forms. Therefore the application forms have been returned to the spouse on 29 January 2002 and when they are signed by both parties and returned to my Department, the applications will be reviewed.</P>
      <P>The outstanding slaughter premium payments in this case relate to the amalgamated herd number which is registered jointly in respect of the herdowner and spouse. A producer acknowledgement form was received in the slaughter premium section which was signed by the named herdowner only with a letter attached from the spouse declaring that the person named has been nominated to sign for and recoup any slaughter premia due on animals slaughtered under the herd number quoted and another herd number. The person named was advised that, for payments to be released on this basis under the joint herd number, the local office should be contacted so that the herd number is registered in one name only.

      <P>Supplementary measure 5 of the previous rural environmental protection scheme provided for payments to farmers who undertook to give public access to their land for environmentally friendly leisure and sporting activities. There is no supplementary measure of this kind in the new scheme which commenced on 27 November 2000. Unlike the regulation governing the previous scheme, Council Regulation (EC) No. 1257/1999, under which the new REP scheme is implemented, includes no provision for a public access measure as part of the EU co-funded agri-environment programme. In an effort to secure the continued availability of public access as part of REPS, my Department made proposals to the European Commission for the inclusion of the measure in the new scheme as a State aid fully funded by the Exchequer. However, the Commission has indicated that a public access measure was not admissible under <Col N="1164" /> the agri-environment title of Regulation (EC) No. 1257/1999, even as a State aid. Participants in the previous REP scheme who are in receipt of payment under supplementary measure 5 may continue to avail of payments under this measure until the end of their existing agreements.</P>

      <P>The main reason for penalties in relation to arable or livestock premia payments is the late lodgement of applications under the various schemes. Other factors giving rise to penalties relate to non-compliance with the terms and conditions of schemes in relation to claimed and unclaimed animals and to overdeclaration of area under the area aid scheme.</P>
      <P>It is not possible in the time available to give details of penalties in respect of each of the years specified. However, I am arranging to have information in respect of 1998, 1999 and 2000 schemes sent to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available. It should be noted that, since payments in respect of 2001 schemes will not be completed until 30 June 2002, it is not possible to determine the overall level of penalties to be applied until after that date. The number of applications received under each of the various schemes specified are shown in the following table.</P>

    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P>1. In 1998 farmers had to submit separate applications under each age category and bull category under the special beef premium scheme each time they applied subject to a maximum of six applications under each category. As and from 1999 a combined form covering all three categories was used each time they applied subject to a maximum of eight applications.</P>
    <P>2. There was no deseasonalisation slaughter premium scheme in 2000 or 2001 as the slaughterings in the autumn of the respective previous years were not sufficiently high to activate a scheme.</P>
    <P>3. The applications in respect of the five livestock headage schemes are combined under 1998, 1999 and 2000 years above. A farmer could have applied for payment under one or all of those schemes. These five schemes were replaced by one area-based scheme in 2001.</P>

      <P>It is my policy and that of the Government that everything possible is done to ensure that Irish livestock and meat producers have unrestricted access to all our important markets worldwide and no effort is being spared to bring this about.</P>
      <P>On the question of third countries, many of which imposed bans on EU beef following the BSE crisis in mainland Europe, efforts at political, diplomatic and technical level are continuing to secure the reopening of these important markets. My Department, together with the Department of Foreign Affairs and An Bord Bia, is working intensively to emphasise to the authorities in those markets the positive results of our handling of BSE in this country and the guarantees in relation to food safety we can offer to consumers of Irish beef.</P>
      <P>Particular attention is also being focused on the Gulf region which is a significant market for Irish beef. A senior veterinary official of my Department visited the region last year to brief the relevant authorities on our BSE situation. Our ambassador to Saudi Arabia has also kept in very close contact with the authorities in all the countries in the region and invitations to those countries have been issued to send technical delegations to Ireland to assess for themselves the quality of our beef production and the efficacy of our BSE controls. Similar invitations to send technical delegations have also issued to South Africa, Algeria, Indonesia and the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Intensive contact is being maintained with these countries with a view to advancing our case for reopening of the markets. I myself have visited South Africa and have offered to send high level teams from my Department to brief their counterparts in these markets if this is required at any time.</P>

      <P>The price paid by meat factories for cattle is primarily a matter between the factories and individual producers. From a producer's point of view, the price paid for store cattle is obviously a key element in determining overall profitability in any transaction. Based on winter finishing budgets prepared by Teagasc last autumn, current price levels <Col N="1168" /> appear to offer reasonable margins in the most part to winter finishers.</P>
      <P>Any evaluation of cattle prices must also take account of the increased payments of the special beef premium and the slaughter premium which were agreed under Agenda 2000, the final instalment of which came into effect this year. The maximum premium payable on steers this year is 24 cent per kilogramme higher than in 2001.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to views expressed by sheep farmers, their representatives and other independent experts in the sheep industry that the sheep tagging and registration system imposed on the sector in June 2001 is extremely complex and difficult to operate at farm level and may undermine traceability in the sector; if he will examine and implement changes to the sheep identification system, particularly the complex registration and reconciliation system, which would simplify and make the system easier to operate at farm level; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9148/02]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the introduction of the national sheep identification system, NSIS, on 21 June 2001, Ireland has for the first time full traceability for all sheep on an individual basis. Since that date every sheep which moves from a holding within the State or which is imported into the State and every sheep carcass processed in any of our processing plants is now fully and individually identified. All sheep remaining on holdings are required to be individually tagged. I attach great importance to this development which is of significant benefit to the sheep sector, most notably in terms of disease control, marketing and in the implementation of the relevant recommendations of the sheepmeat forum.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the various requirements which it has been designed to address, I believe that the NSIS system is simple to understand and operate. It avails of opportunities offered by modern technology and is also cost efficient from the perspectives of flock owners, processors, tag suppliers, the Department and purchasers of Irish sheepmeat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that it does impose a measure of additional work on flock owners and others, but this will be the case with any worthwhile system of identification and traceability. It is also the case that a high degree of precision is necessary, particularly at points in the trading of sheep where traceability might otherwise be problematic. Also, the successful implementation of our policy for the eradication of scrapie from the national flock will, in so far as its flock depopulation component is concerned, involve trace-back of animals and will thereby be reliant to a <Col N="1169" /> significant degree on the tagging and record keeping aspects of NSIS.</P>
    <P>I regard the extra effort on the part of flock owners in tagging and record keeping as an investment in the future of the sector and in its capacity to meet the requirements of markets and ever more discerning consumers. It should also be recognised that individual identification provides the flock owner with a valuable management tool, a fact which has been publicly recognised by a number of flock owners since NSIS became operational.</P>
    <P>My Department is monitoring the implementation of NSIS on an ongoing basis. Certain aspects of the system, for example, the approved status of tag suppliers, will be routinely reviewed over the coming weeks and any significant issues will be addressed should they arise. I do not accept that the registration and reconciliation elements of the system are unduly complex or that they pose any more difficulty for flock owners than many other items of documentation, both farming and otherwise. To assist farmers with the completion of the flock register and to deal with other queries, my Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, recently hosted more than 75 information meetings nationwide and has operated a telephone helpline to provide advice to individual farmers.</P>
    <P>I am advised that, in general, flock registers are being completed satisfactorily and, with experience and the passage of time, I believe that the overwhelming majority of flock owners will be comfortable in keeping the document accurate and updated . It must be remembered that the ultimate beneficiaries of an identification and traceability system which works well and stands up to scrutiny from any quarter are sheep farmers themselves and I believe that this is recognised by most flock owners.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the fallen animal scheme, the rendering of all fallen animals delivered to approved plants and the disposal of the resultant meat and bone meal is subsidised by my Department. This arrangement, which includes sheep, was put in place at the same time as a subsidised collection service was set up for fallen bovines. While the collection from farms of fallen bovines is subsidised at fixed rates per collected animal, this particular aspect of the scheme does not extend to animals other than bovines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that a comprehensive collection scheme for bovines at reasonable charges per ani<Col N="1170" /> mal collected is now in place and the fact that non-bovines delivered to approved rendering plants do not incur a charge means that fallen sheep can be collected at reasonable cost. Unlike in the case of cattle, the option to bury sheep on farm under licence from the district veterinary office is open to producers in certain circumstances. The option is also open to producers to deliver fallen sheep to registered knackeries where a nominal charge is imposed for taking the carcase to the rendering plant. All in all, I am satisfied that the fallen animal scheme as introduced by me last year at an annual cost of &euro;25 million is working well and providing a good service to farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the early retirement from farming scheme there was no underspend. The Estimates provision was &euro;82.889 million and the outturn was &euro;84.452 million.</P>
      <P>The Estimates provision for the rural environmental protection scheme was &euro;215.855 million and the out turn was &euro;164.065 million, representing an underspend of &euro; 51.79 million. There was a number of reasons why spending on the REP scheme was less than expected. In early 2001, safeguards against the spread of foot and mouth disease prevented planners from walking the land and as a result they could not prepare new REP scheme applications. When the foot and mouth restrictions were relaxed, there was a backlog for planners to deal with. The deployment to foot and mouth duties of technical staff in my Department who would normally be involved in the processing of REP scheme applications also led to some delay in the approval of new plans and spending. In addition, my Department's accounts system had to be closed earlier in December 2001 than in other years so as to facilitate the changeover to the euro. A substantial volume of payments that would otherwise have been made in December had to be held back until January 2001. Some &euro;3.7 million of the &euro;4.554 million allocated to the scheme of installation aid in 2001 was unspent. The scheme was launched in February 2001 and is confined to young farmers set up on or after 1 January 2000. Applications under the scheme consist of two parts: initial application which must be made within four months of setting up on the farm; and application for payment which may be lodged within 30 months of setting up on the farm. In addition, young farmers have up to two years after the date of setting up to attain the education and viability requirements of the scheme. Accordingly, the majority of applications received were initial applications and did not come to payment stage in 2001.</P>

      <P>The animal feed regulations require that records be kept at all stages throughout the feed chain from import of raw materials to retail sales. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure the efficient and immediate traceability and possible recall of material where contamination of feeding stuffs is suspected. This is an important element in the food safety chain. There is no question of seven different documents being provided for each item sold. Under the regulations, a retailer of compound feeding stuffs is required to keep a record of the supplier of the feed, the description, net quantity and date of receipt of the feeding stuff together with the date the feed was placed on the market and the name and address of the person to whom the feeding stuff was sold.</P>

      <P>Identification of animals is critical to traceability which in turn <Col N="1173" /> is a critical requirement for presence in the market. Proper identification is a mandatory requirement for premia eligibility. In Ireland, all animals must be identified by two plastic tags, one in each ear. This is to allow time for replacement if one tag is lost. Statistics from 2001 show that the level of request for single replacement tags is less than 4% and the level of request for pairs of tags is less than 1.5%. This shows a relatively low level of loss which is contrary to recent suggestions that the level of loss is between 5% and 7%.</P>
      <P>Under the premium schemes an animal will be paid premium if there is one tag in place when the animal is checked. Therefore while the tag loss is outside farmers' control it is important that producers check their cattle regularly and if a missing tag is detected a replacement tag should be ordered. Of course this is not alone to ensure premium payment but to guarantee the traceability of all animals on the holding.</P>
      <P>If both tags are missing at a scheme check then the animal in question will be rejected from the claim and the premium on other eligible animals will be reduced proportionally. The proportional reduction will depend on the overall number of non-compliant animals against the overall number of eligible animals under the special beef, suckler cow and slaughter premium schemes.</P>

      <P>Classification of beef carcases is carried out by officials of my Department in accordance with a standard EU system, using criteria laid down in the Council and Commission regulations. Under these regulations, classification is based on a visual examination of the dressed carcase and is primarily a subjective examination of the carcase characteristics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Classification officers have not been able to rely on the cattle movement monitoring system as a definitive basis for differentiating between cows and heifers because, until 1 January 2002, that system only provided a record of calving where the calf was born alive and survived to registration time. As the incidence of peri-natal mortality for calves born from first calving bovines can be substantial, many once-calved cows now being slaughtered would continue to be identified as heifers within the CMMS system. However, since all calf births are now being recorded, the CMMS can in the future be used as <Col N="1174" /> a database to assist in classifying animals slaughtered. However, it cannot be used as the definitive basis for differentiating between cows and heifers until the EU regulations governing carcase classification are amended.</P>
    <P>Where a producer is not satisfied with the decision of the classification officer and an appeal is lodged while the carcase is still intact on the premises, a re-assessment of the carcase is carried out.</P>

      <P>With regard to markets generally, I am particularly concerned to ensure that Irish livestock and meat producers have unrestricted access to all important markets worldwide.</P>
      <P>An agreement, signed with Libya in June 2000, provided that Ireland would be officially listed as a source country for all Libyan tenders for the supply of live cattle. Since then, however, the Libyan Foreign Minister indicated that it had not been possible to import live cattle because of what he called logistical problems and that Libya would buy beef directly. Libya subsequently issued tenders for the supply of beef and Ireland was included in the list of countries invited to tender. I understand that a number of Irish companies submitted bids at that time. Efforts at diplomatic and technical level are continuing to ensure that the agreement, in so far as it relates to cattle exports, signed with Libya is fully implemented.</P>
      <P>With regard to live cattle exports to Egypt, the position is that proposals for a trial shipment of live cattle were submitted to the Egyptian authorities in 1997 but these proposals were not implemented. The lack of a market for live cattle exports to Egypt has been, however, more than offset by the volume of trade in beef exports to that country in recent years. The Egyptian market for beef has been reopened to Ireland following intensive efforts throughout last year.</P>

      <P>To date a total of 53 scrapie infected sheep flocks have been depopulated, including three within the past week. The position at present is that payments have issued in respect of 48 of these cases. The remainder of the claims are being processed and payments will issue shortly. Some of these flocks were depopulated immediately prior to the Christmas holiday period.</P>
      <P>While my Department had indicated that as a general rule payment would be made to flockowners within 14 working days of the slaughter of flocks, it had also pointed out that in cases where it was not possible to have an order for payment with the Department's accounts branch by 7 December there would be a delay until after the Christmas period. Such delays arose because of additional work required in our accounts branch because of the euro changeover.</P>
      <P>It is also the case that the volume and complexity of paperwork associated with each case and with a compensation package which is entirely new, and the fact that all flocks with cases confirmed since 1 January 1999 were slaughtered in the same short period added difficulties to the processing of claims. Now that the initial backlog of claims is cleared, my Department will do its utmost to ensure more prompt payment in the case of future depopulated flocks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 262 and 263 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to 21 February 2001, free trade in sheep was permitted in both directions across the Border with Northern Ireland on the basis of a bilateral agreement between the authorities in each jurisdiction. The Deputy will be aware that these arrangements have been reviewed and have changed considerably since cross-Border trade in sheep resumed following the <Col N="1176" /> foot and mouth crisis. Full intra-community rules involving health certification and prior notification apply to trade in sheep with Northern Ireland. Such provisions and additional rules requiring 72 hours prior notification and delivery across specified border crossings to export certified slaughter plants at particular hours of the day only, apply in respect of sheep imported to this jurisdiction for slaughter from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In addition, the national sheep identification system introduced in June 2001, requires sheep delivered to slaughter plants to be individually identified and accompanied by a dispatch document. Imported sheep must bear tags put on in the exporting jurisdiction and NSIS makes provision for the use of a special tag when imported animals are received onto any holding in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Diseases of Animals Act (Amendment) Act, 2001 provides in section 10 that where animals are not tagged in accordance with the relevant provisions, it may be inferred in proceedings that the animal has been introduced into the State unlawfully, that the tag has been unlawfully removed or tampered with, or that a tag has been forged or tampered with. The Act also provides a legal basis for the regulation and control of dealers in animals.</P>
    <P>In relation to animals imported from Great Britain through Northern Ireland, I understand that no animals of FMD susceptible species have been imported to Northern Ireland from Great Britain since the FMD crisis. Prior to 21 February 2001, such imports from Northern Ireland were lawful without prior notification or health certification. Imports from Great Britain required specific certification. The collection of the flat rate VAT rebate on such imports is of course a serious matter and one which has been addressed by the Revenue Commissioners, although I am sure that the various measures introduced by my Department over the past year will be of assistance in this regard. The Deputy will be aware that a conviction has been secured in the case of one individual in respect of the illegal importation of sheep. Activities at certain plants are being investigated by the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it should be noted that Minister Bríd Rodgers and I are working on developing an animal health strategy for the island of Ireland. This work encompasses seeking to maximise the degree of harmony and compatibility in areas such as animal identification and tracing as between North and South.</P>

In relation to these applications, a total of 181 payments amounting to &euro;0.9 million have issued.

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the hardship being caused to farmers by the penalty being employed in respect of application for premium payouts over the various schemes operated by his Department; the action he intends to take to reduce the bureaucracy of these schemes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of penalty imposed in relation to the various premia schemes is relatively low. An examination of penalties imposed for the 2000 schemes showed that less than 3% of applications resulted in penalties and over 50% of these penalties related to the late lodgement of applications.</P>
      <P>Recently the European Court of Auditors published a report in relation to scheme implementation which confirmed that the level of error found as a result of controls in Ireland is amongst the lowest of all member states. I have been concerned about the need for scheme simplification and a more proportionate penalty regime. It was for this reason I raised the issue at the Council of Ministers in October 2000. Over the last year a significant amount of work was completed and as a consequence the control regulations were amended. I am satisfied that the new arrangements, while not giving us everything we would want, will be of considerable benefit to Irish farmers and help draw a distinction between a minor error and a more serious breach of the conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past number of years my Department, in consultation with the farm bodies and with the progressive use of information technology, has <Col N="1180" /> made major progress in simplifying the application procedure under the various premia schemes. The changes introduced include: pre-printing of personal details on application forms, use of bar-coding on bovine animals passports, the provision of herd profiles to assist in completion of the extensification premium declarations, automatic processing of the slaughter premium scheme by reference to the cattle movement monitoring system, and removal of certain notification requirements.</P>
    <P>In addition, the move from an animal based system for the payment of the disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance to an area based system has greatly simplified the application procedure.</P>
    <P>Of course it is my intention to keep the operation of these schemes under review, to implement further improvements where possible and reduce the level of paper movement to the maximum possible extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The animal-based headage schemes were replaced in 2001 by the area-based compensatory allowance scheme. The new scheme, which was approved by the European Commission, provides that applicants must meet a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare of the holding in the year preceding application. However, farmers who are unable to meet that minimum stocking density but who traditionally qualified for headage grants in respect of cattle and-or sheep may continue to qualify for payment, provided their land is being utilised and is not in danger of being undergrazed. The person named was not a headage recipient in 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to my Department's records, the stocking density of the holding did not meet the minimum requirement under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme. My Department wrote to the person named on 7 November 2001 with a view to establishing the type of farm<Col N="1181" /> ing activity being pursued. A reply was received in the district livestock office with details of the stock on the holding. However, as the stock were not in the ownership of the person concerned, he would not appear to qualify for payment under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme. My Department will communicate with the Deputy when the matter has been resolved.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 28 animals under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme on 29 June 2001. Payment of his 80% advance, amounting to &euro;4,123.00, issued to him on 24 October 2001. Subsequently, one of these animals died on 7 January 2002 but the person named incorrectly registered the date of death on the cattle movement monitoring system database as 7 January 2001. When balance payments commenced in January 2002, all 2001 suckler cow premium applications were cross-checked against the CMMS database and it showed that this animal was in fact dead at date of application. My Department contacted the person named on 31 January 2002 and advised him to notify the correct date of death of the animal to SWS Bandon. The CMMS record has been updated with the correct details and payment of the 20% balance of his entitlement, amounting to &euro;1,030.75, has now issued to him.</P>
      <P>Some 80,000 payments totalling over &euro;67 million have been made over the last month alone, the process of introducing a new mapping and area aid processing system has raised some issues in clearing a small number of payment claims. Every effort has been made to keep any delay to a minimum including the use of manual transactions.</P>

      <P>While my Department issues an application form to REPS participants by way of a reminder, the REP scheme documentation clearly states that the onus is on participants to submit their annual applications for payment. The change of address by the person named did not relieve him of his obligation.</P>

      <P>The person named claimed a total of 53.74 hectares on his 2001 area aid application form. An area of 52.86 has been determined. This represents a difference of 0.88 hectares or 1.64% between the area claimed and that determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1184" />Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%. Therefore in this case no penalty is applied, leaving the area for payment purposes at 52.86 hectares. The person named applied on 12 animals under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. Payment of his 100% entitlement, amounting to &euro;2,473.80, has now issued to him. His full entitlement of &euro;4425 under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme has issued to him.</P>

An inspection of her herd took place on 24 September 2001 where it appeared that six of the cows she had applied on had not calved for a number of years. A letter from the person named was received by the inspecting officer on 11 January 2002 in which she set out the calving dates for each of the six cows concerned. My Department has now re-examined her application and has decided to accept these animals as eligible suckler cows. Her application will now be processed for payment.</P>

      <P>The provisions of the Control of Horses Act, 1996, allow for grant assistance to be given by my Department towards the costs incurred by a local authority in implementing the Act. This can be taken to encompass local authority involvement in and support for a horse project where the local authority considers such involvement and support to be an integral part of its implementation of the Act within its functional area. My Department has already provided, via the relevant local authorities, grant support towards horse projects on this basis. Material commitment by the local authority to any given project is a prerequisite in all such instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case to which the Deputy refers, the Department has to date received no formal appli<Col N="1185" /> cation for grant assistance from the local authority in question, although various exchanges of an exploratory nature have taken place. Contacts in mid 2001 indicated that the cost of acquiring the total area of land involved is expected to lie somewhere between &euro;3.2 million and &euro;5 million, to which very substantial capital costs in respect of other elements would have to be added. Albeit that such contacts were exploratory in nature, the Department at the time expressed concern at the magnitude of costs envisaged and it was understood that the local authority and others were to subsequently consider this matter further.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the funds available to my Department to assist local authorities in their implementation of the Control of Horses Act are, in any given year, limited. In the current year this is of the order of &euro;2.5 million per annum.</P>

      <P>Under the Finance Act, 2001, an individual may claim tax relief for un-reimbursed expenses incurred in the provision of health care for a dependent relative. Health care includes maintenance in a nursing home approved by the Minister for Health and Children. In the period from 6 April 2001, to 31 December 2001, a dependent relative for the purposes of claiming the relief was a relative of the individual, or of the individual's spouse, who is incapacitated by old age or infirmity from <Col N="1187" /> maintaining himself or herself; the widowed father or widowed mother of the individual or of the individual's spouse, whether incapacitated or not; or a son or daughter of the individual who resides with an individual and on whose services the individual by reason of old age or infirmity is compelled to depend.</P>
      <P>Section 9 of the Finance Bill, 2002 will enable an individual to claim tax relief in respect of expenses met for a wider range of relatives. This includes the parents or any other ancestor of the individual and the parents of the individual's spouse, whether incapacitated or not. The relief is also being extended to include other individuals whether they are relatives or not who are aged 65 years or over or who are permanently incapacitated. The changes will apply from 1 January 2002.</P>
      <P>Each tax office has a list of approved nursing homes. The list may be viewed on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie. Tax relief, which is available at the taxpayer's marginal rate of tax, may be claimed at the end of the relevant tax year by completing a form MED 1.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Office of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners that the ability to make applications over the telephone was introduced for some competitions in September 2001 with a view to improving the quality of service to candidates and the speed of appointments to client departments.</P>
      <P>When a prospective candidate calls the application centre they are asked a number of basic questions which reflect the information requested on an application form. All calls are automatically logged, detailing exact time, duration and nature of call, be it an inquiry or full application. There is therefore always documentary evidence of a call.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all cases the details recorded are checked back and confirmed with the caller. This means that the likelihood of information being incorrectly logged is virtually nil as the caller has the opportunity to correct any misinformation given. Candidates who have any queries or complaints relating to their application can contact the recruitment section appropriate to their particu<Col N="1188" /> lar competition. Any dispute which may subsequently arise would be investigated and pursued with the individual concerned. This would also be the case in competitions where the traditional method of application is used.</P>
    <P>To date the CSLAC has found that this method has the following benefits: a significant streamlining of the administrative process, ensuring efficiency and cost effectiveness by reducing delays, and thereby enabling delivery on target dates for competitions; substantial savings in postage, staff time and data entry; and elimination of risk of post going astray leading to an overall improved customer service to candidates. For the balance of competitions there are formal application forms for recruitment through the CSLAC.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the Revenue on-line service now has 5,960 registered customers. Of these, 5,880 are from the private sector. When the agents' customers are included, the total of Revenue customers covered by ROS is 269,867. There are approximately 150 new registrations per week. More than &euro;2.6 billion has been paid through ROS in 20,727 payments. A total of 56,344 return forms have been filed and 57,254 on-line tax inquiries have been made from customers' desktop computers. A total of 3,713 repayments totalling &euro;170 million have been made. Revenue's customers now have a facility to do business at a time and location that suits them. They have the benefits of a speedier, more secure and more accurate processing of tax returns, a reduction in compliance costs, a reduction in paper handling and access to current information. ROS is a flagship pioneering project in implementing e-Government in Ireland and, as such, represents good value for money.</P>

      <P>Arrangements for the award of contracts by Civil Service bodies, including Revenue, are governed by my Department's guidelines in this area, Guidelines for Engagement of Consultants in the Civil Service, March 1999. These and previous guidelines were fully adhered to by Revenue in the award of contracts to Andersen-Accenture. Information on each of the contracts for consultancy service awarded to this company between 1996 and 2002 is set out in the following table. I draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that each such contract was awarded following an open competitive tender in the <i>EU Journal</i>; openly tendered at different times; dealt with by different officials within Revenue; subject to <Col N="1191" /> external approval by my Department, the Government Contracts Committee and the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The contract for the Revenue restructuring project was awarded in 2001 and its value, including VAT, was &euro;785,000 for 2001. The purpose of the contract is to achieve the optimum alignment of Revenue's structure with its mission, strategies and programmes. Details of the proposed changes, which resulted from an internal review of Revenue's organisational structure, are set out in Revenue's Statement of Strategy 2001-2003. The report of the steering group on the review of the office of the revenue commissioners, established by the Minister for Finance, endorsed the structural changes proposed by Revenue. Staff from my Department were involved as advisers in the selection process. The award of the contract itself was approved by the Government contracts committee.</P>
      <P>The contract for the Revenue on-line service was awarded in 2000 and its value, including VAT, for each year was &euro;2.28 million in 2000 and &euro;4.90 million in 2001. This project was implemented under the auspices of the Information Society Commission. It enables the Revenue Commissioners to provide improved customer service while also providing customers with the facility to file tax returns, declarations and other electronic information via the Internet. The consultancy aspects of this project were approved by the Department of the Taoiseach as part of the overall sanction for the ROS programme. The award of the contract was approved by the Government contracts committee.</P>
      <P>The contract for the integrated taxation project, ITP, was awarded in 1996 and its value, including VAT, for each year was as follows:</P>

    <P>The purpose of the contract is to supply technical and development expertise in the building and implementation of integrated taxation solutions. This expertise serves to complement that of Revenue's internal business and IT teams. These integrated solutions now form the basis for the administration and collection of the bulk of Exchequer receipts. The consultancy aspects of this project were approved by the Department of Finance as part of the overall sanction for the ITP programme in December 1995.</P>

      <P>My Department's Guidelines for Engagement of Consultants in the Civil Service, March 1999 &ndash; and in particular section 2 of that document relating to, &ldquo;Deciding Whether Or Not To Engage Consultants&rdquo;, are specifically designed so as to provide guidance to Civil Service bodies on when to take on consultants.</P>
      <P>Consistent with these guidelines, Revenue advise that their use of consultancy services is dependent on the following factors: availability of internal skilled resources to carry out a project; specialised knowledge or expertise, which is not available in Revenue and may be required for a temporary period; requirements of skills transfer to Revenue staff; volume of work dictated by Revenue's progressive legislative programme, Information Society Commission's action plan requirements and enhancements to the office's structures and processes; timeframes in which solutions are required; and achievement of Revenue's key corporate priorities.</P>
      <P>In addition, I should point out that my Department has been directly involved in approval of major work programmes involving consultancy support in Revenue including the Revenue on-line service, Revenue restructuring, the integrated taxation programme, the management information framework, the manpower advisory service and others.</P>
      <P>Against the background of Revenue's adherence to the guidelines in its use of consultancy services, and my own Department's involvement in supporting major Revenue programmes involving consultancy support, I am satisfied that Revenue's approach to the placing of contracts is reasonable and appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 298 and 305 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that the Deputies are referring to the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' (tax concessions) scheme. The principal benefits under this scheme are that a new car may be purchased free of VRT and free of VAT every two years. The maximum VRT-VAT relief for a qualifying disabled driver is &euro;9,525 and for a qualifying disabled passenger, is &euro;15,875.</P>
      <P>It is a fundamental requirement of the scheme that the disabled person meets the medical criteria specified in the relevant regulations and is in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the local health board. Where the issue of a primary medical certificate is refused, it is open to the applicant to appeal this refusal to the disabled driver's medical board of appeal, an independent body whose decision is final. It will be noted that neither the Revenue Commissioners nor my Department have any role in the medical assessment of persons for the purposes of admission to the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the person in question has not been issued with a primary medical certificate. The Revenue Commissioners are unable to <Col N="1200" /> consider an application for admission to the scheme without the issue of such a certificate.</P>
    <P>The scheme is under review by an interdepartmental group which is chaired by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The group is examining all aspects of the scheme, including the qualifying medical criteria.</P>
    <P>For the Deputies' information, there are other State funded schemes aimed at mobility, namely a mobility allowance and a motorised transport grant, both of which are payable by the health boards.</P>

      <P>As set out in section 8.4.5, chapter 8 of the Final Report of the Social Welfare Benchmarking and Indexation Group, in the view of the representatives of the Department of Finance, along with those of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Employers Pillar, &ldquo;it was inappropriate to establish a formal benchmark and that the existing arrangements, which have seen real increases, i.e. in excess of inflation, in welfare rates should continue to apply. Essentially, it would be left to the discretion of the Government to determine the level of welfare increases from year to year, having regard to the range of high priority demands on the Exchequer and to issues of affordability, sustainability and compatibility with the social, economic and employment needs of the economy on a continuing basis&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the five homes were included on a list of properties flooded in Limerick over the Christmas and New Year in 1999-2000.</P>
      <P>The list referred to was compiled by an <i>ad hoc</i> committee in the aftermath of the flooding and forwarded to the Department of Finance. This provisional list was not accepted as a certified or official list by the Department of Finance and it was not used as the basis for deciding which properties should qualify for financial assistance. Rather the scope of the scheme was determined solely on the basis of a report on the flooding from Limerick Corporation which indicated the area and the properties more severely affected as a direct result of the public works associated with the Limerick main drainage scheme. Due to the drainage works the receding of flood waters was delayed in that area and as a result residents there suffered additional hardship. It was the intention of the Minister for Finance to provide financial assistance only to those who had suffered additional hardship because of the public works. The area identified by Limerick Corporation was the immediate vicinity of Athlunkard Street adjacent to the River Abbey and a small number of other properties on the opposite bank. The five homes referred to on the Mill Road in the Corbally were not identified by Limerick Corporation as being affected by the drainage works and, therefore, they were not included in the scheme.</P>

      <Quest>the position regarding the taxation of rental income; the changes announced in relation to this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[8707/02]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Profit from rental income is taxed on an actual tax year basis and income from rental property is assessable for tax under Case V of Schedule D of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. For individuals taxed under the PAYE system with rental profits that are relatively small, it can be arranged to have the tax collected by the reduction of their tax credits and standard rate cut-off point. Otherwise, the tax due will be collected under the self assessment system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain expenses can be claimed against rental income such as ground rent payable, rates, management, legal, accountancy fees, insurance etc. It is assumed the Deputy is referring, in particular, to the changes as regards interest relief on bor<Col N="1202" /> rowings for rented residential properties which are contained in section 17 of the Finance Bill, 2002, as passed by Dáil Éireann. These changes were announced in the budget and apply to interest accruing on or after 1 January 2002. Interest on money accruing on or after that date where the money was employed in the purchase, improvement or repair of residential premises will be allowed as a deduction in arriving at the profit from the letting of the property. The interest is treated as accruing from day to day.</P>
    <P>Interest relief on money applied in acquiring an interest in a company or a partnership, where the money is ultimately applied in acquiring an interest in residential premises, is also restored as respects interest accruing on or after 1 January 2002.</P>
    <P>These changes restore the relief for interest which applied up to 22 April 1998. The restrictions on interest relief for investors were introduced following the Bacon report. As I indicated in my budget statement, circumstances in the property market are much changed and the presence of investors is required to secure the future supply of housing to meet accommodation needs.</P>
    <P>Tax relief can also be claimed against rental income for capital expenditure incurred, on or after 6 April 2001, on the refurbishment of certain rented residential accommodation. The expenditure is allowed as a deduction over a seven year period. Expenditure is allowed at the rate of 15% per annum for the first six years with the balance, 10%, allowed in year seven. To qualify, the premises must be used as a dwelling and before and after the refurbishment, contain one or more residential units. From the date of completion of the refurbishment, the premises must be let in its entirety under a qualifying lease throughout the relevant period, that is, ten years from the date of completion of the work or if later, the date of the first letting. The lessor must comply with the regulations in relation to standards for rented houses, rent books and registration of rented houses.</P>
    <P>If the property concerned is designated for rented residential relief &ndash; section 23 relief &ndash; under one of the area-based renewal schemes such as the urban, town or rural renewal schemes, 100% of qualifying construction, refurbishment or conversion expenditure incurred on the property can qualify for relief which can be written off against all Irish rental income. Expenditure incurred on the provision of certain residential accommodation for third level students and expenditure incurred on the construction of certain residential accommodation located at park and ride facilities also qualifies for rented residential relief along the same lines as provided for under the various renewal schemes.</P>

      <P>Exemption from tax on the benefit-in-kind charge arising to employees who receive certain monthly bus or rail passes from their employers was introduced in the Finance Act, 1999. There is, however, no specific provision in the legislation to provide for tax relief in respect of car park charges incurred by such employees when using available park and ride facilities such as those at DART and train stations.</P>
      <P>The rules governing the granting of tax relief in respect of expenses incurred by employees are contained in section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. To qualify for a tax deduction expenses must be wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of the office or employment. The car parking charges referred to by the Deputy would not come within these provisions and accordingly would not qualify for tax relief.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 306 and 317 together.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works has been trying to acquire a site for a Garda station in Leixlip for some time past.</P>
      <P>Kildare County Council had agreed to make a site available at Newtown House, however, an appeal was lodged with Bord Pleanála against the demolition of Newtown House. The appeal was upheld.</P>
      <P>An advertisement was placed in national and local papers in October 2000 followed by a selection process from which a site adjacent to the local Catholic church and the local gaelscoil was considered suitable. Negotiations on the acquisition of this site have proved problematic. While some of the difficulties that arose have been resolved, there remains the question of whether vehicular access can be made compliant with local authority standards. It seems unlikely that this issue can be resolved to our satisfaction.</P>
      <P>A further trawl of estate agents was carried out. Another site was identified and an offer placed on it; we are awaiting a response. Until agreement is reached on one or other site, it is not possible to say what actions are likely to be taken.</P>

      <P>The 2001 tax year ran from 6 April to 31 December 2001. That period of 270 days was 74% of a full year of 365 days. Tax credits in general were, therefore, 74% of the amounts due in a full year.</P>
      <P>However, the 74% apportionment in 2001 did not apply to the widowed parent tax credit. A widowed parent whose spouse died in 2000-001 is entitled, with effect from 2001, to an additional tax credit in each of the five years from 2001 to 2005 inclusive. In 2001 the widowed parent tax credit was £2,000, &euro;2,540 &ndash; the same amount as in a full year. The widowed parent tax credit was increased to &euro;2,600 in budget 2002 and, accordingly, a person widowed in 2000-01 would be entitled to a credit of &euro;2,100 in 2002; &euro;1,600 in 2003; &euro;1,100 in 2004 and &euro;600 in 2005.</P>
      <P>A person with dependent children, widowed in the 2000-01 tax year, is entitled in 2001 to a widowed parent tax credit of £2,000, &euro;2,540, as indicated above, a widowed person tax credit of £814, &euro;1034 and a one-parent family tax credit of £814, &euro;1034.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>A lease of any dwelling house, part of a dwelling house, or apartment, for an indefinite term or for a term not exceeding 35 years, is exempt from stamp duty where the average annual rent does not exceed &euro;19,050. Where the annual rent exceeds &euro;19,050, the amount is liable to stamp duty at a rate of 1%. Leases of residential property where the term of the lease is between 35 and 100 years, or where the term of the lease is in excess of 100 <Col N="1206" /> years, are also liable for rates of 6% and 12% respectively, with the duty being charged on the average annual rent. I am advised, however, that instances of these higher rates of duty applying to residential property are rare. I should also point out that if a tenant is required to pay a lease premium under the terms of a lease, the premium amount is also liable to stamp duty at the same rates as those that apply to conveyances of residential property.</P>
      <P>As regards the history of the charge of stamp duty on leases of residential property, the charge has been a feature of the stamp duty code since the basic legal principles of tax were developed during the 19th century. An exemption from the charge where the annual rent did not exceed &euro;7,618, £6,000, was introduced by the 1989 Finance Act. This figure was increased to &euro;19,050, £15,000 by the 2000 Finance Act and applies to leases executed on or after 1 December 1999.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to provide a breakdown of the number of tenants who are liable for the tax nor is it possible to provide details of the year 2001 from this category of stamp duty. I am advised that the reason for this is that the relevant yield figures include the stamp duty collected from both leases of commercial property as well as from leases of residential property.</P>
      <P>Changing stamp duty rates is always a balancing act since one has to have regard to the various participants in the market as well as to their needs while placing them in the context of the broad economic effect.</P>
      <P>While the rates and thresholds are reviewed on an ongoing basis, I have no plans to change the threshold in relation to stamp duty in respect of leases, but will continue to have the position monitored.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any fiscal barriers to the development of rural and local community-based windfarms. It should also be pointed out that the cost of the plant and machinery for windfarms, which accounts for the bulk of the expenditure on the project, can be written off over five years at 20% per annum. The case for some further tax relief for investment in renewable energy projects has to be examined in the context of the limits applied to other tax incentive schemes both in relation to the amount of tax relief available to each investor and the maximum tax relievable cost of the project itself. As the Deputy will appreciate, the Exchequer cost of any such relief is a key consideration. I should point out that I introduced an amendment to the 2002 Finance <Col N="1207" /> Bill on Report Stage to extend the qualifying period for the existing tax relief for corporate investment in renewable energy projects until 31 December 2004. This extension requires EU Commission approval under State aid rules and will therefore be subject to a commencement order.</P>

The Government is satisfied that the benefits flowing from the increased spending in key areas such as health, education and social welfare, more than justify its acceptance of a growth rate in net current expenditure above the target set out in the 1997 programme.</P>

      <P>I am committed to ensuring that spending in 2002 does not exceed the limits set out in the Revised Estimates Volume as published on 28 February last.</P>
      <P>I have already briefed both my ministerial colleagues and Secretaries General of Departments on the need to exercise firm control over public spending this year.</P>
      <P>In addition to the normal expenditure monitoring and control procedures which are operated by my Department throughout the year, I have also initiated a monthly report to Government on trends in spending and receipts based on the information available for the end month Exchequer statement. This will enable the Government to take immediate corrective action in the event of unanticipated pressures emerging as the year progresses.</P>

      <P>The published end-February Exchequer statement <Col N="1209" /> showed that voted current and capital issues to Departments were up some 22% over the same period in 2001 in comparison with a forecast increase of 14% for the year as a whole.</P>
      <P>The published end-month Exchequer statement does not provide a current-capital split of the total figure. However, I can tell the Deputy that at end-February net voted current spending was up some 19% and net voted capital spending increased by 32% to end-February 2001. The figures can be affected by timing factors either in 2002 or in the base year, 2001.</P>
      <P>On current spending the Votes which showed the biggest increases were Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs, Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>The increase in spending by the Department of Health and Children is generally a reflection of timing issues arising from a lower drawdown from the Exchequer to end-February 2001 in comparison with the drawdown in January and February 2002.  In the case of Social, Community and Family Affairs the increase was in line with the forecast increase provided for in the Revised Estimates and reflects earlier payment dates in 2002 in comparison with 2001.</P>
      <P>Spending by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to end-February 2002 includes BSE compensation and other payments which were not made until later in 2001 either because the BSE scheme had not yet commenced at this stage last year and owing to particular delays in 2001 arising from the precautions taken to prevent the spread of Foot and Mouth Disease. The increased spending by the Department of Public Enterprise reflects a timing issue. Payments to CIE were made later in the year in 2001 whereas the payments up to end-February 2002 are in line with the expected profile.</P>
      <P>The increase in capital spending is mainly due to spending by the Department of Environment and Local Government. Spending on roads, water and housing is up on this time last year.</P>
      <P>I am committed to ensuring that spending for the year as a whole will remain on target and I have made this clear to all Departments.</P>

      <P>After the meeting on 8 February 2002 between my officials in the Office of Public Works and representatives of Kildare County Council to discuss reports received from the council in relation to flooding from the Meadowbrook, Lyreen and Morrell rivers, two further meetings took place during February. The county council has now identified a series of interim measures that might be undertaken to alleviate flooding. The council's consultants have been asked to examine these proposed interim measures to ensure that they will not have any adverse impacts elsewhere. The consultants' report is now awaited. The Office of Public Works has also provided guidance to the county council on its requirements &ndash; inclusion of an environmental impact study and cost benefit analysis &ndash; for a full feasibility study in relation to the reports already received from the county council on the Morrell, Meadowbrook and Lyreen rivers. The county council is now preparing the necessary tender documentation and brief for the extension of the existing reports to complete all aspects of the feasibility study to the required scope and standards including EIS and CBA.</P>

      <P>The original forecasted cost of providing medical cards for persons aged 70 and over was approximately &euro;19 million. This figure was based on a possible 39,000 eligible persons and is predomi<Col N="1211" /> nantly made up of capitation payments to doctors, other costs considered include increased practice support grants and allowances. The most recent figures available to my Department suggest that the number of people in this age category is now in the region of 71,000.</P>
      <P>In relation to 2002 costs, my Department is working with the health boards and the GMS (Payments) Board to determine the likely full year costs in consideration of the evidence which suggests that people in this age category continue to register. As part of this work an assessment will be made of the offsetting savings emerging within the drug payments scheme following the transfer of persons aged 70 and over to the GMS scheme. It is not possible, therefore, to put an accurate figure on full year costs for 2002 at this time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 326 to 328, inclusive, 416 and 437 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to supporting the establishment of a lung transplant facility in Ireland and to ensuring that the programme, when introduced, will be in a position to match the highest international standards in lung transplantation. The Mater Hospital, Dublin, has been designated as the surgical site for the programme. The provision of a lung transplant unit at the hospital forms part of a major capital development approved for the hospital. In order to advance this project an expert consultative group chaired by the Eastern Regional Health Authority was established to advise my Department on various issues associated with the development of the programme. The report of the consultative group has recently been received and is being considered by my Department. A meeting between officials from my Department, the ERHA and representatives of the consultative group has been arranged for later this month to discuss the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending the establishment of an Irish-based programme, an agreement was put in place in April 1999 with the Freeman Hospital in the UK for the treatment of Irish patients requiring a lung or heart and lung transplant. Information sup<Col N="1214" /> plied by the Mater Hospital indicates that 19 transplants have been performed on Irish patients at the Freeman Hospital since April 1999 while 142 people have been referred for assessment and 24 are actively awaiting admission for transplant subject to donor availability and matching.

      <P>Persons suffering from any of the following conditions who are not already medical card holders may obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness (for persons under 16 years only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia. There are no plans to amend the scheme to include persons with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.</P>
      <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances justifies this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. Non-medical card holders and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;53.33 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

      <P>There is no statutory minimum educational requirements for pre-school providers at present. Article 7 of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, provides that &ldquo;a person carrying on a pre-school service shall ensure that a sufficient number of competent adults are supervising the pre-school children in the service at all times.&rdquo; The explanatory guide to the regulations defines a competent adult as a person who has appropriate experience in caring for children under six years of age or who has an appropriate qualification in child care and is a suitable person to care for children. I have established a review group to review these regulations and the review is currently under way.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has established a certifying bodies subgroup of the national co-ordinating child care committee to develop a national qualifications and training framework in child care. The framework will address qualification, certification and accreditation issues in the child care sector from foundation to third level. When completed later this year it will be submitted for consideration to the National Qualifications Authority. It will assist in providing for progression routes and recognition of the child care role as a profession. The process includes wide consultation with child care organisations, child care providers and the public.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the funding of services, including paediatric cardiac surgery at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Waiting list figures received from the Eastern Regional Health Authority for the quarter ending 31 December 2001 shows that there were six children waiting between three and six months for cardiac surgery and that there were eight children waiting for more than six months for cardiac surgery at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin. These figures represent a decrease of 57% and 72% respectively on the corresponding numbers on 31 December 2000.</P>
      <P>The theatre development at the hospital, which I recently approved at an estimated construction cost of &euro;25.4 million, will provide five new operating theatres. The existing two theatre suites will also be upgraded as part of that project. When these theatres are fully commissioned it is expected that the hospital will be in a position to perform an additional 100 paediatric cardiac procedures per annum, which is an increase of 40% on its existing capacity.</P>

The Southern Health Board has further advised me that it is currently holding discussions with the ICA regarding its submission and how the issues raised therein may be addressed in line with the health board's strategy, Ageing with Confidence, and other relevant strategies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to registered general nurses working in the intellectual disability sector. All registered general nurses are eligible to work in the intellectual disability sector. My Department has no specific requirements in this regard. While it is always preferable to employ registered mental handicap nurses, the current shortage of such nurses has led to an increase in the number of registered general nurses working in the sector. To coincide with the introduction of the new pre-registration nursing degree programme this year the Government has provided funding for an additional 93 places annually including 20 mental handicap places at both Letterkenny Institute of Technology with the North-Western Health Board and Waterford Institute of Technology with the South-Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,640 places will be available nationally from this year on the new degree programmes, including 240 mental handicap nursing places. This is an all-time record and is a key element of my overall strategy for ensuring that we produce sufficient nurses to staff our health services into the future. The Deputy will be interested to note the huge rise in the number of people who have applied through the CAO for places on the new degree programme. This year 8,882 applicants applied, a 35% increase on last year's figure. This is most encouraging and reflects the high level of interest in nursing as a career. It is also a resounding endorsement of the national and local campaign undertaken by the Nursing Careers Centre and health agencies which were funded by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of speech and language therapy services to children with Down's Syndrome in the north east is a matter for the North-Eastern Health Board. Additional funding has been made available annually in recent years to the health boards, including the North-Eastern Health Board, for the provision of health-related support services for children with an intellectual disability and those with autism. In addition to this ring-fenced funding, children with disabilities have also benefited from the additional therapy posts which have been put in place in services for persons with physical or sensory disabilities. Many health boards and specialist service providers have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting allied health professionals, especially speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. This is due primarily to the general shortage of available staff in these grades nationally.</P>
      <P>Health boards and agencies have been and are continuing to undertake intensive recruitment drives at home and abroad. My Department has asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision or an enhancement in line with agreed service developments using the resources allocated to the services. In response to my concern regarding the high level of vacancies my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The study was published in July 2001. The report recommends an annual increase of 75 course places for speech and language therapy in order to achieve a fourfold increase in the number of speech and language therapists over the next decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study. The proposals received are currently being assessed by the group with a view to allocating the increased course places as soon as possible. In addition the Northern Area Health Board will shortly be undertaking a concerted overseas recruitment drive for speech and language therapists on behalf of all health boards. The report of the expert group on various health professionals recommended the establishment of a therapy assistant grade where appropriate to provide practical support to speech and language thera<Col N="1220" /> pists in their work and also to address the issue of skills mix. This recommendation will be dealt with in 2002 in the context of the continuing implementation of the report.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to an article (details supplied) concerning the introduction of enterprise liability here; his views on the reported comment in an official memorandum concerning a mechanism used to smooth the transfer of obstetricians from one medical defence organisation to another in 2001; the nature of this mechanism; if there was payment of moneys, either directly or indirectly by the State, to a medical defence organisation; the level of such payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The memorandum to which the Deputy refers is a briefing paper prepared for the information of the Secretary General of my Department. The background to the transfer of some 30 consultant obstetricians from one medical defence body to the other is as follows: In March 2001 the Medical Defence Union indicated that it proposed to charge a subscription of £393,000 to obstetricians in Ireland renewing their membership after July 2001. As the Exchequer would be bearing the greater part of the cost of the increase from the previous subscription of £68,000, the Medical Defence Union informed my Department of its plans. Officials of my Department, supported by their insurance advisors, considered that having the Exchequer fund public hospitals' share of this increase represented poor value for taxpayers' money, given the Government's plans for the introduction of enterprise liability in July 2002.</P>
      <P>My Department wrote to the Medical Defence Union and to the other mutual medical defence body providing cover to Irish doctors, the Medical Protection Society, expressing its concern that obstetricians might not be able to secure necessary indemnity cover at an affordable cost in the run-up to the introduction of enterprise liability. My Department requested that the two defence bodies submit proposals to deal with this concern and smooth the way to the introduction of enterprise liability. Proposals were received from both bodies. These were examined by officials of my Department and their insurance experts. Their unanimous advice was that the proposal of the Medical Protection Society be accepted. The Medical Protection Society agreed to examine all requests for membership from consultant obstetricians who had previously been members of the Medical Defence Union. As far as I know, all of the obstetricians who had formerly been members of the Medical Defence Union were accepted into membership of the Medical Protection Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transferring members of the Medical Protection Society enjoy the same benefits of membership as those who had previously been members of the society. They paid the same level of subscription as the other consultants in the <Col N="1223" /> speciality, £56,000. The precise terms on which the Medical Protection Society agreed to consider the applications for membership are the subject of an agreement between my Department and the Medical Protection Society which has a confidentiality clause. These terms are commercially sensitive, as are the terms contained in the proposal received from the Medical Defence Union. I propose to respect the confidential nature of both sets of proposals. However, I can confirm that there was no transfer of funds, directly or indirectly, by the State to either of the medical defence bodies other than the normal reimbursement by public hospitals to their consultants of the appropriate percentage of the medical defence subscriptions provided for in their contracts of employment.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for the provision of health services in Ennis rests with the chief executive officer of the Mid-Western Health Board. While in Ennis, County Clare on 1 March 2002 the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, had the pleasure of visiting Ennis General Hospital and officially opening the new acute psychiatric unit, the new cardiac rehabilitation unit and the refurbished mammography unit on the hospital campus. The Minister also announced that he had recently written to the Mid-Western Health Board approving the selection and appointment of a design team to prepare a development control plan for the hospital. The Mid-Western Health Board has placed the necessary advertisement in the <i>European Journal</i> inviting applications from suitably qualified architects and other consultants for the project.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the Ennis hospital project team will continue to work towards the completion of the brief for priority developments at the hospital as well as the agreed functional content for the development of the hospital on the existing hospital site. I understand from the Mid-Western Health Board that it has undertaken a review of old age psychiatry services with the objective of examining the future development of this service area in the region. The board has advised that as part of the process a draft review document has been prepared and contributors to the review such as the Clarecastle day care group will have the opportunity to engage with the consultants in old age psychiatry at a planned presentation of the document. The Mid-Western Health Board has advised that while it had been informed of a desire to develop an Alzheimer's unit by members of the group no finalised plans in relation to a proposal had been received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 350 and 409 together.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about the delays being experienced by applicants for inter-country adoption assessment in the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The number of applicants awaiting assessment in the ERHA at the end of 2001 was 477 for first assessment and 61 for second assessment. Delays have arisen over the last few years because of an increased interest in inter-country adoption and difficulties being experienced by the South West Area Health Board, which to date has been providing this service on behalf of the three area boards, in recruiting social workers in the child care area, including inter-country adoption. The standardised framework for inter-country adoption assessment procedures is now being used in all health boards. The purpose is to streamline assessment processes for first and second assessments so that resources are used effectively and to provide a transparent system that can be understood by all of the parties. The framework has been welcomed by health boards and couples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To reduce the time spent by couples on the waiting lists for inter-country adoption assessment in the health boards additional funding of &euro;2,101,000 or £1,655,000 has been provided over the last four years. Almost &euro;830,000 or £653,000 has been provided in this period to the ERHA and this has been used for the following measures: to increase significantly the number of social workers in the service &ndash; funding has been provided to raise the complement of social workers (whole time equivalent) to over 20. At the end of last year, because of ongoing difficulties over recruitment, there were only 9.5 social workers (whole time equivalent) in the service; to assign new administrative personnel to provide support for social workers. This is to free social workers to concentrate on assessments, post-placement reports and other appropriate work; a one-stop shop facility has been introduced to increase capacity for holding office-based interviews and reduce the time that social workers <Col N="1227" /> spend travelling to and from clients; to implement the standardised framework fully.</P>
    <P>Discussions have been going on with the ERHA on further measures to reduce waiting times. The authority has decided that two new assessment units will be established in the northern and east coast area boards and that the present service will become the unit for the SWAHB. I am advised by the ERHA that discussions are at an advanced stage with the three area boards on the arrangements for devolving the service with a view to having the service operational. A final decision as to the exact structure for the service in the region is expected shortly. The ERHA is currently recruiting a regional co-ordinator who will support the restructuring of the service.</P>
    <P>A letter has issued to all applicants notifying them of the impending changes to the current service and their place on the current waiting list and a further letter will be issued to all applicants informing them of any new developments as soon as possible. Subject to availability of staff, I hope that this initiative will be successful in reducing the delays currently being experienced by the couples in the region. I will continue to monitor the situation in relation to the new arrangements for the new assessment centres. In addition to the initiatives taken by the ERHA I have also recently written to the other seven health boards asking them to consider assisting the ERHA in carrying out inter-country adoption assessments. Unfortunately, none of the boards were in a position to release social workers to assist the ERHA in undertaking assessments. Some boards have indicated that they may be in a position to offer assistance to the ERHA on the organisation and delivery of preparation courses in their respective regions. This is being followed up on by the ERHA.</P>
    <P>The ERHA has also advised that a dedicated customer services officer is being appointed in the current service. This person will deal with all customer queries and should provide improved information on the inter-country adoption process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 356 and 357 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there are no proposals to extend automatic eligibility to people affected by this condition. However, people who cannot arrange without undue hardship for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to <Col N="1229" /> decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    <P>Persons suffering from any of the following conditions who are not already medical card holders may obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap; mental illness, for persons under 16 years only; phenylketonuria; cystic fibrosis; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; diabetes mellitus; diabetes insipidus; haemophilia; cerebral palsy; epilepsy; multiple sclerosis; muscular dystrophies; parkinsonism and acute leukaemia. There are no plans to amend the scheme to include persons with polio. Non-medical card holders and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;53.33 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. Health Boards are obliged to treat all applications fairly when applying for medical cards.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 358 and 360 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of health-related services to people with physical and sensory disabilities, including those with post-polio syndrome, is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Health boards provide a range of support services to enable people with physical and sensory disabilities to live as independently as possible within the community. This includes residential respite care, day care, home support including personal assistance services, nursing, therapy, counselling and family support, aids and appliances. Specialised residential care services are also provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" />Significant additional funding of over &euro;175 million has been provided by this Government since coming into office. This level of funding is indicative of the Government's ongoing commitment to the provision of quality services and includes: just under &euro;30 million for aids and appliances; &euro;60 million ongoing funding for the development of services including residential, respite, home support and personal assistance and therapy services; &euro;36 million for capital projects; and a significant proportion of the remainder allocated in support of voluntary sector service providers. In addition to this level of funding my Department, in conjunction with the Health Research Board, the health boards and the voluntary sector service providers, are currently developing the national physical and sensory disability database, which I recently launched. When complete, the database will provide a detailed picture of each individual's health service requirements over a five year period and at national level, detailed statistical information to assist in the acquisition of funds and identify priority services at which to target these resources. The database will be an essential tool in the delivery of effective services to people with physical and sensory disabilities in a planned and co-ordinated manner.</P>
    <P>The above-mentioned issues relate to the many and varying conditions which cause physical and sensory disabilities, including post-polio syndrome. It is not proposed to form a committee relating specifically to that condition. It is worth noting, however, that the Disability Federation of Ireland, of which the Post-Polio Support Group is a member, is represented at various forums such as the national physical and sensory disability database committee and the review group on home support services.</P>

The children in respect of whom these allowances are paid must be in the care of the health board, under the Child Care Act, 1991, either on a voluntary basis or by court order. Under the regulations, a health board must assess the needs of a child placed in care and the suitability of the prospective foster or relative carers and draw up a child care plan. The implementation of the child care plan places significant responsibilities and duties on foster carers, whether relatives or non-relatives. The foster care allowance is paid in recognition of these additional responsibilities and the additional costs of looking after foster children.</P>

      <P>The relevant regulations, which set out the criteria and procedures for granting community pharmacy contracts which allowed pharmacies to dispense prescriptions under the medical card and drug payment schemes, had been subject to ongoing legal challenges. During the course of those challenges, the legal basis of the regulations was raised. Against this background I sought legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General. On the advice received I concluded that I could not continue to operate the regulations and with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, whose consent is required, I proceeded to revoke them.</P>
      <P>The effect of the revocation for the awarding of new community pharmacy contracts is that there are no restrictions on granting new contracts in terms of location, population or viability of existing pharmacies. The revocation does not affect the operation of the community pharmacy scheme, and existing contracts still stand. All existing contract applications and appeals lapsed with the regulations. Those affected should contact the relevant health board directly about re-applying.</P>
      <P>The opening of new pharmacies continues to be governed by the Pharmacy Acts, subject to restrictions imposed by non-pharmacy legislation such as the planning Acts. The pharmacy review group established by my Department to examine the pharmacy issues raised in the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland is now being asked to report as quickly as possible given the new situation. The type of framework, whether statutory or otherwise, required for community pharmacy services will be considered when the group reports. I am considering a number of options pending the completion of the work of the group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1234" />The terms of reference of the group take account of consumer concerns by requiring it to consult widely with consumer interests. As well as a general invitation for public submissions a wide range of consumer organisations were specifically invited to make submissions. I have already met with representatives of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union to discuss their concerns following the revocation of SI 152 of 1996. Discussions are taking place between officials from my Department and representatives of the IPU.</P>

      <P>Persons suffering from any of the following conditions who are not already medical card holders may obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap; mental illness, for persons under 16 years only; phenylketonuria; cystic fibrosis; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; diabetes mellitus; diabetes insipidus; haemophilia; cerebral palsy; epilepsy; multiple sclerosis; muscular dystrophies; parkinsonism and acute leukaemia. There are no plans to amend this to include persons with cancer-related illnesses. People who cannot arrange without undue hardship for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.</P>
      <P>Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. Non-medical card holders and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;53.33 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

      <P>Domiciliary care allowance, DCA, is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department. DCA is paid in respect of eligible children from the date of application up to the age of 16 years whose disability is so severe that they require constant care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. It is a matter for the senior area medical officer in the relevant health board to decide whether a child qualifies for DCA. In reaching such a decision, the senior area medical officer may consider a report from any doctor or any hospital which has treated the child.</P>
      <P>A national health board working group is currently examining all the disability related allowances and grants which come under the aegis of my Department, including domiciliary care allowance. When the group has finalised its report, its recommendations will be considered in consultation with the Department of Finance and in the context of the many competing demands for resources within the health sector.</P>

      <P>A common list of reimbursable medicines was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme. This list ensures equity between the schemes in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both. This common list is subject to ongoing review and amendment on a monthly basis as new products become available and deletions are notified. In order for any item to be included in the common medicines list it must comply with a published list of criteria. These range from their authorisation status where appropriate, their price and in certain cases the uses for which the products are intended. In addition, the products should ordinarily be supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public. As the product referred to by the Deputy does not have a product authorisation from the Irish Medicines Board and as such is not being marketed in this country by the manufacturer it is not included on the common list of reimbursable medicines.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy will be pleased to learn that a protocol, a copy of which is attached, was drawn up to set out the circumstances and conditions in which a necessary unlicensed medicine may be reimbursed by the State, where lawfully supplied. Applications for reimbursement which meet the circumstances and conditions set out in the protocol should therefore be made to the relevant agency &ndash; the General Medical Services (Payments) Board or the local health board.</P>

However, I have been informed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority that the treatment list for drug abusers in the Tallaght area is held at the drug treatment centre at 515 Main Street, Tallaght. Drug treatment services in Tallaght are provided at Millbrook Lawns at the mobile bus which is situated in the grounds of Tallaght Hospital through services provided by level one and level two general practitioners and through <Col N="1239" /> the addiction centre in Jobstown and a number of community pharmacies. Services are also provided at satellite clinics at Brookfield, St. Aengus, Jobstown, Fettercairn and Killinarden. The numbers attending these satellite clinics and with general practitioners is limited by the number of community pharmacy places available. The South Western Area Health Board continues to engage with local pharmacists to encourage more pharmacists to become involved in the methadone protocol or to take on more patients.</P>
      <P>The SWAHB had proposed that Killinarden health centre would provide the services of an addiction centre and dispense methadone on site. However, I have been informed that the management of the programme referred to by the Deputy was unable to support this proposal. Capital funding has been approved for the development of a permanent building for the project referred to by the Deputy. This new building will have the capacity to allow for the dispensing of methadone. The SWAHB is currently in discussion with the management of the programme referred to by the Deputy in relation to the location and other aspects of this new building. I am confident that once opened, this centre will greatly improve the situation for drug abusers in the Tallaght area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 388, 442 and 443 together.</P>
      <P>The relevant regulations, which set out the criteria and procedures for granting community pharmacy contracts which allowed pharmacies to dispense prescriptions under the medical card and drug payment schemes had been subject to ongoing legal challenges. During the course of those challenges, the legal basis of the regulations was raised. Against this background I sought legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General. On the advice received and on the basis of the ongoing legal proceedings, I concluded that I could not continue to operate the regulations and with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, whose consent is required, I proceeded to revoke them.</P>
      <P>The effect of the revocation on the awarding of new community pharmacy contracts is that there are no restrictions on granting new contracts in terms of location, population or viability of existing pharmacies. The revocation does not affect the operation of the community pharmacy scheme and existing contracts still stand. All existing contract applications and appeals lapsed with the regulations. Those affected should contact the relevant health board directly about reapplying.</P>
      <P>The opening of new pharmacies continues to be governed by the Pharmacy Acts, subject to restrictions imposed by non-pharmacy legislation such as the planning Acts. The pharmacy review group, which held its first meeting on 2 November 2001, was established to examine the pharmacy issues raised in the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland and is now being asked to report as quickly as possible given the new situation. The type of framework, whether statutory or otherwise, required for community pharmacy services will be considered when the group reports. I am considering a number of options pending the completion of the work of the group.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, funding for the nursing home subvention scheme has increased significantly in recent years. When the Government came to office in 1997 the funding for the scheme was £27.8 million or &euro;35.30 million. A total of £52 million or &euro;66.03 million was made available for 2001 while in 2002, the funding for the scheme has again been substantially increased, amounting to £72 million or &euro;91 million. In addition to this, approximately &euro;254 million will be available for the capital development of services for older people over the period of the national development plan. Of this allocation, &euro;23.76 million is available in 2002, bringing the total additional funding available for services for older people in 2002 to in excess of &euro;114 million.</P>
      <P>This significant additional funding is indicative of the Government's commitment to improving the health services available for older people and it is the intention to commit similar resources to this sector in the coming years in line with the principles outlined in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1245" />In response to my concern regarding current labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide my Department commissioned a report by Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists, including occupational therapists. The study was published in July 2001 and concluded that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of each of the therapy grades, requiring a significant increase in training places. The report recommends an annual increase of 75 course places for occupational therapy to achieve an increase of over 150% in the number of occupational therapists over the next decade.</P>
    <P>An inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study. The proposals received are currently being assessed by the working group with a view to allocating the increased course places as soon as possible. In addition, I understand that the Northern Area Health Board will shortly be undertaking a concerted overseas recruitment drive on behalf of all health boards to supply professional therapists, including occupational therapists.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Deputy for this opportunity to clarify the Government's commitment to the provision of health-related services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Since coming into office, additional funding of just over &euro;175 million has been provided by this Government for the maintenance and development of health-related services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. This year, additional funding of just under &euro;40 million has been provided for this purpose. This includes: &euro;15.29 million provided for existing services and the full year cost of 2001 development programme; &euro;7.56 million for the development of services, including therapy and home support services; &euro;6.411 million towards the under-resourcing of the voluntary sector; &euro;1.27 million for the transfer of the FÁS CE scheme; &euro;9.322 million for capital projects under the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the recommendations of the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory dis<Col N="1246" /> abilities, priorities for the allocation of funding available for the development of services are decided by the health boards in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services. Voluntary sector service providers and consumers are represented on these committees. My Department, in conjunction with the Health Research Board, the health boards and the voluntary sector, is also developing the national physical and sensory disability database, which I recently launched. When complete, the database will enable quality services to be provided to people with physical and sensory disabilities in an efficient and co-ordinated manner.</P>
    <P>This programme of substantial investment over recent years emphasises the Government's commitment to the ongoing development of quality health services to people with physical and sensory disabilities and is in line with the commitments given in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <P>The mission of the Health Boards Executive, HeBE, is to pursue the strategic development of a modern, equitable, high-quality and person-centred health service by enabling the chief executive officers of the health boards, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and area boards, together with their staff and provider agencies, to work jointly to achieve significant and measurable service improvements and value for money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>HeBE was established by ministerial order on 13 of February 2002 in advance of the target date set in the health strategy. As it is a new organisation, policy development will take some time and will be informed by the implementation of the health strategy and the audit of the health <Col N="1247" /> services to be conducted shortly. Its primary purpose is to enable conjoint working of the chief executive officers of the health boards, ERHA and area health boards on health and personal social service issues in order to increase efficiency and effectiveness in the administration and delivery of services. HeBE will provide a mechanism for co-operation between two or more boards and on a national basis for initiatives in the modernisation of the health strategy. It will undertake executive functions which will be devolved from the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>There is now a great awareness of the need for health agencies to work together in one integrated health system for the benefit of the individual. HeBE provides one mechanism for this to be achieved. Closer formal co-operation between the boards allows better planning, pooling of resources and economies of scale. I can assure Deputy Allen that far from being a layer of bureaucracy in the health services, HeBE, as a complementary body to the health boards, will enable closer co-operation and add value to the work of individual boards. It will play an important role in modernising our health service and in demonstrating value for money from the very significant investment that continues to be made in the development of our health and personal social services.</P>

      <P>The Government published the report of the Forum on Medical Manpower and the report of the national joint steering group on the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, last year. It also approved the establishment of a national task force on medical manpower to prepare a detailed implementation programme for the phased reduction of the working hours of NCHDs, required under the EU working time directive and Council Directives 93/104/EC and 2000/34/EC. The Government decided that it would consider the proposed development of a consultant-delivered public hospital service following quantification of the resource and cost implications involved.</P>
      <P>In order to assess the implications of the recommendations of the report of the forum it will be necessary for the task force to quantify the effect the changes are likely to have on the improvement of services and to examine the workforce changes needed and to assess the costs involved. The task force will have particular regard to the likely benefits to patients, continuity of care, work patterns and clinical responsibility and professional development in a system which is less dependent on doctors in training and more on the changed work patterns of an increased number of consultants. I will bring proposals to Government, including costs, when the task force has reported on this stage of its work. The views of the Minister for Finance will be obtained at that stage. Throughout its work the task force will include representation from the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>The provision which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of the adult sons and daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parent's nursing home care was deleted from the 1 January 1999. As the Deputy is aware, it has been decided that monies should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision. A group representing the Department and the health boards and Eastern Regional Health Authority was established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. Instructions as to how the payments should be made issued recently from my Department and funding has been made available to commence the making of these payments from 1 November 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 402 and 407 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Orthodontic guidelines were issued by my Department in 1985 and are still in operation. Their purpose is to allow prioritisation of children for orthodontic treatment based on the severity of need. The guidelines are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way those <Col N="1250" /> in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them. Persons assessed as category A have severe malocclusions and should receive urgent orthodontic care; those assessed as category B have less severe problems and are placed on orthodontic treatment waiting lists. The number of cases treated will depend on the level of resources available in terms of qualified staff in an area.</P>
    <P>Health board consultant orthodontists recommended that the 1985 guidelines be modified to prioritise treatment for the most severe cases. The purpose of the modified 1985 guidelines is to ensure that the most severe cases receive priority treatment as soon as possible. My Department will be writing to the chief executive officers of the health boards concerning the operation of these modified guidelines with regard to maintaining the delivery of orthodontic services in a prioritised way. The chief executive officers' report on orthodontics, known as the Moran report, recommended the use of an alternative index of need. This is known as the index of orthodontic treatment need, IOTN. The chief dental officer has advised that this new index should not be implemented until its implications have been evaluated in a national survey of children's dental health. This survey is currently under way and is expected to be completed this year. The purpose of the survey is to identify accurately the number of children that would benefit from orthodontic treatment and the resources needed to meet the corresponding level of care.</P>
    <P>I have taken a range of important measures to improve the capacity of the public orthodontic services and place it on a sound long-term footing. Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service such as the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. Six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North Eastern Health Board and South Eastern Health Board commenced their training last October for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. My Department has provided &euro;541,000 in 2002 for this training. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence this year are also under way.</P>
    <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for specialist training in dentistry through the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork university dental school to facilitate the <Col N="1251" /> development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately &euro;1.27 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
    <P>In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. An additional six-surgery and five-surgery facility at the Loughlinstown regional urthodontic unit and the St. James' Hospital regional orthodontic unit respectively have also been developed under the initiative. My Department is exploring with boards every possibility to expand the level of services in the short-term such as the use of private specialist orthodontic practitioners and the treatment of patients in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    <P>My Department has also funded the development of new regional orthodontic units at Dundalk and Navan, both of which are operational, and the recruitment of a consultant orthodontist for the Midland Health Board who was appointed last year. The chief executive officers of the health boards have advised me that the number of patients awaiting assessment and treatment fell by 1,133 and 1,613 respectively between June and December 2001. In addition, at the end of the December 2001 quarter there were 17,295 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 3,086 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in May 1999. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The MMR vaccine is available under the primary childhood immunisation programme. This provides for the immunisation of children against a range of potentially serious infectious diseases. Under the programme parents may have their children immunised free of charge by the general practitioner of their choice. The schedule of immunisation is in accordance with the recommendations of the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, RCPI. There is no provision for children to receive separate measles, mumps or rubella vaccinations under this programme. Information provided by the Irish Medicines Board, which has responsibility for licensing all pharmaceutical products in Ireland, indicates that individual vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella are currently licensed in Ireland but only single dose rubella vaccine is marketed in Ireland. My Department has no information regarding the marketing of single measles, mumps or rubella vaccines across the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are sound public health reasons for not administering the MMR as separate vaccines. First of all, the scientific evidence does not support a link between MMR and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. There is no evidence that administering the three components of MMR as separate vaccines is safer. The immune system is well capable of responding to the small number <Col N="1254" /> of components in the MMR vaccine and there is no evidence that the component parts of the MMR vaccine interfere with each other. In any event, vaccines are designed to strengthen the immune system and not weaken it.</P>
    <P>If the vaccines were to be given separately, this would also mean that a total of six injections would be required to complete the course instead of two which could also mean an increased risk of local reactions at the injection site. The practical aspect of giving six injections would mean that children are unprotected for a greater period of time from these diseases and therefore at significantly greater risk of contracting these infections. The protracted time involved in administering the vaccines would result in the diseases in question circulating in the community for longer. Unprotected children would, therefore, be at greater risk of catching these infections. This would include younger children, below the age of 15 months, and children who are immuno-suppressed.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge no other country advocates the use of three separate vaccines rather than the MMR vaccine. The MMR vaccine is in use worldwide. Most countries implement a two-dose MMR vaccine programme and this policy has been very successful in controlling measles where high uptake of the vaccine has been achieved. My primary concern and that of my Department in relation to immunisation is that the vaccines in use are safe and effective. The international consensus from professional bodies and international organisations is that MMR is a safe and effective vaccine and that the recently published medical evidence does not support a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. The institutions include the Medical Research Council expert committee in the UK, the British Committee on Safety of Medicines, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA, the American Academy of Paediatrics, the World Health Organisation and UK professional organisations. Most recently, the United States Institute of Medicine also concluded that there was no link between the vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. This consensus is based on large-scale epidemiological studies and more specific studies done in the laboratory setting.</P>
    <P>With regard to the study referred to by the Deputy, the researchers themselves indicated that a link between MMR vaccine and autism had not been proven. Further research from the same hospital as Dr. Wakefield's found no causal link between MMR vaccine and autism. This was supported by a large Finnish study involving 1.8 million individuals which demonstrated that no case of inflammatory bowel disease or autism was linked to the MMR vaccine. A similar Swedish study found no increase in cases of autism in the ten years during which MMR vaccine was introduced. Dr. Wakefield's research was subjected to critical review and the general conclusion, having evaluated his research and other studies, is that <Col N="1255" /> there is no causal link between the MMR vaccine and autism.</P>
    <P>The World Health Organisation has indicated that observations made regarding the onset of autism following the administration of MMR vaccine do not meet the scientific criteria required to suggest that the vaccine is the cause. It has also indicated that there has been no new scientific evidence that would suggest impaired safety of MMR. The WHO strongly endorses the use of MMR vaccine on the grounds of its convincing record of safety and efficacy. This view is supported by the Irish Medicines Board and by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. The Irish Medicines Board is responsible for the monitoring and safety of all pharmaceutical products in Ireland. The monitoring of vaccine safety is ensured through clinical trials prior to licence and post-licence surveillance by the IMB. The IMB liaises closely with international bodies including the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and the World Health Organisation.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Health and Children, in its report on childhood immunisation which was published in July 2001, concluded that there is no evidence of a proven link between the MMR vaccine and autism and that there is no evidence to show that the separate vaccines are any safer than the combined MMR vaccine. I would like to take this opportunity to urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme in order to ensure that both their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the disease concerned. General practitioners are aware of the contraindications to the recommended childhood immunisations and parents should discuss any concerns they may have with their general practitioner before making a decision about their child's immunisation.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, at the request of the board and in the context of the national review of acute hospital bed capacity which I recently launched, I was happy to set aside indicative funding of &euro;2.379 million revenue and &euro;473,000 capital for the board for additional bed capacity at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan &ndash; 14 beds &ndash; Louth County Hospital, Dundalk &ndash; 14 beds &ndash; and Monaghan General Hospital &ndash; ten beds. This funding is in addition to the board's determination of &euro;450.053 million for the current year for the maintenance and continued development of existing services and for the provision and development of new services. The provision of the ten beds at Monaghan represents an increase in the number of medical admission beds at the hospital and will also provide an opportunity to improve the special care and coronary care facility, requested by consultant physicians.</P>

      <P>The covert nature of drug misuse means it is difficult to know exactly how many drug misusers there are. I have been advised that an estimate of the number of opiate misusers in the ERHA area is between 8,000 and 13,500 individuals. Estimates of the proportion of injecting drug misusers positive for hepatitis C range from 60% to 75%. Hepatitis C is not statutorily notifiable and there is no register of those people infected with hepatitis C and consequently no reported data on the number receiving specialist anti-viral treatment.</P>
      <P>I have been further advised that hepatology services in conjunction with the drug services determine the appropriate treatment, if any, for individual drug misusers with hepatitis C. A decision on treatment will depend on whether the hepatitis C is active or not active and whether the individual has achieved stability in his or her drug use and social circumstance. Individuals with hepatitis C in the drug services who have achieved stability in relation to their drug use and social circumstances are then referred to the hepatology services for ongoing care and treatment.</P>

People with disabilities attending sheltered work services currently retain their primary and secondary state disability benefits.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there is provision under the nursing home legislation for monitoring standards in private nursing homes involving inspections by health boards, however, no similar arrangements are in place for health board facilities. It is planned to rectify this by expanding the role of the social services inspectorate to cover extended care facilities for older people. It is the intention to bring forward proposals in regard to services for older people as soon as possible. Furthermore, under the national health strategy, it has been proposed that national standards for community and long-term residential care of older people shall be prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there are no plans for an ombudsman for the elderly, the Deputy will be aware that previous calls made for such an appointment stem from the absence of legislation to deal with possible cases of elder abuse. A working group has been established for this area and its terms of reference are to advise on the development of principles, policies and guidelines in relation to elder abuse and, in this regard, to make recommendations on such of the following matters as it considers appropriate: definitions and terminology; identification and screening procedures; assessment protocols and procedures; management of sensitive information; recording and reporting <Col N="1260" /> procedures; inter-agency communications and referral practices; intervention issues and procedures to evaluate their impact; any necessary changes in legislation and legal procedures; training of relevant staff in the statutory, voluntary and private sectors, and the need for appropriate structures to deal with elder abuse.</P>
    <P>The group includes representatives from my Department, health boards, the Garda Síochána the National Council on Ageing and Older People, the Irish Nursing Homes Organisation, the Association of Home Help Organisers and voluntary organisations who represent the interests of older people and includes a consultant physician in geriatric medicine, a consultant in the psychiatry of old age, a consultant psychiatrist, a general practitioner and a clinical psychologist.</P>
    <P>Draft policies, procedures and guidelines drawn up by the working group are being tested in pilot projects which have commenced in two community care areas. Training programmes have been provided for staff members and ongoing evaluation is taking place. The main purpose of the evaluation is to assess whether the draft policies, procedures and guidelines in the identification, assessment and management of elder abuse, are appropriately designed and effective in the two health board areas. The group has set a target date for submission of a report by 30 June 2002 and it is confident that this will be met.</P>

      <P>In deciding the amount to be contributed, health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances.

      <P>As part of an ongoing review of needs within existing services, a review of the services provided by Co-Action West Cork and a number of other section 65 funded intellectual disability service providers in the Southern and Mid-Western Health Board regions was carried out in late 2001. This review identified the need for specific funding in respect of the existing services provided by these agencies. It has been specifically made clear to all agencies involved in this exercise over recent years that, while making every effort to provide the resources required to address these needs as soon as possible, my Department could not give a commitment on a specific time frame within which the identified needs would be met. As the resources are made available to my Department, specific funding has been provided annually in recent years to meet these needs in the various agencies around the country. This was also the case in 2002 with &euro;4.937 million allocated for this purpose.</P>
      <P>In relation to Co-Action West Cork, copies of the draft review report have been sent to the Southern Health Board for discussion with the agency and to provide an opportunity for both to comment on the recommendations which have been made, prior to formally agreeing the final content. In advance of this, my Department made additional funding of &euro;64,000 available to Co-Action West and to a number of other agencies which are at the same stage in the review process.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to work with the Southern Health Board and Co-Action West to address the financial issues which are of concern to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Sections 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, allow health boards the discretion to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for each health board in the context of meeting the requirements of the subvention scheme within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the funding available for the scheme was £27 million, in 2001, the sum was £52 million and in 2002 the funding available is £72 million, &euro;91.4 million. In recognition of the issues involved, this Department made significant additional resources of over £1.2 million, &euro;1.5 million available to the Southern Health Board at the end of 2001. Furthermore, the Southern Health Board received an additional £3.35 million, &euro;4.24 million this year including a sum of &euro;2.641 to respond to extra pressures on the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Southern Health Board has received a significantly increased number of claims from patients for enhanced payments in accordance with Articles 22.3 and 22.4. It is a matter for the board to determine the extent to which it can meet such claims consistent with its requirement <Col N="1266" /> to live within its overall revenue allocation and taking account of the fact that such enhanced payments are discretionary. However, in the interest of avoiding hardship to individual patients, my Department has been in regular contact with the board in an effort to find a solution which would take cognisance of the considerations outlined above. This solution involves the payment of enhanced subventions on quite a significant scale.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Southern Health Board that out of 955 patients currently in receipt of subvention, 530 are receiving enhanced subvention through the contracting of beds which compares more than favourably with the situation in other health board areas.</P>
    <P>It is the Department's intention to remain in contact with all health boards throughout the year on this and other issues. However, as the responsibility for the provision of health services in the Southern Health Board area rests with the board itself, it is a matter for the board to determine the appropriate action to be taken.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 444 and 446 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>General practitioners enter into contracts with the health boards for the provision of the primary immunisation programme to children up to the <Col N="1267" /> age of two years. The contracting general practitioners are be entitled to payment under this programme in three stages as follows: (a) on registration of child with a general practitioner; (b) on completion course of immunisation against DTaP/DT, Hib, polio, meningococcal C and MMR; (c) where the contracting general practitioner has achieved 95% uptake level in respect of the defined child population.</P>
    <P>In respect of (b) payment is issued to general practitioners in respect of registered children, on receipt of notification of completion of the course against DtaP/DT: Hib: polio and meningococcal C. In respect of (c) contracting general practitioners are entitled to bonus payments for each calendar year where they achieve a 95% uptake in respect of the cohort of children on their panel who reach their second birthday during that year. This payment is due within three months following the calendar year in which uptake levels are calculated.</P>
    <P>General practitioners enter into a contract with their health boards, and if payment has not been made to them they should raise the issue of outstanding payment with the appropriate health board. My department is not aware of any problems in respect of the payments referred to at (a) and (b). However, if the Deputy wishes to forward any further details, my Department will raise this matter with the appropriate health board.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department recently met representatives of the Irish Medical Organisation concerning the issue of outstanding bonus payments and agreed to take the matter up with the health boards. While some health boards have indicated that they are experiencing difficulties in relation to bonus payments, I understand they are currently addressing these difficulties. My Department wrote recently to the boards indicating that it is imperative that any outstanding bonus payments are processed and paid as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I fully recognise, and this is expressly echoed in the health and primary care strategies, the importance of information technology and electronic knowledge management in moving towards an integrated quality based, effective and efficient primary care health care service. The soon to be finalised health information strategy will comprehensively detail the information and related technology issues that must be addressed over the next few years.</P>
      <P>The present position is that the national level of computerisation in general practice is approximately 80% of the estimated 1,280 practices in the State. Most of that computerisation has been achieved with grant aid support from health boards but the precise level of support varies between boards and significantly between practices. This reflects the state of practice computerisation applicable in the particular board, the size of the practice being computerised and the cost of the system being installed.</P>
      <P>I should point out, however, that there is no absolute grant entitlement and therefore the issue of delays in processing applications does not arise, as such. Doctors are also free to use their drugs budgeting savings to assist with computerising their practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department also funds a national information technology training programme for general practitioners operated through the National GPIT Group established by the Department and having representation from health boards, the Irish College of General Practitioners and the Irish Medical Organisation. As a means of ensuring that general practitioners are kept advised of <Col N="1269" /> developments in computerisation, the National GPIT Group conducted a nation-wide information mail shot to general practitioners in February and further mail shots will be undertaken in the course of this year.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the hospital system in general is experiencing increased pressure on elective beds because of the growing number of admissions through accident and emergency departments. Available data indicates that about 70% of all hospital admissions are through accident and emergency departments. In addition, a growing proportion of bed capacity is being taken up by the elderly who have a higher than average length of stay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hospitals providing accident and emergency services experience a seasonal increase in activity <Col N="1270" /> and surge in admissions during the winter months. Every effort is made to keep waiting times to an absolute minimum and to ensure that appropriate medical care is provided at all times.</P>
    <P>A triage system of assessment operates at accident and emergency departments whereby each patient attending at an accident and emergency department is assessed and treated according to his or her medical priority, the objective being to ensure that a person requiring treatment has access to a senior clinical decision-making service and is treated without undue delay.</P>
    <P>One of the initiatives taken by this Government to improve services in accident and emergency departments included the provision of &euro;40.63 million investment package in the winter of 2000-01 aimed at alleviating service pressures and maintaining services to patients, particularly in the acute hospital sector. This investment package was targeted at a number of areas, including the recruitment of additional accident and emergency consultants.</P>
    <P>Funding was also provided for the contracting of additional private nursing home places by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. These places are for patients whose acute phase of treatment has been completed but who require additional care in an alternative setting. The ERHA and the health boards contracted more than 700 beds under this initiative in the winter of 2000-01 and this helped to free up acute beds for patients awaiting admission to hospitals. This level of funding was repeated over the winter period October 2001 to March 2002 and has been of significant benefit to health agencies in responding to the high level of demand for hospital beds over the winter periods.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System For You, recently published by this Government. This strategy outlines a programme of investment and reform of the health services starting immediately and continuing up to 2011. As part of the preparation work for the strategy my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners, conducted a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs. On foot of that review entitled Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &ndash; A National Review, which I published in early January the Government decided, in the context of the strategy, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. I announced on 16 January a &euro;65 million investment package in the current year for the commissioning of 709 of these 3,000 beds in acute hospitals and these will come on stream before the end of this year. I am confident that once these beds are put in place, there will be a visible improvement in accident and emergency services.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been an increasing concern that adequate out-of-hours general practitioner provision could not be found. In itself this perception has led to increasing attendance at accident and emergency departments. A new <Col N="1271" /> quality based approach founded on co-operation and partnership between health professionals seemed to be the answer.</P>
    <P>A major re-focus on primary care services marked by the introduction of new models of care involving core multi-disciplinary primary care teams, which will work with a wider network of health and social care professionals and which will offer 24 hour cover to patients. This will also help to reduce demand from and treat appropriately patients who would otherwise have to attend at an accident and emergency department. This sector will therefore take on a pivotal role in helping to reduce pressures in accident and emergency departments. A sum of &euro;17.29 million is being invested in the development of this service in 2002.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives have been identified in the health strategy which are designed to improve the operation of accident and emergency departments. These include: the establishment of 24-hour general practitioner co-operatives which will reduce demand from, and treat appropriately, patients who would otherwise attend at accident and emergency departments; the appointment of additional accident and emergency consultants, 12 additional consultants have been appointed over the past year and funding has been provided to recruit a further 17; the establishment of minor injury units to ensure appropriate treatment and management of non-urgent cases; the use of chest pain clinics, respiratory clinics and in-house specialist teams to fast-track patients as appropriate; the re-organisation of diagnostic services to ensure increased access to, and availability of, services at busy times in accident and emergency departments; the appointment of advanced nurse practitioners &ndash; emergency in acute hospitals; the use of admission protocols to ensure that emergency patients will be the only group of patients admitted to hospital through accident and emergency departments; the appointment of additional personnel to liaise with patients while they await diagnosis and treatment at accident and emergency departments; the introduction of information systems that record comprehensive, comparable and reliable data on activity in accident and emergency departments. Such information will provide staff with a valuable tool in structuring services to meet the needs of patients.</P>
    <P>When I approved the additional accident and emergency consultant posts, I requested Comhairle na nOspidéal to undertake a review of the structures, operation and staffing of accident and emergency departments. Comhairle na nOspidéal has undertaken a lengthy consultative process involving health boards and health professionals and their report, the publication of which I understand is imminent. This report not only deals with the staffing of accident and emergency departments at consultant level but links reform of accident and emergency departments with the need to look critically at hospital processes and patient flows through the hospitals. The report of Comh<Col N="1272" /> airle na nOspidéal will provide valuable advice on the structure of our emergency services and the necessary linkages which will be required to eliminate the delays in emergency departments.</P>
    <P>Many of the initiatives I have outlined will take time to come on stream and to impact positively on accident and emergency services. Therefore, on 13 February, I announced that I intended to establish an accident and emergency forum to identify steps that can be taken immediately to alleviate current problems in accident and emergency services. The forum, which is chaired by Dr. Danny O'Hare, former President of Dublin City University, is taking place today, Wednesday, 20 March.</P>
    <P>Participants include all relevant stakeholders: hospital management, members of the medical and nursing professions, para-medical and non-nursing personnel, staff representative associations and unions, patient advocacy groups and other interested parties. The work of the forum will help to build on the existing and proposed policy framework for accident and emergency services as set out in the national health strategy.</P>
    <P>The issue of violence against any health service worker is a very serious matter. In the year 2000, I asked the ERHA and each health board to review security arrangements in accident and emergency departments and to identify deficiencies. Arising from the review I allocated &euro;1.27 million in 2001 to the ERHA, health boards and directly funded voluntary hospitals to improve security arrangements in accident and emergency departments. This money was allocated to address issues such as additional security personnel, installation of CCTV and training of staff on how to manage or handle aggressive patients.</P>
    <P>I met the Health and Safety Authority in February 2001 and one of the issues for discussion was violence in the workplace. The authority informed me that it planned to step up the number of reviews of hospitals in relation to health and safety issues, of which work place violence is an important issue. I welcome this development and I have since written to the chief executive officers of the ERHA and the health boards informing them of the need to take all necessary measures to address risks to health service staff in this regard.</P>
    <P>In relation to the action being taken by nursing staff in accident and emergency departments following discussions held on 15 and 16 March and on 19 and 20 March, the Labour Relations Commission has put forward a series of proposals aimed at resolving the current dispute. Both sides are recommending acceptance of the proposals and these will be presented by the Nursing Alliance to its members tomorrow, 21 March. I hope the proposals will be accepted and the dispute, as a consequence, will be resolved speedily.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services in the Eastern Regional Health Authority (ERHA) is the responsibility of that authority in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1274" />Additional funding of &euro;2.971 million was provided to the ERHA in 2001 for orthodontic services of which &euro;2.044 million was for an orthodontic initiative in the authority. This has enabled the authority to recruit additional staff &ndash; including two consultant orthodontists &ndash; and develop new treatment facilities at Loughlinstown and at the Regional Orthodontic Unit located at St. James's Hospital. Furthermore, the Northern Area Health Board (NAHB) plan to develop a new orthodontic unit, comprising twelve chairs, on the grounds of James Connolly Memorial Hospital. In the interim, the board is exploring the possibility of establishing a temporary facility.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the ERHA has informed me that the current staff complement in the ERHA is three consultant orthodontists [2.6 whole-time equivalent (WTE)], eight WTE clinicians and four trainee specialists in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the authority has further informed me of the following working arrangements in the area health boards: </P>
    <P>There are 1.6 WTE consultant orthodontists, seven clinicians and two trainee specialists in orthodontics in the South-Western Area Health Board. Of these, one WTE clinician provides orthodontic services to the NAHB and 1.5 WTE clinician provides services to the East Coast Area Health Board (ECAHB). There is one consultant orthodontist, one clinician and two trainee specialists in orthodontics available exclusively to the ECAHB.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the ERHA has also informed me that under the initiative, the NAHB has engaged the services of specialist orthodontic practitioners from outside its own area. Under this arrangement, two consultant orthodontists and one clinician provide five sessions per week between them. To date, the board has been unsuccessful in recruiting a consultant orthodontist and there is no public orthodontist currently employed there.</P>
    <P>For 2002, my Department has provided additional funding of &euro;0.662 million to the ERHA for orthodontic services of which &euro;0.405 million was for an orthodontic training programme. Four dentists from the authority commenced their training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications last October. Furthermore, my Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Post Graduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the ERHA has informed me of the following information in respect of orthodontic waiting lists in the three area health boards as at the end of the December 2001 quarter:<Col N="1275" /></P>

    <P>Patients in category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. Patients in category B have less severe problems than category A patients and are placed on the orthodontic treatment waiting list.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the ERHA has also informed me that at the end of the same quarter, there were 3,776 patients in orthodontic <Col N="1276" /> treatment in the authority. This is an increase of 488 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the corresponding figure at the end of the September 2001 quarter. I expect the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures in the orthodontic initiative take effect.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 458, 461 and 476 together.</P>
      <P>On 21 November 2000 I announced my intention that the process of making all taxis wheelchair accessible will commence by end 2003 and I also indicated that I intended to consult extensively with representatives of consumer groups, of disabled persons and of taxi service providers and others to develop further quality improvements for taxi services for the benefit of both the service providers and the general public alike in the medium term.</P>
      <P>I have recently announced the publication of a consultation paper to elicit comments and submissions from interested parties by 30 April 2002 on a range of issues with a view to the future development of further qualitative improvements in taxi services. The consultation paper has been prepared against the background of the liberalised regime of taxi licensing, the provisions of the Disability Bill, 2001 and the already announced policy intentions on wheelchair accessibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions regarding taxi licensing have taken place between my Department and a range of taxi and other interests on a number of occasions since 21 November 2000 when the new regulatory regime was introduced. The consultation paper, with particular reference to the wheelchair accessible taxi policy, was one of the issues dis<Col N="1278" /> cussed at the most recent meetings between officials of my Department and taxi group representatives held in February of this year and it is open to the groups to present their views in relation to the issues addressed in that paper.</P>
    <P>It is intended to complete the consultative process, including subsequent assessment of submissions and the making of recommendations, by end 2002 to facilitate the commencement of appropriate regulatory reforms in 2003.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Wide-ranging measures are being pursued by my Department in its continuing implementation of Sustainable Development: A Strategy for Ireland, adopted by Government in 1997. The following paragraphs address the measures referred to in the question.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Measure 1</i>As part of my Department's comprehensive, catchment-based national strategy to tackle all sources of eutrophication, major catchment-based projects have been established in respect of Loughs Derg, Ree and Leane, Killarney, and the Rivers Suir, Boyne and Liffey to establish water quality monitoring and management systems.</P>
      <P>For purposes of implementing the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), my Department is now extending its successful catchment strategy against eutrophication by promoting the establishment by local authorities of river basin management projects to address water management in all inland and coastal waters, including groundwater, and all sources of water pollution. River basin management projects for the east, the south-east, the River Shannon and the west have been approved in principle. Financial support at a rate of 100% will be provided by DELG for expenditure incurred by local authorities in relation to these projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recently launched EPA's report on Water Quality in Ireland for the period 1998-2000, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library, shows that, for the first time since national surveys began in 1971, there has been a reversal in the downward trend in water quality with a reported increase in the length of unpolluted river channel, from 67% in 1995-97 period to 70% in 1998-2000 period. In addition, lake surface area classified as unpolluted has increased from 65% to 93% over the same period. The improvements in water quality are attributed by the report largely to the <Col N="1279" /> wide range of catchment-management measures applied, particularly in the large projects promoted by DELG, including investment in upgrade of sewage treatment works.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Measure 2</i>The EPA published, as part of its functions under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, a review of water quality management planning in the State in 1999, including recommendations for a framework for future planning. These recommendations are being elaborated in the context of the EU Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) and the requirement under the directive to prepare comprehensive river basin management plans.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Measure 3</i>All of the regulations made under the Waste Management Acts contribute directly or indirectly to the prevention or reduction of water pollution. The licensing system established under the Act in relation to waste disposal and recovery activities provides for systematic monitoring and regulation of such activities by the EPA and local authorities. Other regulations include: the Waste Management (Amendment of Waste Management Act, 1996) Regulations, 1998 &ndash; these regulations amend the scope of section 51(2) of the 1996 Act, concerning the recovery of sludge and agricultural waste; Waste Management (Use of Sewage Sludge in Agriculture) Regulations 1998) &ndash; these replace 1991 regulations made for the purpose of giving effect to Council Directive 86/278/EEC on the protection of the environment, and in particular of the soil, when sewage sludge is used in agriculture; proposals being developed in my Department for further regulations to promote and support the application of good agricultural practice.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Measure 4</i>New water quality standards have been prescribed by: the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977 (Water Quality Standards for Phosphorus) Regulations, 1998; Protection of Groundwater Regulations, 1999; and Water Quality (Dangerous Substances) Regulations, 2001.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Measure 5</i>The Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997 was enacted in 1997.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Measure 6</i>National estimates of pollutant loads to waters &ndash; nutrients and organic matter &ndash; were prepared in 2000 and included in the EPA Millennium Report a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library as part of EPA functions under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992. Levels of these pollutants in waters are continuously monitored by the local authorities, fishery agencies and the EPA and are documented in the <Col N="1280" /> three yearly national water quality reports published by the agency. A separate national survey of potentially toxic substances was carried out by the agency in 1999-2000 and the results were published in 2001. Currently, a national monitoring programme is being developed by the EPA to cover the substances dealt with in the Water Quality (Dangerous Substances) Regulations, 2001. The EPA is also required by these regulations to review certain licences to ensure compliance with prescribed standards for water quality.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Measure 7</i>As part of its functions under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, a national ground water monitoring programme was established by the EPA in 1995 with the assistance of the local authorities and the data arising have been included in the national water quality reports for 1995-97 and 1998-2000. As part of the national hydrometric programme, the recording of water levels in boreholes and wells also commenced in 1995 to monitor the quantitative aspects of ground water. Problems in groundwater, in respect particularly of quality issues, are discussed in the national reports and general recommendations made on the avoidance of such problems.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Measure 8</i>My Department, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands co-operated in the preparation and publication of the report and discussion document Coastal Zone Management &ndash; A Draft Policy for Ireland in 1997 a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library. This was followed by a public consultation conference in March 1998 and numerous individual measures advanced by these Departments which are influenced by, and will facilitate achievement of, the principles of integrated coastal zone management. In the case of my Department these include a major programme of investment in waste water treatment plants, especially in the larger, coastal urban centres such as Cork, Drogheda, Dublin, Dundalk, Limerick, Galway, Waterford; establishment of river basin management projects in relation to all inland and coastal waters; development and implementation of the Bantry Bay charter by Cork County Council in partnership with interested stakeholders; provision in the Planning and Development Act, 2000 for the making of local area plans in the context of development plans generally, the making of regional planning guidelines by regional authorities and obligations to obtain permission for development on the foreshore; provision for protection of the seashore in the context of development plans; definition of the maritime boundary of a local authority as the high water mark for the time being under the Local Government Act, 2001 provides that; provisions that bye-laws under the Local Government (Water Pollution) <Col N="1281" /> Acts, 1997 and 1990 can now relate to the foreshore.</P>
    <P>Policy on integrated coastal zone management will now be advanced in the context of a draft recommendation proposed by the European Commission and under consideration by the institutions of the European Community.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Measure 9</i>Expenditure on water services since the 1997 report, Sustainable Development &ndash; A Strategy for Ireland, totals &euro;1.7 billion. The national development plan provides for expenditure of almost &euro;4.4 billion over the period 2000-06 on water services infrastructure, the bulk of which will be incurred on the treatment of waste water. This is approximately three times the total comparable spend during the 1994-99 period. Exchequer expenditure in 2001 reached a record &euro;507 million.</P>
    <P>As mentioned under Measure 1, the most recent EPA report on Water Quality in Ireland 1998-2000 confirms an increase in the length of unpolluted river channel for the first time since national surveys commenced in the 1970s. The improvement is attributable to the wide range of catchment-management measures applied particularly in the large projects promoted by my Department including investment in upgrading sewage treatment works.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Measure 10</i>In 1996, the Department introduced the Water Conservation Sub-Programme. Its general objective is to reduce unaccounted for water, UFW, in distribution networks, thereby improving levels of supply to consumers, lowering operating costs and maximising the value of investment in capital works. Almost &euro;64 million was provided for the initial phase of the sub-programme.</P>
    <P>Most of the 15 schemes selected for the initial round of the sub-programme in locations such as Dublin, Cork, Galway, Wexford, Waterford, Limerick, Athlone and Clonmel, have completed the initial study phase and have begun physical work on substantial network rehabilitation. Significant reduction in leakage levels is already being achieved, particularly in the Dublin region, where, at the end of the active leakage repair contract in September 2000, unaccounted for water was reduced from 42.5% of supply to 28.7%.</P>
    <P>Following the completion of a national water study, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, a comprehensive national water conservation programme is being developed. This programme, with envisaged investment of almost &euro;370 million, will provide funding on a county-county borough basis for a range of water conservation projects including consultant studies, metering, mapping, pilot rehabilitation and repair, leak detection, substantial rehabilitation work and key technical assistance projects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1282" />
      <i>Measure 11</i>The Government's water services pricing policy provides <i>inter alia</i> for the collection of capital and operational costs from non-domestic customers in a structured and uniform manner and in accordance with the polluter pays principle, including the completion of the metering of all non-domestic water services customers by 2006. The existing legal provision which precludes the charging of households for water services for domestic purposes remains in place. It is expected that the implementation of water services pricing policy will lead to the more sustainable use of these services, including the promotion of effective water conservation policies through economies by industry and general non-domestic customers.</P>

      <P>The provision of fire cover is a statutory duty of the local fire authority, in this instance Wicklow County Council. It is a matter for the council in the first instance to consider the fire fighting provisions needed to enable it to meet its statutory responsibilities as set out in the Fire Services Act, 1981.</P>
      <P>I recently announced the publication of the Farrell Grant Sparks report on the review of fire safety and fire services in Ireland, which sets out a comprehensive set of recommendations for the future development of the service. The report recommends that the existing statutory role of local fire authorities should be extended and strengthened. It also recommends the introduction of a risk based approach to standards of fire cover and I concur with this recommendation. It indicates that this new approach will guide the determination of stations which will need to convert to full-time operations, while acknowledging that cover provided by existing stations in particular areas will only need to change in a relatively small number of cases.</P>

      <P>The Waste Management (Environmental Levy) (Plastic Bag) Regulations, 2001 designate the Revenue Com<Col N="1284" /> missioners as the responsible authority for enforcing the collection of the plastic shopping bag levy. In addition, the regulations impose a supplementary requirement on retailers to pass on the full amount of the levy to customers, and this regulatory provision is being enforced by local authorities. The relevant enforcement officers have extensive powers to enter any retail premises, to conduct any searches or investigations considered necessary, and to inspect or remove any records, books and documents for the purposes of any proceedings in relation to the levy.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners and the local authorities have the necessary powers &ndash; equivalent to those available in respect of the implementation and enforcement of relevant taxation and other waste management measures &ndash; to ensure that the levy can be successfully applied and that any efforts to evade liability can be detected.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the levy has been very successful and my Department has had very few complaints about non-compliance. However, I recognise the need to ensure that the efforts and commitment of the vast majority of retailers are not undermined by the non-compliance of a few. My Department wrote to local authorities in January in regard to the regulations and also met representatives of all local authorities to discuss enforcement and other aspects of the levy, prior to its introduction. A further detailed circular on enforcement was issued to local authorities this week asking them to pay particular attention to the identification and follow up of any non-compliance with the law.</P>

      <P>The Government has implemented a major programme to renew the local government system since coming into office. The aim of this programme has been to promote local government which is democratically based, strong and engaged, properly financed and working in partnership with the community it serves. Substantial progress under the programme includes: constitutional recognition of local government; increased finance for local authorities by way of a statutorily based local government fund, backed up by a new and comprehensive financial management system; introduction of a wide range of customer service initiatives in local authorities, including one stop shops and customer action plans; significant new initiatives in human resource management; introduction of a representational payment and provision of a policy focused training and education programme for councillors; broadening local government's social inclusion role, including the establishment of pilot social inclusion units; setting up new local governance structures in the shape of county-city development boards and strategic policy committees. The whole programme has been underpinned by a modern legislative framework by way of the Local Government Act, 2001.</P>
      <P>The strategic policy committees, SPCs, and county-city development boards, CDBs, have facilitated the wider community including sectoral interests, to have a substantial role in local government. The SPCs introduce the partnership model to local government, where the social partners, including the community and voluntary sector, and sectoral interests sit alongside councillors to formulate, monitor and review local government policy.</P>

      <Col N="1287" />County-city development boards, led by local government and also representative of local development bodies, State agencies operating locally and the social partners, including the community and voluntary sector, have been established in all cities and counties. The boards aim to bring about a more integrated approach to local government and local development and a more coherent delivery of services at local level. They are currently publishing their county-city strategies for economic, social and cultural development, which will be implemented by their member bodies. Community and voluntary fora have been established and resourced as part of the CDB process to support strong input to the work of the boards. The fora also have a consultative role in relation to public agencies, including local authorities, operating at local level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 474 and 475 together.</P>
      <P>The issue of compliance with EN 1317 has been the subject of discussions between the National Roads Authority (NRA), my Department and the European Commission.</P>
      <P>Arising from these discussions, the NRA has made arrangements to bring future procurement of road safety barriers into line with EN 1317. The NRA's design standard, NRA TD 19/01 safety barriers, and specification, series 400 &ndash; safety barriers and pedestrian guard-rails, are now being amended accordingly.</P>
      <P>The NRA has confirmed that all future public tendering documentation will refer exclusively to ISEN 1317, the Irish national standard implementing European standard EN 1317, with regard to the procurement of road safety barriers. Only road barrier systems that have been successfully tested in accordance with Parts 1 and 2 of that standard, or an equivalent standard, will be permitted on future public contracts.</P>
      <P>The present standard applied by the NRA for the use of safety barriers, NRA TD 19/01, was published in June 2001 following an assessment of requirements for containment barriers. This requires that high containment (H2) barriers are provided at central reserves up to 7.5 m wide and that normal containment (N2) barriers are provided at central reserves between 7.5 m and 15 m in width. Barriers are not required on central reserves in excess of 15 m. Normal containment barriers are provided at other specific locations as required, for example outside verges. This element of NRA TD 19/01 will be unaffected by the changes proposed to the NRA's design standard and specification referred to above.</P>

      <P>Under the Road Traffic Act, 1961 and the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1999 to 2001, it is a matter for the appropriate licensing authority, in this case Kerry County Council, to determine the eligibility of a person for a provisional driving licence, and to issue licences. I am not empowered to exempt individual persons from the regulatory provisions.</P>
      <P>Where the validity of a provisional licence has lapsed, the licence may be renewed within a five year period without the applicant having to pass the driver theory test and submit a theory test certificate to the licensing authority. Where the elapsed period is greater than five years, an applicant for a category A or other provisional licence must first pass the driver theory test. Upon obtaining a provisional licence, the licence holder may ride a motorcycle subject to the limitation of engine size covered by the licence and may not carry a passenger.</P>

A scheme for Spanish Point was not among the proposals listed by the council. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002, announced in July 2000. Given this position regarding the prioritisation of both schemes, the level of competing demand and the limited funding available, it has not been possible to include either scheme in the programme.</P>

The effective maximum grant available under the scheme has doubled from &euro;10,158 to &euro;20,320. I have also increased the recoupment rate to local authorities in respect of grants paid under the scheme. In November 1998, local authorities were recouped 50% of grants paid. Now they are recouped two-thirds of the amount of grants paid.</P>
      <P>In line with a significant increase in the Department's provision for the disabled persons grant scheme, the recoupment to Clare County Council has also increased substantially. In 1998 Clare County Council was recouped &euro;108,599 in respect of 32 disabled persons grants.

      <P>I issued approval in principle in July 2000 to Cavan County Council's proposal for the provision of a new fire station at Virginia. The further advancement of this project is under consideration in my Department in the context of the council's overall fire stations building programme. In this connection, during my term of office I have approved the following Cavan County Council projects: a new two bay fire station which was completed at Bailieborough in 2001; a further new station which is currently under construction at Dowra; and a proposed new fire station at Cootehill currently proceeding to tender stage.</P>
      <P>All these stations are being grant-aided in full by my Department.</P>

      <P>I established the renewable energy strategy group in November 1999 to consider the obstacles that could impede the further development of our wind energy resources.</P>
      <P>In its report, Strategy for Intensifying Wind Energy Deployment, the strategy group recommended, among other things, that a small-scale wind energy category should continue to be supported under my Department's alternative energy requirement programme. This is the typical project promoted by Meitheal na Gaoithe.</P>
      <P>In AER V, I reduced the upper project size for the small-scale wind energy category from five megawatts to three megawatts and I prohibited anybody with an interest in larger scale projects from availing of the higher prices offered in the small scale category. This has allowed bona fide small scale developers to enter the competition with a reasonable expectation of success.</P>
      <P>I announced the results of AER V in February of this year. I am delighted to say that some 19 projects were successful in the small sale wind energy category. This represents a total installed capacity of some 36 megawatts with projects ranging in size from 0.65 MW to 3 MW installed capacity. The successful applicants, including local companies, community groups, farmers, and individuals, have been informed that their projects have been selected to receive a conditional offer of a contract to supply green electricity to the ESB.</P>
      <P>I have already announced my intention to move to the next support measure for renewables, AER VI, in the coming months. I will consult with the various industry representative associations with regard to the terms and conditions of this scheme, including continued support for a small-scale wind energy category in the competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The market mechanism applied &ndash; competitive tendering &ndash; is essential to comply with the European Commission's clearance of the power purchase agreements which it has determined constitute state aid. Grid connections are a matter for the ESB or Éirgrid in the first instance. In the event of any dispute the Electricity Regulation Act (No. 23 of 1999) allows for appeals to the Commission for Electricity Regulation and its <Col N="1297" /> decision is binding on the supplier &ndash; section 34 of the Act. I have no statutory function in the matter.</P>

      <P>The purchase of this housing development as a turnkey project has been approved by my Department. It was originally envisaged that Donegal County Council should be responsible for the purchase and management of this development. Following discussions it has now however been agreed that this development should be managed by Letterkenny Town Council with the pre-acquisition process continuing to be dealt with by the County Council.</P>
      <P>Donegal County Council itself is acquiring three separate adjacent turnkey developments totalling 160 houses. At my Department's request, the council intends to provide 20 units for sale under the affordable housing scheme and to let the remainder as rental units to households on the waiting list. The highest level of social housing need in Donegal exists in the Letterkenny area.</P>

      <P>The scheme was twenty first on the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by Donegal County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002, announced in July 2000. Given the priority afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand, and the funding available, it has not been possible to include it in the programme.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the recent report &ndash; Paying for Road Use &ndash; by the <Col N="1300" /> UK Commission for Integrated Transport. Its contents will be of interest to relevant Irish Government Departments and transport authorities in the context of designing longer term policies for transport management.</P>
      <P>The mechanism of distance charging outlined in the Commission's report is described as requiring a long lead in time and as depending on the prior delivery of significant public transport improvements and the roll out of dependable new technology on the scale required.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, the UK Commission's proposals do not appear to offer an early viable alternative to existing or currently planned road tolling in Ireland and no case to this effect has been made to my Department by the National Roads Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 503 and 504 together.</P>
      <P>The EU Directive on End-of-Life Vehicles (2000/53/EC) requires member states to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the directive by 21 April 2002. Apart from legal transposition, the directive provides certain discretion to member states as to when various provisions must be implemented. My Department is progressing work with a view to early transposition and implementation. However, full transposition also depends on a number of issues being finalised by the European Commission. There is no likelihood, therefore, of Ireland being subject to fines for non-implementation in the near future.</P>
      <P>As part of the progress towards transposition and implementation of the Directive, my Department has been actively engaged with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry (SIMI), the Irish Motor Vehicle Recyclers Association (IMVRA), the Metal Merchants Association of Ireland (MMAI) and other concerned parties with a view to developing a producer responsibility initiative which would implement a number of the directive's provisions.</P>
      <P>These stakeholder bodies submitted an agreed initial proposal for an end-of-life vehicle (ELV) management scheme towards the end of last year. This replaces earlier proposals by SIMI alone. Consultants have been engaged by the stakeholders to assist in the development of a finalised proposal. It is my intention to secure early agreement on a detailed management scheme with the support of all stakeholders as soon as possible. Once operational, it is envisaged the directive will facilitate the development of a modern, efficient and sustainable vehicle dismantling, treatment and shredding sector.</P>
      <P>Difficulties now being experienced by the ferrous metal recycling or vehicle shredding industry have resulted in part from revisions to the European Waste Catalogue which came into force on 1 January 2002. These re-classified non de-polluted end-of-life vehicles and waste containing dangerous substances generated by the recovery of metals from vehicles &ndash; auto shredder residue (ASR) &ndash; as hazardous waste. The increasing cost of landfill has also impacted on the sector. I will consider, with EPA, the scope for appropriate action to ensure safe disposal of ASR in landfills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to with the principle of producer responsibility, it is not proposed to provide a subsidy from public funds for the ongoing costs of recycling operations. Producer responsibility <Col N="1302" /> initiatives already operate in Ireland, in the areas of packaging waste and farm plastics waste, where producers are required to take steps to recover waste or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in compliance schemes set up to recover the waste in question. These schemes in turn provide subsidies for the collection and recovery of materials for recycling, which provide economic support for the recycling sector.</P>
    <P>The proposed producer responsibility scheme to manage end-of-life vehicles will, in turn, improve the viability of the dismantling and metal recycling sector.</P>
    <P>The new scheme of capital grants for waste recovery infrastructure, including recycling infrastructure, amounting to &euro;127 million in the period to 2006 and proceeds from the Environment Fund, which will be funded by the recently introduced levy on plastic shopping bags and the new levy on landfilling, will provide another source of potential future support for recycling. In addition, in recognition of the positive environmental contribution of the recycling sector, the Waste Management (Landfill Levy) Regulations 2002 provide that the residue from certain reprocessing activities &ndash; including non-metallic ASR &ndash; will be exempted from the &euro;15 per tonne levy which will apply on the disposal of waste at landfill with effect from 1 June 2002.</P>

      <P>The telephone allowance covers the normal line and instrument rental charges associated with a standard telephone and a limited allowance for calls. The VAT element of the allowance is also covered. At present there are approximately 248,000 allowances in payment. Installation fees are not covered by the allowance.</P>
      <P>Obviously, there would be concerns if people are not availing of the scheme because they cannot afford the installation charges. In this regard, in view of the extra business which the scheme can generate for the service provider I think it is reasonable, as suggested in the review of the free schemes published in 2000, that they should play a role in assisting those eligible to have telephones installed.</P>
      <P>In the past reduced installation fees have been offered to social welfare pensioners. While the granting of concessions on installation fees is, of course, a matter for the provider, my Department will continue to encourage them in the context of negotiations and discussions on the operation of the scheme to offer such concessions.</P>

      <P>Since April, 2001, for contributions averages below 20, the personal rates of pension and the rates of qualified adult allowance, QAA, bear a similar relationship to the maximum rates, that is, 75% of the maximum in each case for averages between 15 and 19 and 50% for averages between ten and 14. Prior to 6 April 2001 the same rate of QAA applied regardless of whether the pensioner was on full rate, 75% rate or 50% personal rate. This created anomalies, particularly in the context of the significant increases in QAA rates which have been <Col N="1307" /> provided for over recent years and which could otherwise give rise to rates of QAA in excess of the personal rates. The additional increases in QAA rates were provided as part of a process of increasing the rate of QAA for persons over 66 to the same level as the personal rate of old age (non-contributory) pension.</P>
      <P>The measures introduced in the Social Welfare Act, 2001 standardised the treatment of QAAs so that they compared to the personal rate that is being paid. However, in applying the new arrangements existing pensioners with reduced yearly averages retained their existing levels of QAA and, where the qualified adult was over age 66, they also received an increase of &euro;10.15, £8.00. In the case of the person concerned, who is in receipt of a pro-rata old age contributory pension based on a yearly average of 17 contributions and whose qualified adult dependant is over 66, this brought his QAA rate to &euro;92.20, £72.60. From January 2002 his QAA rate has increased to &euro;98.50, £77.58. His total current weekly entitlement is &euro;209, £164.60, comprising a personal rate of &euro;110.50, £140.30, and QAA of &euro;98.50, £77.60.</P>
      <P>The various measures referred to formed part of the annual budget provisions for social welfare payments which were publicised and enacted in the normal way.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supplementary welfare allowance is subject to a means test. Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances, less &euro;7.62. This &euro;7.62 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Many recipients pay more than &euro;7.62 towards their rent because applicants are required to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appro<Col N="1308" /> priate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their rent.</P>
    <P>Supplementary welfare allowance is not normally payable to people in full time employment. However, special arrangements have been in place for a number of years now which allow people on approved schemes such as community employment to retain part of their rent or mortgage interest supplement, subject to a gross household income limit of &euro;317.43 per week and certain other conditions. Following discussions with the social partners under Partnership 2000 substantial improvements in the conditions relating to the retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements were introduced from 6 April 2000.</P>
    <P>The &euro;317.43 per month limit on the amount of rent supplement payable was abolished and the sharp withdrawal of support at the end of the third year was removed, the supplement now being withdrawn on a tapered basis over a four year period i.e. 75% in year one, 50% in year two and 25% in year three and 25% in year four. As a result, many participants in community employment schemes now retain a greater amount of rent supplement than they would have done under the earlier arrangements. This is particularly the case for families.</P>
    <P>In no circumstances do the new rules result in a lower rate of rent supplement than is payable under the standard rules of supplementary welfare allowance. In addition, from 1 January 2002, I included participants on community employment schemes as qualifying for the part-time workers disregard for the purposes of rent supplement. This means that community employment participants in receipt of a rent supplement can now retain the first &euro;50 of any additional income without affecting their rent supplement. This disregard was increased from &euro;31.74 to &euro;50 in the recent budget.</P>
    <P>Up to January 2002 individuals were no worse off, in relation to rent supplement, by participating in a community employment scheme. These participants will now be better off because of the &euro;50 disregard.</P>

      <Quest>if he will amend the qualifying criteria for an old age contributory pension to allow people who commenced paying social insurance contributions, at full or modified rate, before reaching age 56, regardless of where they made their contributions; if he will allow for those who have ten years Irish contributions and commenced paying social insurance contributions before reaching age 56 in the UK; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have entered insurance ten years before pension age, achieved a minimum number of paid contributions, at the appropriate rate, and a yearly average of at least ten contributions, paid or credited over their <Col N="1309" /> working lives for a minimum pension, with an average of 48 contributions required for a full rate pension. Contributions made at modified rates do not provide cover for old age contributory pension.</P>
      <P>There is already provision within the system to cater for people with contributions from other countries. This pension is based on a combination of full-rate Irish social insurance contributions and reckonable social insurance in other EU countries or countries with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement.</P>
      <P>The pension is a pro-rata payment based on the proportion of Irish social insurance contributions to the total number of contributions paid and credited i.e. Irish and other insurance combined.</P>
      <P>In general I consider that the position of people with social insurance contributions from the UK, other EU countries and countries with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement is already well catered for within the pension system. In the circumstances, there are no plans for changes at this point in time though the position will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the various health boards, payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>There are currently 46,633 rent supplements and 4,169 mortgage interest supplements in payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1310" />Details of the number of recipients of rent or mortgage interest supplements over the past five years and the associated expenditure are set out in the following tabular statement.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on rent supplements has risen by almost 88% over the past five years. The continuing increase in expenditure in this area is due for the most part to sharp increases in the cost of private rented accommodation as the number of recipients was reasonably stable over the period. However, in the last quarter of 2001 and indeed since the beginning of 2002 there has been a significant increase in the number of claims in payment.</P>
    <P>The total number of recipients grew by 3,257 or 7.6% in the six months to the end of February 2002.</P>
    <P>In contrast, both the number of recipients and the expenditure relating to mortgage interest supplements have fallen by approximately 50% over the last five years. The two main factors for the reductions are the number of people who have returned to work and the fall in interest rates during the period in question. However, there has been a significant increase recently in the number of mortgage interest supplement claims in payment to people who hold mortgages other than local authority mortgages. There was an 11% increase in the number of such recipients in the six months to the end of February 2002.</P>

      <P>The income adequacy target included in the revised National Anti-Poverty Strategy is &ldquo;to achieve a rate of &euro;150 per week in 2002 terms for the lowest rates of social welfare to be met by 2007 and the appropriate equivalence level of basic child income support (i.e. child benefit and child dependant allowances combined) to be set at 33%-35% of the minimum adult social welfare payment rate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the cost, in 2002 terms, of implementing this target is of the order of &euro;1.55 billion in respect of weekly welfare rates. This calculation is based on an assumption that the lowest rates of payment are increased to &euro;150 with equivalent monetary increases for all other schemes.</P>
      <P>In addition, it is estimated that the additional costs in terms of child income support would lie between &euro;407 million and &euro;1.24 billion, depending on how that is delivered, for example, through child dependant allowances alone, through child benefit alone or a combination of both.</P>

      <P>The earlier parliamentary question to which the Deputy refers &ndash; Question No. 206 answered on 30 May 2001 &ndash; related to the composition of the Department's transfer lists for Sligo. At that time there were about 170 people on the clerical officer transfer list for that location.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to note that revised central arrangements for filling of clerical officer vacancies in large provincial centres, including Sligo, which were introduced in late 2001, provide that appointments to these posts will be made both from the relevant transfer list and by direct recruitment from competitions conducted by the Civil Service Commission.</P>
      <P>The ratio of appointments from each source is 50:50 over a period of a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some 135 names on the Department's clerical officer transfer list for Sligo but there are no vacancies to be filled in the Sligo offices at present. The applicants are from a number of different Departments and offices and many are required to serve in the location for which they were recruited for a minimum period <Col N="1312" /> of one year before being released for transfer to another location.</P>
    <P>The placing of individual applicants on the Department's transfer lists is not affected in any way by competitions conducted by the Civil Service Commission.</P>

      <P>The back to education allowance scheme is a non statutory scheme. Therefore, decisions made on applications under the scheme cannot be appealed to the appeals office. However, if a person is dissatisfied with the result of his or her application he or she can request a review. The review is carried out, within back to education schemes, by an officer of a higher grade than the one who made the original decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, back to education schemes do not have any requests for review on hand. A total of 490 applications for participation in the back to education allowance scheme were refused for the 2001-02 academic year. To date, a total of 158 requests for review have been received of which 63 have had a successful outcome. The average <Col N="1313" /> length of time in processing requests for a review is one week to ten days.</P>

      <P>The back to work allowance scheme was introduced in 1993 to encourage the long-term unemployed and other social welfare recipients to take up employment opportunities. Participants in the scheme retain a reducing proportion rate of their social welfare payment over three years if taking up work as an employee or four years if taking up self employment.</P>
      <P>As the scheme is non statutory it does not come under the aegis of the formal appeal system. However if a person is dissatisfied with the outcome of an application he or she may request an internal review of the decision.</P>
      <P>At present there are six cases awaiting review. There are no national statistics available on the number of cases disallowed in the past 12 months. A request for a review of the outcome of a back to work claim is normally processed within a six week period. During the year 2001 there were 136 requests for reviews. Of these 26 cases were subsequently allowed.</P>

      <P>The numbers sought in the question, in so far as details are available, are set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>The average time taken to process all appeals finalised during 2001 was just under 23 weeks. This average period includes all phases of appeals from the date of the initial notice of appeal to the date when it is finally closed in the records of the appeals office. It would include additional investigations, second medical assessor examinations, where needed, and adjournments sought to enable additional evidence to be submitted. If allowance is made for the 25% of the most protracted appeals the average time is about 15 weeks. Average times for individual types of appeals are not readily available.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of carer's allowance at the maximum weekly rate of &euro;22.40 and a child dependant rate of &euro;8.60. She applied for a further increase in her carer's allowance in respect of an additional care recipient.</P>
      <P>This application was refused as the full-time care and attention condition was not satisfied. She subsequently appealed this decision and submitted further medical evidence in support of her appeal. The appeals officer, following an oral appeal hearing, upheld the original decision to refuse carer's allowance. Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a number of long-term funding programmes, the purpose of which is to provide core funding for groups involved in anti-poverty and social inclusion initiatives in their communities. The funding provided for the community development support programmes in 2002 amounts to &euro;27.65 million and represents an increase of &euro;4.67 million on funding made available to the programmes in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, core funding provided under my Department's community development support programmes provides for the employment of a maximum of two full-time staff equivalent together with the administration and general operating costs of the project. In the 1998 budget, <Col N="1317" /> an allocation of £300,000 was made available for projects funded under the community development programme specifically to apply for additional time limited funding for work, usually to cover the employment costs of a worker, necessary to the effectiveness of the programme but not otherwise resourced at that time. This enhanced funding scheme operated from 1998 to 2000, inclusive, during which time a total of &euro;4.475 million, including commitments for 2001-02 has been committed to projects. All funding previously committed under this scheme has been met.</P>
    <P>No new applications for funding or applications for continued funding of existing posts were invited in 2001 pending a review of the scheme. This review has been completed and is currently under consideration by my Department. While a decision regarding the future operation of the scheme has yet to be determined, I would emphasise that all existing funding commitments will be honoured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for old age contributory and retirement pensions a person must, among other conditions, have paid social insurance at an appropriate rate. Social insurance at the modified rate paid by many public servants does not provide cover for these pensions.</P>
      <P>Historically, most public servants were excluded from full social insurance cover because it was considered that they had provision within the terms and conditions of their public sector employment for adequate cover for contingencies such as sickness or old age and that the risk of unemployment was not a factor in their case. Full PRSI coverage was extended to new entrants to the public service in 1995 with consequent changes in the occupational pension arrangements. All other public servants continue to pay the modified rate of social insurance which does not give coverage for old age contributory or retirement pensions.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to say how many people who paid modified rate insurance are refused pension each year. However, it is thought that the number refused is small as, generally speaking, the people concerned do not submit applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall there are approximately 152,000 people insured in classes B, C and D, which are the main modified rates applying to public ser<Col N="1318" /> vants. Information on the ages of existing public service pensioners or their current status <i>vis-à-vis</i> the social welfare pension system is not readily available and, in the circumstances, it is not possible to provide an estimate for providing them with contributory pensions. As already indicated, it is considered that the pension needs of this group are already adequately catered for through their occupational pension arrangements and there are no plans to provide them with social welfare old age contributory pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the ancillary benefits which are targeted at people on long-term social welfare payments in general, and not those which are available only to certain categories of long-term clients, for example, pensioners. The ancillary benefits in question are fuel allowance, Christmas bonus and extended payment of child dependant allowance.</P>
      <P>The national fuel scheme provides for the payment of fuel allowances, subject to a means test, to people on long-term social welfare or health board payments who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A standard allowance of &euro;9 per week is currently paid to eligible households during the fuel season, which runs for 29 weeks from early October to late April. A smokeless fuel allowance of &euro;3.90 per week is paid in smokeless zones. This latter allowance is also available to some people on short-term payments.</P>
      <P>Christmas bonus payments are provided by my Department to people in receipt of certain long-term social welfare payments to alleviate hardship due to the additional demands on people's resources at Christmas time. The Christmas bonus has been paid at a rate equivalent to 70% of a person's normal weekly payment, subject to a minimum payment of &euro;25.39 since 1989. In 2000, the bonus was increased to 100% or double the person's normal weekly payment, again subject to a minimum payment of &euro;25.39, and was paid on a similar basis in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to child dependant allowances, the position is that where a parent is receiving a pension or other long-term payment from my Department, CDAs are payable up to the age of 22 years or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday, where the young person remains in full-time education. At present these arrangements do not apply to short-term payments such as disability benefit or unemployment benefit. In the case of short-term payments, <Col N="1319" /> CDAs are currently lost as soon as the young person reaches their 18th birthday. As a first step towards increasing the age limit to 22, as promised in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, with effect from April, child dependant allowances are being extended until the end of the academic year in which the young person reaches 18 years.</P>
    <P>It would cost in the region of &euro;8.2 million in a full year to extend the above supports to those receiving short-term payments for 12 months or more. This includes the cost of raising the CDA age limit to 22 years for recipients who have children over 18 years in full-time education which is estimated at under &euro;0.9 million.</P>

      <P>Self-employed persons pay PRSI contributions at class S which gives cover for old age contributory pension, widow's or widower's contributory pension, maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, orphan's contributory allowance and bereavement grant.</P>
      <P>The degree of cover available to class S contributors is reflected in the rate of contribution payable. Class S contributors pay social insurance contributions at a rate of either 3% or 5%, depending on earnings, whereas the combined employee and employer rate applicable to class A contributors varies as between 8.5%, 14.75% and 16.75%, depending on earnings.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for carer's allowance on 5 December 2001 in respect of both her parents. The principal conditions for receipt of the allowance are that full-time care and attention is required and being provided and that the means test which applies is satisfied.</P>
      <P>Full-time care and attention for the purposes of carer's allowance means that the care recipient is so disabled as to require continuous supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with their normal personal needs. In addition, the care recipient must be so disabled as to be likely to require full-time care and attention for at least 12 months.</P>
      <P>Having examined all the medical evidence supplied, the Department's chief medical adviser expressed the opinion that the care recipients are not so disabled as to require full-time care and attention. The application was refused on that basis.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was notified of this decision and of her right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. Her case has now been forwarded to the appeals office for determination, which will be in contact with the person concerned regarding the outcome of her appeal.</P>

      <P>The sharing of databases of personal information between public services agencies can be done only in accordance with legislative provisions and restrictions. At present there is no legal provision under which bulk data of the kind referred to could be transferred by my <Col N="1321" /> Department to the local authorities in the manner envisaged by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In addition to the question of legislation, there are significant technical issues which would need to be overcome to develop the computer systems and procedures to facilitate such bulk sharing and matching of data in a secure manner.</P>
      <P>As I have stated before, I am committed to the ongoing improvement of State services through greater streamlining and integration of processes across the public sector. To this end I have established, with Government approval, the REACH agency to develop the legal, technical and business frameworks to enable the development of such integrated services. Central to this integration is the establishment of the personal public service number as the common public service identifier for all public bodies and the establishment of a public services broker to provide the technology and business platform on which Departments and agencies will integrate their services.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress is being made in promoting the wider use of the PPS number to facilitate the streamlining of service delivery and in evolving service delivery strategies. The REACH agency is also at an advanced stage in the specification and procurement of the public services broker. The issue of further data transfer between public service agencies will be considered in the context of the development of the broker services.</P>
      <P>Any sharing of data between Departments and agencies for the purposes of providing integrated services must be done with full regard to the privacy and security of personal data held on behalf of citizens.</P>

      <P>The reform of legislation pertaining to civil registration is an integral part of the modernisation programme for the civil registration service. The purpose of the provisions, in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2002, is to facilitate the electronic registration of births and deaths and the electronic issue of certificates.</P>
      <P>All submissions received, including that of the Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations, have been considered in framing the legislation. With regard to item 4, Part 5 of the Schedule of the above mentioned Bill it should be noted that the Bill provides for the computerisation of the records and indexes dating back to 1845 for marriages and 1864 for births and deaths. When completed this system will remove the access restrictions which currently apply to paper based records thereby allowing simultaneous access by a number of parties to registration data and will also ensure that an accurate and up to date index of life events is available. The new electronic database of life events will provide a level of service which would not be possible in a paper based system.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other recommendations put forward in relation to item 8 of Part 5 of the Schedule to the Bill these will be considered in the context of the Report Stage of the Bill.</P>

    <P>The 2001 closing date for receipt of applications was set at 27 April 2001. However, it was acknowledged that following the outbreak of the foot and mouth disease, many voluntary groups experienced difficulty in submitting their completed application forms prior to the 27 April closing date. As a result, the closing date for receipt of applications for the scheme was extended to 31 May 2001.</P>
    <P>The 2002 scheme of grants will be advertised extensively in the national and provincial newspapers in the near future. While a closing date for receipt of applications is applied each year, the regional offices of my Department are flexible in accepting late applications, their prime concern being the safety and security of vulnerable older people in the community.</P>

      <P>There is provision within the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to provide assistance to people with once off exceptional needs and also with ongoing needs which, given the circumstances of the case, the person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their normal weekly income. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the various health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>

    <P>Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment. Payments are &ldquo;once-off&rdquo; and made at the discretion of the health board.

    <P>Funding is not available under the scheme for emergency lighting units as indicated in the Deputy's questions. My Department's scheme is specifically designed to provide funding to improve the security and social support of older people as detailed above. The supply of electricity is the responsibility of the Department of Public Enterprise which formulates high-level policy for the energy sector. I will ask my officials, however, to draw the attention of that Department to the <Col N="1328" /> specific problems the Deputy has raised in relation to electricity supply in north Mayo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 554 and 555 together.</P>
      <P>In 1992, a contract was agreed between the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and the company referred to by the Deputy to provide a passenger and cargo ferry service between Galway and the Aran Islands for the five year period from 1 September 1992 to 31 August 1997. The initial annual cost to the Exchequer of this contract was &euro;603,000. However, this was later increased to &euro;698,000 with effect from 19 April 1994 in order to take account of inflation, extra operational costs and the cost of essential equipment required for the service. Included in the aforementioned contract, which was inherited by my Department in 1997, was a clause allowing for its possible extension for a further five year period after 31 August 1997 provided that agreement on this could be reached between the parties to the contract. In this context, officials of my Department, in 1997, entered into negotiations with the company concerned with a view to extending the contract for a further five years. During the course of these negotiations, however, it became clear to my officials that the cost to the Exchequer of an extended contract could be reduced if the extension was to cover a period greater than five years. As a result of this, a seven year extension of the contract was agreed at the considerably reduced annual cost of &euro;603,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the process of renewal of this contract, my Department sought and received the advice of the Chief State Solicitor on the legality of the proposed amendments to same and on any legal requirements there may have been to seek public tenders for the provision of the service. A copy of the draft contract was also sent to the Chief <Col N="1329" /> State Solicitor for approval prior to its implementation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1992, a contract was agreed between the Minister for Tourism, Transport, and Communications and a shipping company to provide a passenger and cargo ferry service between Galway and the Aran Islands for the five year period from 1 September 1992 to 31 August 1997. A total of ten tenders was received for the provision of this service. The consultants, Ashford Marine Limited were employed to generate interest in the tender as well as to advise the Department in the evaluation of tenders for the service.</P>
      <P>The initial annual cost to the Exchequer of this contract was &euro;603,000, £475,000. However, this was later increased to &euro;698,000, £550,000, with effect from 19 April 1994 in order to take account of inflation, extra operational costs and the cost of essential equipment required for the service. A once-off capital payment of &euro;127,000, £100,000, was also made to the company in 1994 as a contribution towards the cost of additional operational equipment required for the service, extra sailings provided under the contract, the disruption caused by pier improvement works on the islands and extra initial requirements on the vessel used to provide the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the granting of this additional funding, the company had indicated to the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications that, in the absence of a cash injection from the Department, they would be obliged to terminate the ser<Col N="1331" /> vice within two to three weeks. It was felt by the Department at the time, based on their experience, that if this were allowed to happen it would not be possible to have a replacement service in place for at least four to five months. This, the Department considered, would be unacceptable and would, in effect, devastate the local economy and, in particular, tourism on the islands at enormous cost to the islanders themselves and ultimately to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it was evident that the residents of the three islands would expect any replacement service to be at least comparable to the service being provided at the time by the company concerned. In the circumstances, the Department was satisfied that it would not be possible to provide a comparable service at a lower cost than the company's revised proposal and that the option of terminating that service and inviting tenders for a new one was not, therefore, a realistic one.</P>

      <P>Amendments may be made to the boundaries of cSACs for a variety of reasons, some resulting in the inclusion of extra lands and others involving the removal of land from the designated area. Where it is established that an area does not meet the scientific criteria for designation boundaries are amended to exclude that area. Such situations arise where a landowner or land-user disagrees with the boundaries of a particular site, they can appeal informally to Dúchas, or, in the event that the informal appeal is not resolved to the satisfaction of the appellant, to the independent appeals advisory committee, which I have established under the chairmanship of Mr. Michael Mills. Boundaries changes may be recommended as a result; or where Dúchas make recommendations for amendment to existing cSACs on foot of additional survey work carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" />In the case referred to by the Deputy, Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, was asked by the quarry operator, in the context of an informal appeal, to examine the case for removing the quarry site and its immediate environs from the cSAC. Following investigation, staff concluded that the inclusion of the quarry in cSAC Connemara Bog Complex was not sustainable, as the lands contained in the quarry had already been degraded and do not meet the criteria for inclusion in a cSAC. However, the activity at the quarry may potentially have an impact on the neighbouring cSAC and accordingly Dúchas is liasing with the quarry operator to ensure that mitigation measures are put in place to ensure that activities at the quarry have no adverse effect on that cSAC in the future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 570 and 571 together.</P>
      <P>The deadline for receipt of applications for ACCESS funding was 31 October 2000 and the independent advisory committee, established by me to consider eligible applications, sat on 14 and 15 March 2001 and 3, 4, 10 and 27 April 2001. The committee completed its work on 27 April 2001. I understand that the confirmation of a local contribution for the Cill Rialaig project was received in my Department on 11 May 2001 and could not, therefore, be factored into the committee's deliberations.</P>

      <P>An application was submitted by the Garage Theatre in Monaghan for ACCESS funding to build a new theatre and arts centre. All eligible applications were evaluated by an independent committee established by me for that purpose. As the application in question was not among those recommended to me by the committee, it was not successful. Only applications recommended by the independent committee were considered by me for the purposes of grant allocations.</P>
      <P>Total funds available for ACCESS come to &euro;45.7 million, while applications were received for grant aid totalling &euro;284.42 million. Difficult decisions therefore had to be made, with many worthwhile projects having to be refused. Officials from my Department met recently representatives from the Garage Theatre. However, the funding available to the ACCESS scheme is already fully allocated to 2004.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The levels of funding available to the arts council have increased dramatically since I took office as Minister in 1997. To start with, I obtained £26 million for the council in 1998, which allowed it to complete the then current arts plan a year earlier than anticipated. I then secured £100 million, &euro;126.97 million, for the implementation of the second arts plan from 1999-2001. The amount secured by me for the Arts Council in 2002 is over 80% more than what was provided in 1997.</P>
      <P>While issues in relation to specific cases will always arise, the arts is now far better provided for than before I took office. The Arts Plan 2002-2006 sets out the Arts Council's priorities for the years of the plan, along with projected costs. The plan is under consideration in my Department. Legislation does not arise in this context.</P>
      <P>As with any Department, the funding available to my Department is subject to the annual Estimates process and therefore the amounts that can be made available to the council for any particular year of the plan can only be confirmed on an annual basis. The allocation available for 2002 has been known to the Arts Council for some considerable time.</P>

It is intended that compensation for losses in 2002 arising out of the interim 30% destocking will be paid later this year.</P>

      <P>It appears from the information supplied by the Deputy that the person referred to is eligible to apply for citizenship through either the naturalisation or post-nuptial processes. I have set out below some general information about these two methods of acquiring Irish citizenship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Post-Nuptial Citizenship</i>A non-national married to a person who is an Irish citizen, otherwise than by naturalisation, post-nuptial declaration or honorary citizenship, may accept Irish citizenship as his or her post-nuptial citizenship, by lodging a declaration not earlier than three years from the date of the marriage or three years from the date the applicant's <Col N="1339" /> spouse became an Irish citizen, whichever is the later. The marriage must be subsisting and the couple must be living together as husband and wife at the time of application.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Naturalisation</i>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended in 1986, provides that the Minister for Justice may grant a certificate of naturalisation at his or her absolute discretion. The applicant has to fulfil certain statutory requirements including being of good character and having a total of five years residency in the State in the nine year period preceding the date of the application. The Act also empowers the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to dispense with the statutory conditions in whole or in part, in certain specific circumstances, for example if the applicant is of Irish descent or has Irish associations. More detailed information on citizenship matters and any relevant application forms can be obtained by telephoning the citizenship helpline, telephone no. 01-602 8202, on any Tuesday and Thursday morning between the hours of 10 a.m. and 12:30 pm.</P>
    <P>The current average processing times are 15 months and six months for applications of naturalisation and post-nuptial citizenship respectively.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1342" /> These amounts are broken down in the tabular statements following.</P>
    <P>In the course of the prisons building and refurbishment programme, my Department has, on an ongoing basis, engaged consulting architects, consulting engineers and other specialists as appropriate to each particular project. The total cost for these services to my Department over the period 1997 to 2001 is estimated at &euro;6.8 million approximately. It would not, however, be appropriate to break these figures down to reveal the cost of each consultancy or contract because of the market sensitive nature of this information. Furthermore, in the interest of the security of the prisons, it is not considered appropriate to identify consultancy firms or individual consultants in relation to prison works or prison building projects.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that material in relation to the Criminal Assets Bureau is not included in this reply. As the bureau is a high security area it would be inappropriate for security reasons to provide any information on the detail of any contracts in relation to this office.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that expenditure in relation to the Garda Síochána is not included for 1996 and 1997 as records were not computerised. The compilation of these records would require a manual examination of individual contracts and would necessitate the diversion of staff from other important duties.</P>

      <P>More than 100 recommendations were made in the report of the working group on the review of the coroner service which was published in December 2000, following a Government decision to approve the preparation of new legislation. A critical part of this legislative preparation involves the development of coroners rules and these are currently being developed by a coroners rules committee which was established in November 2001. The committee expects to complete its work within the next few months. My Department is also examining how implementation of the overall review can best be progressed in advance of introducing the new legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 587 and 603 together.</P>
      <P>The legislation governing small public service vehicles, that is, taxis and hackneys is set out in the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations 1963 (S.I. No. 191 of 1963), as amended. The primary legislation is the Road Traffic Act, 1961, (Part VII) as amended.</P>
      <P>The processing of public service vehicle licence applications in regard to the suitability of the applicant is a matter for the Garda authorities and responsibility for ensuring that persons are fit and proper persons to be granted a licence rests with the Garda authorising officer in accordance with the provisions of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles)(Amendment )(No. 2) Regulations, 1970 (S.I. No. 200 of 1970). The regulations do not specify any particular convictions which would render an applicant unsuitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities may at any time revoke a licence to drive a small public service vehicle if they consider the holder of the licence is no longer a fit and proper person to hold such a <Col N="1355" /> licence. The regulations also provide that where the holder of a licence to drive small public service vehicles is convicted of an offence which in the opinion of the court renders the holder unsuitable to hold such a licence, the court may revoke the licence and shall notify the Commissioner of any such revocation.</P>
    <P>The issue of amending the above legislation to exclude convicted sex offenders from obtaining PSV licences is a matter for consideration by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the procedures used in the consideration of applications for PSV licences, as a result of the issuing of such a licence to the person at the centre of the X case, which has been revoked since September 1999, the Garda initiated a working group to review existing procedures for the processing of applications for PSV licences.</P>
    <P>Following this review, more stringent vetting procedures were developed and a revised &ldquo;Application for a Licence to Drive Small Public Services Vehicles&rdquo; form was introduced in March, 2000. The main changes in the vetting procedures include: applicants are now obliged to provide their PPS number for identity verification purposes; applicants must provide details of two referees, who must be deemed acceptable and of sufficient standing, who can vouch for the applicant; applicants are obliged to provide details of previous PSV licences; and applicants are obliged to indicate if they ever had any previous convictions in this State or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Each applicant is checked against Garda records and where there is any doubt about the applicant's suitability, that person is interviewed by the issuing officer and afforded an opportunity to address any Garda reservations. It should be noted that in cases where an applicant is refused a licence by the Garda authorising officer, the applicant has a right of appeal to the District Court.</P>
    <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the staffing levels in the Carriage Office are kept under review and increased as and when judged necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three ways in which a non-national can obtain Irish citizenship: by descent, by naturalisation or by marriage to an Irish citizen (post-nuptial citizenship). I have set out some general information about these methods of acquiring Irish citizenship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" />A person whose father or mother was an Irish citizen at the time of his or her birth is an Irish citizen from birth. A person whose grandparent was born in Ireland may become an Irish citizen by registering in the Foreign Births Register at an Irish embassy or consular office or at the Department of Foreign Affairs. A person whose great-grandparent was born in Ireland may register in certain circumstances. Further information in this regard may be obtained from Consular Section, Department of Foreign Affairs, Hainault House, St. Stephen's Green, Dublin 2 or from any Irish embassy or consular office.</P>
    <P>A non-national married to a person who is an Irish citizen otherwise than by naturalisation, post-nuptial declaration or honorary citizenship may accept Irish citizenship as his or her post-nuptial citizenship by lodging a declaration not earlier than three years from the date of the marriage or three years from the date the applicant's spouse became an Irish citizen, whichever is the later. The marriage must be subsisting and the couple must be living together as husband and wife at the time of application.</P>
    <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended in 1986, provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may grant a certificate of naturalisation at his or her absolute discretion. The applicant has to fulfil certain statutory requirements, including being of good character and having a total of five years residency in the State in the nine year period preceding the date of the application. The Act also empowers the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to dispense with the statutory conditions in whole or in part, in certain specific circumstances, for example, if the applicant is of Irish descent or has Irish associations.</P>
    <P>It appears from the information supplied by the Deputy that the person referred to is eligible to make an application for a certificate of naturalisation at this point in time. Without further information, I am not in a position to advise the Deputy as to whether the person concerned could obtain citizenship by one of the other methods outlined. More detailed information on citizenship matters and any relevant application forms can be obtained by telephoning the citizenship helpline, telephone no. 01 &ndash; 602 8202, on any Tuesday and Thursday between the hours of 10 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. The current average processing times are 15 months and six months for applications of naturalisation and post-nuptial citizenship respectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that an application for a Garda CCTV system in Swords has been received by the advisory committee that was established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate applications for Garda CCTV systems. The application from Swords is currently under consideration, together with applications from other cities and towns throughout the country. Garda CCTV systems are currently in operation in the following areas: Dublin North Central, that is, O'Connell Street and its surrounding areas; Dublin South Central, that is, Grafton Street and its surrounding areas; and Tralee, County Kerry.</P>
      <P>A Garda CCTV system is currently being completed in Cork City and I understand, in this regard, that most of the cameras in the system are now fully operational.</P>
      <P>The first phase of the Garda CCTV system in Dublin North Central was launched in April 1997. Subsequent phases in this system together with the CCTV systems for Dublin South Central, Tralee and Cork have been installed since June 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware that I announced late in 2000 that the number of Garda CCTV systems was to be extended. As part of the first tranche of this expansion, CCTV systems are to be installed in the following areas: Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. It is anticipated that these ten CCTV systems will be installed by the end of 2002. At least <Col N="1358" /> a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course.</P>
    <P>Tenders have been sought and received in respect of the town centre CCTV systems for Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick. The evaluation process is in its final stages and I hope to announce the awarding of the contracts shortly, after which work will commence immediately to put the systems in place. The planning in respect of the town centre CCTV systems for Athlone, Clondalkin, Waterford and Tallaght is well advanced and it is expected that tenders will be invited via the EU journal and the national newspapers within the next few months.</P>
    <P>I am also conscious that some applications for CCTV systems that have been received by the advisory committee that was established by the Commissioner to evaluate CCTV applications relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority.</P>
    <P>I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided to areas which are not rated as a high level Garda priority. To this end, I plan to introduce a grant scheme soon to cater for those communities who would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. While it will be up to the local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes, grant assistance will be provided.</P>
    <P>To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards will have to be met and the Garda will have to be allowed access to the system when and as it requires it. Local authorities will have an important role to play. The details of this new scheme are currently being finalised and full details of the scheme including relevant conditions and grant levels will be announced within the next four to six weeks.</P>

      <P>As regards Ballinrobe, the Deputy will be glad to know that I have been informed by the Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for such matters, that a contract was placed this month for the construction of a new Garda station in the town. I understand that work on the project will commence subject to the receipt of the required bond from the builder. Moreover, I understand from the Office of Public Works that the contract duration is nine months.</P>
      <P>On the general issue of a priority list for such projects, I point out that the building and major refurbishment of Garda stations is carried out in conformity with priorities decided on in consultation with the Garda authorities, Garda staff associations and the Office of Public Works. It should be noted, however, that works are not always undertaken in strict numerical sequence as, for instance, the commencement of a project is dependent on a number of factors, for example the successful acquisition of a suitable site for the development.</P>
      <P>Finally, the allocation of funding for such capital projects is a matter for the Office of Public Works. It has informed me that funding has been provided in this year's Vote for that office for the construction of new Garda stations and for major refurbishments to others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 616 and 617 together.</P>
      <P>An Irish visa is, in effect, only a form of pre-entry clearance. It does not constitute permission to enter the State. The holder of an Irish visa may be refused leave to land by an immigration officer if he or she does not have a visa despite being a visa required national. An immigration officer may in addition however refuse a visa holder leave to land on a number of stated grounds &ndash; for example where he or she is satisfied that the person in question is not in a position of self support or seeks to enter the State for a purpose other than that expressed.</P>
      <P>A second point that must be borne in mind is that a person who is granted an Irish visa may choose thereafter not to travel to the State. Therefore the number of visas issued to persons of a particular nationality does not necessarily equate with the number of persons of that nationality who entered the State during any particular period.</P>
      <P>Non-EEA nationals, other than asylum seekers, who are resident in the State for more than three months are required to register with the Garda Síochána and to obtain from it the permission of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to remain in the State for a particular purpose, for example, work or study. Prior to 21 September 2001, it was the case that the relevant information gleaned during the course of this process was recorded manually by the Garda Síochána. However the Garda National Immigration Bureau launched a new computerised registration system on that date. The purpose of this initiative was to transform the registration process from an entirely paper based system to a computerised system and to improve the quality of management information. In effect what this means is that all new registrations and renewals of registration are being captured on computer at present. Since most registrations are renewed annually much of the information is still paper based. As a consequence the information requested by the Deputy is not readily available and could only be obtained by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of Garda resources.</P>
      <P>However, I can say that in the year 2001 there were 90,446 non-EEA nationals registered in the State of whom 11,949 were Chinese. It is estimated that the vast majority of those Chinese nationals were in the State for the purposes of study although such persons are, subject to certain conditions, allowed to enter employment part-time during their course of studies and up to 40 hours per week during vacation periods.</P>

    <P>These figures show that the manpower strength at Rathcoole Garda station more than doubled in the above period. Resources are augmented within the division as required by the divisional task force, traffic units and district drug and detective units.</P>
    <P>I am also informed that Rathcoole Garda station is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. each day. Any extension of the current opening hours would necessitate the employment of Garda personnel on indoor administrative duties. Such personnel can be utilised more effectively in providing a visible Garda presence on outdoor policing duties. The allocation of vehicles to Rathcoole Garda <Col N="1369" /> station is comparable to areas with similar size and population throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, local Garda management is satisfied that the arrangements currently in place at Rathcoole are adequate to meet the present policing needs of the area. However, the situation will be kept under review and when additional manpower next becomes available the needs of Rathcoole will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country.</P>

      <P>In 1997, a Defender fixed wing aircraft and a Eurocopter AS355 were delivered and entered into service with the Garda air support unit.</P>
      <P>A decision was made subsequently to introduce a second helicopter for use by the Garda air support unit and in August 1999 a contract was placed for a Eurocopter EC135. This represents a new generation of helicopter technology. The craft is built to order and delivery time depends on the production line and demand from other customers. Following construction, the craft was then delivered to the UK for the fitting out of specialised police equipment.</P>
      <P>The fitting out of most of the specialised equipment was been completed and the necessary trials carried out allowing acceptance by us of the craft on 20 December 2001. However, a small number of items and additional Garda tactical components are currently being fitted.</P>
      <P>The total cost of the second Garda helicopter, including the specialised police equipment fitted to the aircraft, is &euro;5.057 million &ndash; inclusive of VAT. No direct costs have been incurred as regards maintenance and hangarage of the helicopter since December 2001. Garda observers have been receiving some training in the use of tactical equipment. I understand that five Air Corps pilots have completed ground school training with the manufacturer and that two Air Corps technicians have also received technical training.</P>
      <P>The second helicopter is being purchased with a view to increasing the availability and coverage of air support to the Garda Síochána; to provide additional availability during servicing downtime of the current helicopter and to provide for an increase in operating hours to a twenty four hour immediate response capability in time.</P>

      <P>Additional staff resources and significant administrative changes were introduced in the citizenship area of my Department during the course of 2001 with the result that the processing time for naturalisation applications, notwithstanding the increased volume of applications being received, has been reduced from two and a half years at the start of 2001 to 15 months by the year's end.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1373" />
      <i>The Paul Ward Case</i>An assistant commissioner was appointed by the Garda Commissioner to inquire into and report on the circumstances that gave rise to the trial judge's comments in this case. Arising from the report, a working group was established by the Commissioner to progress the recommendations contained in the report.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Fred Flannery Case</i>Arising from the comments of the trial judge in this case the then Garda Commissioner appointed a chief superintendent to examine and investigate the alleged misconduct by members of An Garda Síochána. The chief superintendent's report was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who directed that no action was warranted in respect of any members of An Garda Síochána involved.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Dean Lyons Case</i>A probative inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the charging of the individual concerned was conducted by an assistant commissioner, on the directions of the Garda Commissioner. This inquiry established that the person in question was lawfully arrested on the 26 July 1997, and subsequently detained under the provisions of section 4, Criminal Justice Act, 1984, in connection with the double murder at Grangegorman, Dublin 7 on 6-7 March 1997. It was also established that the manner in which the person was interviewed was in compliance with the Criminal Justice Act 1984 (Electronic Recording of Interviews Regulations, 1997) which came into operation on 1 March 1997.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Anna Maria Sacco Case</i>No inquiry was carried out by An Garda Síochána in relation to the conduct of the Garda investigation of this case.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Jerry McCabe Case</i>Complaints were made under the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986, by some of those arrested in the course of this murder investigation and these were investigated by the Garda Síochána Complaints Board. No inquiry was carried out by An Garda Síochána in relation to the conduct of the Garda investigation of this case.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Hugh Byrne Case</i>Twelve individuals have gone on trial for the manslaughter of Mr. Josie Dwyer. Of these, six persons have been convicted by the courts of various offences related to the incident. Two of these were tried before the Special Criminal Court. A further five persons were found not guilty (one of whom was Mr. Byrne) by direction of the presiding judge. Charges against the 12th person were withdrawn. No inquiry was carried out by An Garda Síochána in relation to the conduct of the Garda investigation of this case.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Paul O'Donoghue Case</i>No details of any inquiry carried out in relation <Col N="1374" /> to the conduct of a Garda investigation relative to the named individual are available.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Frank Shortt Case</i>As this matter is currently before the courts I do not consider any comment to be appropriate at this stage.</P>

      <P>In addition, the community police continue to actively encourage the local community to participate in the Neighbourhood Watch scheme and gardaí attend meetings of the local business association, where crime prevention advice is given.

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that I announced late in 2000 that the number of Garda CCTV systems was to be extended. As part of the first tranche of this expansion, CCTV systems are to be installed in the following areas: Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Tallaght and Waterford. It is anticipated that these ten CCTV systems will be installed by the end of 2002. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course.</P>
      <P>Tenders were sought and received in 2001 in respect of the town centre CCTV systems for Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick. The evaluation process has taken longer than was anticipated and as a result it was not possible to enter into any contractual commitments. In the circumstances, the total expenditure from the Garda Vote in 2001 on CCTV systems amounted to £33,592 or &euro;42,653. The original allocation was £4.185 million or &euro;5.314 million. It is not envisaged that a similar situation will arise this year.</P>
      <P>The evaluation process in respect of the CCTV systems for Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick is in its final stages and I hope to announce the awarding of the contracts shortly, after which work will commence immediately to put the systems in place. The planning in respect of the town centre CCTV systems for Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford is well advanced and it is expected that tenders will be invited via the EU journal and the national newspapers within the next few months.</P>
      <P>I also plan to introduce a grant scheme to cater for those communities which would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. While it will be up to the local communities to install and monitor the CCTV schemes, grant assistance will be provided. The details of this new scheme are being finalised and full particulars including relevant conditions and grant levels etc. will be announced within the next four to six weeks.</P>

    <P>Last November, I announced that I had approved the holding of a Garda recruitment competition early this year to recruit an additional 300 Garda trainees. This competition was recently advertised by the Civil Service Commission. Recruitment already under way will bring Garda strength up to an all-time record high of 12,000 by the end of 2002 and the recruitment of this additional 300 Garda trainees will ensure that Garda strength does not drop below this level.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the serious problem of under age drinking throughout the country, he will bring into immediate force the section of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, which requires all off-licences to display their name and address on all containers used for alcohol and thereby greatly assist the gardaí in tracing the source of alcohol sold to minors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Section 17 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, provides that the name of the owner, and the address, of premises to which an on-licence or an off-licence is attached shall be clearly indicated on a label affixed to any container in which intoxicating liquor is sold for consumption off the premises.</P>
      <P>The aim of this section, which has not yet entered into force, is to complement existing provisions designed to combat the consumption of intoxicating liquor by persons under the age of 18 years. My Department is considering how best to overcome practical and technical difficulties relating to the labelling of individual containers &ndash; particularly in relation to the possible removal or altering of labels after sale &ndash; with a view to ensuring the effective implementation of this section.</P>
      <P>While the labelling of containers may assist the Garda in efforts to combat underage drinking, the effectiveness of this measure could be undermined to some extent by what has become known as &ldquo;secondary purchasing&rdquo;, that is, the purchase of alcohol by persons who have attained 18 years of age for illegal consumption by under-18s. Intoxicating liquor found by gardaí in the possession of persons under 18 may have been sold in good faith by the on-licence or off-licence concerned to a person of 18 years or over.</P>

    <P>Similiar details in relation to escapes from Garda custody are not readily available and could only be obtained by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of prisoner escapes take place when prisoners are in transit to or from court or hospital. In such settings prisoners have to be taken out of restraints and the control of prison officers or gardaí over their movements may be restricted. Out of the tens of thousands of such outings from prisons over the period, a total of 55 escapes occurred and seven of these prisoners remain at large. However, two of these have been committed to prison in a different jurisdiction. A number of others are recent escapees and experience has shown that it is likely that these persons will be recaptured by the gardaí in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is responsible, <i>inter alia</i>, for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum <Col N="1380" /> seekers under the system of dispersal and direct provision which was introduced in April 2000. The RIA is currently providing full board accommodation for close on 5,000 asylum seekers in 81 centres which are situated in 24 of the 26 counties. Currently, 89 asylum seekers are accommodated in one centre in Kilkenny on a full board basis under the system of direct provision.</P>
      <P>In accordance with Government policy on the dispersal and provision of accommodation for asylum seekers, the Office of Public Works, arising from a public advertisement, has recently secured a four year, nine month lease, effective from the completion of construction, for a site at Leggettsrath, Dublin Road, Kilkenny on behalf of the RIA for the purpose of developing a centre for the provision of accommodation and certain ancillary services for up to 250 asylum seekers, including children. Arrangements are being made to put in place the contract for the construction of the accommodation. No development has yet commenced on site.</P>
      <P>The facility in question will be a low-rise accommodation centre, modelled on similar facilities used extensively throughout Europe. It will be similar to other system built centres at Knockalisheen, County Clare, Cork and Dublin and it is anticipated at this stage that the centre could come on stream at the end of this year or early next year. Following its completion, placements to the centre will be made on a phased basis over a number of months.</P>
      <P>The centre will cater, in the main, for families and will incorporate dining, communal, recreational, health and welfare facilities and appropriate landscaping works. In accordance with normal practice, representatives of the RIA have already met with representatives of Kilkenny County Council, the South-Eastern Health Board and local residents and will liaise with support service providers, including the South-Eastern Health Board, schools and voluntary groups in order to facilitate the development of support structures for asylum seekers to be accommodated at the centre.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources to individual areas, that Riverstown is located in the Cabra sub-district. The area is subject to foot patrols from members of the community policing unit in Cabra, which consists of three members. The community policing unit is supplemented from members attached to other units such as the detective unit, divisional task force, divisional traffic unit and K district drug unit.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that local Garda management is satisfied that these patrols are sufficient to meet the policing needs of the area and that they are monitored on a regular basis by the inspector in charge of Cabra. However, the situation will be kept under review and when additional manpower next becomes available the needs of the Cabra sub-district will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Under the national lottery funded sports capital programme, funding is allocated to sporting, voluntary and community organisations for the provision of sporting and recreational facilities. The 2002 programme was advertised on 25 and 26 November 2001 with a closing date of 4 January 2002 for the receipt of completed applications. An application was not received from an organisation as named by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the 2003 sports capital programme will be advertised towards the end of this year and it will be open to the organisation to apply for funding at that time should it so wish.</P>

      <P>Ministerial responsibility for fire safety, including the formulation of regulations and guidelines, comes under the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey. I take it the Deputy is referring to the guidelines entitled Fire Safety in Guest Accommodation, issued by that Department in 2001.</P>
      <P>The safety of guests in tourist accommodation is of vital importance to all involved in the tourism industry and my Department endorses all efforts to ensure that the highest possible standards are set and enforced. I have long held the view that the tourist experience in guesthouse and bed and breakfast accommodation is a unique feature of an Irish holiday for many overseas visitors. Adherence to high standards, including those relating to fire safety, can only serve to enhance such accommodation and make it more attractive and safe for the increasingly discerning tourist.</P>
      <P>The core objective of the recently launched Bord Fáilte Éireann's Tourism Product Development Scheme, 2000-2006, is to improve the spatial spread of tourism by focusing on less developed tourism areas. However, given the current level and range of tourist accommodation, there is no measure within the scheme to grant-aid such facilities, including assistance towards any expenses incurred by accommodation providers along the lines indicated by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, 2000-02, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are: preliminary report; contract document; ten<Col N="1391" /> der and construction. My Department's technical advisors, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been received for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>
      <P>My Department has received a feasibility study for a proposed swimming pool in Monaghan. This proposal was received after the closing date set for the current local authority swimming pool programme but will be considered when a new programme is initiated.</P>

      <P>The young people's facilities and services fund, YPFSF, was established in 1998 as part of the Government's overall strategy to tackle drug misuse. The fund aims to assist in the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The objective of the fund is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.</P>
      <P>The main focus of the YPFSF has been on the local drugs task force areas where integrated plans were prepared on the basis of detailed guidelines agreed by the Cabinet committee on social inclusion.</P>
      <P>With regard to the information sought by the Deputy in relation to the postal districts of Dublin 6W, Dublin 12 and Dublin 24, it should be noted that local drugs task forces operate in the Dublin 12 and Tallaght areas and are based on the partnership areas that had been previously identified for local development purposes. They are not, therefore, coterminous with the postal districts identified. Dublin 6W is not part of a task force area and, therefore, did not receive funding under the YPFSF.</P>
      <P>The Dublin 12 and Tallaght LDTF areas, coterminous with the KWCD and the Tallaght Partnership areas respectively, have received the following allocations to date:</P>

      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, 2000-2002, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are preliminary report, contract document, tender and construction. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluates each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant-aid is allocated only when tenders have been received for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>
      <P>My Department has received a feasibility study for a swimming pool at Kilclooney, Portnoo, County Donegal. This proposal was received after the closing date set for the current local authority swimming pool programme but will be considered when a new programme is initiated.</P>

      <Quest>if his Department will provide a top-up grant for the 2000-01 academic year for a person (details supplied) in County Leitrim.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grants.</P>
      <P>The action group considered that the target group of &ldquo;those most in need&rdquo; could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education, that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22. The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, students aged 23 and over. In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that she or he must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post leaving certificate courses: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees' and the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate, PLC, courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All four schemes have similar provisions, relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant. Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, she or he may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is <Col N="1396" /> desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy. If an individual applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, she or he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his/her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant are being reviewed with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from &euro;2.49 million, £1.964 million, in respect of the 2000-01 academic year to &euro;7.49 million, £5.9 million, in respect of the 2001-02 academic year.</P>

      <P>The boards of management of Cappoquin girls national school and Cappoquin boys national school have indicated their agreement to amalgamate with effect from September 2002. However, the details have not yet been finalised.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving the accommodation situation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997.</P>
      <P>Because of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
      <P>I have recently authorised my Department to allow the building project in respect of Cappoquin girls national school and Cappoquin boys national school, to proceed to the preparation of tender documents and the invitation of tenders.</P>

      <P>My Department recognises English language schools which meet the criteria specified by the Advisory Council for English Language Schools, ACELS, for such recognition. I have arranged for the regulations governing such recognition together with the list of English language schools recognised by my Department to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will note from the list of recognised schools, there is a significant number in the greater Dublin area. In effect, Dublin is well established as a centre for learning English for junior and adult learners. As a capital city, it has good access transport from the traditional European markets such as Spain and France, and has good onward links through Britain for visitors from long-haul markets such as Latin America and China. With further improvements in international access transport and in local infrastructure, it has the scope to further develop, particularly in terms of attracting adult language learners year round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The teaching of English as a foreign language industry is estimated to be worth in excess of &euro;400 <Col N="1398" /> million annually to this country. I consider that Ireland, and Dublin as the capital city, has the potential and opportunity to position itself as an internationally recognised quality education destination with English language training as a component part. In this context, I am in consultation with Enterprise Ireland and the international board for education in Ireland, with a view to developing a coherent promotional strategy to build on our existing reputation for high quality education and training.</P>

      <P>The pupil-teacher ratios in first and second level schools, relating to the 1999-2000 school year, are as follows: First Level, 20.3; Second Level, 14.8.</P>
      <P>The most recently published international comparison of pupil-teacher ratios relates to the 1998-99 school year. The table following provides data on pupil-teacher ratios at primary and second level in 1998-99 in European countries for which comparable information is readily available. The country means at OECD, European and EU levels are also provided.</P>
      <P>Although the pupil-teacher ratio in Ireland is still above the average for European and OECD countries at primary level, it has been reduced very significantly at this level over the last decade leading to a considerable narrowing of the gap with the rest of Europe and the OECD. Furthermore, at second level, the pupil-teacher ratio is now approaching the OECD average having been reduced systematically over recent years.</P>
      <P>In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide for further reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs and those from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>

    <P>Prior to 1994 there were 252 ex-quota remedial teaching posts allocated to second level schools. An additional 25 posts were allocated in 1994-95 and a further 73 were allocated in 1995-96, bringing the total to 350. These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need and having regard to the existing provision in schools. Regard was also taken of the recommendations of the Department's psychological services in allocating such posts.</P>
    <P>With effect from the 1999-2000 school year all second level schools in the free education scheme have an automatic entitlement to an ex-quota allocation in respect of remedial teaching. The allocation is determined by the enrolment in the school. Schools with an enrolment of 600 or more are allocated a full post while schools with enrolments below 600 are allocated 0.5 of a post. Individual schools which had been allocated an ex-quota remedial post by my Department prior to 1999 retained that entitlement even if the enrolment in the school was below 600. The total allocation to second level schools in respect of remedial education in the current school year is of the order of 560 whole-time teacher equivalents. Further improvements in remedial teacher allocations will be made in the light of available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The case of the student, referred to by the Deputy, was recently forwarded to my Department by Waterford County Council for guidance regarding the assessment of reckonable income.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the third level student support schemes, a candidate's reckonable income for the purposes of the means test is his or her gross income from all sources and the gross income of his/her parents or guardians where applicable, with certain specified social welfare and health board payments, as follows, being exempt: child benefit; family income supplement; disability allowance, where paid to the candidate; blind pension, where paid to the candidate; means-tested one parent family payments; orphan's pensions; back to education allowance; foster care allowance; domiciliary care allowance and carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>According to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the one parent family payment, referred to above, is a means tested payment for both men and women who, for a variety of reasons, are bringing up a child, or children, without the support of a partner. A person who is unmarried or widowed, is eligible to apply for this payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department understands that the mother of the student in question is in receipt of a pension from the South Eastern Health Board and a contributory widow's pension, payable by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Both these payments are considered as reckonable income for the purposes of determining eligibility under the student support schemes. Child dependant allowance, which forms part of <Col N="1402" /> the contributory widow's pension payment, would also be included as reckonable income.</P>
    <P>My Department understands that the other payment in question is an allowance received by the student from the South Eastern Health Board arising from her late father's employment with the board. As it is not one of the specified exclusions, it must also be included in the calculation of reckonable income for grant purposes.</P>
    <P>It is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the student support schemes in individual cases. However, I will review the position regarding the inclusion of an orphan's payment in the assessment of means and will let the Deputy know the position as soon as possible.</P>

In the case of an independent mature student, reckonable income is his or her gross income from all sources and, where applicable, the gross income of his or her spouse.</P>
      <P>The following social welfare and health board payments are excluded in the calculation of reckonable income for the purposes of the schemes: child benefit; family income supplement; disability allowance, where paid to the candidate; blind pension, where paid to the candidate; means-tested one parent family payment; orphan's pensions; back to education allowance; foster care allowance; domiciliary care allowance and carer's allowance.</P>

      <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grants.</P>
      <P>The action group considered that the target group of &ldquo;those most in need&rdquo; could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education, that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students aged <Col N="1408" /> 23 and over. I recently announced that these rates will also be available to eligible mature students from Easter. In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that s/he must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants.</P>
    <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post leaving certificate courses: (a) the higher education grants scheme, (b) the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme, (c) the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and (d) the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate, PLC, courses.</P>
    <P>All four schemes have similar provisions, relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant. Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, she or he may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy. If an individual applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, she or he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>I have given a commitment that the eligibility criteria for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed with a view to extending eligibility. That review is now under way and a first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in its first year of operation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their finan<Col N="1409" /> cial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from &euro;2.49 million, £1.964 million, in respect of the 2000/01 academic year to &euro;7.49 million, £5.9 million, in respect of the 2001/02 academic year.</P>

      <Quest>the actions taken by his Department to give legal affect to directives 89/48/EEC and 98/5/EEC; his views on whether, in the context of the Bologna declaration, it is desirable that there be cross-Community recognition of third level qualifications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Council Directive 89/48/EEC provides for a general system for the recognition of higher education diplomas awarded on completion of professional education and training of at least three years duration. My Department transposed this directive into national law in 1991 by means of statutory instrument SI 1 of 1991. Ireland was the first EU member state to transpose this directive into national law.</P>
      <P>In relation to Directive 98/5/EC, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has received legal advice to the effect that a provision in primary legislation is necessary to transpose the directive on the right of establishment of lawyers, in addition to regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972. The necessary provision has been made by way of an amendment to the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, which is awaiting Report Stage, having been passed by the Seanad. On enactment of the Bill the necessary regulations to give full effect to the directive will be made.</P>
      <P>On the issue of cross-Community recognition of third level qualifications, I presume that the Deputy is referring to the issue of transparency and recognition of qualifications within and across the European Union. In this connection, the Deputy will be aware that the Council of Education Ministers at our meeting on 14 February last, adopted a detailed work programme jointly with the Commission. This sets out the key issues to be addressed in order to meet the strategic objectives of improving the quality and effectiveness of education and training systems in the EU; facilitating access for all to education and training systems; and opening up education and training systems to the wider world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to achieve these ambitious but realistic goals, the Council and the Commission agreed that, <i>inter alia,</i> we should seek to ensure that education and training systems in Europe will be <Col N="1410" /> compatible enough to allow citizens to move between them and take advantage of their diversity and that holders of qualifications, knowledge and skills acquired anywhere in the EU will be able to get them effectively validated throughout the Union for the purpose of career and further training.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that in their joint declaration in Bologna in June 1999, European Ministers for Education undertook to establish the European area of higher education in a global context. The goals of the declaration are to increase mobility and employability within the European area. Recognising the fundamental principles of autonomy and diversity, the establishment of the European area of higher education will be achieved by greater compatibility and comparability of the European systems of higher education. One of the key objectives of the declaration is the adoption of a system of easily readable and comparable degrees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Dance and drama form part of the revised primary school curriculum and schools are obliged to provide dance and drama instruction for their pupils. Boards of management of primary schools are expected to employ fully qualified teachers, able to teach all aspects of the curriculum, including dance and drama. As a result there should be no need to employ the services of a dance and drama instructor to provide dance and drama lessons during school time.</P>
      <P>Should a dance and drama teacher be employed, however, such a teacher should act as assistant to the class teacher. The class teacher should be fully aware of the planned content of lessons and should be present at all times during the lessons so that he or she will be in a position to expand on the content in the absence of the outside teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the board of management may employ the services of a dance and drama instructor during school hours and ask the pupil's parents to contribute to the cost of running such classes, it should be noted that all pupils have a right to attend classes held during school time irrespective of whether their parents choose to contribute to the cost. In this regard parents can be requested to contribute to the costs of running such classes, but no undue pressure can be brought to bear in order to make parents contribute. Indeed, if parents choose, for whatever <Col N="1411" /> reason, not to contribute, their child still has a right to attend all classes held within school time.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in relation to dance and drama lessons held during school hours, all pupils in classes at whom these lessons are aimed must be allowed participate, irrespective of whether their parents have contributed to the cost of the lessons. In addition, the class teacher must be present for all such lessons.</P>

      <P>There are no plans at present to introduce new procedures for dealing with schools' timetabling arrangements.</P>
      <P>School authorities are obliged to ensure that schools adhere to the prescribed minimum number of teaching days per annum. At primary level, the minimum number of teaching days per school year is 183, while at second level, schools are required to be open for teaching for 167 days. Subject to the requirement in the primary sector that the schools must close for the months of July and August, the choice of vacation days on which schools will be closed is a matter for individual boards of management or vocational education committees, which are charged with the direct governance of schools.</P>
      <P>In order to guarantee that its school is in operation for the prescribed minimum number of days, each managerial authority, in planning the school year, must make allowance for days on which the school may have to be closed due to unforeseen or exceptional circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances I consider that school authorities should therefore retain discretion in this matter. However I would urge all school authorities to liaise with neighbouring schools in <Col N="1415" /> planning the school year so that, in so far as is possible, schools serving a particular area would be open for broadly similar periods.</P>

    <P>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods): The Deputy will be aware that last year I announced the provision of a new second level school on a greenfield site in Ratoath, County <Col N="1416" /> Meath. The school will be a community college under the aegis of County Meath VEC.</P>
    <P>A number of steps have since been taken to progress the development of the facility, including the determination of a catchment area and a long-term projected enrolment. It had been proposed initially that provision should be made in the new school for 700 pupils. This figure is currently being reviewed, however, in the light of a proposal from County Meath VEC that provision should also be made for the possible demand for second level schooling through Irish, given the existence of three gaelscoileanna in the general area. A decision in this regard will be made as soon as the necessary consultation process with all relevant interests is completed.</P>
    <P>Also, County Meath VEC is in the process of identifying potential sites for the new school. When a suitable site is acquired, architectural planning will begin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 714, 717, 729, 738, 741, 746, 748, 755, 758, 767, 770, 774, 802, 810, 841, 845, 876 and 907 together.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department held discussions with the representatives of the managerial authorities in the second level sector, in order to ensure that schools would remain open when the ASTI directive to its members to withdraw from voluntary supervision and substitution duties took effect on 4 March 2002.</P>
      <P>Arising from these discussions a contingency plan was prepared and agreed between my Department and the managerial authorities. As part of the contingency arrangements, my Department undertook to resource schools in order that they could employ staff to provide supervision and thereby remain open. In addition, my Department undertook to recoup the cost to the management authorities of advertising for, recruiting and training personnel to provide supervision services in schools on a temporary contractual basis.</P>
      <P>Supervisors who contracted for delivery of supervision services are being remunerated at a daily contract rate of &euro;68.56, £54, based on a minimum of two hours supervision. Where further supervision above these two hours is required this is being remunerated at &euro;34.28, £27, per additional hour. This is the equivalent to the hourly rate offered to teachers.</P>
      <P>To put schools in funds for the purposes of the contingency arrangements, an initial payment was made to schools by my Department on 28 February 2002, and was based upon six weeks of the annual grant, calculated on the basis of &euro;1,270, £1,000, per whole time equivalent teacher post per annum, with a stipulation that further payments of the grant will be made to schools at the appropriate stages of the contingency. In addition, funding was provided to cover employers PRSI, holiday pay and administrative costs. In aggregate, the sum dispersed to schools was approximately &euro;7 million, £5.5 million.</P>
      <P>The contingency plan acknowledges that supplementary allocations may need to be made to some schools at a later stage if their approved outgoings are greater than the amount of the grant. Accordingly, the final costs are not yet available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The joint managerial body, JMB, placed advertisements on behalf of the managerial authorities in the national media over the weekend of 16 and <Col N="1419" /> 17 February. In addition, the JMB organised training on a regional basis and operated a telephone help-line for schools. My Department has recouped &euro;114,258.47, £89,985.86, to the JMB to offset the cost of providing these services to date. Information concerning the number of people recruited and the number of schools in which they are working is not readily available at this stage, as these personnel are recruited directly by the school authorities.</P>
    <P>The contingency plan does not specify a pupil/supervisor ratio, as the plan recognised that the number of persons required would vary from school to school depending on the layout, both internal and external.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>The teachers in question have applied to my Department to have previous teaching experience considered for incremental credit purposes. Both applications are being considered at present and I have asked my Department to progress these matters as speedily as possible. My officials will be in contact with the parties concerned shortly. Issues relating to tax deductions are a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The delay in dealing with the issue in question has arisen because of the unprecedented growth in special education services which has taken place under the present Government. This is illustrated by the fact that the number of resource teachers deployed to assist children with disabilities in the primary system has grown from 104 in 1999, to more than 1,000 at present and the number of special needs assistants deployed to address the care needs of these children has grown from less than 300 to more than 2,800 whole-time equivalent posts over the same period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals which have been approved by Government for the development of a national special education service, including the establishment of a national council for special education, <Col N="1420" /> will have a major impact on improving the efficiency of service provision in this area in the future.</P>

      <P>The four schools in question have been included in the rural dimension of the new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, which I launched last year to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The programme will be run over a three year period and will cost some &euro;33 million with the allocation of over 200 extra teaching posts.</P>
      <P>The schools targeted under Giving Children An Even Break were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out by the educational research centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. All schools included in Giving Children An Even Break are receiving supplementary grant aid towards providing additional educational supports for the pupils concerned.</P>
      <P>Rural schools, such as the schools referred to by the Deputy, with the highest concentration of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage have been clustered into groups of four to five and each cluster is entitled to the services of a teacher-co-ordinator to work with the schools in relation to the needs of the pupils concerned. The four schools in question have been included in a rural cluster in County Galway.</P>
      <P>Guidelines for the appointment of a co-ordinator were forwarded to each of the four schools in the cluster in January of this year. Schools have been advised to notify my Department once a suitably qualified teacher has been selected for the co-ordinator post. To date, my Department has not received any notification from the cluster regarding the appointment of a co-ordinator.</P>

      <P>I was not made aware that the pupil referred to by the Deputy was suspended from school for the duration of February 2002.</P>
      <P>A psychologist assigned by the national educational psychological service, NEPS, has been liaising with the school principal and will continue to do so. I understand that the pupil's parents have sought an appointment with the local health services for counselling. The NEPS psychologist is supporting this referral, with a view to having the pupil's case prioritised for attention.</P>
      <P>My Department allocated ten hours one-to-one tuition per week for the month of January 2001 and three hours one-to-one tuition per week for the four weeks of February 2001 for the pupil referred to by the Deputy. The principal was advised that no further allocation would be warranted without a review. A fresh application was received from the principal on the 6 March 2001 and this has now been referred to a senior psychologist in my Department for consideration.</P>
      <P>My Department has issued guidelines to boards of management to assist them in discharging their obligations in the area of school discipline. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school. These guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of suspensions and expulsions only as a last resort.</P>
      <P>Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal to the Secretary General of my Department where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board suspends a student for a cumulative total of more than twenty days in an academic year. An appeal will generally not be admitted unless it is made within 42 calendar days from the date the decision of the board of management was notified to the parent or student concerned. However, a longer period for making appeals may be allowed as an exception where it is accepted that circumstances did not permit the making of an appeal within the 42 day limit.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 727, 768 and 769 together.</P>
      <P>There are instances in which a teacher in receipt of salary may not be timetabled for teaching duties. These would include where teachers are carrying out managerial and other non-teaching functions such as home-school community liaison, where teachers are seconded to curriculum or in-service support functions, where teachers are on approved paid leave, sick leave and maternity leave and where teachers are on suspension.</P>
      <P>As indicated to the Deputy in my reply on 7 March 2002, the teacher in question is employed by a vocational education committee. It is a matter for the vocational education committee, as the responsible statutory authority and employer, to ensure that its teaching staff are timetabled and deployed in accordance with the needs of its scheme and to make any salary payments due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the vocational education committee is dealing with the matter raised by the Deputy with a view to deploying the post in question appropriately within its scheme. It would not be appropriate for me to comment <Col N="1426" /> further at this time on a personnel management matter relating to an individual VEC employee.</P>
    <P>An inspector from my Department visited the school in question with the intention of inspecting the work of this teacher. When the inspector visited the classroom the students were engaged by the teacher in completing examination forms and hence a full inspection could not be undertaken. The principal was advised accordingly. I have requested the relevant assistant chief inspector to contact the chief executive officer of the VEC with a view to carrying out a further inspection.</P>

      <P>Since 1 September 2001, the payment structure for special needs assistants at second level is the same as that in force at first level.

Implementation of any proposals for enhancement of this service will be subject to the agreement of the school management representative bodies.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Galway was refused a higher education grant in view of documentation (details supplied) which supports this person's application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The higher education grants scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. These Acts define a mature student to mean a person &ldquo;of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in approved institutions and have reached that age on 1 January, or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his-her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
      <P>When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account, irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not an independent mature student. My Department understands that the student referred to by the Deputy does not meet the age requirement to be assessed as a mature student under the terms of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of the difficulties being encountered in the assessment of means of students under 23 years of age who, for various reasons, are not in a position to produce evidence of parental <Col N="1428" /> income as required under the scheme, my Department sought, and received, legal advice with regard to the assessment of such cases. Subsequently, a letter issued from my Department to the awarding bodies, local authorities and vocational education committees, to the effect that, in cases where estrangement from parents-guardians is claimed, independent verification or official supporting documentation relevant to the particular circumstances, is required.</P>
    <P>My Department understands that in the case of the person referred to by the Deputy, the documentation provided to date does not provide the necessary evidence indicating estrangement from parents. In this regard, confirmation that a candidate is living separately from his-her parents or guardians does not constitute sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>As the person in question does not meet the age requirement to be assessed as a mature student, and in the absence of compelling evidence of estrangement from his parents, his eligibility for a higher education grant must be based on parental income. It is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the student support schemes in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from &euro;2.49 million, £1.964 million, in respect of the 2000-01 academic year to &euro;7.49 million, £5.9 million, in respect of the 2001/02 academic year.</P>

      <P>Gaelscoil Bhrían Boróimhe received provisional recognition in September 1999. An application for permanent recognition was lodged with the planning section of my Department in September, 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time, consideration of the application was deferred until such time as the school patron satisfied one of the Department's criteria for permanent recognition, that is, that interim accom<Col N="1429" /> modation complied with the relevant planning and health and safety provisions.</P>
    <P>The school relocated to new premises in November 2001. An inspector's report on the new accommodation has been received and is being examined in the planning section. The assessment of the school's application is nearing completion and the school authorities will be advised of the outcome shortly. The position regarding permanent accommodation will be considered by my Department in the event that permanent recognition is granted and in light of available capital resources.</P>

      <P>The report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as &lsquo;top-up' grants.</P>
      <P>The action group considered that the target group of &ldquo;those most in need&rdquo; could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid by virtue of their being in full-time education, that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22.</P>
      <P>The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is, students aged 23 and over but subject to specific conditions, namely: &ndash; (i) he, or she, must qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants, (ii) total reckonable income, in the tax year to 5 April 2001, must not exceed &euro;9,396, £7,400, and (iii) as at 1 April 2001, the applicant's spouse or partner must be in receipt of one of the specified social welfare payments and be in receipt of full-rate qualified adult allowance, or similar entitlement, in respect of the applicant; or the applicant, him or herself, must be in receipt of one of the specified social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>Unemployment assistance payment is not an eligible payment, for the purpose of the special rates of maintenance grant, where the applicant for the special rates grant is him or herself in receipt of the allowance. Those in receipt of unemployment payments from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs may, however, qualify for the back to education allowance, BTEA, the educational opportunities scheme for unemployed people administered by that Department.</P>
      <P>The BTEA is not, under the current criteria, an eligible payment where the applicant for the special rates of maintenance grant is him or herself in receipt of the allowance.</P>
      <P>I have given a commitment that the eligibility criteria for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed with a view to extending eligibility. That review is now under way and a first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in its first year of operation. In this regard, I have already indicated that the scheme will be extended to ensure that additional, suitably qualifying mature students will benefit from the special rates of maintenance grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 759 and 760 together.</P>
      <P>Home tuition services are generally made available to support students who, because of serious medical or other difficulties, are unable to attend school or are absent from school for lengthy periods. The level of support provided in each case is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child. The service can also be made available to children who are absent from school because of delays in arranging a suitable placement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children with visual disabilities can be catered for in special schools, in special dedicated classes attached to ordinary schools or in integrated set<Col N="1439" /> tings where they can be supported by the learning support or resource teacher service.</P>
    <P>All special schools and special classes dedicated to the visually impaired operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio of 8:1 and pupils attending such facilities attract a special increased rate of capitation funding. Children with visual impairment attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis can be supported by the learning support teacher service and the resource teacher service. The level of support provided is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child, including any learning difficulties which the child may be encountering.</P>
    <P>All children with visual impairment also have the support of the visiting teacher service, which includes specialists in visual impairment. The visiting teachers provide tuition in the home for pre-school children from the time of diagnosis. The service also supports students with visual impairment at first, second and third level. In addition to providing advice and support to students, parents and schools, the visiting teachers make recommendations to my Department to address any special learning difficulties which may require attention. The visiting teachers also make recommendations on any special equipment needs which may arise in respect of individual pupils. My Department provides funding to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers, braillers, radio aids etc., where recommended by the visiting teacher service. Due to the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
    <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is being extended or refurbished as part of the Government's programme and is currently in architectural planning. The project will continue to the preparation of tender documents and the invitation of tenders, as soon as possible, under the expanded building programme.</P>

      <P>Following the recent resignation of the psychologist in the National Educational Psychological Service Agency with responsibility for the service to children with visual impairment, NEPS has now re-organised this service. Two psychologists have taken on the lead responsibility for the co-ordination of the service and have recently visited the school attended by the named person. One of these psychologists will, in the near future, arrange an investigation of the person's needs.</P>

      <P>The higher diploma in education programme is a one year full-time post-graduate qualification programme, which represents the principal entry route to second-level teaching. The programme is currently offered in universities in Cork, Galway, Maynooth and Dublin. Further dedicated undergraduate post-primary teaching programmes are also offered at the University of Limerick. Entry to the higher diploma in education programme is subject to an entry quota, the setting of which is monitored on an ongoing basis by my Department and the Higher Education Authority. There are currently 1,000 places available on the programme, including 40 places on the higher diploma in education programme offered through the medium of Irish in NUI, Galway. This provision is considered suitable to meet the current needs.</P>

      <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions. These are as follows: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1454" />The statutory framework for the higher education grants schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. It is the local authorities which, on behalf of my Department, administer the schemes, which are reviewed annually by my Department. The VEC scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered, on behalf of my Department, by the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>All three schemes have broadly similar provisions relating, for example, to age, residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
    <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired.</P>
    <P>With regard to the person referred to by the Deputy, County Cork VEC recently contacted my Department to inquire about his eligibility under the terms of the VEC scholarship scheme 1997. My Department has issued a letter advising County Cork VEC in this regard. The VEC will, in turn, contact the student directly in the matter.</P>
    <P>If an applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she or he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    <P>Where an applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>It is not open to me or my Department to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1455" />The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution. It provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain in college. I significantly increased the provision for this fund from &euro;2.49 million, or £1.964 million, in respect of the 2000-01 academic year to &euro;7.49 million, or £5.9 million, in respect of the 2001-02 academic year.</P>

      <P>My Department's established position in the matter has been to approve the allocation, on an ex-quota basis, of a post of chaplain to deed of trust type community schools and colleges which arise from amalgamations and greenfield developments. The deeds of trust for such schools specifically provide for the appointment of a chaplain on an ex-quota basis. At present there is no provision for the allocation of a post of chaplain in the case of schools like Scariff, where it is understood there is no deed of trust involved.</P>

      <P>My Department was not aware of the case referred to by the Deputy. Inquiries by the SWAHB to my Department were of a general nature and were not specific to the child referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of <Col N="1456" /> schools and my Department does not interfere in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. This may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
    <P>The national educational psychological service is available to all post-primary schools recognised by my Department. NEPS can advise on the management of any difficulties that pupils might experience and which may present problems in a school setting. Where appropriate it can also advise on any educational supports which might be required to ensure that a pupil's time in school is as productive and positive as possible.</P>
    <P>The home tuition scheme operated by my Department seeks to ensure that a pupil who cannot attend school at a particular juncture continues to receive a certain level of educational provision. The scheme allows for the provision of up to nine hours one-to-one tuition per week, which is generally provided in the child's home. Home tuition is not offered as an alternative to mainstream education, rather it is meant to ensure the continuation of a certain level of education during the period that a suitable full-time school placement is being sought.</P>
    <P>In order to progress this case further a questionnaire has issued to the child's mother which will help identify his educational needs and provide my Department with her written permission to contact schools and NEPS on behalf of this child.</P>

      <P>With effect from 1996, the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states. Prior to this grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in the Republic and Northern Ireland. In this context it was agreed that students pursuing approved courses in other EU member states, including in Northern Ireland, would be paid the value of the grants in the currency of the country in which they were studying and that the value of the maintenance grant to be paid in all circumstances would be the Irish value converted to the currency of the country in which the student is pursuing his or her course.</P>
      <P>In December 1999, in response to a number of representations, local authorities and vocational education committees were advised that grant-holders should be given the option of having their grant paid either in Irish punts or in the currency of the country in which they are studying. This concession allowed students studying in Northern Ireland or the UK to receive their grants in Irish punts and, since January in euro, rather than sterling if they so wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is satisfied that the current arrangements are equitable and efficient. While the exchange rate difficulties with sterling are appreciated, my Department is not in a position to supplement grant aid for students pursuing courses in the United Kingdom. Such an <Col N="1458" /> approach could well give rise to anomalies and to claims of inequitable treatment between students studying in different countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students which is administered by the local authorities and the vocational education committees. These are as follows: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; and the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses at undergraduate or postgraduate level for the first time are eligible for maintenance grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of the third level maintenance grant schemes, a mature student is defined as a person of not less than 23 years of age on 1 January in the year of entry to the third level institution.</P>
      <P>Under the free fees initiative my Department meets the tuition fees of eligible students attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration.</P>
      <P>Students studying at postgraduate level may apply for financial assistance under two of the maintenance grant schemes: the higher education grants scheme and the VEC scholarship scheme.</P>
      <P>Maintenance grants are payable at either adjacent or non-adjacent rates. The adjacent rate of grant is payable where the grantholder's residence is 15 miles or less from the college being attended. The non-adjacent rate of grant is payable in all other cases. The adjacent and non-adjacent rate of grant for the current academic year is &euro;2,390 and &euro;956, respectively.</P>
      <P>From 1999-2000, as part of a funding initiative at third level, the higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is paid to all eligible mature students, irrespective of distance from college.</P>
      <P>I have introduced special rates of maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grantholders with effect from the 2000-01 academic year. Recently I announced that the special rates of grant will be available to mature students, that is, students aged 23 and over, subject to specific conditions, from Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given a commitment that the eligibility criteria for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed with a view to extending eligibility. That review is now under way and a first step will be to assess the coverage and effective<Col N="1459" /> ness of the implementation of the special rates in its first year of operation. In this regard, I have already indicated that the scheme will be extended to ensure that additional, suitably qualifying mature students will benefit from the special rates of maintenance grant.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund.

      <P>The admission of students to a university is a matter for the university concerned. I understand from inquiries made by the Higher Education Authority that in the case of University College Dublin, the minimum entry requirement for applicants from the USA is a scholastic aptitude test score of 1,000 combined with a grade point average of 3.0 in a school leaving or third level examination. In the case of Trinity College Dublin applicants from the USA are required to have a minimum SAT score of 1,300. Both universities may also consider applicants with other qualifications from the US such as the advanced placement examination or the American college testing programme, subject to a minimum standard being achieved in those qualifications. These are the minimum requirements for entry to the universities concerned and higher levels of attainment may be required depending on the specific programme applied for.</P>

      <P>The National Educational Psychological Service Agency, NEPS, has completed its analysis of the needs of St. Killian's special school for educational psychological support. Members of the NEPS management team have since visited the school and discussed the outcomes of the survey <Col N="1471" /> with the school principal and representatives of the parents. Priorities for action have now been agreed. It is clear from the survey findings that the children in the school have complex needs and that many of them require support from both clinical and educational psychologists.</P>
      <P>NEPS has not provided a service to this school in the past because it has had access since its establishment to a psychological service provided by a voluntary body under the aegis of the Southern Health Board. This service was withdrawn on a temporary basis, beginning in September 2001, due to the resignation of a member of staff. At that stage, all NEPS psychologists had been assigned to schools, so it was not immediately possible to provide a replacement service to this school. However, a recruitment competition for additional psychologists for NEPS is now nearing completion and it is expected that a number of appointments will be made to the Southern Region.</P>
      <P>NEPS is also liaising with the voluntary body with the aim of eventually providing a joint clinical/educational psychological service to the school. I am hopeful that it will not be too long before this school will have access to full educational and clinical psychological services. Meanwhile, it may avail of my Department's scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, full details of which are available from NEPS or from my Department's website.</P>

      <P>The requirement in relation to Irish should be seen in the broader context of the requirements in relation to the curriculum to be followed in post-primary schools and to subjects to be studied as part of the junior certificate and leaving certificate courses. These are set out in rules and programme for secondary schools which aim to ensure adequate breadth and balance in the education that pupils receive.</P>
      <P>The curriculum of a secondary school must include instruction in a syllabus approved by the Minister in a number of subjects, one of which is Irish. Irish is one of a number of subjects that must be included in the approved course for recognised junior cycle pupils. In the case of the established leaving certificate, the approved course for recognised senior cycle pupils must include not less than five subjects from a specified list, one of these must be Irish. The study of Irish is one of a number of requirements that apply in the case of the leaving certificate vocational programme and the leaving certificate applied.</P>

      <P>As a rule post-primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible pupil will have more than two miles to travel to a pick-up point. Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route. Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the school transport scheme as the cost involved on a countrywide level would be prohibitive.</P>
      <P>The Department strives to provide an efficient service in the most cost effective manner. Should a service happen to pass a pupil's home, this is due to a purely fortuitous set of circumstances and is not a requirement under the scheme. The position in this case is that the pupils concerned reside 1.3 miles or less from an existing pick up point on the current route of service. This is considered to be a satisfactory level of service in the context of the general operation of the scheme. As extra cost would be incurred in re-routing the service as requested and as three eligible pupils could not be catered for as a result of the proposed re-routing the present arrangement is the most that may be offered.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, in 1998 a small number of girls from the Kinvara catchment area, who would not ordinarily qualify for transport to another catchment area, were allowed board the bus at the same point as their brothers who had a full transport entitlement to the Gort school, provided no extra State cost was involved. This was done in the unusual circumstances where members of the same household were appropriate to separate catchment areas on the basis of their gender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar circumstance did not exist in respect of girls from the Gort area who wished to travel to the Kinvara school. In their case there was no question of members of the same household being appropriate to different catchment areas. In addition, there was no existing service to accommodate such pupils. The establishment of a new service would have been an extra cost to the <Col N="1480" /> State. It would also have been a clear infringement of the catchment boundary system, in the absence of the agreement of both schools to a single catchment area. In these circumstances, the most that could be offered to these pupils was catchment boundary facilities from the nearest pick up point in the Kinvara area, provided there was spare accommodation on the bus.</P>
    <P>The management authorities of the Gort school have again been asked to consider the question of having a single catchment area to include post-primary schools in Kinvara and Gort. The result of this would be to allow pupils enrol in either school and once they were three miles from the school of attendance, they would be eligible for school transport. This would resolve the transport problem for pupils who wish to attend either centre under the school transport scheme. The matter will be examined again in the light of the response from the Gort school.</P>

This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997.

      <P>Applications for improved accommodation or other capital works have been received from the majority of the primary schools in County Galway.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My approach in relation to the value of the maintenance grants has been to increase the level of grants annually at least in line with inflation. Last June, in line with this policy, I approved increases of 6% in the rates of maintenance grant. The reference value for inflation is the annual percentage increase in the consumer price index to mid-February. The increase of 6% in grant rates for 2001-02 was higher than the reference value, which was 5.3%.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the practice in recent years has been to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. I approved an increase of 6.5% in the reckonable income limits for the 2001-02 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1999 to March 2000, which was 5.9%. I also increased by 6.5% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.</P>
      <P>On my initiative a special project team is carrying out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants and other student supports to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review includes the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. Some of these topics are, of their nature, complex and require detailed research. As part of the review, the Economic and Social Research Institute was commissioned to undertake research on the effect of changes in the income thresholds and on related matters. The report's findings have informed the work of the project team and drafting of the team's report is now being finalised. Issues relating to the implementation of the team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already introduced special rates of maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders with effect from the 2000-01 academic year. The rates are &euro;3,809 &ndash; £3,000 &ndash; for students residing over 15 miles from the college attended and &euro;1,535 &ndash; £1,200 &ndash; for students residing less than 15 miles from the college <Col N="1482" /> attended. These increased rates of grant will be a powerful incentive to eligible students to enter third level and to complete their studies in the knowledge that additional financial assistance will be available to them.</P>

      <P>A number of improvements were put in place in 2001.

The number of eligible primary pupils required to establish a new school bus service has been reduced from ten to seven. All school transport vehicles now have a communication system on board. The scope of the remote area grants, payable to pupils in certain circumstances, has been extended and the rate of grant payable has been increased. The travelling and waiting time for post-primary pupils has been reduced from three to 2.5 hours. Where feasible, students who are on the early pick-up from their homes are the first to be dropped home in the evening and vice versa.</P>

      <P>An application for recognition as a national school has been received in respect of Gaelscoil Nás na Riogh, which it is proposed will open in September next. The application is currently under consideration in my Department's planning section and the promoters will be advised of the outcome in due course.</P>
      <P>In most cases, schools must undergo a period of provisional recognition, during which the operation of the school and the growth of pupil numbers are monitored. During that period, it is the responsibility of the school patron to provide interim accommodation. This accommodation must be capable of fully meeting the needs of the developing school until permanent recognition has been secured and the Department is in a position to acquire a site and provide a permanent school building.</P>

      <P>My Department's records indicate from the most recent correspondence received from the INTO that four schools in County Kildare were considered by that organisation as having substandard accommodation. My records also show that, since 1996, over 165 schools nationally have been listed by the INTO. Many of these schools have received substantial grant-aid from my Department and a number are currently in architectural planning.</P>
      <P>The criteria used in determining which schools are listed by the INTO are unclear and seem to have been applied in an arbitrary fashion. It is not clear, from the information supplied by the INTO, who compiles the reports and the level of technical input, if any, involved in the assessments. All of these cases are being considered by my Department and work on some is either completed or under way.  The primary school building programme is based on the prioritising of needs on a fair and rational basis. My Department must respond to the need for schools in rapidly developing areas, to the particular needs of schools in areas of social disadvantage, to the accommodation needs of schools catering for children with special needs and to the need for building works to facilitate development through amalgamation.</P>

      <Quest>the payments which have been made to each second level school in County Kilkenny in respect of substitution and supervision arising from the teachers' dispute.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Officials of my Department held discussions with the representatives of the managerial authorities in the second level sector, in order to ensure that schools would remain open when the ASTI directive to its members to withdraw from voluntary supervision and substitution duties took effect on 4 March 2002.</P>
      <P>Arising from these discussions a contingency plan was prepared and agreed between my Department and the managerial authorities. As part of the contingency arrangements, my Department undertook to resource schools in order that they could employ staff to provide supervision and thereby remain open. In addition, my Department undertook to recoup the cost to the management authorities in advertising for, recruiting and training personnel to provide supervision services in schools on a temporary contractual basis.</P>
      <P>Supervisors who contracted for delivery of supervision services are being remunerated at a daily contract rate of &euro;68.56, £54, based on a minimum of two hours' supervision. Where further supervision above these two hours is required this is being remunerated at &euro;34.28, £27, per additional hour. This is the equivalent to the hourly rate offered to teachers.</P>
      <P>To put schools in funds for the purposes of the contingency arrangements, an initial payment was made to schools by my Department on 28 February 2002, and was based upon six weeks of the annual grant, calculated on the basis of &euro;1,270, £1,000, per whole-time equivalent teacher post per annum, with a stipulation that further payments of the grant will be made to schools at the appropriate stages of the contingency. In addition, funding was provided to cover employers PRSI, holiday pay and administrative costs. In aggregate, the sum dispersed to schools was approximately &euro;7 million, £5.5 million. I am not in a position at present to provide the Deputy with details of funding provided to schools in County Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>The contingency plan acknowledges that supplementary allocations may need to be made to some schools at a later stage if their approved outgoings are greater than the amount of the grant. Accordingly, the final costs are not yet available.</P>
      <P>The joint managerial body, JMB, placed advertisements on behalf of the managerial authorities in the national media over the weekend of the 16-17 February. In addition, the JMB organised training on a regional basis and operated a telephone help-line for schools. My Department has recouped &euro;114,258.47, £89,985.86, to the JMB to offset the cost of providing these services to date. The current position is that the INTO has accepted my Department's proposals for payment on the basis of &euro;34.28 per hour. The TUI and ASTI have rejected them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ASTI issued a directive to their members to withdraw from supervision and substitution with effect from 4 March 2002. The directive <Col N="1492" /> applies to supervision at break times and before and after school and to substitution by permanent teachers for absent colleagues.</P>
    <P>On Friday, 15 February the ASTI made a new set of demands in relation to supervision and substitution. These were a minimum annual rate of &euro;2,500; that it be pensionable; available to existing pensioners in compensation for having done this for free over a number of years; that it be within the 22 hours weekly maximum teaching time.</P>
    <P>I met with the three teacher unions on 28 February 2002. I indicated that the Government is not opposed to the pensionability of supervision payments. In that regard I offered to enter into a process at the end of the current school year to work out the details of an arrangement which would be consistent with the requirements for pensionability. I also indicated that the procedures provided by the conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers should be used to deal with the issue of an appropriate payment rate for supervision. These procedures include independent arbitration where the parties cannot agree.</P>
    <P>My approach was welcomed by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation and the Teachers' Union of Ireland but rejected by the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland. The ASTI central executive has since decided not to enter into any further negotiations on this matter pending the settlement of their pay claim.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the Teachers' Conciliation Council on 12 March, the TUI and INTO requested that further discussions take place on the issue of supervision and substitution. These discussions will commence shortly with the assistance of a facilitator. The ASTI has taken the view that they are not prepared to deal with this issue within the teachers' conciliation and arbitration scheme, which is the agreed industrial relations forum for processing these matters.</P>

      <P>An interim report and recommendations prepared by consultants was presented to the PLC Review Group on Friday 15 March, 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main features of the recommendations are a reduction in class contact hours for PLC staff from 22 to 18 per week to allow time for other essential duties &ndash; marketing, recruitment, guidance, module/curriculum development, and assessment under the NCVA/FETAC system; establishment of a new management structure &ndash;<Col N="1500" /> to replace the ordinary school one &ndash; for colleges with large PLC provision with the inclusion of new professional grades and specialist administration posts. The aim is to build up a strong top management and middle management team in the large colleges, with recommendations being made based on centre size; provision of central and regional support services for industry liaison, quality assurance and ICT development, and enhancements in capital and ICT infrastructures.</P>
    <P>The recommendations are predicated on a new contract for staff which would clearly specify the non-class duties which must be carried out. The implementation of the report on a phased basis, and associated industrial relations issues, are matters to be negotiated in the normal way between the Department, and the relevant union and management bodies, taking full account of available resources, competing demands for funds and the potential impact on other levels of the system. Arrangements to circulate the report will be made shortly. A copy of the report will be forwarded to the Deputy for her information.</P>

It is a matter for each vocational education committee to deploy resources in the best possible manner so as to meet the needs of individual schools. However, pending a consideration of the report of the PLC Review Group, my Department has given sanction to City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee for the appointment of two IT technicians on a temporary basis for one year. The Department has also agreed to extend the appointment of a system analyst-programmer, grade V, for a further period not exceeding six months. It is a matter for the VEC to deploy these resources in accordance with its own needs and priorities.</P>

      <P>An application for capital funding from St. George's national school, was received in the planning and building unit of my Department in <Col N="1503" /> July last. The application is being considered in the context of an overall review of primary educational provision in the Balbriggan area taking into account all relevant factors, i.e. enrolment trends in this school and neighbouring schools, demographic trends, housing developments, and birth and baptism statistics for the parish. As soon as this review is complete decisions will be made on how best to address any emerging needs and my officials will be in contact with the relevant school authorities.</P>

      <Quest>the precise criteria that are used in deciding on the appointment of a resource teacher; the precise criteria that apply in deciding to put in place a special class in a primary school; the range of needs which can be provided by a resource teacher; the range of needs that can be provided in a special class; his views on the appropriateness of the present number of special classes being provided in the system compared to the number of children who are being supported through resource teachers; and the trends in these provisions in the past five years.</Quest>

      <P>The resource teacher service supports children with special educational needs attending school on fully integrated basis. The level of resource teacher support provided in any case is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child and reflects the special pupil teacher ratio applicable to the particular disability involved. Resource teacher support can be allocated on a full-time or part-time basis depending on the level of need and the number of pupils involved. Resource teachers cater for children across the spectrum of special needs provided the children are capable of attending school on an integrated basis.</P>
      <P>Special classes can be established where there are a sufficient number of children in an area who have been assessed as requiring such a service. The number of children involved will vary depending on the disability category. For example, in the case of children with autism a special class caters for a maximum of six pupils whereas a special class for children with a mild general learning disability will cater for up to 11 pupils. In establishing special classes regard is also had to the availability of suitable school accommodation and the home locations of the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resource teachers support the ordinary class teachers in catering for the special educational needs of children with disabilities. For example, assessing and recording needs and progress; setting specific, time-related targets for each child and agreeing these with the class teacher and principal; direct teaching of the children, either in a separate room or within the mainstream class; <Col N="1504" /> advising class teachers in regard to adapting the curriculum, teaching strategies, suitable textbooks, use of information technology and suitable software, meeting and advising parents, accompanied by the class teacher, as necessary and a range of other related matters.</P>
    <P>Special classes are established for children with special educational needs arising from the following disabilities: visual impairment, hearing impairment, mild general learning disability, moderate general learning disability, severe-profound general learning disability, emotional disturbance, autism/autistic spectrum disorders, physical disability, multiple disabilities, specific learning disability, specific speech and language disorder. There are approximately 600 special classes in the system at present.</P>
    <P>My policy is to ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special needs into ordinary mainstream schools. However, the model of response provided is largely based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child and the wishes of the child's parents. In the case of pupils with significant special needs, special class provision is often the required response.</P>
    <P>Since 1999 children with special educational needs in primary schools now have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs irrespective of their level of need or location. The impact of this decision is reflected in the fact that the number of resource teachers supporting children in integrated settings has increased from 104 to approximately 1,600 whole-time equivalent resource teachers at present. Over the same period, the number of special needs assistants supporting children with disabilities in the primary system has increased from approximately 300 to 3,000.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the unprecedented level of development in special education services undertaken by this Government will ensure that all children with special needs receive the support they require.</P>

      <P>The number of full psychological assessments carried out by the National Educational Psychological Service varies considerably from year to year due to the rapid rate of expansion of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1505" />The casework statistics for the school year 2000-01 are shown below. During the course of that school year, the number of NEPS psychologists working in the schools almost doubled, and is now standing at almost half the ultimate target. The number of psychologists in NEPS will again increase in the near future as a further recruitment competition is nearing completion. It is hoped to make a substantial number of appointments during this year. As I have said, therefore, the number of assessments per year is not particularly meaningful during this phase of marked expansion.</P>
    <P>In addition to those children who receive individual psychological assessments, considerable numbers are helped indirectly by NEPS psychologists through consultations with teachers and parents, advice to schools on general issues relevant to psychology and particularly on the promotion of good mental health.</P>
    <P>The planning group that reported in 1998 on the need for a national educational psychological service estimated that approximately 11% of children would need psychological intervention at some stage in their school career, although not all of these would need individual psychological assessments. This estimate seems to have been confirmed by a survey that was conducted in primary schools in County Monaghan during the year 2000.</P>
    <P>During the summer of 2001, I announced the allocation of funding for a scheme for commissioning psychological assessments. This scheme is an interim measure intended to meet current urgent needs for psychological advice pending the expansion of NEPS to all schools. Its purpose is to ensure that children who may have special educational needs may be facilitated to obtain extra resources that may be necessary without undue delay. Schools that do not yet have access to the service provided by NEPS may commission psychological assessments under this scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department has approved in principle the provision of a PE hall with a floor area of 608m² plus ancillary accommodation at Scoil Mhuire Gan Smál, Blarney, County Cork. The management authority of the school is proposing to build a larger hall and fund the extra cost. The stage four-five &ndash; detailed design and Bill of Quantities &ndash; submission for the project has been <Col N="1511" /> received and is currently being examined by officials of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of allowing the project to proceed <Col N="1512" /> to stage six &ndash; tender action and report &ndash; will be considered when this examination is completed and a decision will be conveyed to the school authorities as soon as possible.</P>
