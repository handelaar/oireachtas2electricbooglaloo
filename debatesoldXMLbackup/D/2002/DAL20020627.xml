      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with four different topics. I propose to deal with these topics separately and will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. In regard to the first topic, I received notice from Deputy Cowley and ask him to state the matter.</P>

      <P>I seek leave to move the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise the matter of the delay in issuing the preliminary findings of the Government feasibility study into the establishment of an all-Ireland helicopter emergency medical service which is urgently needed. There is continuing unnecessary loss of life, especially of young people, due to road accidents and other causes due to the lack of such a service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the House under Standing Order 31 to discuss a mater of urgent national importance, namely, the decision by the board of the Railway Procurement Agency to seek the appointment of a banker as its chief executive officer, in light of the fact that when the board advertised the position it sought an individual with an excellent track record in delivering engineering projects. There is an urgent need for the Minister for Transport to make a statement to the House clarifying this apparent contradiction and outlining the procedures surrounding this key decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, there are two supplementary Order Papers which have not issued to Members of the House. It is normal practice to issue Order Papers to us and there are two supplementary Orders Papers concerning 22<i>c</i> and 22<i>d</i> which have not issued. We should have them before the Order of Business commences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood they were circulated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>No. We received only one sheet telling us there were two supplementaries. I am very particular about these matters. Come back Deputy Brennan, all is forgiven.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 22<i>b</i>, motion re Appointment of Select Committee on European Affairs; No. 22<i>c</i> on the supplementary Order Paper, motion re Appointment of members to Committee on Procedure and Privileges and Select Committee on European Affairs; No. 22<i>d </i>on the supplementary Order Paper, motion re Sittings and Business of the Dáil; No. <i>a</i>1, Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Performance of Certain Functions) Bill, 2002 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Second and Remaining Stages; No. 7, Arts Bill, 2002 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; and No. 8, Railway Safety Bill, 2001 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 22<i>b</i>, 22<i>c</i> and 22<i>d</i> shall <Col N="1559" /> be decided without debate; the Second and Remaining Stages of No. <i>a</i>1 shall be taken today and the following arrangements shall apply: Second Stage to conclude within 90 minutes, if not previously concluded; Committee and Remaining Stages to conclude within 30 minutes, if not previously concluded; and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion by one question in each case which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <P>There are two proposals before the House. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 22<i>b</i>, motion re Appointment of Select Committee on European Affairs; No. 22<i>c </i> on the supplementary Order Paper, motion re Appointment of members to Committee on Procedure and Privileges and Select Committee on European Affairs, and No. 22<i>d</i> on the supplementary Order Paper, motion re Sittings and Business of the Dáil, agreed to?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>As we speak, the Forum on Europe in Dublin Castle is hearing the Taoiseach dealing with the contents of the Referendum Bill. It is important we make a point and, for that reason, I object to the proposal. Dáil Éireann is where the contents of the Bill should be outlined. It is another blow to the accountability of this House that we have to wait until the Dáil rises to see the content of legislation which ought to be before the House today to allow the people's representatives debate the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to specifically focus on No. 22<i>d ,</i>motion re Sittings and Business of the Dáil. I note on the Order Paper that the sittings scheduled for 4, 5, 10 and 11 September will be for the purposes of taking the Twenty-sixth Amendment to the Constitution Bill, 2002 which is in effect the Nice treaty referendum mark II, though without change.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the business of addressing this issue on 4 September will not allow for the presentation, in equal measure, of the case opposing the proposition for the adoption of the Nice treaty in a second referendum. The order for taking speakers will apply in 30 minute segments to each of the Government parties, Fine Gael and the Labour Party. The other parties in the House, which have been the spearhead of opposition to Nice, will be apportioned opportunities to contribute in 20 minute slots, as the debate proceeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, the Standing Order states that Members may make a brief comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a brief comment and I will conclude, therefore, in line with the <Col N="1560" /> wishes of the Ceann Comhairle, by stating that it is absolutely wrong that the arguments in relation to Nice at the commencement of this debate do not accommodate in equal measure the representatives of those who articulated the No position in the referendum on Nice that has already been won by that view. It is unacceptable that our position would be confined to a later opportunity in the debate. We have the right to have our position heard early and in equal measure because we represent that significant section of the electorate who already made the decision on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that we were taking Nos. 22<i>b</i> and 22<i>c</i>. However, if we are taking No. 22<i>d</i> I wish to raise two points with the Tánaiste.</P>
      <P>The House and the media were given to understand, although to the Taoiseach the record is quite clear that his comments were conditional, that the Dáil would return the week after next to discuss the Ansbacher report. The Supplementary Order Paper does not provide for that and I want the Tánaiste to indicate if the Dáil, contrary to what the Taoiseach previously stated, will not be recalled for a day. In fairness to the Taoiseach, the record gives him, in his traditional way and in terms of the small print, a way out.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party understood that when the Dáil is recalled in September it could possibly take the European Union Bill or a Government alternative to it. The explicit Order Paper now before us confines the House exclusively to taking certain legislation and not dealing with any other item which may arise. I refer specifically here to the European Union Bill. Before we agree to the proposal I would like the Tánaiste to clarify the position because the failure to debate the Ansbacher report and the confinement or exclusion of the European Union Bill are unsatisfactory from our point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Sargent, the Taoiseach will not be dealing with the contents of the Bill in his address to the Forum on Europe this morning.</P>
      <P>It is the case that if the Whips of the Opposition parties wish the Dáil to be recalled to discuss the Ansbacher report, the Government will be happy to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>If the parties, having read the report next week, wish to have the Dáil recalled the following week &ndash; as the Taoiseach stated, it is a long report and to be fair to everybody it would not be possible&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will, as the Taoiseach has already stated, facilitate that request. In relation to the European Union Bill&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The Committee on European Affairs, which is being established today, will discuss the European Union Bill during the summer recess. However, the Government will not be in a position to discuss the Bill during the recall of the Dáil in early September which is solely for the purpose of debating the Referendum Bill.</P>
      <P>I wish to inform Deputy Ó Caoláin that the matter of ordering speakers is one to be dealt with by the House under Standing Orders. However, since up to 90% of Members represent the Yes side&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not agreed to. I received a phone call from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government indicating this Bill was being introduced, but I have yet to find any time being made available in this debate for parties other than the larger parties. It is important that each party is represented. This Bill covers the transfer of functions from the old Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. There is an intrinsic conflict of interest when Dúchas will be in the same Department as that with responsibility for incinerators. It is important that we address the issue fully and that all Members and parties are able to articulate their views on it.</P>

      <P>There is no provision for time for the smaller parties or Independents to participate in the Second Stage debate on this Bill. The provision of 90 minutes for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Performance of Certain Functions) Bill, 2002 does not accommodate us. That is not just speculative. I sought the time, but was advised this morning that no time would be available, as it is not provided. As a Member of this House representative of a small party which wishes to participate, I protest in the strongest manner and the only way I can present that is in opposing the proposition, which is clearly discriminatory.</P>

The Government has made a very bad decision in severely guillotining Bills at this very early stage in the life of a new Dáil when we have a long legislative period before us during which Bills can be fully discussed. To bring in such a measure in a way that excludes people from particular parties and groups of Deputies is unacceptable.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We now move on to leaders' questions. I call Deputy Hogan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The new motoring survey reveals that insurance costs have risen by 10% for the second year in a row. That provides more evidence that the Government has lost control of price increases in the economy. People who depend on car transport every day are being hit with cost increases which are twice the recorded rate of inflation. The AA report also reveals that the cost of car insurance rose by an incredible 25% last year. That supports the findings of the recent motor insurance report that many motorists are being overcharged for insurance. Given that the Government's commitment to implement the MIAB report does not include a timescale, will the Tánaiste give us a deadline for action on these important recommendations? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate the Tánaiste is taking the Order of Business because this matter is directly within the remit of the responsibilities of her Department. Will she clearly outline the work done to date to implement the excellent report referred to by Deputy Hogan which was prepared <Col N="1567" /> by Dorothea Dowling? Will she outline the steps which will be taken by her Department to reduce the outrageous cost of insurance? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report referred to by Deputy Hogan. The last Government established an implementation group to implement the recommendations of the MIAB report. That implementation group will report on 24 July, which is a couple of weeks from now. In advance of that, a memorandum has been circulated to Departments in recent days to establish the personal injuries assessment board, which will go a long way to reducing the cost of claims. Approximately 40% of the cost of taking a claim is accounted for by expert witnesses and legal fees. The measures the Government have put in place in relation to the implementation of the MIAB report will help to get a speedy decision from the Government. We hope to be in a position soon to make the type of decisions necessary to reduce the cost not only of motor insurance but of public and employers' liability insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach said the Government would tackle rising inflation by introducing more competition. That has been neglected over the past five years. Can the Tánaiste tell the House what specific action is being planned by the Government in this regard and what sectors will be affected? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Taoiseach was talking about the selective leaking of the Forfás report, which dealt with one aspect of the report. Yesterday's report did not mention the fact that we are the third best paid in Europe after tax, which is relevant. The Government is committed to introducing competition in every sector. We now have regulators in regulated markets to ensure fair access on reasonable terms. However, I am not in a position to say what the Government will do on the basis of the Forfás report because it has not yet gone to Government. It will go to it quickly and we will take seriously the conclusions of the authors of the report in terms of the obstacles in the economy to competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Government aware that a new principle of apartheid is being introduced into our health system with respect to accident and emergency services? A memo recently prepared in St. Vincent's Hospital, which is a voluntary hospital but which receives substantial public funds, states:</P>
      <P>Please note that, following discussions at the Bed Management Committee, Executive Committee of Medical Board and Hospital Executive Council, a decision has been taken to designate St. Clare's Ward as a 15 bed seven day unit for Accident and Emergency patients with priority being given to patients with private health insurance cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1568" /> Is the Tánaiste aware of the extension of the apartheid system to our accident and emergency services where previously there was not any distinction between public and private patients? This memo relates to a special ward rather than to the unit, but the principle has been introduced. Has that been done with the expressed consent of the Government? How does the Government reconcile that practice, which is part funded by the taxpayer, with its commitment to the health strategy?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that people's illnesses are not taken into account, but that the strength of their bank balance is more important in terms of getting access to health care. To improve access to primary care, will the Tánaiste indicate if the Government has any plans to review the decision not to increase income limits for medical card patients in view of the fact that single people who earn more than &euro;133 and married couples with two children who earn more than &euro;238 are not entitled to a medical card? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that people have access to health care on the basis of medical need, not financial means. The adoption by the last Government of the health strategy was done with that in mind. The ratio of public to private beds in hospitals in recent years, which should be 80:20, had gone to 71:29.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 50:50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>That is unacceptable and the health strategy was devised with a view to bringing the balance back to where it should be, which was agreed under the common contract. I am not familiar with the details of the memo read by Deputy Quinn. The management of a hospital on a day to day basis is a matter for that hospital. We are all concerned to ensure that anyone who comes to a hospital as an accident and emergency case is dealt with on the basis of their need and not on any other basis. That strategy is being pursued.</P>
      <P>As regards the medical card guidelines, the medical card was extended substantially over the lifetime of the last Government. A high proportion of people have medical cards. In accordance with the financial situation, it is the Government's determination to ensure that those at the bottom in our society not only have a medical card but have access to a good health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept that the day to day management of any institution, including hospitals, must rest primarily with those responsible for that management, the Minister for Health and Children has both political and statutory responsibility and power to issue guidelines to the management of all such medical institutions. I ask the Tánaiste, in light of this revelation, to raise this matter with the Minister for <Col N="1569" /> Health and Children. Will she, on behalf of the Government, give an undertaking that guidelines will be issued by the Government on the treatment of patients, particularly accident and emergency patients, and that there will not be any distinction between public and private patients in terms of the way they are treated in any hospital which receives public funds? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I do not know the context in which that letter was circulated, I will not say off the top of my head what the Government may do. I would be surprised if accident and emergency cases at St. Vincent's Hospital or at any other hospital were discriminated against. I will draw the memo read by Deputy Quinn to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business yesterday, the Taoiseach informed Deputy Ó Snodaigh that an order to extend the period of protective rent control would be signed today. Will the Tánaiste confirm that this is being done and will <Col N="1570" /> a copy of the order be laid before the House or made available in the Library? Will the Tánaiste also tell the House if and how the tenants affected by this issue will be informed?

What arrangements will be made to ensure that Deputies will have copies of this report? It is an extremely important report, relating to the greatest health scandal this country has ever known. Many people suffered and died as a consequence of the failure of the system to provide the necessary protection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The tribunal was established by this House and it is my understanding that reports of tribunals are distributed to all Members of the House. While I have no information as to how the tribunal might decide to distribute this particular report, I have no reason to believe they will move away from what is the normal practice in this regard. I will raise the Deputy's query with the appropriate Minister who will, obviously, receive a copy of the report to make sure that Deputies, particularly the Opposition spokespersons, will have copies at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Performance of Certain Functions) Bill, 2002 is to complement the making of a Government order under the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1939, transferring functions relating to heritage matters to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. In announcing the new Government on 6 June, the Taoiseach placed strong and renewed focus on environmental sustainability. Consistent with this approach, the Taoiseach has mandated the Department of the Environment and Local Government with the additional responsibility of protecting our natural heritage and heritage policy generally. This is a timely move, particularly in light of the recent publication of the national heritage plan which my Department will implement in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government.</P>
      <P>There is widespread understanding of what is meant by our national heritage. It includes the natural environment like flora, fauna, wildlife habitats and the built environment such as monuments, archaeology, streetscapes and more. Heritage is valued by the people, not only for its intrinsic value but for its economic, cultural and recreational benefits. The recent publication, for the first time, of a national heritage plan signalled a new and more coherent approach and provides a comprehensive strategy and framework for the protection and management of heritage over the years. The Government policy statement on heritage contained in the plan states that it is an objective of Government to ensure the protection of our heritage and to promote its enjoyment by all. This underscores the recognition which the Government accords to heritage and which is complemented by transferring responsibility to my Department, which of course retains its responsibilities for the complementary areas of protection of the environment, the planning system and local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1576" />It is very appropriate that the Department with responsibility for local government will also take responsibility for heritage matters. Over the past decade the planning process, which is administered by local authorities, has become a central element in the protection of heritage as well as an important instrument for the delivery of sustainable development. Amendments to the planning code in recent years, especially the provisions on protected buildings, have seen significant advances in the protection of heritage. The national heritage plan envisages local authorities taking a more pro-active role in protecting our heritage, especially in broadening involvement at community level in the protection of heritage.</P>
    <P>I should mention that, throughout my speech, I will use the term Dúchas to refer to the division of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, formerly Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, for which I am assuming responsibility. Dúchas is the part of central Government with overall responsibility for preserving the national heritage and promoting public interest in Ireland's rich store of national monuments, protected buildings and ecologically valuable sites. As such it has developed a body of expertise which has been put at the disposal of local authorities, An Bord Pleanála and the Environmental Protection Agency. Under EU and other international law Ireland has certain legal obligations to ensure the protection of our natural and built environment. Dúchas, and now my Department, has a key role in meeting these obligations.</P>
    <P>As the pace of development in this country has increased over the last few years, this role Dúchas plays has become increasingly important if we are to achieve sustainable development. Of course, this role must be carried out in an efficient, open and transparent way. As the House will be aware, there are a number of mechanisms by which Dúchas is involved in the planning and environmental licencing processes. Dúchas is a statutory consultee with local authorities in preparing their development plans and has particular responsibility under the Planning and Development Act, 2000 in respect of recommending structures of special architectural interest for protection through the development plan. This function will dovetail with the traditional function of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in overseeing the development plan process.</P>
    <P>In addition, Dúchas is a statutory consultee in relation to planning applications which may impact upon protected structures, national monuments or other objects of archaeological, geological, scientific, ecological or historical interest, or which may have significant nature conservation effects. Planning applications for the relevant developments are assessed by Dúchas officials who have specific heritage expertise. It is not practical to expect each planning authority to develop the necessary expertise in these matters, as it is more sensible to have the expertise available centrally. This specialist service provided by <Col N="1577" /> Dúchas for local authorities, An Bord Pleanála and the EPA in relation to the protection of our heritage is vital. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure such advice is available from my Department as an input to planning or other licensing processes.</P>
    <P>The Bill will amend the Planning and Development Act, 2000, the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, and the Waste Management Act, 1996, to provide for the performance by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government of the functions transferred from the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, formerly the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The Bill makes an identical technical amendment to one section in each in these Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 30 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, precludes the Minister for the Environment and Local Government from exercising any power or control in regard to any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála is, or may be, concerned. Similarly, section 79 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, and section 60 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, preclude the Minister from exercising any power or control in regard to the performance, in particular circumstances, by the Environmental Protection Agency or a local authority of the functions assigned to it by those Acts.</P>
    <P>The principle that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government must not intervene in individual cases before An Bord Pleanála was enshrined in the planning code at the time when the board was established and the Minister's functions in determining planning appeals were removed. The Minister was, however, given power to issue general policy directives to the board to which it must have regard. However, it was specifically provided that he or she could not exercise power or control with regard to individual cases coming before the board. This was intended to underline the independence of the board in dealing with individual appeals while operating within a general policy framework set out by the Minister. This principle regarding An Bord Pleanála was extended to the determination of planning applications by local authorities in 1982 and restated when the planning code was generally revised and consolidated into the 2000 Act. On the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1992, and when its functions were extended to include responsibilities with regard to waste management in 1996, the same provision was included in the legislation to ensure the independent operation of the EPA.</P>
    <P>This policy of non-intervention and the legislative restriction on involvement by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in individual cases, which all of us would agree has worked well, would not, however, permit the giving by the Department of specialist advice on the natural and built heritage which is such a vital part of the planning and environmental licensing <Col N="1578" /> processes. I am advised that in order to permit the continued exercise of the statutory consultative functions with regard to the built and natural heritage in planning and environmental licensing matters which Dúchas has, new legislation is necessary to disapply the above mentioned sections with regard to the transferred functions only. This is the reason for bringing forward this urgent legislation, otherwise the functions could not have been transferred now or else Dúchas would have to suspend its involvement in planning and environmental licensing until this enabling legislation was passed.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill replaces section 30 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. It restates the restriction on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government exercising power or control with regard to any matter that is, or may be, before a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála. However, with regard to the functions transferred to the Minister from the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs by way of the Government order under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, and only to those, the section disapplies the restriction. As a result, specialist advice on wildlife, built heritage and national monuments protection functions will continue to be available to An Bord Pleanála and the local authorities when the functions are transferred to the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>Section 2 amends section 79 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, which contains a power for the Minister to issue general policy directives to the EPA regarding its environmental licensing functions. Subsection (3) sets out that this power cannot be construed as enabling the Minister to exercise power or control with regard to the exercise of the EPA's functions in particular circumstances. The new subsection (3A) will disapply subsection (3) in so far as it relates to the transferred functions. The same amendment is made in section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act, 1996, which contains a power for the Minister to issue general policy directives to the EPA or local authorities regarding their functions on licensing and managing waste.</P>
    <P>By referring to those powers specifically transferred under the Government order it clearly delimits the areas where the Minister is empowered to intervene in the planning and environmental licensing processes, that is, to the newly transferred powers. I look forward to assuming the new functions, integrating them within the Department of the Environment and Local Government and giving effect to the Taoiseach's wish for a renewed focus on environmental sustainability. In accordance with the Public Service Management Act, my Department will be preparing a new statement of strategy. This will give us the opportunity to set out our enhanced goals for this strengthened Department of the Environment and Local Government which we are creating to promote sustainable development and <Col N="1579" /> improve the quality of life for all. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Planning and Development Act, 2000, the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, and the Waste Management Act, 1996, to facilitate the transfer of heritage functions from the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. While it has been described as a technical Bill, I must record my disquiet that it was published only yesterday. It takes time to consider legislation of this kind and those in my role cannot make any assumptions about whether the Bill is solely technical in nature or whether it will give underlying effects to other legislation. I accept that the Bill must be passed before the Dáil rises for the summer recess, nevertheless, like all legislation, it requires careful scrutiny. Bills dealing with planning and development should receive the maximum scrutiny.</P>
      <P>Section 30 of the Planning and Development Act, 2002, provides that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government shall not exercise any power or control in relation to any case with which a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála is or may be concerned. This provision re-enacts a similar one in planning legislation since the establishment of An Bord Pleanála in 1976. There are identical formulations in environmental law with regard to the EPA and waste licensing.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, now the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, is recognised, both in primary legislation and regulations, as a party to be consulted on individual planning cases where these involve significant issues for nature conservation, habitats and/or built archaeological heritage. The purpose of these provisions is to permit comment or argument by the Minister with regard to the merits of particular planning proposals from these perspectives.</P>
      <P>I have been advised that the Department of the Environment and Local Government sought the advice of the Office of the Attorney General and, on Tuesday, 18 June, the Attorney General confirmed that an order under the Ministers and Secretaries Act was unlikely to be able to resolve this contradiction and that separate legislation was necessary to provide for the kind of influence which Dúchas must continue to exercise in planning cases. This legislation has to be enacted before the Government order transferring the functions is made, otherwise Dúchas will immediately have to suspend its involvement in the planning process. This would have significant implications for current planning applications and appeals to which Dúchas is a party. Since this is an urgent matter I will, despite my reservations, facilitate the passing of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 proposes an amendment of section 30 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, <Col N="1580" /> which places a limitation on ministerial power. It states: &ldquo;Notwithstanding section 28 or 29 . . . the Minister shall not exercise any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or the Board is or may be concerned.&rdquo; Section 2 amends section 79 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, which basically deals with general policy directives. It provides:</P>
    <P>1.&nbsp;The Minister may, whenever he thinks proper, give such general directives in writing to the Agency as to policy in relation to environmental protection.</P>
    <P>2.&nbsp;In performing its functions the Agency shall have regard to any directives given by the Minister under this section.</P>
    <P>3.&nbsp;Nothing in this section shall be construed as enabling the Minister to exercise any power or control in relation to the performance in particular circumstances by the Agency of a function assigned to it by or under this Act.</P>
    <P>4.&nbsp;Where the Minister gives a directive under this section, he shall&ndash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>(a) </i>as soon as may be cause a copy of the directive to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas,</P>
    <P>
      <i>(b) </i>cause a notice of the issue of the directive to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in at least one daily newspaper circulating in the State, and </P>
    <P>
      <i>(c)</i>cause a copy of the directive to be transmitted to the Agency and to each planning authority.</P>
    <P>5.&nbsp;A notice under <i>sub-section (4) (b)</i> shall specify where a copy of the directive to which it relates may be obtained and the fee (if any) payable in respect of such a copy which shall not exceed the reasonable cost of making the copy.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is an amendment of section 60 of the Waste Management Act, 1996 which is a section relating to policy directions by the Minister in relation to waste licensing, the movement of waste and other matters and reads:</P>
    <P>(1) The Minister may, whenever he or she thinks proper, give general directions in writing to the Agency or each local authority as to policy in relation to, as appropriate&mdash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) the making or review of the hazardous waste management plan or a waste management plan,</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) the management of waste recovery or disposal activities carried on otherwise than under a waste licence,</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>) the granting of waste licences,</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>) the performance by the Agency or local authority of its functions under this Act with respect to movements of waste,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1581" />(<i>e</i>) matters related to matters aforesaid.</P>
    <P>(2) In performing its functions under this Act, the Agency or each local authority concerned, as the case may be, shall have regard to any directions given to it by the Minister under this section.</P>
    <P>(3) Save as respects the matters referred to in <i>paragraph (a)</i> thereof, <i>subsection (1)</i> shall not be construed as enabling the Minister to exercise any power or control in relation to the performance in particular circumstances by the Agency or a local authority of a function conferred on it by or under this Act.</P>
    <P>(4) Whenever the Minister gives a direction under this section, he or she shall&ndash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>(a) </i>as soon as may be cause a copy of the direction to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas;</P>
    <P>
      <i>(b) </i>cause a copy of the direction to be transmitted to the Agency or each local authority concerned, as the case may be;</P>
    <P>
      <i>(c) </i>cause to be published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> a notice of the giving of the direction.</P>
    <P>(5) A notice under <i>subsection (4)(c)</i> shall specify where a copy of the direction it which it relates may be obtained and the fee (if any) payable in respect of such a copy (which the Minister is hereby empowered to charge).</P>
    <P>The amendments to the above mentioned sections of the Acts basically do the same thing and disapply the injunction in relation to the Minister intervening in the process either before the planning authority or An Bord Pleanála or, in the case of the Environmental Protection Agency Act and the Waste Management Act, 1996, the EPA, thus allowing Dúchas to continue with the work it has been doing to date.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Waste Management Act, 1996, Dúchas was a statutory consultee and gave its views and comments and, therefore, must be disapplied in this case. This Bill, if enacted, will provide for the transfer of functions to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government from the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs by an order under section 6(1) of the Minister and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1939, entitled &ldquo;Divers Powers of Government in relation to Departments of State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Dúchas must continue to exercise influence in planning cases and needs to be involved in significant issues for nature conservation, habitats and, as I said earlier, built and archaeological heritage. The built, movable and natural heritage is an integral part of our national inheritance. It forms part of our sense of identity and provides us with resources of social, education, recreation and aesthetic value. Dúchas, the heritage service of the Department of Community, Gaeltacht and Rural Affairs, manages the Department's responsibilities under national and European law for the pro<Col N="1582" /> tection of conservation management and presentation of Ireland's natural and built heritage.</P>
    <P>Ireland's built heritage consists of architectural and archaeological elements, both movable and immovable, including gardens and instances of vernacular architecture. The National Monuments Act, 1930-1994, provides a statutory basis for the protection of the built heritage and I know that a range of integrated measures are being implemented to strengthen the protection of our built heritage and this responsibility is carried out in co-operation with local authorities and voluntary groups at national and local level by influencing and implementing statutory responsibilities to protect the architectural and archaeological heritage which is not in the care of the State and by caring for over 700 heritage properties in the ownership of the State.</P>
    <P>The protection of the natural architectural and archaeological heritage is an integral part of the State's responsibilities, requiring co-ordinated effort in many areas. Through developing appropriate policies and legislation, the heritage policy division, I know, contributes to this task. By working on policy documents and legislation, the heritage policy division also ensures heritage is taken into consideration by other Departments or bodies whose work may impact on the natural heritage and provides advice on such matters. Dúchas assists in finalising heads of Bills for legislation before submission for drafting on the natural, architectural and archaeological heritage and it also gives advice on policy and legislative implications of certain cases and issues and ensures heritage input to legislation programmes and policies of other Departments so, therefore, I believe that it is appropriate that this legislation is allowed proceed unhindered by this House.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier in my contribution, we have to deal especially carefully with legislation in relation to planning and development. In that context, I ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, to examine a decision made by the outgoing Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who approved a development scheme for the Spencer Dock in north Dublin. The scheme had been submitted by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and modifications were made to the plan by Deputy Dempsey, including increasing buildings on the north quays by one storey. I find that very strange, particularly in view of the fact that this area was the subject of much controversy with an earlier proposal failing to get acceptance. The general election was held on 17 May and in the interregnum situation on June 5 the Minister approved a scheme endorsing the broad thrust of the DDDA scheme. The Minister said that the modifications he had made included a provision for increasing building height by one storey along North Wall Quay and extending the proposed Station Square southwards to North Wall Quay to embrace the river frontage. He stated that the modifications complemented and strengthened <Col N="1583" /> the planning scheme vision for the development of that area in a way that will provide a solid basis for the attainment of the very high urban design standards that are essential in developing a successful city quarter in the North Lotts area. He said they reflected the importance of the River Liffey to the city's heritage.</P>
    <P>If I apply for a garage to be built on my property I would not expect the person adjudicating on my application to add a four storey house to it. It is strange that a submission made by the DDDA, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, was changed dramatically by the Minister. At whose behest was this done? All information in regard to this decision needs to be made available. I presume it can be obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997. Who lobbied the Minister?</P>
    <P>The DDDA made the submission, but I want to know who lobbied the Minister to make a substantial change to the development, changing the whole facade facing onto the river front?</P>
    <P>Last year the Dublin Docklands Development Authority made a planning scheme known as the Docklands North Lotts Planning Scheme under section 25 of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act, 1997. This planning scheme had been submitted by the authority to the Minister for approval under section 25(4) of that Act.</P>
    <P>As the Minister will be aware, the North Lotts is bounded by campshires on North Wall Quay, East Wall Road, Upper and Lower Sheriff Street and Gill Street and measures just under 81 acres in area. It is strategically located immediately east of the financial centre and extends to the Point Depot. The predominant land use in that area is warehousing, distribution and light industry and there are a number of small but dispersed pockets of residential developments &ndash; that is the important issue. For the purpose of the planning scheme, the area is divided into eight distinctive zones, each with its own distinctive character and ownership patterns.</P>
    <P>I am asking what were the factors and reasons which led a Minister to decide to raise the height of the building by one storey and add to the scheme as I outlined earlier. The Minister owes it to the House to make a full statement on this matter. It bears much on the subject we are discussing. Any legislation dealing with the sensitive matter of planning and development, which has such a history in this country, needs to be scrutinised in a detailed way. I ask the Minister to respond to the request I have made for the factors which influenced the former Minister, Deputy Dempsey, to dramatically change the character of this building in a sensitive residential area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy McManus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this appears to be a simple technical Bill, it has significant ramifications. We respectfully <Col N="1584" /> disagree with the thrust of it, initially with the establishment and separation of Dúchas and of the transfer of it to the Department of the Environment and Local Government <i>per se</i>. I understand what the Minister is doing and the advice he received and I do not disagree with the advice he was given by the Attorney General on the aspects with which he is dealing. However, we thought that in the overall decisions made by the Taoiseach this function should have been left where it was, in an independent area in the Department.</P>
    <P>The Bill is required as a consequence of the announcement made by the Taoiseach on 6 June, when naming his Cabinet, that he was transferring responsibility for heritage policy and Dúchas from the former Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The Taoiseach indicated at that time that responsibility for the management and other operational aspects of our built heritage was being transferred to the Office of Public Works and as a result the Minister would have to bring forward this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined in expansive detail a whole panoply of important functions which Dúchas performs. That is why we disagree and will oppose the Bill on Second Stage. We all know about the importance of the principle established in legislation since the mid-1970s, under the 1976 Act, that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government must not and cannot intervene in individual cases before An Bord Pleanála. Therefore, the Minister effectively has no function, hand, act or part in such appeals and the independent principle is underpinned, paramount and sacrosanct. We all agree with that and the Minister referred to this point in his speech.</P>
    <P>The Minister, however, was given power to issue general policy directives to the board to which it must have regard. I know what the Minister is doing in so far as he wants to incorporate Dúchas to permit the giving of special advice by the Department on the natural and built heritage, a function currently fulfilled by Dúchas. The Minister stated that the transfer Bill will enable Dúchas to participate fully in the exercise of its statutory consultative role. I understand the rationale behind what the Minister is doing but we respectfully disagree with it. It is all right in so far as it goes, but it offends the &ldquo;arms length&rdquo; principle which must underpin everything. I want to make it clear that it is not of the Minister's doing but a direct result of decisions made farther back in the chain to sever the Departments in the manner outlined in the allocation of Government portfolios. The Taoiseach's announcement did not raise much comment at the time, but the very fact that this Bill is now regarded as necessary raises very serious questions about the decision and in particular about whether conflicts of interests may now develop for the Minister for <Col N="1585" /> the Environment and Local Government as a result of the transfer.</P>
    <P>Dúchas is an important body carrying our important functions, which the Minister set out very eloquently. It manages the Department's responsibilities under national and European law for the protection, conservation, management and presentation of Ireland's natural heritage. The national parks and wildlife division is charged with the conservation of a range of ecosystems and populations of flora and fauna in Ireland. The division is responsible for the implementation of a large body of legislation, both domestic, such as the Wildlife Acts &ndash; the Minister is busy already and he has a big role as it stands, but it is going to get bigger &ndash; and international, such as the EU Habitats and Birds Directives, and the management and development of national parks and nature reserves. The development applications section of Dúchas provides an important service in the assessment of the impact of proposed developments on the natural heritage. A particular responsibility of this division is the designation and protection of special areas of conservation, SACs, special protection areas, SPAs, and natural heritage areas. The protection of our heritage is essential not only for our own good as a people, but also to preserve the unique physical qualities of this country which draw so many tourists to our shores.</P>
    <P>However, sometimes there can be conflicts between the need to protect our heritage on the one hand and the demands of development on the other. Recently Dúchas was the subject of criticism from a former Minister and probably from people like myself &ndash; therefore this is not a puritanical view &ndash; regarding concerns they might raise on some particular matter. That illustrates the strong independence which was always evident in Dúchas. Irrespective of our views, Dúchas was always extremely independent.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government will now have responsibility for Dúchas and the Minister also has responsibility for other important areas, including planning and development, housing, environmental services and waste management. This may lead to a conflict of interest for the Minister. He does not have to answer this today but I am raising it for the future &ndash; as a barrister, I always see issues which may arise down the line. One could envisage a situation where the Department of the Environment and Local Government, wearing its waste management hat, might favour the construction of an incinerator in a particular location, but Dúchas might have very legitimate concerns about the impact of such an incinerator on our heritage. A similar issue might arise with a major local authority housing development. I would strongly support such development and would encourage the Minister to get as much money as possible for local authority housing schemes &ndash; no doubt he will. If there were any such conflicts, how would they be resolved?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1586" />Section 60 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, states that the Minister may give general directions to each local authority as to its policy in relation to waste management plans, waste disposal or recovery activities carried out otherwise than under a waste licence and the granting of waste licences. I recall the debate on that Bill, the passage of which took virtually a year. I will never forget it and I would not ask anybody else to go through it.</P>
    <P>Other than in respect of these areas, the Minister is specifically excluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance of powers by the Environmental Protection Agency or local authorities. As a result of this Bill, however, that restriction will now be qualified in regard to the functions transferred to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government from the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs by order. What is more, this applies to any functions carried out by him even before this Act is enacted.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the fact that the Minister informed me that this Bill was being introduced and I am not taking any issue with him in that regard. I suppose I am at an advantage over my colleague in that I have some legal knowledge and I was able to read through this Bill. The Government obviously received advice from the Attorney General and that was forwarded to us through the Chief Whip. The order to which I refer has not yet been made so we still do not know the extent of the powers to be transferred. This is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs.</P>
    <P>There is clearly a potential conflict of interest with regard to the functions a Minister may now have to carry out under his or her two different hats under the Waste Management Act. A similar potential conflict arises with regard to the Planning and Development Act and the Environmental Protection Agency Act. Even at this stage, I urge the Government to look at this issue again. It seems there is a compelling argument for giving political responsibility for the protection of our heritage to a member of Government other than the Minister who has responsibility for planning and development and for waste disposal.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to deal with the following matters specifically rather than globally, but I will understand if he cannot do so. In fairness to him, he is one of the better Ministers at listening to the points we make. I did not get a chance to acknowledge that in recent days. He listens to the points we make. He does not think that we come in here trying to set traps, but to improve legislation and he accepts that we do not just oppose it for the sake of doing so. We fundamentally believe what we say. I hope the Minister will see from where we are coming.</P>
    <P>Given that many aspects of the Department of the Environment and Local Government's functions at the moment are matters for independent judgment and scrutiny by Dúchas, how would potential conflicts of interest be resolved? Can the Minister ensure the integrity of the statutory <Col N="1587" /> consultative functions being exercised by a body that has, effectively, been absorbed? Dúchas is being absorbed. It is a legitimate question. Will Dúchas be ring-fenced to ensure its autonomy? That could well address some of the apprehensions rightfully raised in this morning's discussion.</P>
    <P>We argue strongly that it was not necessary to break up the former Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in the first place. With regard to heritage, we share the view concerning the separation of the built and natural heritage. In our view, Dúchas should be strengthened.</P>
    <P>Will the absorption of Dúchas &ndash; the Minister calls it a transfer &ndash; into the Department not constitute a reduction rather than a strengthening of its powers? The separation of functions between the heritage and planning aspects has always existed. They should remain clearly separated because the arm's length principle is vital to underpin this aspect of the matter and to ensure there is always a perception of independence.</P>
    <P>I have tabled an amendment in respect of another matter, and the Minister may wonder why I did so. I will try to explain, maybe not as well as he does. The purpose of the Bill goes beyond what is required in so far as it is completely open-ended. It permits the Minister to transfer functions at any time in the future. This forms the basis of my amendment which limits the power to transfer such functions to a definitive period of 30 days subsequent to the passing of the Bill from the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
    <P>We have a number of reservations. The Minister is, no doubt, in a position to rebut every one of them, but it is better that we present them for his consideration. We are not casting aspersions on anybody, just asking questions. We will be opposing Second Stage of the Bill. I will hand over to my colleague, Deputy McManus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Penrose, for allowing me to speak. He has expressed concerns that are shared by other Labour Party Members in respect of any potential for conflict of interest as a result of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill is relatively straightforward. It concerns powers being transferred and impacts on the relationship the Minister will have with An Bord Pleanála or his or her role under the Waste Management Act. Since we have an opportunity to consider that relationship, I would like to make a point about An Bord Pleanála. It is no longer acceptable to have a body as unaccountable as the board. That is not to say that I am arguing for interference by the Minister. That would be the last argument I would make. The nature of decisions and the way they are transmitted to the public, in terms of providing information on how they are made, is deficient. It sometimes operates on the policy of &ldquo;never apologise, never explain&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My county has been on the receiving end of a number of decisions by An Bord Pleanála. The <Col N="1588" /> board went directly against its own inspectors' reports. It had extremely strong and expert advice on certain occasions, but inexplicably went against it. One has to remember that the inspector is the only person related to An Bord Pleanála who actually visits the site in question and has an intimate knowledge of the particular development proposal. That is an issue of concern to me.</P>
    <P>The Waste Management Act is alluded to in this Bill. I tried to raise a matter on the Adjournment this week and requested the Minister to come into the House because I am extremely concerned about the issue of illegal dumping in County Wicklow. A reply was issued to me stating the Minister had no role to play under the Waste Management Act in terms of assessing or investigating the role of the local authority in investigating illegal dumping. Again, I find this difficult to accept.</P>
    <P>Now that we are assessing a new relationship under the Waste Management Act, we can assess whether there are areas that the Minister needs to consider. In 1998, for example, residents in west Wicklow reported illegal dumping activity to Wicklow County Council. Nothing was done, certainly nothing effective, although specific information was given about the registration numbers of vehicles involved in the dumping. Last year the local authority at first denied that the letter had been sent when the matter came to public notice and the extent of the dumping began to be understood. The county council then said it had found the letter. What is remarkable is that, even though that letter is central to the criminal investigation on which the Garda has embarked, the county council is now saying it does not have it.</P>
    <P>I wished to raise that issue in this House because it is a serious issue of waste management and because the Minister is the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. It is not correct for a local authority to investigate itself. It is not fair on the people working in the local authority and it is certainly not fair on the public which has an interest in this matter. My request to debate the matter on the Adjournment was refused on the grounds that the Waste Management Act precluded the Minister from getting involved.</P>
    <P>We do not yet know the full extent of dumping in County Wicklow but it involved hundreds and thousands of tonnes of illegal waste, some of which was hazardous. We must remember that when the extent of dumping was discovered, who was down in his boiler suit only the Minister for the Environment and Local Government with a retinue of press photographers and journalists to see him visiting the site. It certainly made for tremendous photographs. However, if the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is saying he has no role in this regard, what was he doing at Whitestown? Why was he involved in terms of the public perception, yet did not get engaged in terms of how the process panned out since then? </P>
    <P>There has still been no legal process, action <Col N="1589" /> taken or people appearing in court. We were told in January by the county council that this action was imminent yet nobody has been charged. The local authority lost an important piece of evidence, found it and lost it again. Now it maintains that it was not terribly important anyway. It was extremely tardy in calling in the Garda, despite urging from me and other councillors to bring in the experts, the people who had the legal authority to question people. Months passed before that was done. In effect, the local authority took upon itself the responsibility for a criminal investigation. Of course, the role of the local authority is questionable. I pay tribute to the people in Wicklow County Council who are working very hard at the moment to get to the bottom of this. Their rights must be protected and the wrongdoers responsible for the illegal dumping activity, who are still out there, must be brought to book.</P>
    <P>In that context, I do not think it is correct for a local authority to be left, in effect, investigating its own role, as is happening now. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has a particular duty of care and a role to play and he should not stand aside in a case such as this. A consultant's report is to be issued shortly and decisions will have to be made in Wicklow &ndash; decisions relating to the policy outlined by other people on waste management. These decisions will affect local people in the beautiful, if not spectacular, area of west Wicklow. Their environment has been polluted and contaminated by a huge amount of extremely profitable criminal activity. The detritus left behind will be impossible to clean up fully because of the scale of the damage. It is certainly the worst crisis I have seen in my long career &ndash; I do not want to say how long &ndash; as a county councillor, yet the Minister appears to stand aside. I mean no disrespect to the current Minister, but I ask him to listen to what I am saying. He has a very good reputation for fairness.</P>
    <P>The information we have from the county council is sketchy. Even though I am a member of the council I have difficulty extracting information. The local residents have been informed that the letter they sent has gone missing once again. There has never been a satisfactory explanation for the fact that a notice prepared by the council last year under section 55 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, was not sent out. The council has admitted it was responsible for a certain amount of inert dumping at Whitestown. We need to know the extent of that. We also need to know why Wicklow County Council, in April 1999, sent a letter through one of its engineers to the owner of the land at Whitestown stating that the council had an interest in carrying out dumping on that site.</P>
    <P>I have been in the Department of the Environment and Local Government, so I know the Minister will argue that local authorities are sovereign in the sense that they must manage their own business. However, at the end of the day somebody must evaluate the performance of local <Col N="1590" /> authorities. Somebody must be responsible for ensuring they are doing their jobs correctly. If there are questions relating to the role of the local authorities on any issue, there must be checks and balances to make sure that right is done and seen to be done. It is a year since the issue of waste management in west Wicklow first came up. A policy has been outlined very clearly by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I do not believe, looking at Wicklow County Council and County Wicklow itself, that the policy is working. It cannot be working if, despite such extensive evidence of illegal, massive dumping, nobody has been taken to court. The position of the county council is that it cannot stand aside from the part of this story that relates to it. The only person who can deal with this is the Minister. While the Garda is carrying out criminal investigations the members of the council are doing their work, but I am concerned about this issue.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to assess the functioning of An Bord Pleanála. At present, Dúchas has certain rights the Minister does not have, but they are very limited. We must ensure that important, fragile heritage areas, particularly in the area around the greater Dublin conurbation, are protected. These crucial matters, in terms of both planning and waste management, deserve a more extensive debate than the one we are having today, which is about a minor and limited aspect of legislative change. Inevitably, once any change relating to these two fundamental issues is considered, bigger issues come into play. It is important these are addressed. A new Minister is now setting out, hoping to make his mark. Having been freed of his responsibilities in terms of roads, he has an opportunity to deal with these matters, some of which are central to the future and the quality of life of the residents of my county and of the country at large.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised there are not more Deputies in the House, because this is very important legislation and, as a number of speakers have pointed out, it needs to be dealt with fairly urgently. The purpose of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Performance of Certain Functions) Bill, 2002, is to complement the making of a Government order on the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1939, transferring the functions relating to heritage matters to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I am puzzled about the reason for this. The Minister has a busy schedule, so why are extra functions being passed to him from the former Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the <Col N="1591" /> Islands? I have no doubt about the Minister's ability to deal with extra functions, but, as a number of speakers have pointed out, there is now a stronger possibility of ministerial conflicts of interest.</P>
      <P>As Deputies Penrose and Allen have pointed out, there are several matters for which the Minister will have primary responsibility as the Minister of the Environment and Local Government, including planning and other local authority matters and waste management. It puzzles me how the Minister will overcome these possible conflicts of interest. Perhaps he might elaborate on this when replying. For example, the Minister will have responsibility for waste management and if an application is submitted to build an incineration plant in a certain area and that application goes to An Bord Pleanála, where will the Minister's function rest or what will be his major responsibility?</P>
      <P>While we have taken a position not to impede the legislation because it is necessary, that does not stop us from asking serious questions. Does the passing of the legislation strengthen or change the effect of the Minister's involvement with An Bord Pleanála? I am not exactly clear whether his functions and responsibilities are increased compared to those which existed previously or whether it is a direct transfer of the same responsibilities which were previously held by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and which will now be held by him as Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I would like an answer to that.</P>
      <P>There are times when some of the decisions of An Bord Pleanála are puzzling to say the least. It concerns the public and public representatives in some cases when the board overrules the recommendation of its inspector and makes a different decision. That is puzzling to members of the public and to public representatives because they do not have a clue of the position in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP" hpid="Mr. Cuffe Mr. Cuffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo many of the concerns my colleagues have voiced about the legislation, especially the centralising of power within one ministry. There is a seminal issue of the conflict of interest which may arise whereby the Minister may act as judge and jury on certain issues relating to specific areas under the legislation. I am concerned that a conflict of interest may arise in the area of waste management.</P>
      <P>I will put forward a scenario. If the Minister were to decide an incinerator was necessary in a certain area in which heritage issues are at risk, for example, the Boyne Valley where a waste management plan might call for an incinerator while significant issues of heritage might need protection, we would be concerned that that might involve a significant conflict of interest for the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also concerned about the disappearance of the word &ldquo;heritage&rdquo; from the title of a Department, and this goes beyond a simple issue <Col N="1592" /> of naming. It shows the lack of importance given to heritage by the Government in recent times. There is a reduction in the amount of conservation grants issued, from £4 million last year to &euro;3 million this year, a reduction of 40% in assistance from the State to architectural heritage throughout the country. I am concerned that not only are we seeing the word &ldquo;heritage&rdquo; being dropped, but there is a significant reduction in the amount of finance being made available to those trying to conserve or protect architectural heritage.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned that, by having powers vested in the Minister in the area of heritage, it may allow him to intervene in many planning applications. For example, when an environmental impact statement is called for or submitted within a planning application, that statement must examine a myriad of issues, among which is heritage. I am concerned that that may give the Minister a facility to intervene in major planning applications within the State. This centralising of power could lead to a conflict of interest in this regard. We are concerned that significant powers are vested in the Minister.</P>
    <P>Returning to the issue my colleagues raised earlier about the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, it was pointed out that when the previous office holder approved the plan for the North Lotts area, he increased the quantum of development on the site. That is a significant power being vested in the Minister. It is not irrelevant to point out that some of the lands on which the area which could be developed was increased belonged to a major contributor to the Minister's party. It is important that the potential for a conflict of interest is minimised in this regard. I am concerned when I see further powers being vested in the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, that is a highly regrettable remark the Deputy has made.

The way he put it is highly regrettable and should be withdrawn.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned that the word &ldquo;heritage&rdquo; has disappeared from the title of a Department and that that is reflected in funding available to architectural heritage. I am also concerned that a conflict of interest may arise, especially in the area of waste management where the Minister already has extensive powers and, if heritage issues arise <Col N="1593" /> in addition to waste management ones, he may well be judge, jury and executioner. I oppose the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their thoughtful contributions to the debate. I understand the points made and the reasons people made them.</P>
      <P>I am not making any changes to the legal base of operations. I am maintaining the legal position as it stands. However, because of the transfer of functions, the advice from the Attorney General was that I needed primary legislation to confirm the existing legal framework and what is already an operational matter. No change is being made.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Allen for his support of the Bill, notwithstanding the reasonable reservations he outlined. A short time frame was available to me to produce the Bill. I tried to flag it quickly to the Opposition spokespeople when I became aware of the advice. My attitude would be to try to keep communication lines open particularly between the major parties and myself. I will ask my officials to facilitate in terms of the supply of information where possible.</P>
      <P>That we want to get rolling on this quickly should be seen as indicative of the Government's approach and enthusiasm for the Taoiseach's changes as outlined when the Government was formed and new Departments were set up. In a sense that point comes back to the amendments put down by Deputy Penrose. If there were any doubts or lack of enthusiasm about this I would not be here today moving the Bill. It is something we need to do quickly and was supported by all sides of the House in the Seanad yesterday. It demonstrates the Government's commitment in regard to the new Department of the Environment and Local Government and its transferred responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies raised the issue of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority. Members will appreciate that I am not in a position to go into that in detail today. My predecessor, Deputy Dempsey &ndash; the current Minister for Education and Science &ndash; for whom I have great regard and who is viewed by all Members as a man of integrity, would have examined the matter in the exercise of his functions and in good faith would have brought to bear his policy, right and function in regard to any changes made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much imagination could be brought to the planning process in terms of policy. Something that struck me as Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works concerned our built environment. In parts of Dublin one can pick out clearly identifiable timeframes in our history which is something positive. I am not so sure that can be done elsewhere in Dublin or throughout the country, with perhaps just a few exceptions. I have a great interest in the built environment. I do not accept simplistic arguments that make general rules such as height is wrong or everything should be low. We cannot approach <Col N="1594" /> the built environment in that way but we must look at areas and then make judgment calls as to what we are trying to do.</P>
    <P>It has been the Government's approach in the past five years to look for character when building new buildings. Buildings should speak well of and represent a community. A building should not be just a standard <i>pro forma</i>, prefabricated building and the same design no matter where it is in the country. I have a healthy abhorrence to such an approach. A building should speak of a community, its location and the environment in which it is located. That brings into play different issues which cannot be gathered together by having one rule of thumb across the board.</P>
    <P>Deputy Penrose spent time on the issue of conflict of interest. I have been involved &ndash; so too has Deputy Penrose &ndash; in debates on the environmental issue. In that context, what is euphemistically called &ldquo;the green environment&rdquo; understates the environment. It is much more than that. However, I will use the terminology because it seems to convey a particular bent in regard to the environment. It is right to be serious about the environment and its demands and conflicts. I do not deny there are conflicts in terms of our built environment, the modernisation of the country, our economy and agriculture and all these issues require balanced decisions. Bringing Dúchas under the umbrella of my Department makes a body of expertise available to the State and the Department. We are not trying to just get a more centralised approach but a more streamlined approach to the area of policy so that we will have a clear vision in terms of how and what we want to deliver as an end product in the totality of the environment in this country.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies used the analogy that a major incinerator to cope with waste management could be built in a special area of heritage or of conservation. I would be appalled if any local authority or combination of local authorities would knowingly want to site an incinerator in an area obvious to everyone as an important area of heritage. That does not make sense and I cannot see that sort of extreme case arising. I assure the House that I will be careful with regard to my functions and responsibilities under the various planning and waste management Acts and in regard to my functions under Dúchas. I will perhaps put in place a protocol within the Department to deal with this and I will consider the issue.</P>
    <P>My concentration for the first few weeks has been on getting legislation through both Houses and I thank my Opposition colleagues for facilitating that. Now I will have to look at this area. It is not simple but I believe the thrust of the policies formulated are right. I will be mindful of what Deputies have said and of the potential areas of conflict that could arise. There are mature ways of dealing with this. One of the things I intend to do is to be open and transparent on these matters and I will listen to what Deputies have to say. The points made here this <Col N="1595" /> morning were fair and reasonable and they brought up issues with which we will want to deal when we get to the body of major legislation. We will tease out those in the context of the programme for Government.</P>
    <P>This Bill is specific. It confirms the functions that exist under a former Minister in another Department. I simply want to make certain in law, particularly as the Dáil is going into recess, that there is no question mark about the role of Dúchas. As we know, it is involved in many different planning applications on an advice basis. I do not want to undermine that. In introducing this Bill speedily, my Department demonstrates its good faith. If I wanted to undermine matters, <Col N="1596" /> the last thing I would do would be to rush the Bill through the House. My approach is to copperfasten and confirm the <i>status quo</i> and not to undermine the approach of Dúchas.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions on Second Stage. I accept and understand the general areas of reservation on policy but in time the decision will be welcomed by all in the House as we move forward to face the challenges, particularly that of waste management. I will not get into the issues raised by Deputy McManus in regard to Wicklow. There is a criminal investigation under way there and I will wait until that is completed. I will not be nationally passive, mute or deaf when major issues arise.</P>

    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are cognate on Amendment No. 1 and the three may, therefore, be taken together by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 25, after &ldquo;or&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;within 30 days&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In my opinion the Minister will accept the point &ndash; I also made it on Second Stage &ndash; I am about to make. As it stands, the provision in section 1 is an open-ended construction which could lead to the entire process being undermined. The proposed new subsection (3A) as contained in section 3 and to be inserted in the Waste Management Act, 1996, states that &ldquo;Subsection (3) shall not affect the performance by the Minister of functions transferred (whether before or after the passing of the <i>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Performance of Certain Functions) Act, 2002</i>)&rdquo;, which means that there is no time limit being imposed. I am suggesting that a period of 30 days after the passing of the Act should serve as the cut-off point. I accept, however, that it is a time limit of only one month and I would be prepared to accept a limit of 60 days.</P>
      <P>There should be a time limit by which all the particular functions the Minister intends to designate as being important to transfer should be transferred. He outlined those functions and the reasons for their transfer on Second Stage. I disagreed with a number of those reasons but that is neither here nor there because we live in a democracy. It would be prudent and wise, however, for us to impose a time restriction. I submit that a period of 30 days is reasonable but the Minister and his officials may be of the opinion that this would be overly constraining because it might not be possible to affect the entire transfer in that time. My intention is that we should define the period involved and bring an air of finality to this matter in order that it is not left open-ended.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the Minister could not if a function which was overlooked comes to light, merely state that it should have been dealt with and that he has the power to do so under the Act. There should be a definite cut-off point, in temporal terms, in relation to the application of this Bill, which is similar to emergency legislation, in order that there can be certainty about the functions with which he wants his Department to deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a reasonable amendment and I urge the Minister to avoid the necessity of holding a div<Col N="1597" /><Col N="1598" /> ision in respect of it. The amendment was put forward and framed in a way which takes account of the legal position and, because of the way it has been constructed, the Minister might perhaps give it favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much merit in the argument put forward by Deputy Penrose. I ask for a little poetic license. One of the shortcomings of the previous planning and development Act was that it contained a penalty for cutting down trees or destruction of a building with a preservation order on it. I ask the Minister to consider introducing legislation which would prohibit development on sites where illegal actions took place beforehand. Currently if people enter a site in the middle of the night and cut down trees, although they are penalised, they can still go ahead with the development if they make an application to do so.</P>
      <P>An issue which will probably cross the Minister's desk very soon is the work of Dúchas in developing a national park in County Wicklow. While the organisation does a great deal of good work in the county, it is in conflict with land owners. The Minister's predecessor, the former Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands Deputy de Valera, set up a committee in this area which has done much good work. I ask that it receives every possible support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand precisely the reason Deputy Penrose tabled these amendments. They would require the Government order transferring heritage functions to my Department to be made either before or within 30 days of the passing of the Bill. They are identical amendments and I do not propose to accept them as they are unnecessary and restrictive. I am not certain the Deputy and I are on the same wavelength.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach announced the new Government on 6 June, he placed strong and renewed focus on environmental sustainability. Consistent with this approach, he has mandated the Department of the Environment and Local Government with the additional responsibility of protecting our natural heritage and heritage policy generally. It is the intention that the order transferring heritage functions to my Department will be made as soon as possible after the enactment of this legislation, which is the very reason I wanted to bring it before the House.</P>
      <P>That this legislation is being introduced at such short notice is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to establishing a new, reconstituted Department of the Environment and Local Government with a strong heritage focus as a matter of urgency. As this is quite clear, I do not accept the amendments. While, in the past I have taken on board the point the Deputy makes, and incorporated it in certain legislation, I do not feel it is necessary in the context of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Timmins raised several points which <Col N="1599" /> were not directly related to Committee Stage, the first of which relates to his interest in a particular policy area. I would be happy to consider the matter if he raises it with me in writing.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

      <P>I understand there is a facility to ask questions of the Minister on the Bill. As I did not have an opportunity to participate in the earlier debate, I have a small number of questions and ask that he takes them on board. At the outset, I record my disappointment that I had no opportunity to participate in the Second Stage debate.</P>

      <P>In fairness, if the Deputy had been present, he would have been able to speak. I came into the House at 12.35 p.m. although I did not have to be here until 12.50 p.m. The reason I did so was that there were no other speakers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated the position. I now wish to ask certain questions if the Minister would be prepared to address them. Will he outline, in the context of the Bill, what the precise role will be for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in relation to Dúchas? Does he not agree that the transfer of heritage and responsibility for Dúchas to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, which made this Bill necessary, could lead to contradictions and conflicts of interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government has responsibility for waste management. The outgoing Minister sought to put in place a network of incinerators which have met with widespread opposition on the grounds of waste management, human health and environmental protection. It seems this Bill would allow the Minister to be consulted in individual planning cases where these involve significant issues for nature conservation, habitats and-<Col N="1600" /> or the built and archaeological heritage. If there are such significant issues in a planning application for a waste incinerator, what will be the position? </P>
    <P>Does the Minister recognise that the Department of the Environment and Local Government, because of the actions of the previous Minister, has lost the trust of communities and many local authority members? This is principally because of the Waste Management Act, 2001, which removed powers in relation to waste management from elected councillors and gave them to managers to ensure the network of incinerators, was pushed through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies, I would like to clarify a matter raised earlier concerning the Deputy's right to speak. A time slot was provided for in the Order Paper today. There was 11 minutes remaining of the time slot when the Minister was called. Any Deputy present in the House who offered to speak was entitled to do so in those 11 minutes. I wish to make that clear.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Chair's clarification, but I ask that he also take on board that prior to the Order of Business this morning the request for time was made properly and was denied. On that basis I had no way of second guessing your good offices regarding the opportunity to speak.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter of my good offices. The reality of the position in the House is that the Chair determines who will speak and is bound by Standing Orders. As it happened, there were 11 minutes to spare earlier. I wish to make this clear because the Chair does not want to be implicated in whatever difficulties arose this morning.</P>

      <P>The issues raised by the Deputy were discussed at length on Second Stage when I responded to all the points he made in great detail. We are now on Committee Stage. Nevertheless, I assure him I am absolutely satisfied I will be more than capable, along with my officials <Col N="1601" /> with responsibility for various areas, of exercising my authority in a fair and even-handed manner. The decision to confer these new powers on my Department, specifically with regard to giving it responsibility for Dúchas, is a very positive move. I welcome the broad thrust of our approach to the environment going forward.</P>
      <P>It could be presumed from the manner in which the Deputy made his points that I will act in some way as judge and jury on all these issues. I will not and neither do I propose to. There are a whole range of bodies in place which can deal with many of the issues the Deputy raised. We had a lengthy discussion on all of these matters on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>On the Deputy's last point regarding my predecessor, he acted correctly following a complete failure of councillors in many areas to exercise the responsibility entrusted to them for taking decisions on waste management. They simply walked away from their responsibility. The reality is we have a serious crisis in this area. However, this is not a debate for today. I emphasise that this action was not taken in an arbitrary fashion or for the sake of it. It was done for good practice to ensure decisions could be made throughout the country on these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I was very much involved as a local elected councillor in all of the discussion locally and also here in the House. The councillors who refused to embrace the Minister's wishes were not acting in an irresponsible way or refusing to take their responsibility seriously. They had a different perspective and a different sense of what was correct and appropriate. This was within a short time of having enshrined local government and local democracy in the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I get the same latitude. I raised the issue of the Spencer Dock development previously and although I did not expect the Minister to be able to respond in any great detail, I expect a response to the issues I raised. I do not accept that a Minister adding an extra storey to a development was done without lobbying from a third party. I do not think the Minister and his officials took on the responsibility to add a storey to a development as submitted by the DDDA. Did any other party make approaches to the Department? There are stories going around that I will not repeat here even though Deputy Cuffe implied something else. However, in the interests of the reputation of his Department, the Minister <Col N="1602" /> should make a detailed statement as quickly as possible. To add a storey to a development on the waterfront in the middle of Dublin city on a site that was the subject of much controversy and opposition by residents, without prompting from outside agencies or groups, is quite unbelievable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said, I do not have all the details of the matter before me. However &ndash; this view is shared by the vast majority of Members of this House &ndash; my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, the former Minister in this Department, is a man of the highest integrity. I have no doubt that any decision was reached by him and the officials in the Department of the Environment and Local Government. There is no question that they would have made decisions based on specific suggestions made in this House. I do not have all the details, but I am quite comfortable with and will be looking at it. If clarification is needed, I will certainly provide it.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I compliment my predecessor, Deputy de Valera, on the preparation of this Bill. Deputies will understand that I have only recently taken over this portfolio and that there are some details of the Bill's provisions that I would like to consider in more depth. I may, therefore, wish to propose some adjustments to the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>An Agreed Programme for Government aims to ensure cultural activity is available and accessible to all and commits to the enactment of a new arts Act to provide for a more inclusive definition of the arts and also to map out on a statutory basis a new relationship between artists, the Arts Council and the Minister. The proposals in the Bill are not solely about a reorganisation of the Arts Council. The proposals are as much about defining for the first time in legislation the role and functions of Government and the Minister in relation to the promotion of the arts both inside and outside the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The past five years have seen a quantum leap in the level of Government support for the arts in Ireland. The subvention voted by the Oireachtas for the Arts Council in 1997 was &euro;26.44 million. In the current year the amount is almost &euro;48 million, an increase of about 80% on the 1997 figure. In the same period there has been an unprecedented programme of capital development for the expansion of existing cultural spaces and the creation of new ones. The millennium wing of the National Gallery of Ireland, the Museum of Country Life in County Mayo, which is part of the National Museum and the Chester Beatty Library now located in Dublin Castle have all been recipients of prestigious awards in the recent past. Through the Government's ACCESS capital programme, under which allocations totalling &euro;45.71 million over the five year period to the end of 2004 were announced last year, and its predecessor, the CDIS, a mosaic of high quality venues has been created for artistic creation and <Col N="1604" /> experience in partnership with local authorities and private groups.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is the product of experience gained with having a Minister representing the arts at the Cabinet table. The proposals sought to take into consideration a comprehensive period of consultation with the arts sector in its widest definition culminating in an intensive weekend session early last summer. Key players in the arts sector formed working groups to consider in depth the key issues. All those who had responded to the earlier open invitation were invited to an open forum. We have come a very long way since 1951 when the first Arts Act set up the Arts Council as the vehicle through which Government supports the arts in Ireland. The council is now well established as the major driver of artistic development in this country. The Irish arts sector today is much bigger, more dynamic and more diverse than has ever before been the case. This has happened for a number of reasons. The increasing level and quality of State support has undoubtedly made a big difference and the more general changes in Irish society &ndash; of which the arts sector is a part and from which it very often draws its creative inspiration &ndash; have also had an influence.</P>
    <P>In 1951, we were as a nation probably quite inward-looking, although we were by no means alone in that levels of communications and access to travel in those days made everyone more locally focused, whatever country they lived in. Ireland today is a vibrant, dynamic, modern and more outward looking society. We are continually exposed to other cultures and ways of doing things. Indeed, Ireland itself is well on the way to becoming a multi-cultural society. This diversity of cultural influences, when combined with the rich mother lode of our native artistic tradition, gives us a wonderfully rich and diverse base from which to draw in the pursuit of artistic endeavour. All of this has had a profound impact on artistic Ireland. It is no longer valid to view the arts as merely another product of economic growth. While this is an element we recognise the role of art in Irish society as a desirable end in itself, as giving meaning to our existence. People are now more involved in the arts. Some are continuing with traditional disciplines, but others are pushing out the boundaries with experimental and innovative work, including work based on new technologies that have developed in recent years.</P>
    <P>For a country of our size we are incredibly rich in our contemporary talent and in our artistic heritage. Artistic Ireland, it is fair to say, has had a profound influence on all who live here. It is my objective, through these legislative proposals, to ensure that the environment exists to build on what has been achieved to date. Artists challenge, inspire, entertain and enrich the society from which they spring, in which they live and work and from which they draw their inspiration.</P>
    <P>As the Minister whose responsibility it is to deliver State support to the arts sector, it behoves me to ensure that the complex mix which com<Col N="1605" /> prise the present-day environment for the practice of the arts are balanced together to give a coherent whole. Significantly increased resources have become available, and thus accountability and efficiency must be afforded due priority. The sector is bigger, so the structures for dealing with it must work well. That which is traditional must be nurtured, while the dynamism and freshness of the new must also be given their due place.</P>
    <P>When enacted, this Bill will define Government's role in relation to the development of arts policy; update the structure of the Arts Council; and clarify and rationalise the council's relationship with Government. The Arts Act, 1951, as amended by the Arts Act, 1973, currently regulates some of these areas. There have been dramatic changes to almost all areas of Irish life since the existing legislation was enacted. Since 1973, the political, cultural, administrative and artistic landscapes have changed dramatically. In addition, the 1951 and 1973 Acts were enacted in a context where there was no Minister with specific responsibility for the arts &ndash; which has of course changed &ndash; and the Bill recognises this for the first time in legislation.</P>
    <P>The formulations of many of the provisions of the Arts Acts of 1951 and 1973 relating to the functioning of the Arts Council are novel and the opportunity is being taken to bring them into line with what are today standard provisions relating to the functioning of statutory authorities. However, the Bill proposes a number of key changes that I will outline to the House in more detail. &ldquo;The arts&rdquo; will be defined, for the purposes of the Bill, in a way that continues to refer to constituent art forms, but will be sufficiently flexible to include traditional as well as emerging and innovative art forms and art forms in any language. This definition endeavours to encapsulate in legal language the outcome of the consultative process to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the position regarding ministerial responsibility for the arts has changed fundamentally since the 1951 and 1973 Acts were enacted. The arts portfolio forms a key part of my remit as Minister for the Arts, Sport and Tourism. The Bill therefore defines the functions of the Minister in this context. As Minister, I will have overall responsibility for the promotion of the arts both inside and outside the State. In performing this function, it is important that I be appropriately advised and that broader policy considerations be taken account of. The Bill therefore provides that, in performing my functions, I may consult with the Arts Council, and with such other Ministers, public bodies, or other persons as I consider appropriate. As the Minister with overall responsibility for the promotion of the arts, I will be empowered to give a direction in writing to the council requiring it to comply with policies of the Minister or of the Government. Such a direction may include a requirement that the council prepare and submit to me a plan specifying strategies or measures that it proposes <Col N="1606" /> to adopt in relation to the arts during a specified period. I do not think anyone can credibly argue that the Minister with responsibility for the arts and for securing substantial funding for them should not have a clear and substantive role in the formulation of the State's policy on the arts. However, while these provisions recognise this legitimate role for the Minister of the day, they will not affect the independence of the Arts Council regarding individual funding decisions. Indeed, statutory recognition is given in the Bill to that independence.</P>
    <P>A great deal of arts activity takes place at local level and local authorities can greatly influence the welfare of the arts and the level and nature of artistic activity within their administrative areas. Many local authorities already do excellent work in this regard and it is important that the potential impact of the authorities on the arts be optimised and that these efforts dovetail as far as is practicable with overall Government policy.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill, therefore, requires local authorities to prepare and implement plans for the development of the arts within their functional areas and in so doing to take account of Government policies on the arts. Local authorities may provide financial or other assistance to stimulate public interest in the arts, promote knowledge of the arts, or improve standards in the arts. To ensure overall coherence, the arts activities of other public bodies must also operate within the parameters of Government arts policy. Section 7 requires public bodies, in doing anything that relates to the arts, to have regard to such Government policies.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill broadly restates the functions of the Arts Council. The council is given a wide-ranging remit which includes the stimulation of public interest in the arts, the promotion of knowledge, appreciation, practice of the arts and assisting in the improvement in standards in the arts. The council can make recommendations to the Minister on matters within its remit and will generally act as an expert resource for other Ministers and public bodies in relation to the arts. This approach is fully in keeping with the approach of the council itself in recent years, during which it has sought to deepen and strengthen its role as a development agency for the arts, in addition to the effective disbursement of arts funding, which of course continues to be one of its primary functions.</P>
    <P>In the course of the consultation I understand that much debate surrounded the appropriate size of the council. The Arts Council, as currently constituted, has 17 members and, understandably, there were opposing views as to whether this was too big or just right. A 17 member council structure originally sprang from a desire to include practitioners of as many art forms as possible so as to bring a high level of practical expertise to the decision making process of the body. The council in its current formulation has undoubtedly served the arts in Ireland well. However, there is a downside to any committee structure <Col N="1607" /> with a large number of members and smaller tighter structures have real advantages in terms of efficiency and sometimes of flexibility. Accordingly, the Bill provides that the Arts Council be reduced from 17 to nine members.</P>
    <P>Another possible disadvantage of the present system was that a completely new membership could be appointed every five years causing problems of continuity that can make it more difficult for new members to pick up the strings of where their predecessors left off. To overcome that, it is proposed in the Bill to introduce a system of rolling membership. That means that half the ordinary members of the council will change every 30 months, rather than the membership having the possibility of being changed in its entirety every five years. The proposed new system should make transitions from one set of council members to another much more gradual and seamless. In recognition of the fact that the membership of the council will be smaller than heretofore, the Bill proposes a system of three statutory standing committees which are provided for in section 21.</P>
    <P>The process of consultation to which I have already referred revealed that those involved in traditional arts are dissatisfied with how their sector is faring under existing arrangements. Whether justified or not, this group appears to have a strong sense that its sector has been treated less well than it deserves and arguments were advanced for either a new and separate traditional arts council or the ring-fencing of a substantial portion of the Arts Council's funds for traditional arts. However, others argued strongly against these suggestions on the basis that it would be inappropriate to separate any particular art form or set of art forms from the remit of the Arts Council and that the arm's length principle is potentially an uneasy bedfellow with the concept of ring-fencing in this context. The Bill reflects an effort to strike an acceptable balance by requiring the Arts Council to establish a standing committee on the traditional arts which shall make recommendations to the council in relation to the advance of moneys to those involved in the traditional arts.</P>
    <P>Given the increasing importance of local authorities for local artistic endeavour, the Bill proposes that the council establish a standing committee on local authorities and the arts. The third statutory committee proposed will advise on artistic innovation. The objective was to maintain an effective focus on new and emerging art forms, including those based on new media and new technology. The remainder of the Bill consists of standard provisions which are normal for any legislation regulating a State body, such as the Arts Council, and I will briefly outline these provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 1 contains the Short Title and commencement provisions. Section 2 contains definitions. Section 3 provides for the payment of expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Bill when enacted. Section 4 pro<Col N="1608" /> vides for the repeal of the Arts Acts, 1951 and 1973. Section 5, to which I have already alluded, sets out the Minister's powers and functions. Section 6 provides for the preparation and implementation of local arts plans by local authorities. Section 7 provides that public bodies shall, when doing anything relating to the arts, have regard to Government policies on the arts. Section 8 provides for the continuation of the Arts Council as a body corporate. Section 9 sets out the functions of the Arts Council. Section 10 allows the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and after consultation with the council and any other Minister of the Government, as he considers appropriate, by order to confer additional functions on the council.</P>
    <P>Section 11 covers the membership and structure of the Arts Council. Section 12 covers resignation, removal from office and disqualification from office by members of the Arts Council. Section 13 provides for the filling of casual vacancies on the council. Section 14 provides for the remuneration of the chairperson and members of the Arts Council. Section 15 deals with the appointment and terms of office of the director of the council. Section 16 lays down procedures for the meetings of the Arts Council. Section 17 covers certain restrictions on holding office as a member of the Arts Council or as a member of the council's staff. Section 18 provides for declarations of interest by members of the Arts Council. Section 19 covers declarations of interest by members of the council's staff. Section 20 prohibits the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information by members of the council or of standing committees or by members of the council's staff. Section 21 provides for the appointment by the Arts Council of standing committees. Section 22 allows for the appointment of additional committees by the council.</P>
    <P>Section 23 allows the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to advance moneys to the council from funds provided by the Oireachtas. Section 24 allows the Arts Council, in carrying out its functions, to advance funds to such persons as it considers appropriate and provides that the council shall be independent in the performance of this function. That enshrines in legislation the long-standing understanding in that regard. Section 25 requires the keeping of proper accounts by the Arts Council and for their submission to the Minister after audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Section 26 requires the submission of an annual report on the council's activities to the Minister, who will lay copies before each House of the Oireachtas. Section 27 allows the council to accept gifts of money, land, or other property.</P>
    <P>Section 28 allows the appointment of staff by the Arts Council and deals with the terms and conditions of such staff. Section 29 provides that the rates of pay of council staff shall be in line with Government policy and directions issued by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Section 30 deals with the superannu<Col N="1609" /> ation of council staff. Section 31 allows the Minister to require the council to furnish specified records or documents.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes some important changes, while continuing with those elements which have served us well for many years. There will now be a recognised and well defined role for the Minister responsible for the arts. The Arts Council will continue and although it will now have a more specific obligation to operate within a framework of overall Government arts policy, its independence in individual funding decisions will now have statutory backing. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment to a position with responsibility for the arts. Given that he comes from County Kerry which has a huge tradition in the arts, it is appropriate that he represents the arts. As both of us come from Kerry, I hope we can play a major role in developing the arts in our county. The arts are thriving in Kerry and that will help both of us to take a practical look at the future development of the arts there. I also compliment the work done by the Minister's predecessor during her term in office. She was accessible, innovative, easy to approach and co-operative. Her work in the arts should be recognised.</P>
      <P>Some people feel it was a mistake to dismantle the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands because it brought together and focused attention on the arts, heritage, culture and our language. I will refer to that change later in my contribution. People with a genuine interest in the arts are concerned about such a seismic shift. I do not know if that change was carefully considered. It behoves me as Opposition spokesperson to ensure that the arts are not marginalised in the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. I understand the Minister also has responsibility for Bord na gCon and the Irish Horseracing Authority. He is responsible for a big Department. I am not aware that a Minister of State has been appointed to share those responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Two Arts Acts have been enacted since the foundation of the State. The first was enacted in 1951 and the second was enacted in 1973. That means the Arts Bill, 2002, may be the only opportunity the House will have to assist and encourage the development of the arts through legislation for a generation. What we do today will probably decide the direction the arts will take for the next 25 to 30 years. New art forms will emerge through new technology during that time. We must grasp the opportunity to get the Bill right. I will table several amendments on Committee Stage to try to improve the Bill after consultations with a variety of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have studied the history of the development of the arts since the foundation of the State and recall the contribution of my party, when in government, to them over the past 80 years. The Garda and Army bands were established in the <Col N="1610" /> 1920s, both of which have made a huge contribution to the country, music and the arts in various ways. The first State subsidisation of an English language theatre took place in 1925 with the award of £800 to the Abbey Theatre. Significant funding was also allocated to Irish language activities in schools at the time. During that formative period of the State it was the first Cumann na nGaedheal Government which set up all the institutions and established the system which has proved so successful up to the present day.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the broadcasting service in 1926 led to the creation of music groups which would in time become the RTE concert orchestra, the national symphony orchestra and the string quartet. In 1928 visual art was commissioned, illustrating the Shannon hydro-electric scheme. In 1949, under a coalition Government, following a period of 16 years out of office, a study was commissioned of the state of the arts in Ireland under the direction of Dr. Thomas Bodkin, former director of the National Gallery. In his report Dr. Bodkin expressed his views frankly on the condition of the arts in Ireland at the time. The report stated no country in Europe gave less to the cultivation of the arts than Ireland. It also highlighted the lack of instruction in art in our primary and secondary schools and universities. The 1951 Arts Act was a product of the report and its main objective was the establishment of An Comhairle Ealaíon, the Arts Council.</P>
    <P>One of the basic principles of the 1951 Act was that, while art and artistic activity should be encouraged and supported to the greatest possible extent by the State, it should not be directly controlled by the State. This approach &ndash; the arm's length principle &ndash; which was not uncommon in other countries, has prevailed under various subsequent Governments. However, this principle is threatened by the Bill before the House in view of the powers being given to the Minister in the direction of the Arts Council to which I will refer.</P>
    <P>The 1973 Arts Act was introduced at a time when Fine Gael was the main coalition partner in government and the membership of the Arts Council was increased from seven to 17. In that regard, in the Bill before the House, the Minister is reverting to the 1951 membership level. The 1973 Act also established three committees, one to advise on painting, sculpture and architecture, one to advise on music and one to advise on drama, literature and cinema. Unlike the three standing committees which the Minister is now establishing, the previous committees did not have legislative status and were more of an advisory nature.</P>
    <P>In 1984, when my party was again in government, section 32 of the Finance Act allowed for tax relief on contributions towards the advancement of the arts in Ireland, which was quite an innovative measure. In 1994 increased funding was provided for the development of arts and culture infrastructure through the CDIS programme. This provided some very fine facilities in County <Col N="1611" /> Kerry, such as the cultural centre in Listowel, in which I am involved. The 1995 Finance Bill provided that persons who donated heritage items could credit the value of those items against certain taxes. The Cultural Institutions Act, 1997, provided a new legislative structure for the operation of Ireland's national cultural institutions.</P>
    <P>I have demonstrated that Fine Gael and previously Cumann na nGaedheal made major contributions to the arts in many ways. In my capacity as Fine Gael spokesperson on the arts I hope to ensure that tradition will be maintained. I intend to be very proactive in this area, being conscious of my roots in Listowel, which is regarded by many as the literary capital of Ireland. The former President of Ireland, Mrs. Mary Robinson, once referred to it as the Athens of Ireland. Accordingly, I have a great deal to live up to.</P>
    <P>I know of no society that can live without the arts. The arts represent us all in our ability to live outside ourselves, to imagine, create, respond, communicate locally, globally, aesthetically, emotionally and culturally, yet we have consistently failed to recognise their importance. We are quick to recognise ourselves economically, yet we do not see or understand the artist in each of us. My feeling about the arts is neither a deep philosophical one, nor a complicated one &ndash; it is quite simple. We are better off for having them around us because we are somehow more human, more alive, more receptive. If we are serious about the arts in Ireland, we must show that we take them seriously.</P>
    <P>How can a country not take the arts seriously when it has a Nobel prize winner living and writing in its heart, when it has produced poets, playwrights and novelists who are read and performed worldwide and when it has actors, singers and performers envied throughout the art world? How can a country that has film, music and song leading world artistic thinking, that has just created an international visual expanse in its national gallery and that has opened up the doors and remit of its national museum not take the arts seriously? How can a country that knows its tradition of language and literature, a country where story and legend and myth are the heartbeat of the nation not take the arts seriously? I sometimes wonder, however, if we really take them seriously or if we just pay lip service to the great national resource which flourishes all around us, waiting to be developed.</P>
    <P>In view of our cultural heritage I am disappointed that in many respects what we are discussing is not really an Arts Bill but rather an Arts Council Bill. Perhaps it should be renamed accordingly. Instead of relating to the arts it relates more to the organisational structures through which the Arts Council will work and the future relationship the council will have with the Minister at the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. Its main effect seems to be to give the Minister a major say in the future direction of the <Col N="1612" /> arts, which may not be a desirable outcome. The fact that the council will now deal with a Minister at the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, as opposed to a Minister at the former Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, is noteworthy in itself.</P>
    <P>The arts now constitute a smaller part of a large Department and are separated from the Department with responsibility for the Irish language and the Gaeltacht. While the arts and the Irish language are now divorced, a real appreciation of the role played by the Irish language in our artistic and cultural development and heritage must not be underestimated or, worse, lost.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides for the establishment of standing committees, which is a new structure for the Arts Council. It is proposed that one of these committees will be concerned with traditional Irish arts. It will apparently advise on the distribution of all funds in the traditional arts area but it is not clear if this will entail assisting and advising the council on matters concerning Irish language arts. Areas such as broadcasting, publication, prose, drama and poetry in the Irish language include art and artists who are at the cutting edge of contemporary arts and who are internationally recognised. It has been said that a serious disservice would be done to the arts generally and to such practitioners in the Irish language if they were arbitrarily considered to be traditional arts. We must not forget that it is in the Irish language arts that most give an Irish dimension to our culture, yet the conservation and promotion of the Irish language and its arts is not reflected in the Bill. A basic and essential cultural domain is ignored and overlooked. In the absence of particular care and attention and the cherishing of courageous developmental action, the Irish language arts will not survive.</P>
    <P>The role of the arts is not simply to encourage tourism or trade. The arts stand alone and they offer a definition of where we are as a society and a people. It has been found that artistic endeavours organised for purely artistic purposes are generally better attended and more successful than those developed exclusively as tourism initiatives.</P>
    <P>The autonomy of the arts, especially from their departmental bedfellow, tourism, must be recognised and protected. The Minister has a major responsibility to ensure that they do not become fused into tourism and be seen as an economic vehicle, which they can be, rather than a cultural one. We must not return to the days when people thought of the arts with a Bord Fáilte mentality, as constituting an extension of the shamrock. They are far more than that and our attitude must not be blinkered or influenced by any new found policy change making them merely a major economic force rather than promoting them for their intrinsic value.</P>
    <P>The proposal to substantially reduce the number of members of the Arts Council is far reaching. If the Bill is passed, the membership of the <Col N="1613" /> council will be reduced from 17 to nine, consisting of a chairperson and eight ordinary members. However, section 21 provides that the council establish three standing committees to advise on matters relating to the traditional arts, the activities of local authorities in relation to the arts and artistic innovation. Each standing committee will have five members, including a chairperson to be appointed by the Minister from the members of the Arts Council. Of the remaining four members, two are to be appointed by the Minister and two by the council. This means that the Minister will make six additional appointments to the original nine appointments to the council. It is possible that other than the chairperson, the members of the council may not be represented on these committees. This must be examined to ensure that it will serve the needs of the arts in the best possible manner.</P>
    <P>The provision that members appointed to the standing committees may not necessarily be members of the council will create a possible further six ministerial appointments, bringing the total to a possible 21. It also means that the proposed structure could become cumbersome and ineffective. In the past the Arts Council was generally independent, which is probably why it clashed with so many Ministers. Even where there were political appointments, others represented various sectors of the arts. In this instance I foresee that appointments to the newly structured council will be political. The Minister or his successors will appoint those who are loyal to his party, which would be a dangerous development. It could mean that if the Minister makes a direction to a council made up of well known members of his party, they will take much greater notice of it than if they were independent. This will have to be addressed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There should be at least two members of the Arts Council on each standing committee. If representations are made to a standing committee whose membership has only one representative from the council in the form of the chairman, difficulties may arise in the relationship of the committee to the council. On Committee Stage we will have the opportunity to consider these and other aspects of the proposed structure for the council.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is passed without amendment it will represent a seismic shift in the future work of the Arts Council. It has been suggested that to restructure the council in the manner envisaged will dissipate the energy and vision of the body as a whole and it will possibly encourage a factional approach to the promotion of the arts across the country, which is undesirable.</P>
    <P>However, if my suggestions on the formation of standing committees are accepted but the Minister does not change the proposed structure, then we must question the absence of a standing committee on education. It is currently envisaged that there will be three standing committees, on the traditional arts, the role of local authorities in <Col N="1614" /> the arts and on the innovative arts. If my proposed amendment on Committee Stage is accepted, which will provide that the membership of each standing committee should contain two members from the council, the numbers envisaged will allow for the creation of a standing committee on education.</P>
    <P>Education is paramount to the future development of the arts in this country. Everything starts at school and the provision of a standing committee on education would help to ensure that in the arts, all of our children would be cherished equally. This would be in line with the spirit of the Constitution. The Arts Council's arts plans for 2002-06 recognises that due to the poor provision for the arts in formal and informal education, the opportunities for people to experience and engage with the arts are limited. The plan has detailed specific proposals to enhance the arts experience of young people. It suggests that local authorities and other local agencies be used to disseminate best practice models of arts in schools and that in conjunction with the National Youth Council of Ireland, the capacity and scope of the national youth arts programmes should be expanded.</P>
    <P>The Arts Council also recommends that capacity in arts organisations should also be expanded to enhance the experience of primary teachers in arts programming. These suggestions are especially important when we consider the report, The Arts in our Schools, undertaken on behalf of the Association of Principals and Deputy Principals. At the outset, the importance of active support and encouragement for the arts in education is clear. The report states that while a properly structured and integrated arts education programme will produce more sensitive and perceptive students, it will also stimulate learning, creativity and enhanced self esteem. The report states: &ldquo;We must bring art and the artist into the classroom. If we do not make this an absolute priority, we are moving towards a cultural wasteland.&rdquo; Unfortunately, the findings of a survey undertaken by the NAPD in November 2000 make for depressing reading.</P>
    <P>With regard to music as a taught subject in second level education, an astounding 48% of single-sex boys' schools make no provision for teaching music at junior certificate level. As if that were not bad enough, at leaving certificate level 74% of single-sex boys' schools do not offer music at all. These appalling figures are, however, not replicated to the same degree in single-sex girls' schools where 10% do not offer music at junior certificate level and 17% do not offer it for leaving certificate. The number of co-educational schools that do not offer the subject is disturbingly close to 50% for both junior and leaving certificate levels.</P>
    <P>Turning our attention to art, the report found a higher provision of art as an examination subject than music across all sectors. However, 25% of boys' schools and 8% of girls' schools make no provision for art. It is quite obvious from even the <Col N="1615" /> most cursory examination of the research findings that the provision of art and music in second level education is outrageously gender biased. Males have a significantly higher chance of completing their education cycle having had little or no artistic input or interaction. This makes depressing reading, as much for the fact that we have seen this documented so frequently in the past.</P>
    <P>The 1979 Benson report referred specifically to the poor state of music in the education system; how little has changed in the past 23 years. Report upon report has found that arts education is insufficient or virtually non-existent. The Benson report, quotes directly from the 'Design in Ireland' report, stating: &ldquo;The Irish schoolchild is visually and artistically among the most uneducated in Europe.&rdquo; This is a damning statement, a condemnation of past failings, but also a premonition of future cultural non-engagement and stagnation.</P>
    <P>The Government must tackle the appalling state of the arts in our education system, and the Arts Bill, 2002, should reflect the priority that this issue must be given. If the standing committees, inherent in the restructuring of the Arts Council, are approved, a committee with responsibility for education could effect real change for the benefit of primary and post-primary students. An urgent examination of how we might gender-proof arts education is also required, and is something that this standing committee could examine and advise upon. It is interesting to note the importance that was attached to education in the arts by the previous Administration. The proposal to convene a special committee to examine the role of the arts in education made little headway and eventually fizzled out.</P>
    <P>As well as considering these matters, we must examine certain principles that the Arts Bill, 2002, will replace, if it is enacted without amendment. When the Arts Council was established in 1951 it was provided in the Arts Act of that year that the President of Ireland &ndash; not the Taoiseach, nor the Minister &ndash; would appoint the director of the council. This was a clear recognition that the function of the Arts Council should be separate from the workings of the government in office at the time. At essence was the realisation that the Arts Council would be independent in its role. Under the terms of the legislation of 1973, the position of Chairman of the Arts Council was established, and the legislation provided that the Taoiseach would make the appointment. In this way, the working of the Arts Council was brought closer to the Government, however the function of the council remained unchanged.</P>
    <P>I will get an opportunity on Committee Stage to raise the many issues I did not get a chance to raise here today. I support the involvement of local authorities in the arts. However, there is no point giving them a role unless it is accompanied by funding. The Minister only has to contact the arts office in Kerry to realise how paltry funding is for the arts there. Many questions have been <Col N="1616" /> raised by this Bill in regard to the autonomy of the Arts Council in the future and the actual, or perceived, interference by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Ms Lynch Ms Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his new brief. I have met the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, quite frequently this week. I have been told it will not happen again for a long time that we will have so much with which to contend in this area in one week.</P>
      <P>I fully accept that the Bill before us is not one of the Minister's own making, but he has had to take it on board. It is an appalling Bill. It is a housekeeping instrument more than anything else. We could do so much better by the arts than this. It is 29 years since the last Arts Bill was introduced in this House and the previous one was in 1951. If history is to teach us anything then clearly it will be a long time before we re-visit this area again.</P>
      <P>The Minister should withdraw the Bill. I was shocked when I saw it had been five years in gestation. Five years of consultation was distilled into this Bill and all we get is 31 sections &ndash; some six pages. We can do fundamentally better than this. If the Minister is appointed to a position in the next government it will, no doubt, be to a different area of responsibility, and if he wants to leave a fitting legacy in regard to the arts then it should not be a Bill of this ilk. He needs to go back into consultation to bring forward an appropriate response to the needs of the arts sector.</P>
      <P>No more than for the Minister, the arts is a new field of expertise for me, as the new Labour Party spokesperson on the arts. I read about the consultation that had taken place, the focus groups that were set up and the community groups that had contributed. Much was made of the great enthusiasm out there for the proposed new Bill. I am sure those people are not as enthusiastic about what has been achieved.</P>
      <P>It worries me to think this legislation will control the arts world in Ireland over the coming years. It is all about control. While there are other aspects of concern, the all-consuming power of the Minister is most worrying. The Minster must be consulted at every hand's turn. The Arts Council will be unable to boil a kettle of water without consulting the Minister. This is a very distressing development.</P>
      <P>It is something of a disappointment that the Government put arts into the same portfolio as tourism and sport. It shows that it is still treating the arts as a type of Cinderella area, uncertain what to do with it, as if it does not deserve autonomy. This is the second time the Government has moved arts from a Department in its own right and thrown it in with other areas of responsibility. Arts runs the risk of becoming the poor relation to sports and tourism. This could happen very easily if we are not careful. This country has virtually gone mad over a soccer tournament and if the arts must compete with that type of enthusiasm, I am not certain it will win out or get the attention it deserves.</P>

      <Col N="1617" />It would have been preferable to create a Department of arts and culture on its own as it would give the arts the status they deserve in our society. The arts have an inherent value and I firmly believe that they warrant a dedicated Department of their own. We saw the benefits of that approach when Deputy Michael Higgins was Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. The huge vibrancy within the arts society when he was in charge of it was tangible. One could nearly feel it. People still talk about his enthusiasm for the area, his dedication to the subject and his concentration on the issues. That is something else which we need to sit down and seriously examine.</P>
    <P>It should be said that this Bill, good or bad, is the work of the Minister's predecessor, Deputy de Valera. For some reason the Bill, which fell with the last Dáil, has been reintroduced. I could understand if it were worth reintroducing, but it is not. It fails abysmally.</P>
    <P>It is now 29 years since the last Arts Act was put in place and it is about time we had a new one. The arts, culture and cultural policy in Ireland have gone through many transformations in that time and it is now appropriate that we re-examine the legislation which governs it and which will affect this important sector of Irish society.</P>
    <P>I praise Deputy Síle de Valera for putting in place a discussion forum which allowed individuals and organisations across the arts sector to air their views and in the process stimulate a good debate. I have heard nothing but good about it. That debate was very worthwhile. People felt they had an involvement and had ownership of their particular area. They felt that their view was worth listening to and that they could contribute to the development of the arts.</P>
    <P>That discussion enters an entirely new and more decisive phase as we begin to debate this Bill. The Minister outlined in detail what is contained in the Bill. The definition of the arts contained in the Bill is very disappointing and to some extent shows a lack of imagination on the part of those who drafted it. The definition of the arts is very limited and rather meaningless.</P>
    <P>This Arts Bill is about a new Ireland because there is a new Ireland, but it has no vision, imagination or energy. Where are we going? What are the arts in Ireland? How do we intend to ensure that they flourish? Where is the freedom for artists? For example, an unemployed concert pianist who goes to the local employment exchange is still asked why he or she is not out there looking for a real job. There is still no recognition of it as a worthwhile career in which people should be supported. Where in the Bill is there reference to the welfare of artists? According to the terms of the Bill, it is the function of the Minister to promote the arts, both inside and outside the State. Surely it is the function of the Minister to ensure the welfare of artists in order that they are not in a position whereby they must take up jobs to which they are unsuited and which <Col N="1618" /> will ensure that they cannot function as artists. Where is that function outlined in the Bill?</P>
    <P>The role of the Minister is very worrying. I wish to express my concern at what I regard as a serious dilution of the arm's length principle between the Minister and the Arts Council in this Bill. As a member of the board of directors of the Cork Opera House who has been at loggerheads with the Arts Council on funding, I would still agree that the council must be independent and at arm's length from Government. Even though there are times when I have disagreed with it, I still think the element of independence is vitally important.</P>
    <P>During her time in office, the former Minister, Deputy de Valera, had what could only be described as a difficult relationship with the Arts Council. As Deputy Deenihan stated, the Arts Council has had difficulties with many Ministers. Perhaps it is because it insists on its independence that it has had those difficult relationships, but it has been right to so insist. However, I am concerned that this legislation is a crude attempt to put manners on the Arts Council. I believe that parts of this Bill will not lay the ground for a good working relationship between the Minister and the Arts Council.</P>
    <P>Before the Bill was published we got a foretaste of its contents from the former Minister in a document entitled Towards a New Framework for the Arts, where she set out her views in a very plain fashion. That report stated:</P>
    <P>There is broad acceptance in the arts community and among all key arts development agencies that the arm's length principle has been appropriate to the arts environment in Ireland. There have, however, been concerns expressed on issues such as accountability and transparency and these issues should be considered in the review of the arts legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not see that here. In addition, the report went on to talk about the dangers of the arm's length approach, &ldquo;including the withdrawal of cultural decision-making from genuine public view or accountability and a potential neglect by Government of a sector which is does not control&rdquo;. Of all the matters in the world that one needs to control, expression of the arts is not one of them. It is reasonable to say that this was a very strong statement of intent on the part of the former Minister and could only be regarded as a shot across the bows on the part of the Arts Council and its governance of cultural policy.</P>
    <P>Under this legislation there is a straight choice made, favouring an arts policy that is dictated by Government rather than one which is driven by an arm's length approach. The Bill is quite clear on this matter. This is outlined in the explanatory memorandum which states that the Bill provides &ldquo;that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands shall promote the arts, both nationally and internationally, and gives recognition to the role of the Minister in formulating overall State policy on the arts&rdquo;. At the same <Col N="1619" /> time the Bill states that the plans and strategies of the Arts Council will be required to comply with Government policy on the arts. If this is not direct interference, then I do not know what is. When both of these statements are juxtaposed, it is quite clear who is the master and who is the servant. I regard this as a backward step which will do nothing to foster positive working relations between the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism and the Arts Council. It cannot be a reasonable working relationship if they are simply in the role of being subservient to Government policy and the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Bill proposes to exert a greater degree of control over a State body, the Arts Council, which has made a significant contribution to the development of arts and cultural policy over many decades. I would prefer if the Bill was designed to ensure that the relationship between the Government and the Arts Council was one of partnership rather than of subservience. It would be preferable if the Government set down clear principles which would act as a cultural policy framework within which the Arts Council could operate. That would be acceptable. These principles would reflect the Government's objectives in the area. Such a structure would allow the Arts Councils and other organisations to play a policy-proposing role.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal to reduce the membership of the Arts Council from 17 to nine. Anyone who works or participates on a committee tends, as a rule, to work more efficiently when the membership is set at a feasible level. Large committees always run the risk of becoming unwieldy and unmanageable and find it quite difficult to reach a consensus.</P>
    <P>However, the positive benefits of a slimmed down Arts Council will be undermined significantly by the creation of three standing committees to advise the Council on matters relating to Irish traditional arts, activities of local authorities in respect of the arts, and artistic innovation. This will simply mean taking people off one committee and replacing them with other people on three new sub-committees within the council according to section 21 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>However, I am more concerned that, under this section of the Bill, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism has the power to appoint three of the people to sit on these standing committees, including the chairperson of each standing committee. It is quite clear that these committees are structured to ensure an amount of power and influence in decision making, which the Minister will retain. The proposed structure is a recipe for bad relations between the Minister and the Arts Council because the Minister will effectively be interfering in the day to day business of the Arts Council.</P>
    <P>Regarding the three committees being proposed, what is the reasoning or thinking behind the creation of one pertaining to traditional Irish arts? This committee, unlike the other two, will <Col N="1620" /> be the only committee to have the power to make recommendations on the advance of moneys to any person relating to the traditional Irish arts. This is beyond me although I think I know what is behind it.</P>
    <P>Why is the Minister now introducing a form of protectionism into the traditional Irish arts, be it music, dancing, song, writing or poetry in all its forms? All Irish artists that I know, who are prepared to be innovative and sell their wares on the world stage, are quite prepared to operate in the same fora as other artists. They are convinced that they have a product and talent which will ensure they have sufficient work and that their music is heard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan spoke about Listowel in a way that only somebody from Listowel could. I could speak in the same way about Cork as I am sure the Minister could about Cahirciveen. However, the one thing that struck me about the late John B. Keane, and the reason why I admire him more and more as time goes by, was his conviction on certain issues when it was neither profitable or popular. I recently heard his interview concerning the Language Freedom Movement. I am sure that if he were here to read this Bill he would attend another meeting in the Mansion House and the same opposition that met him there in respect of the Language Freedom Movement would meet him in respect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Are we now going to have a committee that will push for a separate Arts Council in regard to traditional Irish arts? Are we going to have a separate committee that will determine who gets funding from the Arts Council in relation to traditional arts? If those people who apply are not kosher or do not come under the definition of what the committee considers strictly to be the traditional arts, are they to be excluded? I find this very worrying and cannot explain it. Why would the Minister do this at a time when Irish music and all forms of Irish art are the darlings of the world? We will now have people &ndash; I think the Minister knows who they are &ndash; ensuring that Irish music and all Irish art forms go back generations. There will be nobody raising their hands while dancing to an Irish jig. We will go back to strictly Irish and that worries me. I ask the Minister to take a second look at the issue.</P>
    <P>With regard to local authorities, I could not agree more with Deputy Deenihan. Cork has been very fortunate in being awarded the honour of European capital of culture for 2005, but we have no additional funding. The section dealing with local authorities should use the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo;. If the Minister legislates for it, we will get funding, as he and I know. Therefore, the lukewarm approach taken in this Bill in respect of local authorities is very deliberate. The arts budget for any local authority is appalling. We are fighting over crumbs with people who desperately want to make a living in the world of arts and culture.</P>
    <P>I warn against putting the three standing committees on a legislative footing given that it will <Col N="1621" /> be many years before we see the introduction a new arts Act. I am concerned that these committees will be sewn into the Arts Council structure until such time as there is new legislation. It removes a significant amount of flexibility and room for manoeuvre from the Arts Council. I am not convinced that this has been well thought out and I do not know what the rationale is behind the creation of the committees. Arguably, it could be said that the Government does not trust the Arts Council. That is what this Bill is clearly saying. Consequently, the Government wishes to build in its own majority into each of the three committees to ensure the Minister will get his own way. This is also made quite plain in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 21(11) states:</P>
    <P>The Council shall in the performance of its functions take into account any advice given to it by a standing committee in so far as it relates to any such function.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister pays the piper and in this case the Arts Council must play his tune.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents a wasted opportunity. It is poor legislation and it is a misnomer to call it an Arts Bill. It is really a Bill designed to shackle the Arts Council to ensure it will do exactly what the Government wants. The Government is not very imaginative in respect of the arts.</P>
    <P>This Bill, if passed, will shape the future of State support for the arts for the next 25 years. On this basis, I urge the Minister not to make changes that he feels will place the Arts Council in a strait-jacket from which it will be unable to free itself until new legislation is introduced. The Arts Council should be structured in such a fashion that it can deal with the changes that will inevitably take place in all sectors of the arts over the coming years.</P>
    <P>The Minister inherited this Bill. I know he did not have much time to look at it, but I appeal to him to withdraw it. We can do an awful lot better than this. This is not a time for retrenchment. We should be looking to the future, which is bright in respect of the arts in Ireland. The Minister could leave after him legislation worthy of the arts in Ireland, which this Bill is not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sharing my time with Deputy Finian McGrath.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his new brief. He has an historic opportunity to amend the mistakes made by his predecessor in bringing the Bill forward in this format. Like some of the previous speakers, I echo my disappointment at the separation of arts and culture. Arts cannot exist without culture and <i>vice versa</i>. It will be difficult to create a definite identity in terms of our artistic and cultural heritage if the two areas are promoted by different Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, as it stands, is flawed. It provides the Government with more control, not less, over the arts. The arts do not operate in a controlled environment. In pushing this Bill we may be creating, to exaggerate slightly, an environment akin to <Col N="1622" /> Eastern Europe of the 1950s, with its Stalinist control over creative self-expression, or the USA during the McCarthy era, where people who thought differently were labelled &ldquo;reds&rdquo; and lived in fear of their lives.</P>
    <P>There are some positive developments in this Bill. I welcome the reduction in Arts Council membership and the introduction of rolling membership to enable proper continuity. However, in a single stroke this one welcome feature has been destroyed by section 21, which provides for the council to establish three standing committees. Why is there a need to set up three so-called standing committees? Art should stand on its own merit. It should not be protectionist, but should have intrinsic cultural value. Who decides what is covered by the term &ldquo;Irish traditional arts&rdquo;, for example?</P>
    <P>In relation to local authority arts activity the Bill is more specific, but this is a further drive towards centralisation because local authorities do not have the funding nor the creativity to promote the arts in their own right. South Dublin County Council, whose area I come from, has run a highly successful Per Cent for Art scheme which has promoted local artists working in a variety of media. If the new Arts Council is to have too much input into that process, we will in effect be creating a centralised authority and removing power from local authorities. While to some extent I welcome the Arts Council's role of speaking on behalf of those involved in the arts, it will have one hand tied behind its back because of ministerial control. Who designates the three sectors? Who decides, for example, whether new art and innovation is new and innovative? It is possible to take something new, add it to something old and fuse the two. Is that new, or is it a new way of saying something old? What is new art? What is innovation?</P>
    <P>This Bill effectively castrates the Arts Council. If a cat is castrated it becomes docile. It wants to stay close to home and not go out and explore new territory. Art is all about celebrating the old and celebrating diversity, but it is also about discovering new territory. This cannot be done without the freedom to explore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of this Bill, which is intended to update the existing arts legislation and make it more relevant and appropriate to the present day. We all need to examine carefully what has happened to the arts over the last 20 years. We urgently need to bring the arts &ndash; traditional music, language, drama, mime, street theatre and the activities of different cultures &ndash; back to the ordinary person. We need to end the current exclusion of ordinary people from the field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We particularly need to develop the arts at primary school level. Schools and community groups in disadvantaged areas need to be funded properly. The current feeling is that these groups receive a few crumbs from the table and this is not good enough. After-school art projects and <Col N="1623" /> art therapy, among other things, can no longer be allowed to exist on shoestring budgets. Schools in the inner city and in disadvantaged areas have been obliged to close down projects in art therapy because they were &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,000 short. Art therapy is particularly effective for dysfunctional and disruptive children who are crying out for help and it will prevent many of them ending up in prison. We must escape the Dublin 4 mind-set which says the arts are for the rich. Many community-based festivals such as the St. Patrick's Day parade and the Galway Arts Festival have gone out of their way to include the poorer sections of society. This needs to be developed further.</P>
    <P>Poetry and creative writing can be used in disadvantaged communities to help with literacy problems. Over the last 20 years I have seen this at first hand in my own school. Children who have major difficulties with reading and books can gain confidence from music and poetry, especially when it is relevant and written by people who are based in the working class, so that within a matter of months they want to join the reading groups in their classes. Let us use the arts as a resource for helping children, particularly those with a disability, and to lift their self-esteem and confidence. I welcome the section which gives specific recognition to the independence of the Arts Council's decisions about the disbursement of funding. This is a positive step, but all decisions on funding should be transparent.</P>
    <P>On a more critical note, I have major reservations about reducing the Arts Council membership from 17 to nine. I caution the Minister that while 17 might be top-heavy from a bureaucratic point of view, nine is definitely too low to represent most groups and prevent elitism. I urge the Minister to consider my proposal of 12 members. The council needs to be balanced, strategic and transparent. That is the way forward.</P>
    <P>In section 6, dealing with local authorities, I am concerned about the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, as in &ldquo;may provide financial or other assistance&rdquo;. That is a bit windy and lacks strength. It would be better to use the word &ldquo;should&rdquo; and I hope the Minister will change this. I have outlined my concerns and my criticisms. I urge the Minister to reflect further and to introduce an Arts Bill that shows balance, professionalism, creativity and concern for the poorer sections of society. Above all, we need a Bill with teeth to develop the arts in this country. I wish the Minister well with his new portfolio.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach. Is ceart labhairt faoin Bhille seo. Tá rudaí maithe ann agus molaim a lán atá sa Bhille. There are many good things in the Bill. It recognises the increasingly central role played by the arts in our society and I welcome the fact that it brings the 1973 Act into line with contemporary concerns by attempting to define the arts in more inclusive terms. Also welcome is the emphasis on the crucial role local authorities can play in promoting the arts. However, this is surely a role that will require more resources at local level if it is to be successful. The powers conferred by the Bill upon the Minister and his Department give rise to a number of questions. Perhaps the Minister, in his response, could address these points.</P>
      <P>Can we be sure, in practice, that the emphasis on the policy-making role of the Minister is not in conflict with the assurances of the continuing independence of the Arts Council? This is a critical issue. We read quite frequently about intense controversies, not just in Ireland but all over the world, involving the artistic community and Ministers or Government Departments. If we are to err, it should be on the liberal side so as to allow the artists and the Arts Council to have their heads. The Minister or Department should interfere very rarely. The balance in this Bill could be redressed somewhat to allow more independence to the Arts Council.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister explain the rationale for the creation under the Bill of three new Arts Council standing committees in the areas of traditional arts, innovation and local authorities given that the Arts Council has to date been autonomous in its choice of policy priorities, committees and advisers? Is the Bill prescribing too much for the Arts Council? While I appreciate that there is scope in the Bill to set up other committees, by giving these standing committees recognition in law, the Bill is determining the arts in too strong a way. It should be left to the Arts Council to make these decisions. How will the new standing committees and departmental policies represent artists of all disciplines who continue to contribute so much, often on slender resources, to the enrichment of the culture of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of contributors asked what arts mean to the people. I suppose that, if the people like it, it is art and that is it. If they want the activity, they find it brings pleasure to them and they enjoy it, it is an artistic form. Many people believe that attending a classical music recital or a painting exhibition is the exclusive domain of the middle classes. What is important in arts policy and is enshrined in the Bill is that local authorities have a budget for promotion of the arts locally. If one travels throughout the country, one <Col N="1625" /> will see many fine museums and art galleries. In Drogheda, which I am sure the Minister will visit and where he will be very welcome to the local arts centre, we have a dynamic inter-relationship between the local authorities, Louth County Council and Drogheda Borough Council, and the local community through a state of the art centre whose construction was funded by the local authority and the jobs in which are funded through community employment and FÁS schemes.</P>
    <P>The problem is, if the people do not come to arts centres or to the arts, the arts must be brought to the people. We need much more investment in local communities through outreach programmes. We need to go into the poorer areas of cities and towns and into the concrete jungles and bring to them the experience of the whole spectrum of the arts. We need to interact with young people, especially those who feel excluded from society, who are not given any resources in their communities and who have no choice but to become involved in drugs, crime or vandalism. We need a much more progressive policy of reaching out into these communities. We need to bring musicians and other practitioners of the arts into these communities &ndash; someone mentioned poetry &ndash; to show them what a wonderful, rich and fantastic heritage we have in Ireland. People in these areas do not feel part of society and they believe it does not care about them. This progressive policy will make a difference.</P>
    <P>Another development which I have noticed in my community is involvement with senior citizens' groups. In Drogheda we have a cottage hospital in which there is a senior citizens' group in the day care centre. It is a progressive and useful society with painting competitions being held and artists coming to visit. It is fantastic to see pensioners in their 70s and 80s painting scenes of their childhood or environment. It gives them a great sense of belonging and of being part of the community to produce something so fine and wonderful as a painting of a plant, flower or tree in their back garden or street in the community. There is an important outreach programme in County Monaghan of bringing art to the psychiatric hospitals. As a member of a health board I have visited psychiatric hospitals where the majority of patients never have a visitor. To have an active arts programme in these institutions is a significant and worthy thing to do. The North-Eastern Health Board has a progressive and active policy in this regard which I would like extended nationally. It brings light into the world of the people to whom I refer and brings their world to us.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are under-funded in supporting the arts. The Bill requires them to provide support but does not necessarily provide funding for that through the Arts Council. Perhaps that could be clarified. Local authorities tend to be hidebound with bureaucracy and do not tend to be dynamic organisations. The appointment of arts officers to many local authorities is changing <Col N="1626" /> the face not just of communities, but also of local government. That is worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The issue of arts in education is broad. The old art class was where everyone ended up who did not want to do home economics, woodwork or metalwork, despite these being arts in themselves. Modern teaching of art in school is of a very high standard. The interaction between teachers and students from my experience has been first class. We are changing as a society. We are showing more tolerance of and respect for the arts and are becoming more involved. Communities are becoming more involved.</P>
    <P>John Thaw through his television programmes made classical music popular for many people because, when he listened to the classics, so did many ordinary people. We need to have many more public concerts in our cities and towns. I know there is a progressive policy in the Arts Council of promoting excellent musicians to visit arts centres, but I would like a much more sustained programme of public concerts.</P>
    <P>Our weather is not always clement, but I do not see why we should not have some classical music sessions in shopping centres, for example. I do not see why we should not have more on the street involvement between the artistic community and shopping areas. We must bring the arts alive and, while the Bill goes a long way towards doing that by giving certain statutory powers to the Arts Council, we need a little more imagination. I would like a brave new world in the arts where we get out more and become more involved.</P>
    <P>I would like in our policy towards the arts generally a more sustained campaign between public and private enterprise. While I acknowledge that a number of wealthy companies contribute significantly to artistic life generally, I would like a much more sustained programme and greater involvement of companies and wealthy individuals in society. I would like to see them give much more to the arts. An active policy through the Minister's Department could be constructive and helpful in this regard.</P>
    <P>For most people life is a humdrum, two dimensional affair of family and work. The arts brighten up people's lives. The world I would like to see would be a much livelier and three dimensional place. We have many fine museums and art galleries. Although I know it is not easy, I would like some of our finer paintings brought to provincial centres. I know there may be a problem with insurance. However, not everyone can go to the art galleries or museums in Dublin. I would like to see a policy where we could bring the arts to our local community. Molaim an Bille seo. Tá rudaí maithe ann agus tá rudaí nach bhfuil mé ró-shásta leo ach is tosnú maith é.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill. I congratulate the Minister and wish him well in his new post. It is appropriate that a Member from his particular part of the country should grace the Department. I am sure <Col N="1627" /> he will do well and he may be assured of good constructive comment from this side of the House.</P>
      <P>The Bill will take into account the changes that have taken place in society over the past 25 years, particularly the changes in appreciation of the various forms of the arts. There has been a change, too, in appreciation of art. When I was younger art exhibitions in rural areas were unheard of, but they are now commonplace and the standard is high. Art needs to be nurtured and encouraged. In a Department where I was once Minister of State art and local enterprise were encouraged. The Department encouraged people with time and energy to spend time improving their skills and flair in this area. For a small amount of money a huge degree of appreciation was achieved by both those participating and the public.</P>
      <P>The area of art in school needs further attention. It is amazing that so many young people have a natural flair. While a lot of work is done in schools, the Minister and his Department could do a lot more and work with the Department of Education and Science to encourage those with ability to proceed along those lines. Everybody has a flair for something. Some are good at maths, some at music, some at painting and so on. We should try to encourage people with a forte in any particular area. In the future I hope this can be done to a greater extent than it has been done in the past. There is huge scope for enjoyment, participation and funding for something which is beneficial, pleasing to the eye and a source of satisfaction to the person who has done the work.</P>
      <P>For several years I have endeavoured to table questions to the Minister in respect of a particular form of the arts &ndash; the circus, which is not as prominent as it used to be. I know that it is debatable whether a circus performance is an art form, but I believe it is. When I tabled questions I was given the old story that it was a matter for the Arts Council and that the Minister had no responsibility to the House. I know it is possible to answer parliamentary questions in the House in respect of bodies where, although they are autonomous, the Minister has a function in determining their policy. This attitude that has developed in the House of separating accountability in the House from the performance of the organisation is wrong. It is bad for the image of the House and bad in terms of public appreciation for what we do. It needs to be changed. It makes life easy for Government, but is still wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all received correspondence during the years pointing out various cultural changes and developments that have taken place that affect the circus. We have been left in a situation where there may not be the same space for circuses to perform, where there is no longer the same appreciation for the circus that there used to be, there is no longer the same revenue to be generated and the overheads have grown <Col N="1628" /> dramatically. A circus on tour now involves huge costs. We are conscious of the need to preserve the arts for future generations. It is important then that we should keep in mind the vulnerability of some forms of the arts in our modern environment and try to ensure help is offered.</P>
    <P>Sports, recreation and the arts have an affinity with each other. Culture used to be incorporated in this area. I do not suggest that the Minister opposite lacks culture. The part of the country from which he comes is an area of countless cultural activities. There is scope for incorporating culture in the area covered by his Department. It is important to recognise that we have many demands competing with each other. There is competition for money from the Department from each section. Sports, recreation and the arts all make their own demands and I hope culture will also fall within that remit. Competition forces some activities to the side. I urge the Minister to keep that in mind.</P>
    <P>Along with other speakers, I agree that it is important for art to be brought to the people and that it is promoted in all parts of the country. As my colleague, Deputy O'Dowd, said, there is no sense in having objects of artistic interest unless they are on display and people can see and enjoy them. Access should be readily available but that is not always the case. I hope that, in the course of his tenure, the Minister can take a long, hard look at the deployment of art in its various forms with a view to ensuring that it is not just in city centres and that access is available nation-wide.</P>
    <P>The various local authorities now promote the arts and heritage and it has been recorded on canvas and in stone and wood. It occurs to me that the need to link up with local authorities is obvious in the promotion of art. A suitably qualified person is needed in each local authority area to liaise in a meaningful way with the Arts Council to facilitate a contribution from the locality that will benefit the nation and, at the same time, receive comment, guidance and assistance, as necessary, so as to bring the scheme together as opposed to allowing local artists travel the road alone or over-supervising them to a stifling extent.</P>
    <P>I notice the Minister seems anxious to close. Is he just resting &ndash; perhaps having an artistic slumber?</P>

      <P>Occasionally, they say. With every new Administration come different Ministers who have different ways of administering their Departments. The Minister's predecessor did a good job in the Department. The opportunity arises for him to put his stamp on the Department in a way that is beneficial to all and will provide a good and useful legacy for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vital to promote the arts at a local level as well as introducing the means to do so. I do not know what the Minister proposes to this end in <Col N="1629" /> schools and colleges, but it is important that he examines this matter at an early stage.</P>
    <P>In the past 20 years Irish music and culture generally has carved out a niche for itself, not only in this country but all over the world, particularly in the United States and Europe. We are unique in the sense that we were able to sell ourselves through the media of music and song in a way other countries have been unable to do. The world of the arts can be used easily, conveniently and profitably to promote this country and its artists and it does not require much promotion once the system is off the ground. All that is required is that those who are performing do so at the highest level, that they have backup, advice and assistance available to them initially and that they can sell themselves in the world-wide marketplace as they wish.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister pursues a course that is beneficial to interested parties in the future. If he does so, the country and its people will reap generous rewards. In the context of our debate on tourism yesterday, there is no better way to sell one's country than through this medium. It also presents an opportunity for the Minister to pursue his objectives in that area which I am sure will be complementary to the world of art.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this Bill. It has long been promised and has been described as major renovating legislation regarding the arts. It was necessary that the founding legislation of the 1951 and 1973 Acts be updated because they are significant in terms of their omissions. Neither, for example, recognises dance as an art form. Another interesting omission from that legislation was that the capacity for innovation in artistic activity was not sufficiently allowed for. However, this proposed legislation is seriously flawed in a number of respects. Since the removal of the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; from the title of the Department of which I had the honour of being the first Minister &ndash; the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht &ndash; it is difficult to detect any movement towards a comprehensive policy regarding culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Culture is usually defined in an anthropological sense, as in UNESCO's Our Creative Diversity and the Council of Europe document In From the Margins. These refer to the totality of our lives &ndash; the way we are &ndash; and regard artistic activity as one form or expression of culture. It was a serious regression to remove the reference to culture from the title of the Department. When the Minister came to reform the 1951 and 1973 legislation, if he had done so within a definition of culture he would have arrived at a different kind of legislation. Having divided the Department, natural heritage has been returned to the Department of the Environment and Local Government, built heritage to the Office of Public Works &ndash; accountable to some place that is unknown &ndash; and broadcasting to the Department of Communications, the Marine and Natural <Col N="1630" /> Resources. All that is left in Mespil Road is an assistant secretary in the waterways section of a Department which was once known as the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>What is missing from the legislation is a vision of the kind of role artistic activity might play in Ireland. For example, in 1979 the Benson report referred to the importance of creativity. It made a powerful statement, which was not influenced by the parties on either side of the House, to the effect that creativity was social and that the capacity for creativity being delivered &ndash; as it is through symbolic behaviour &ndash; was available to every child. It was succeeded, in turn, by a set of reports on music, from Deaf Ears, the original, through to that chaired by John O'Connor while I was Minister, namely, the PIANO report on musical education. The general assumption or vision which ran through those reports was that creativity was very important, inherent in every person, old or young, and that all one needed to do was create the vehicles for its expression.</P>
    <P>A major debate followed the appearance of these reports. There were people on one side who said one would have to sacrifice excellence if one was to celebrate community arts, while those on the other side stated everybody could be allowed to participate which would lead to a rise in levels across the board and that this, in turn, would mean that excellence would be assured, but at a higher level.</P>
    <P>There have been reports on dance, music, musical education, access and creativity. One could expect that these would be reflected in reform of legislation in relation to the arts if we had in place a Department of Culture. What we have, however, is a Department to which the arts are attached as a subsection of a larger whole. In section 2(1) the arts are defined as &ldquo;any creative or interpretative expression (whether traditional or contemporary).&rdquo; The pity is, however, that this extraordinary use of the term &ldquo;traditional or contemporary&rdquo; is not repeated consistently throughout the legislation. For example, when it comes to dealing with artistic expression through the medium of the Irish language it is rather narrowly defined and not defined generally at all. The vision is limited. I suggest that the use of Irish in this way will lead inevitably to a kind of ghettoisation of the language as something which is in the first narrowing, linguistic and in the second narrowing, traditionally linguistic, meaning that it will then become preserved.</P>
    <P>The Minister must explain the reason he was so anxious to abandon the arm's length principle. When the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht was being established in 1993 I considered the debates that took place throughout Europe on matters of this nature. In those debates artists generally stated the farther away one could keep creative expression from Governments, Ministers and Parliaments the better. They wanted a kind of artistic autonomy. However, when I wanted to bring into existence a Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht <Col N="1631" /> and justify that existence I did so by accepting the principle that the council which would allocate funding would be kept at arm's length from the agency of the State, the ministry or Department involved.</P>
    <P>The principle to which I refer is not respected in the legislation before us. The membership of the council is being reduced from 17 to nine and the Minister will have responsibility for appointing the chairpersons of the three significant sub-committees. These sub-committees, in turn, are not treated equally. One will have the right to make recommendations in relation to finance, but the legislation is extraordinarily silent in relation to the other two.</P>
    <P>The relationship of the Arts Council to other Departments is far from clearly stated. One of the most important issues facing any Minister &ndash; the current Minister has my support in a cross-party sense in this &ndash; will be the need to encourage the Department of Education and Science to deal properly with its responsibilities. If one drew a line from Drogheda across to Limerick, one would discover that everything to the left of it is seriously deficient in relation to musical education. There has been a campaign for many years by interest groups in Galway for the establishment of a school of music. There is a chair of music there which cannot be filled while, at the same time, people are obliged to travel to Dublin every weekend for music lessons. There is a serious deficiency in musical education.</P>
    <P>I find it extraordinary that in its programme the Government states, in reference to education, that every child in the country must be given an opportunity of having access to the enterprise culture. However, the word &ldquo;music&rdquo; does not appear once in 34 pages. I hope the Department of Education and Science will be leaned upon to meet its obligations in relation to basic musical education. Those obligations will not be met by releasing 100,000 tin whistles on the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the kind of approach which, I am informed, is favoured and it is far from satisfactory.</P>
      <P>In a curious way we have a terrible habit of continually astounding ourselves in terms of what we produce, etc. Ireland is among the worst countries in the western world in respect of musical education, in terms of the both the facilities and resources on offer. I once proposed a small pilot scheme &ndash; it horrified the Department of Finance which informed me that I was practically operating <i>ultra vires</i>&ndash; to gather up all the instruments lying unused in people's attics, etc., and make them available to others through the medium of a musical instrument bank. That is still a good idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation is deficient in vision and I find its treatment of creativity and the Irish community to be very seriously limited. The relation<Col N="1632" /> ship between the Arts Council, as it is proposed, and other Departments is unspecified. With regard to the concept of the new international agency, perhaps this is a good idea and worthy of debate. The Department of Foreign Affairs no longer has the old cultural relations committee which was inadequately funded. The Department always defended that committee because it provided for a smattering of piano playing when its officials were trying to sell beef and fish abroad. However, the Department has called it a day and held up the white flag. It is now suggested that the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism will be responsible, nationally and internationally, for the promotion of State policy on the arts. I wish him well in this.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that local authorities, which were given the capacity to assist the arts in 1974 &ndash; I stand open to correction on this &ndash; will not now be able to promote them without having regard to Government policy relating to the arts. That is an extraordinary intrusion into the decision-making of local authorities. Equally, the three sub-committees which fall under the remit of the Arts Council cannot propose anything without also having regard to Government policy relating to the arts. Why does the Minister need to have his hand stuck so far into the Arts Council when he is already reducing its membership from 17 to nine, taking responsibility for appointing its chairperson and the chairpersons of the three significant sub-committees and informing local authorities throughout the country that they cannot make proposals or take action without having regard to Government policy relating to the arts? Who will make the announcement in that regard?</P>
    <P>The Government programme is silent on music, does not commit itself to any programme of access and fails to make reference to creativity, venues, dance or local authority funding. If the Government programme is silent on the matter, do we then do nothing? In respect of that question, we have the ubiquitous presence of the Minister for Finance who has managed to find himself, by agreeing to it, referred to in every section of the legislation. Section 14 suggests that remuneration by the council and allowances for expenses will be decided by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>However, the consent of the Minister for Finance runs right through the Bill. In that respect it is a very dull report.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15043/02]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the talks at Weston Park last summer, the two Governments published a package of proposals on 1 August to address the key outstanding issues of the Good Friday Agreement &ndash; policing, decommissioning, demilitarisation and the stability of the institutions. Since then, we have been able to make progress across the range of issues.</P>
      <P>The new Policing Board has been established since November and has made encouraging progress in tackling a number of difficult and sensitive issues. It has also appointed the Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police, Hugh Orde, as the new Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The Government congratulates Mr. Orde on his appointment and looks forward to working closely with him when he assumes duty later this summer.</P>
      <P>I cannot stress enough the importance of achieving the Agreement's goal of securing a police service which attracts the support of all sections of the community. It is encouraging that new recruitment to the PSNI is representative of both communities. Against the background of recent violence in interface areas across Northern Ireland, the PSNI also needs to demonstrate that it can deal in a proactive, consistent and impartial way with events on the street in order that it can develop and retain cross-community support and confidence.</P>
      <P>The Government remains committed to the full implementation of the Patten report. We welcome the continuing role of the oversight commissioner, Tom Constantine, in benchmarking that process and look forward to the time when all parties in Northern Ireland support and participate in the new policing arrangements.</P>
      <P>Two acts of IRA decommissioning have been carried out since last August, the most recent in April when the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning reported it had witnessed an event in which a substantial and varied amount of weapons was put beyond use. Progress is also being made on security normalisation, including the undertaking of the demilitarisation measures specified in the Weston Park package. In January, additional measures were announced, including the closure of Ebrington Barracks in Derry and the dismantling of the observation tower at Glassdrummond in south Armagh. In May a significant financial package was announced by the British Government which will allow regeneration of specified former military bases for local investment and community purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to allegations of collusion by the security forces, the Government's position remains that a public inquiry into the murder in 1989 of the human rights lawyer, Pat Finucane, is necessary. The Irish and British Governments have recently appointed Canadian judge, Peter de <Col N="1634" /> Cory, to investigate this and other cases, including those of Rosemary Nelson and Robert Hamill. Both Governments have agreed to implement his recommendations, including where he recommends that a public inquiry be established.</P>
    <P>The institutions of the Agreement are continuing their important work. The North-South Ministerial Council will meet again in plenary session tomorrow in Armagh, bringing together representatives of the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive. The British-Irish Council held its third summit in Jersey on Friday, 14 June with the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair in attendance.</P>
    <P>The Secretary of State and I jointly chaired a meeting of the pro-Agreement parties at Hillsborough yesterday. This implementation group provided a valuable forum for the parties to review the progress that has been made, address the current strains within the process and renew our collective determination to achieve the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects.</P>
    <P>There are issues of confidence on all sides, which need to be addressed. This is primarily the reason the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair are planning a visit next week to Northern Ireland to meet all the parties and renew our collective commitment to the process. We now need to focus not only on implementation, but also on the consolidation of the Agreement. We need to find positive and creative ways to demonstrate to people that the Agreement works for them and is delivering for all parts of the community. We will continue our efforts, together with the British Government and the pro-Agreement parties, to ensure the Agreement is implemented in full and its institutions, which represent its democratic core, are further consolidated and secured.</P>

      <P>I take the opportunity to welcome the progress made in implementing the Good Friday Agreement and join the Minister in wishing the new Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland well. In relation to the recent Panorama programme on BBC, which alleged collusion between the security services in Northern Ireland in the death of Mr. Finucane, has the Minister raised the matter with his counterpart in the British Government, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, since it was broadcast and, if so, when?</P>
      <P>Does he expect that the Canadian judge, Peter de Cory, will be able to get to the bottom of these allegations? Does he agree that if both sides of the community in Northern Ireland are to be encouraged to continue to support the Police Service of Northern Ireland and develop such support, the serious allegations of the nature of those broadcast by Panorama need to be fully and thoroughly investigated and that justice must not only be done, but must be seen to be done?</P>

      <P>The Deputy, whom I congratulate on his appointment as spokesman for foreign <Col N="1635" /> affairs, will be aware that we have been dealing with this issue for a long time, nearly 13 years now. While the Government retained its stated position of seeking a public inquiry at Weston Park, as a result of discussions it held there, it obtained the agreement of the British Government to appoint Mr. Justice de Cory to examine all papers. Both Governments have given a prior commitment to implement his recommendation, whatever that may be.</P>
      <P>The matters referred to in the recent television programme add to the legitimate concern many people have expressed in relation to this and other cases. We await also the publication of the Stephen's report on this matter. I assure the Deputy that the British Government is totally aware of the Government's position. As I said, in the past week or thereabouts we have formally appointed Mr. Justice Peter de Cory as part of the Weston Park proposals. I am delighted to have met him and I am very satisfied he will deal with this matter in a very professional and conscientious way. I am glad a person of his international repute, who has experience in human rights law, will be given this task. He has indicated to both myself and the Taoiseach that he intends dealing with his task as quickly as possible given the complexities involved. The Deputy can be assured that these matters are a priority for the Government.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and I discussed the situation in the Middle East with our European partners at both the General Affairs Council last week and the European Council in Seville over the weekend. A declaration on the Middle East was issued in the conclusions to the Seville Council. The declaration called for the implementation of the most promising initiative being undertaken at the moment, which is the proposal to hold an international conference to discuss the situation in the Middle East. Ireland and our European Union partners support an early convening of the conference, which should address political and economic aspects as well as matters relating to security. It should confirm the parameters of a political solution on a realistic and well defined time scale. It should have wide regional involvement and appropriate participation by all the major actors.</P>
      <P>The Seville declaration stressed the need for urgent action by the international community to address the situation in its political, security and economic aspects. It condemned all terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians and stated that the fight against terrorism must be accompanied by negotiation of a political solution. The objective is an end to the occupation and the establishment of a Palestinian state on the basis of the 1967 borders, with minor adjustments. The result should be two states living side by side within secure and recognised borders enjoying normal relations with their neighbours. Fair solutions will have to be found to the issues of Jerusalem and refugees.</P>
      <P>The declaration supports reform of the Palestinian Authority and calls for an end to military operations in the occupied territories and restrictions on movement. It pointed out that walls will not bring peace and it renewed the European Union's commitment to work with all concerned to pursue every opportunity to bring peace to the region. It reiterated our commitment to contributing fully to peace building, as well as to the reconstruction of the Palestinian economy as an integral part of regional development. Ireland is committed to contributing over &euro;5 million in aid this year to the Palestinian people and the European Union remains a principal contributor to the Palestinian economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are extremely concerned at the deterioration of the situation in the Middle East in the past fortnight. We utterly condemned last week's terrorist attacks, but we believe the recent actions of the Israeli authorities will only fuel tensions in the region and could lead to further attacks by Palestinian militants. The occupation of Palestinian lands, attacks on Palestinians and the destruc<Col N="1637" /> tion of Palestinian infrastructure will only tend to provoke further terrorist actions, unacceptable and counterproductive as they may be. It makes little sense to call for action against terrorism, while at the same time destroying or paralysing the means available to the Palestinian Authority to carry out such a policy.</P>
    <P>Ireland and our EU partners will work with the parties and with our partners in the international community, especially with the United States in the quartet grouping, to achieve these goals and to pursue every opportunity for peace and for a decent future for all the people of the region. We welcome the announcement yesterday by the Palestinian Authority of a reform plan and dates for presidential and legislative elections. We call on all concerned to make it possible to hold these elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explicitly comment on the initiative of the United States? Annex 6, page 35 of the Seville Presidency conclusions, which makes reference to the Middle East, contains a certain amount of vagueness in the first and final paragraphs. When the Minister says the European Union will take an increased interest in the issue of the Middle East or continue its efforts in the framework of the quartet, it raises the question of what is the status of the US proposals in the context of the quartet?</P>
      <P>The Minister's answer today and Annex 6 of the Seville Presidency conclusions suggest that the problem is the nature of the Palestinian Authority. Is not the complete rejection by Israel of different UN resolutions, its insistence on occupation and its abuse of military force not a greater problem? Why did that not feature in the Seville Presidency conclusions? There is a single sentence asking for a reduction in military activity. It is hard to know what initiatives the Minister favours. If he is confining himself to the quartet, is he bound by the US proposal? If he is not bound by it, what is he doing in the context of the quartet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The involvement of the European Union in the quartet is set out in its statement to the quartet on 12 May. We are in a very difficult and problematic situation with very little optimism about how we can solve the problem. I acknowledge, as we have done repeatedly at both Government and EU level, that the question of adherence to Security Council resolutions is an important aspect of resolution of this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some positive aspects to the statement by the US President. There are also aspects to it with which we would not necessarily agree. We welcome the US engagement in the process, but we consider that the question of the Palestinian leadership is one for the Palestinian people to decide. We hope efforts will continue to convene an international conference at which the various participants can express their views on how the vision of a two state solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can be achieved. We will continue <Col N="1638" /> to contribute to this process in particular through our input in the co-ordination of the EU position within the quartet.</P>
    <P>The only real palpable initiative that is currently available is the need to call an international conference. It is clear the Oslo process is in serious trouble. There is violence and counter violence, suicide bombings, incursions and occupation. This is the outcome of there not being a peace process in any tangible sense at present. The need to have an international conference to engender some sense of direction, purpose and possibility to the continuing terrible problems is the best possible way forward as we see it. However, a huge job remains to be done. There is a total absence of confidence in either party's ability to sit down and resolve this problem between the two of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister's view of the expression about the re-election of President Arafat made by the US President, which seems to have received tacit support from the United Kingdom Prime Minister in recent days? Has the Department of Foreign Affairs assessed the implications for Ireland of an increase in the conflict in the Middle East? What steps has the Minister and the EU taken to ensure the US view, which seems to have been given tacit support by the UK, is not the prevailing view and that we respect the right of the Palestinian people to chose their own leaders as they see fit?</P>

It is only fair to say he has confirmed that the question of the leadership of the Palestinian people is a matter for Palestinian people to decide. Regarding the current reality, the British Prime Minister says the Palestinian Authority will need to be given the wherewithal to act. I referred in my initial reply to the fact that it is very difficult for the Palestinian Authority to deal with many of the serious problems that exist if part of the military response of the Israeli government is to destroy the infrastructure and the capability by which one might be able to deal with those who are involved in suicide bombings and those who are putting at risk peace and security within Israel. Israeli citizens are entitled to peace and security also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From our point of view, it is very important to try to get people around a table at an international conference. We need to try to get interlocutors who will deal with each other. At the moment we do not have that possibility. There is an absence of confidence on the Israeli side in the capacity of the Palestinian Authority to provide the basic security it requires. I have made the point to the Israelis that it is very difficult to objectively test that ability if one is systematically destroying the infrastructure by which one might be able to achieve it. Therefore, we have a vicious circle of assertion and counter assertion as to the bone fides of both sides to deal with the issue in <Col N="1639" /> the context of the peace process and finding a political track that will also need a security track.</P>
    <P>The Tenet agreement is the key to getting the Mitchell train to leave the station. However, we have now reached a stage where there is not a basis on which talks are taking place and we need to re-establish that. The idea behind the international conference is to try to pull that together because leaving it to the Israelis and Palestinians alone clearly means the peace process will not progress in the near future.</P>

      <P>When does the Minister believe the international conference will take place? Annex 6 of the Seville Presidency conclusions states that the objective is an end to the occupation and the early establishment of a democratic, viable, peaceful and sovereign state of Palestine on the basis of its 1967 borders, if necessary with minor adjustments agreed by the parties. What is the position of that aspiration within the work the Minister is doing on a common basis within the quartet?</P>

      <P>The Minister did not address the part of the question I asked in relation to whether an assessment has been done of the implications for Ireland of an escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. Is there uniformity in the approach of the European Council of Ministers to this matter? Are the British and other EU Governments singing off the same hymn sheet in relation to what is happening in the Middle East or has Mr. Blair and his Government gone off on a solo run? What is the status of the British announcement in recent days?</P>

      <P>The position of the EU <i>vis-à-vis </i>the quartet and the level of agreement with the US, for example, is set out in the statement of 12 May. That sets out the common position as far as one can set out such a position. There are differences of opinion between the EU and the United States regarding aspects of this matter &ndash; there is no point in saying otherwise. It could also be suggested that there are different approaches within the Bush Administration.</P>
      <P>I have not conducted a specific assessment on the deterioration in the region. As we all know any deterioration in the Middle East has not only local and regional implications but, in the worst case scenario, more widespread ones as well. Clearly the Middle East is a place where we are continuing and increasing the expansion of exports. Obviously political instability in any part of the world affects our interests in so far as we have them in that region. We are trying to work with others in the European Union to see what way we can stabilise the region and provide a framework by which a political tract can be recreated which will lead to real engagement between the parties.</P>

The European Union is the only organ that is providing the financial wherewithal for the Palestinian Authority allowing it to continue to exist. Without the financial contribution of the European Union the Palestinian Authority would be gone. Clearly there are areas where we would like to have greater political influence. We must work to stop the dichotomy of Israel looking exclusively to the United States and the Palestinians looking exclusively to the EU. That is the point of trying to build up the idea of the quartet. We are trying to get common positions of substance where we can speak to both sides with the same degree of influence.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU is playing a leading role in helping to relieve the external debt burden on poor countries. In 1999, the EU and its African, Caribbean and Pacific partners decided that unallocated funds in the European development fund could be used to fund debt relief, primarily through the heavily indebted poor countries &ndash; HIPC &ndash; initiative, in an international response to the debt crisis. Approximately &euro;1 billion from the EDF is being used for this purpose, of which &euro;734 million constitutes the EU's contribution to the HIPC trust fund at the World Bank which finances the relief of debt owed to <Col N="1641" /> multilateral financial institutions. The remainder is being used to write off debt owed directly to the EU. This is the largest single donation to the HIPC trust fund and amounts to about one third of the total donor pledges received.</P>
      <P>The HIV-AIDS crisis presents an unprecedented challenge to development, particularly in Africa where the disease now infects one in four of the adult population in some countries. The EU's commitment to tackling the impact of the HIV-AIDS pandemic is reflected in its contribution of over $1 billion to the global fund for AIDS, TB and malaria. This is the largest single contribution by any donor. The EU also adopted a comprehensive new policy on HIV-AIDS, malaria and TB in November 2000.</P>
      <P>The EU has been working to ensure that the multilateral rules on intellectual property rights, the so-called TRIPs Agreement, do not restrict the access of developing countries to life-saving medicines at affordable prices. The EU strongly supported the adoption of a declaration on TRIPs and access to medicines at the WTO ministerial meeting in Doha in November 2001. I attended that meeting on behalf of the last Government. The Doha declaration recognises that developing countries can take exceptional measures, such as issuing compulsory licences for the domestic manufacture of patented medicines, in the case of public health emergencies. It also allows the least developed countries to defer application of pharmaceutical patents until at least 2016. This means that generic medicines can be imported by these countries without restrictions until then. However, the Doha declaration does not address the problem of countries that have little or no domestic manufacturing capacity and cannot, therefore, avail of compulsory licences. This week the EU tabled a proposal at the WTO in Geneva for a technical modification of the TRIPs agreement to help resolve this problem.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional information</i>The EU has also proposed the establishment of a global tiered pricing system for life-saving medicines. Under such a system, medicines would be sold in developing countries at heavily discounted prices. The establishment of a tiered pricing system would require safeguard measures to ensure that the discounted medicines were not smuggled back into the markets of developed countries. The European Commission is discussing the technical details of a global tiered pricing system with the pharmaceutical industry and with other key markets, such as the US.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The food needs of developing countries are a major concern for the EU. The EU has responded rapidly to the emerging food crisis in southern Africa. On 30 May the development Council underlined its concern by adopting a declaration, proposed by Ireland, which called on major donors to respond urgently to the developing crisis. The EU has also provided emergency assistance to help alleviate the impact of the crisis. On 24 June the European Com<Col N="1642" /> mission allocated &euro;6 million for victims of food shortages in Zimbabwe. The funds will mainly be used to distribute food to the poorest families in the most seriously affected districts of the country, to provide targeted nutritional support for children and to assist farm workers who have been affected by the land resettlement programme. This is in addition to a further &euro;1.5 million which the Commission intends to allocate to the growing food crisis in Malawi. The Commission has also made a number of recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the EU's food aid and food security policy, a key element of the Union's reaction to famines and food crises. These recommendations should help make EU food aid more effective and responsive in meeting the needs of developing countries.</P>
    <P>The EU is the world's largest donor of humanitarian aid and the fifth largest donor of development aid. If the contributions of the member states are included, the EU is by far the largest source of global ODA. The scale and scope of the EU's development assistance programme, which encompasses debt relief, support for the alleviation of the diseases of poverty, food security and humanitarian relief and assistance, underline the EU's solidarity with some of the poorest countries in the world.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for his good wishes on my appointment to the Fine Gael Front Bench. May I also wish his two Ministers of State well on their new appointments. I am glad all three are here to deal with this issue. I do not need to rehearse the extent of this problem, it is well known to the House. Over 800 million people are suffering from chronic hunger. It has been clear that the trade agreements which the Minister referred to often undermined the poorest countries. Is the Minister aware that the number of hungry people is falling by about 8 million per year, but this is less than the 20 million per year it would need to be to make a dent in the problem? The Minister will be aware of the extent of the HIV-AIDS problem.</P>
      <P>With two years to prepare for Ireland's Presidency of the European Union, will the Minister set about making major inroads in the area of making medicine available to Third World countries, reducing debt, making food available and assisting the capacity to develop crops as our major objectives? As I said at the National Forum on Europe this morning, no other country in the world &ndash; certainly no other European Union country &ndash; has the credentials to do this because of our record of missionary and NGO work in the Third World and our history of famine. I implore the Minister and the two Ministers of State to make this a major priority in their preparations for the Presidency. It is something the country would welcome and is an issue on which we could make inroads at EU level.</P>

I know Deputies Cowen and Roche would support such an effort.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the reform of European Councils at the Seville meeting. The development Council will be brought centre stage, into the General Affairs Council and that gives it an added strength. I give the Deputy my personal assurance that I will endeavour to bring development, trade and the debt crisis to the fore during the Presidency and give it my personal attention between now and then. Obviously there are many immediate crises that we have to deal with, especially in southern Africa. I will meet the major NGOs tomorrow to discuss that and other matters. I can bring my experience as a trade Minister, where I pursued development issues at the WTO, into this portfolio and try to highlight the issues the Deputy has raised.</P>

The items considered included Council reform, illegal immigration, preparations for the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg and enlargement. In the external relations area, Ministers discussed the Middle East, India-Pakistan, the EU special representative in Afghanistan, European security and defence policy, relations with Iran, the western Balkans, Albania, Zimbabwe, the International Criminal Court and the Common Foreign and Security Policy budget. The conclusions of the General Affairs Council are available on the Internet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the General Affairs Council I briefed EU partners on the declarations which the Government subsequently secured at the Seville European Council. The Seville Declarations consist of a National Declaration by Ireland and a European Council Declaration. Both documents confirm that our traditional policy of military neutrality is in full conformity with existing EU treaties, including the Nice treaty. The Taoiseach made a detailed statement to the House on the Seville Declarations on Tuesday. It is my hope that the declarations will allay concerns about our military <Col N="1644" /> neutrality and provide a basis for the people to approve the Treaty of Nice which will be put to a referendum in the autumn on the basis of the referendum Bill just published.</P>

There is a vague formulation in the conclusions which refers to the Commission and the discussion on communication and the integrated management of the external borders of the member states of the European Union.

      <P>The Council took note of the contributions submitted to the Seville European Council by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 13 June and heard a wide-ranging debate on immigration policy, which was one of the main items for discussion at Seville. The debate focused in particular on how to co-operate with third countries of origin and transit to jointly combat illegal immigration. I underlined the need to differentiate between illegal immigration, legal immigration and asylum. The Council broadly acknowledged the need to develop an all-encompassing and balanced approach on migration issues and to integrate it into the wider co-operation with partner countries established within existing or future EU agreements. That was also reflected at the discussions at Seville. The Seville conclusions note that the European Council is determined to speed up the implementation of all aspects of the programme adopted in Tampere for the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union. The European Council points to the need to develop a European Union common policy on the separate, but closely related issues of asylum and immigration.</P>

      <P>I will outline the views expressed. If I want to hear the Deputy's opinions, I will sit down and listen to them. Our position, which the Taoiseach outlined, is that in dealing with this issue it is important to recognise that we must help the development of these countries. One must provide assistance. There must be prospects of financial aid from the European Union to these countries to help them deal with development problems. Otherwise, there could be migratory flows of citizens from those countries. In international agreements one seeks compliance with international obligations from everyone, including the European Union and those with whom we have external relations. It clearly sets out that we wish to co-operate and provide a basis for co-operation with countries to see in what way we can address this issue in compliance with our international obligations. One cannot have a situation where countries turn a blind eye to obligations and where the European Union is forced to ask what it can do. All countries have obligations in this matter. We want to establish a basis for co-operation which will deal effectively with illegal immigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the entirely retrograde position of putting conditions on aid. We spent 30 years trying to make the case for untied aid. The Minister referred to the obligations on both sides of the equation, for example, human rights in recipient countries. However, there has been little compliance by the arms export side of the donor countries. At the Seville meeting we had the outrageous proposal that the Union, having failed to disburse the aid which had been voted and having given aid to the Middle East which was bulldozed into the ground by the Israelis, should place new conditions on aid based on an anti-immigrant policy. Ireland should have said it was outraged by that and therefore opposed it. We cannot have it both ways. We cannot suggest the proposal was in the spirit of Europe while, at the same time, other people objected to it. I am interested to know Ireland's position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out that Ireland fully supported the concept of the Union using all instruments at its disposal to encourage third <Col N="1646" /> countries to tackle the problem of migration to Europe, while underlining the need for proportionality in this area and the need to engage in this action in a positive way. These proposals will give illegal immigration a greater emphasis in the overall external policy of the EU and will integrate immigration issues into external actions. This type of strong political support is required if countries of origin, departure and transit are to be encouraged to participate in finding a solution to the problem of illegal immigration. A number of member states were unhappy with the language in the co-operation with third countries of origin and transit to jointly combat illegal immigration. Discussion on that proposal has emerged. We are not in the business of tying our aid. However, we recognise that if this problem is to be solved, we need a level of co-operation between the countries of the European Union and other countries, which is not there at present. That means that illegal immigration is making it difficult for those who are legally immigrant in the European Union and for asylum seekers. We must deal with the issue and find a solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 6 and 59 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Taoiseach said in the Dáil on Tuesday, the Government secured agreement at the Seville European Council on a National Declaration and a European Council Declaration which confirm that Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality is in full conformity with our obligations under existing EU treaties, including the Treaty of Nice. The National Declaration confirms that Ireland is not party to any mutual defence commitment, that we are not party to any plans for a so-called European army and that we will continue to take our sovereign decision, on a case-by-case basis, on whether the Defence Forces will participate in humanitarian or crisis management tasks undertaken by the EU, based on the triple lock guarantee of UN endorsement, Government decision and Dáil approval. The Government has <Col N="1647" /> said there will be no change to that situation unless the people first give their assent in a referendum.</P>
    <P>The Seville European Council Declaration confirms that there are no obligations on Ireland arising from the EU treaties which would oblige us to depart from our policy of military neutrality. That understanding is shared by our EU partners, including our fellow neutrals Austria, Finland and Sweden. If the people consent to Ireland ratifying the Treaty of Nice in a referendum to take place in the autumn, the Seville Declarations will be annexed to Ireland's instrument of ratification and forwarded to the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dowd asked why the Government did not seek a protocol. The answer is quite clear. We do not need a protocol because our neutrality is fully protected under the EU treaties. The Seville Declarations make that clear. However, if we did need a protocol, it would have to be ratified by all member states in the same way as the Nice treaty. The other member states have made it clear that they are unwilling to reopen the treaty package, although the question of a protocol does not arise.</P>
    <P>All the safeguards for our traditional policy of military neutrality are already present in the existing EU treaties. It was not necessary to seek an opt-out from obligations which do not exist. Successive Governments have negotiated successfully to make sure that is the case. I assure the House that the Government will continue to work to secure the best interests of the people in Europe. It is my belief that can best be achieved through ratification of the Treaty of Nice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that section 9 of Part II of the Schedule to the Twenty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2002, which was circulated this afternoon, elevates to constitutional status the <i>de facto</i> position and puts paid to the claims that ratification of the Nice treaty is ratification of a common defence position? I ask the Minister to confirm that this does not tie the hands of the Government or the Dáil in so far as the Dáil may wish to act in future. For example, will the Minister confirm that if an event comparable to what happened in the United States on 11 September last were to happen in any part of Europe or, God forbid, on this island, the Government would still be in a position to act to defend the best interests of Ireland, acting in concert with other EU member states where it might choose to do so, and secure the European Union on an intergovernmental basis and outside of any provisions of the treaty? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The essence of the proposed constitutional amendment is that it provides an absolute safeguard that Ireland will not adopt a decision of the European Council to establish a common defence without a further referendum. This means that Ireland will never be part of a binding mutual defence commitment within the <Col N="1648" /> European Union unless the people decide otherwise through another amendment to the Constitution. That is a clear statement of fact which has been given constitutional expression in the proposal being brought forward in the referendum Bill. Having listened to the concerns expressed and considered the forum report the Government has provided a clear outline of Ireland's position with regard to existing treaty provisions. This includes our obligations and safeguards in the event that ratification of the Treaty of Nice proceeds. It confirms that this is an area of policy in which we have retained the discretion of the Government and the Dáil to decide, on a case by case basis, whether we participate in any crisis management or humanitarian task set out in the treaties as per the Petersberg tasks, the legal basis on which the Union acts in this matter.</P>
      <P>In order that there will be no further effort to distort the situation we are giving constitutional expression to the factual position. This has been stated in the statutory declaration and will now form part of our Constitution for that purpose. That is an important reassurance, confirming the bona fides of the Government to deal with this matter in a clear, up-front and proper way in order that we can get down to the debate concerning our national interests, as affected by the Treaty of Nice, in respect of our economic and social development. That is the purpose, the prospect, the reasoning and the result of very long and careful consideration of these matters by the Government since the establishment of the forum.</P>
      <P>Ireland's position, outside of any common defence that might be agreed by the European Council, is fully safeguarded through this proposed amendment to the Constitution. It puts to rest, definitively, the false argument propagated by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; proponents that the State could adopt a common defence policy without a referendum. I hope the bona fides of the Government will now be accepted by all in relation to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying the insertion of this provision in the Constitution, which involves significant change from the provisions suggested in the last Nice treaty referendum, guarantees that Ireland could not participate in a common defence without further amendment of the Constitution. That amendment will only be made if the people vote in favour of it in a future referendum. It gives constitutional effect to the solemn commitment in the national declaration by Ireland at Seville that a referendum would be held in Ireland on the adoption of the decision taken by the European Union to move to a common defence. This commitment has been the position of successive Governments. There is treaty provision for it. The statutory declaration confirms the factual position in political terms. We are now giving constitutional effect to that position. Accordingly, there can be no doubt on the part of any reasonable person who has had concerns in relation to this matter as to what the position is. We have brought clarity to the position which in the past was subject to obfuscation and wilful distortion of the facts. I do not wish to say more than that on the matter. I recall what people said then and compare it with what they are saying now. They now complain that we are stating the obvious, but it was not very obvious to them on the last occasion. They said the very opposite to the people.</P>
      <P>I make it very clear to Deputy Higgins that I welcome open, transparent and accountable systems in the House to enhance the role of our own Parliament in relation to European matters. This includes the need to monitor and the need for our parliamentarians to be involved in monitoring, suggesting and formulating policy and working with the Executive in a way that will defend and extend our interests in the European Union.</P>
      <P>I refer to what has been said in the statement accompanying this Bill. The Select Committee on European Affairs has now been formulated.

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I remain extremely concerned at the reports of the events in the Jenin refugee camp during the Israeli incursions into Palestinian controlled territory in April. I considered that an independent, international inquiry was required on the basis of the reports emanating from the camp. Accordingly, I instructed our permanent representative to the United Nations to lend Ireland's full support to demands for the establishment of a United Nations inquiry to investigate the events.</P>
      <P>The UN Security Council adopted resolution 1405 unanimously on 19 April. The resolution referred to the dire humanitarian situation of the Palestinian civilian population and mentioned, in particular, reports of deaths and destruction in the Jenin refugee camp. It welcomed the initiative of the Secretary General to develop accurate information about what happened in Jenin through a fact-finding team and requested him to keep the Council informed. Ireland participated actively in this debate at the Security Council. Ireland called on Israel to co-operate with the fact-finding mission saying that it had serious questions to answer about the conduct of its military operations in Palestinian areas at that time. Ireland also said that it should co-operate fully with the various agencies in allowing humanitarian aid to get through. The Government made available the services of Garda Deputy Commissioner Peter Fitzgerald and two assistants as members of the team.</P>
      <P>We were extremely disappointed by unjustified Israeli objections to the fact-finding mission. Every effort was made to meet Israeli concerns but, despite the adoption of a General Assembly resolution condemning the Israeli refusal to allow the team in, they were prevented from carrying out their investigation. In the circumstances, the Secretary General had no option but to disband the mission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a resolution on 7 May, during the resumed emergency special session, asking the Secretary General to prepare a report on the events at Jenin on the basis of information available to him from other sources. This report is in preparation and I expect that it will be submitted to the General Assembly in the near future. We are deeply dissatisfied with the failure of the <Col N="1652" /> Israelis to allow the Jenin fact-finding team to carry out their work and we have expressed our disappointment in official contacts with the Israeli Embassy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On 19 April, the press office of the Minister's Department issued a press statement announcing what was to happen in the case of the Jenin refugee camp. The Minister reiterated this in his reply. The press release also said that Ireland had expressed a view on the Israeli refusal to allow a visit to the area by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson. Is the Minister satisfied, following the issue of this press statement and the disbandment of Mrs. Robinson's mission by Kofi Annan, that this is a clear breach of international law on the part of Israel? What is the position on the correspondence dealing with the objection to Mrs. Robinson's visit?</P>
      <P>I constantly reiterate my condemnation of suicide bombing, acts of terrorism and my abhorrence of the destruction of civilian life, which is going nowhere. Often people question the genuine intent of these expressions because I raise questions from the other side of the conflict. They are genuine. However, the seeming inability of the European Union to address the international legal issues involved is incredible. What took place at Jenin refuge camp amounted to a crime. It is not the first time that has happened. Why can a statement not be made on the international legal aspect, or has the international legal framework evaporated in view of the fact that President Bush and Prime Minister Sharon speak alike? While I have sympathy with the Minister's position, is he satisfied that there have been comprehensive breaches of international law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the refusal to co-operate on the basis of resolution 1405, unanimously adopted by the UN Security Council on 19 April, does not stand to the credit of the Israeli Government. It is, therefore, the position that, as members of the United Nations, we are obliged to fully implement security resolutions. Failure to do so means failure to comply with international law because such resolutions are the basis in international law on which the achievement of peace, security and international legal order are sought.</P>
      <P>If a Security Council resolution calls on a country to co-operate with the Security Council, which is the sole body in the United Nations given the task of dealing with issues of peace and security, failure to comply not only does not stand to the credit of a government but leaves it open to being guilty of non-compliance with a legal position, which is that established in the resolution.</P>

      <P>An inspection unit was established in my Department in September 1992 in order to have in place a structure to examine the operation of overseas missions in a systematic way. The mandate of the unit was extended in 1994 to cover internal audit. The unit examines and evaluates the operation of missions abroad with a view to ensuring that the resources of the Department are deployed as effectively and productively as possible in line with overall departmental strategy. The unit also performs an independent audit function, which evaluates the efficiency and effectiveness of systems for the internal check and control of operations throughout the Department and makes recommendations for improvements.</P>
      <P>From the time of the establishment of the unit in 1992 to date, 47 inspection visits have taken place to missions abroad. Each inspection entails a detailed examination of the allocation and use of the resources of the mission. The general administration, including the keeping of mission accounts and procedures for dealing with the consular work and passports, is also scrutinised. In advance of the visit, both the divisions at headquarters and the mission carry out a detailed survey of their relationship and interaction. Following inspections, the reports are discussed by the management advisory committee with the participation of the relevant head of mission and appropriate action is taken to implement recommendations.</P>
      <P>The inspection unit also carried out in 2000 and 2001 a major audit of the overall tasks and resources of the Department. It made a number of significant recommendations, many of which it has been possible to implement. The development co-operation directorate has a separate evaluation and internal audit unit, dedicated to ensuring the quality and relevance of the development work of Ireland Aid and to auditing the accounts of all projects and programmes. It also commissions external evaluations and audit exercises as required. The findings and recommendations from these evaluations have been implemented throughout the Ireland Aid programme.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to raise this delicate subject, but with regard to the multiplicity of Third World development agencies, to which the Minister referred, is he satisfied that everything possible is done to keep down the overheads of these sometimes competing organisations? Does his Department play a co-ordinating role or does it encourage co-ordination? What, if any, examination has been undertaken by his Department or this departmental unit into the effectiveness of what is a multiplicity of organisations in terms of dealing with the issues of the developing world, or does the competition between them assist with making people aware? I would like this issue to <Col N="1654" /> be addressed. While it does not necessarily have to be done in a public forum, it is an issue in which the Minister, or more particularly, the Minister of State with responsibility for that area, might take an interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this question could be better addressed by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt. There is an increasing budget for overseas development aid. An external evaluation on Ireland Aid was carried out by the OECD and the report judged it to be an excellent programme. However, concerns were expressed about its capacity to evaluate, oversee, audit and ensure the sufficiency of personnel and information system resources available to guarantee that we were getting value for money and that everything we were hoping to do was being done on the ground.</P>
      <P>In addition, the development and co-operation division, evaluation and audit unit, undertook a range of exercises last year. We have extra personnel in the area and are satisfied we are now building up the necessary expertise required, given that the resources of this area of the Department could quadruple in terms of volume between now and 2007. It is clear that we need an active and able programme in order to get the evaluation and audit in place. It has done a strategic and operational review of the Ireland Aid evaluation unit, the promotion of community managed urban services and an external review of the national committee for development education.</P>
      <P>There has been a national review of block grant projects of Concern Worldwide, GOAL and Christian Aid Ireland in India and Bangladesh. There has been an evaluation of GOAL, Concern Worldwide, Trócaire and Self-Help Development International block grant projects in Kenya, Uganda and Malawi and a management system review of potential NGO block grant recipients. There has been a study to develop a formal risk management process in Ireland Aid and an external review of the development programme in Ethiopia; an evaluation of hotel and tourism training project in Zambia; the evaluation of Ireland Aid contributions to the UN Commission for Refugees and to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the participation in UNICEF review in Zimbabwe, to give a flavour of what has been achieved. The external annual audit programme includes the six priority country programmes plus South Africa. A systematic approach is being taken and, as has been said, if there are any specific areas of concern the Minister of State will only be too happy to give the detailed replies necessary.</P>

      <P>The Government fully shares the view expressed by the European Council on 21-22 June at Seville. That meeting's conclusions state that &ldquo;decisive progress has been made in the accession negotiations during the first six months of the year. The negotiations are now entering their final phase.&rdquo; The Council reaffirmed that</P>
      <P>if the present rate of progress in negotiations and reforms is maintained, the European Union is determined to conclude the negotiations with Cyprus, Malta, Hungary, Poland, the Slovak Republic, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, the Czech Republic and Slovenia by the end of 2002, if those countries are ready . . . . It would seem reasonable to expect that the Treaty of Accession could be signed in spring 2003. The objective remains that these countries should participate in the elections for the European Parliament in 2004 as full members.</P>
      <P>A failure by Ireland to ratify the Nice treaty, which every member state and every candidate country agrees provides the necessary legal framework for the accession of candidate countries, would prevent the enlargement proceeding as planned and would precipitate a crisis in the Community.

      <P>With regard to the first question, the accession will take place during the course of Ireland's Presidency. We are already initiating actions in regard to the Presidency and clearly one of the issues of which we will have to be conscious is that the Community will be much larger than is currently the case. Enlargement will pose all kinds of different problems for the Presidency and we will have to facilitate and assist the new member states that will &ndash; if the Irish people turn the key in the autumn &ndash; hopefully be able to become full members of the European Union in early Spring 2004.</P>

With a new EU of some 25 members and more after 2004, Ireland and the UK will be the only two countries to remain outside of the Schengen agreement, if I recall the facts correctly.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister given any consideration to negotiations as part of the enlargement process which would allow Irish citizens travel within the extended EU on a lesser document than a passport? The passport is a request from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to all foreign governments to give decent and proper treatment to Irish citizens travelling abroad. Not having to use it would take the idea of being foreign out of the EU if it could be brought about. I am not suggesting the introduction of a compulsory identity card, but some kind of system which would allow us to travel across the EU without having to produce a passport.

I feel that a passport makes us foreign. I understand the problem with the common travel area, as I was previously in the same job as Deputy Roche and sought to find a new way around it. I think many Irish citizens would be happier travelling within the EU not having to use a passport, notwithstanding the difficulties there are for us in the common travel area. Perhaps we can find a half-way house between the two.</P>

Its consultation document, Making a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland, was published in September 2001. This document includes a chapter on social, economic and environmental rights which impacts on a wide range of sectoral areas.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Commission hopes to issue its final advice to the Secretary of State early next year. Once the Commission has made its submission to the Secretary of State, it will be for the British Government to decide how to take matters forward.</P>
      <P>The bill of rights is intended, under the Agreement, to reflect the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland. We will continue to monitor developments in this area closely.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister confirm that the intention was that the same level or rights would be available on all parts of the island? I tabled this question to address the situation which might arise should the British Government accept the suggestion of the commission in Northern Ireland which deals with social and economic rights. That would mean that the Irish Government would have a choice to go down the same route regarding social and economic rights and have equivalent legislation or, should it not do so, to accept a situation in which there will be a different level of rights available in different parts of the island, which, it seems to me, was not the intention of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>

      <P>The Government undertook, in <Col N="1658" /> terms of its own obligations on human rights under the Agreement, to take further steps to further strengthen and protect human rights in this jurisdiction. These included establishing an independent human rights commission and an examination of the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into the Constitution.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Human Rights Commission has been established and is up and running for some time. I am advised by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has lead policy responsibility for this area, that the European Convention on Human Rights Bill, 2001, has been restored to the Dáil Order Paper at Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>We have also met our other obligations in this area through ratification of the Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities, the implementation of enhanced employment equality legislation, the introduction of equal status legislation and the establishment of the Joint Committee of Representatives of the Human Rights Commissions, North and South.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's question refers to obligations, which would be more than that, imposed on the Government dependent upon the outcome of the consultation process between the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the Secretary of State's consideration of its final report to him in 2003. Under the Agreement we set out to do certain tasks in our jurisdiction. There are, were and continue to be specific circumstances regarding Northern Ireland which require a particular response. In the context of that divided society, and the failure to have everybody adhere to and give allegiance to basic institutions of state, there is, perhaps, a need for a rights regime which will provide the necessary confidence in all communities, comprising whatever is the outcome of their current deliberations.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, until such time as the constitutional arrangements change, the jurisdiction remains under the United Kingdom. There are rights regimes and a range of economic, social, employment and other rights in existence in the United Kingdom and different ones in the Republic of Ireland. It is not axiomatic that the outcome of this process is that we end up with the same rights in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland while two different jurisdictions exist. These are matters for consideration by the Government in due course, but I do not see it as necessarily being as paradoxical as the Deputy is suggesting if the outcome of the process should lead to that.</P>

      <P>Should the United Kingdom Government introduce a rights framework which included social and economic rights, would the Minister, on behalf of this Government, indicate that Ireland would follow suit? If the answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, it is to be welcomed. If the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;, then the point is that, as signatories of the European convention, one jurisdiction would <Col N="1659" /> respond one way and another would respond in a lesser way. The basic issue is whether the Minister is open to the extension beyond civil and political rights into the social and economic area in parallel with such a development should it happen in the case of the United Kingdom. This affects not only Northern Ireland but also citizens in the Republic.</P>

When I see the theory translated into practice and how it might affect our own position, I am prepared to have a look.

      <P>The day the Dáil resumed over 1,000 community employment workers, managers and supervisors marched through the centre of Dublin to Dáil Éireann, such was their disgust and unhappiness with the cavalier way in which the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, and the Taoiseach allowed the community employment programme to be run down without putting in place any appropriate measures to support the social economy.</P>
      <P>We all know the incredible achievements in our communities over the past two decades which have been underpinned, initially by the SES programme and subsequently by the community employment programme. I speak as a graduate of the local community employment initiatives. We have worked hard, with the advantage of the community employment, for training for the long-term unemployed, for our young people, for women returning to the economy and for a plethora of important local projects to care for our youth, older people, sports clubs and community centres. A range of services has been underpinned over the years by the community employment programme and many of the graduates of community employment have successfully gone on to become important workers and managers throughout the economy. Indeed, the programme, which was introduced by my party leader, Deputy Quinn, was one of the most successful initiatives ever introduced by this House.</P>
      <P>We are now faced with a programme of savage cutbacks. The national agreement, the PPF, has been grotesquely broken by one side &ndash; the Government. We know that FÁS has been instructed to cut the numbers to at least 24,000, and possibly lower. There was a strong rumour in the past week or two from the community employment sector that the programme will be gutted and reduced to 8,000 places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I wish to know the real position. What can we say to communities throughout the country involved in these projects, which have been assisted in a very valuable way by community employment and through which people have been enabled to re-enter the mainstream economy? Groups like the Northside Supervisors' Network &ndash; the alliance of northside community employment and job initiative managers &ndash; have told me that there has been no consultation whatsoever with them and with all the other interests in the community sector by the Department of <Col N="1661" /> Enterprise, Trade and Employment. We get the same reports from all over Ireland. In Cork city I was told yesterday that there have been cutbacks of about 55%. Our Dublin city projects are being cut by 37% in terms of community employment numbers. There are valuable community projects throughout Ireland like the inner city project for the homeless in this city in which the number of workers have been cut by a third. The Government told us that anti-drug and child care places would be ring-fenced and that the education area would be mainstreamed. However, there are still major gaps and anomalies throughout the sector.</P>
    <P>For example, as I tried to mention to the Taoiseach, child care CE workers traditionally do a two year course, such as the famous FETAC Level II child care course, which qualifies one to be a child care worker in the mainstream economy. However, these child care workers are now facing the loss of their places in child care programmes throughout the country after a year. Where is the sense in that?</P>
    <P>I looked over the FÁS strategic review, 2002 to 2005, which states that an objective was to decrease CE and community training and replace them with apprenticeship and the social economy. However, over the past three to four years the Government has failed to turn the social economy structure into any kind of credible vehicle to enable us continue with community projects. Looking at the FÁS review of the social economy programme, I noted that it said 130 social economy enterprises have now come on stream, creating 670 places. However, this is a tiny drop in the ocean compared to the huge resource in our communities in which CE was valuable.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach and Tánaiste to consider new legislation on the social economy so we can recognise the very valuable community leadership and work that has been done for the past two decades by people across the country. Will they consider mainstreaming it and make it a part of our national life?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of community employment as an active labour market programme is to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into open labour market jobs. CE provides unemployed people with temporary opportunities where they can develop their skills and obtain a recent track record of work experience. CE was established in the mid-1990s at a time of high unemployment and, at its height, there were some 40,000 participants on the programme. There has been a dramatic transformation in the economy since then. At the end of 1997 there were 39,130 on the CE programme or one place for every 2.3 long-term unemployed persons. By the end of 2001, there were 30,809 on CE or one place for every 0.7 persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are currently restructuring CE in line with the Government decision in 1999 to take account of falling unemployment levels and to better target available places at older, long-term unem<Col N="1662" /> ployed persons. As part of this process, and in consultation with the social partners, a decision was taken to gradually reduce the numbers employed on CE to 28,000 by 2003.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of CE is part of an overall shift in strategic policy in favour of greater investment in training places, particularly for persons under 25 and long-term unemployed people, and other supports such as the social economy programme and the new high supports process, which I hope will be launched in the near future. Overall, the numbers engaged in training and CE have increased since 1997 from 72,500 to a target participation rate of 74,000 in 2002.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that FÁS prioritises projects according to the types of services provided and levels of unemployment in the locality and will co-ordinate reductions so as to minimise the negative effects on groups and services most in need of CE. Priority groups include the drugs task forces, child care service provision and designated disadvantaged areas covered by the new RAPID programme and BMW regions. The mainstreaming of schools services currently under way and the proposed mainstreaming of other essential services, including the health and environmental sectors, will further reduce the numbers employed on the programme.</P>
    <P>In the context of CE, &ldquo;mainstreaming&rdquo; is the term used to describe the proposed transfer of funding and the provision of services to the relevant Department with direct responsibility for the area concerned. The mainstreaming initiative recognises that certain key support services, such as in the education and health areas, can best be provided through the Government Department with functional responsibility in the relevant area.</P>
    <P>There is now greater flexibility in the operation of community employment following the introduction of new guidelines in August 2001. FÁS now has discretion to extend, on a case-by-case basis, an individual's term on CE, having regard to that individual's personal development needs and future employment prospects. Participants are considered for the extension under the new arrangements if, on reaching the end of their normal entitlements on CE, they are likely to experience difficulty in getting employment.</P>
    <P>A number of CE participants have difficulty progressing to open labour market employment due to their age, literacy or numeracy problems or a lack of suitable jobs available locally. For such participants FÁS now has discretion to offer a further period on the programme on a case-by-case basis. In general, approximately 20% of participants on CE may benefit from an additional year on the programme under the new flexibility guidelines. In addition, the social economy programme is available to support the development of social economy enterprises that will benefit the economic and social regeneration of communities.</P>
    <P>Local social economy working groups have been established in the 38 designated disadvantaged partnership areas and in 16 non-partnership <Col N="1663" /> areas. In this way the social economy is targeted at areas which traditionally have had high dependence on services provided under CE.</P>
    <P>The number of persons available to participate in CE has reduced in the last few years, partially due to the success of CE and similar reintegration programmes. The current tight labour market conditions, together with the dramatic reductions in the numbers of long-term unemployed, provide an unprecedented opportunity to re-integrate into the workforce persons who have been participating in labour market programmes. FÁS employment services continue to be available to assist such persons who have completed their term on CE and are now ready to progress to work in the open labour market. In this context it is worth noting that the continuing strong demand for work permits for low-skilled positions would suggest that persons finishing their contractual term on CE are facing a buoyant labour market.</P>
    <P>A review of active labour market programmes, as provided for under the PPF, has recently commenced under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, which is chaired by my Department. This committee includes representatives of the community pillar, employers and trade unions, as well as other Government Departments and FÁS. Consultants have recently been appointed by my Department to facilitate a rigorous assessment of the effectiveness of existing programmes, which will help to inform the deliberations of the standing committee. Terms of reference for the consultants' work were agreed by a steering group representing the standing committee, which includes the social partners.</P>
    <P>FÁS is undertaking its own internal review of CE, which should further inform the prioritising of activity therein, taking account of the needs of disadvantaged groups and the provision of services to areas experiencing severe social and economic disadvantage. In addition, FÁS also intends to carry out a fundamental review of the community training programme in consultation with sponsors, participants, employers and relevant Government Departments. The future policy direction of active labour market programmes, including CE, will be informed by the outcome of these processes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me raise this matter on the Adjournment. The <i>Jeanie Johnston</i> project was initiated in the mid-1990s to commemorate the famine. Subsequently, when it could not meet its deadline in this respect, it became a millennium project. On 24 November 1997, Kerry County Council decided to support and give a guarantee of £750,000 in grant aid, which was received from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands under the CDIS pro<Col N="1664" /> gramme. That was the first time that Kerry County Council got involved in the project.</P>
      <P>It was obvious at the end of last year that the project was running into trouble. Therefore, at a special council meeting held on 21 February 2002, Kerry County Council decided to proceed with an initiative to lead a structured winding down of the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i> project that would facilitate its take-over and the operation of a limited visitor attraction for 2002. This involved the council negotiating various issues with stakeholders and injecting a maximum of £1 million in additional funding into the project. The initiative was further considered and approved at the meeting of the council held on 25 March. Since then the council has used its best endeavours to give effect to this initiative. Along with committing considerable staff resources to the issue, it has retained the expert advice of JW O'Donovan, solicitors, Ernst &amp; Young and SWS Corporate Services. To facilitate the takeover of the project a new company called Seaholly was established and preliminary work was undertaken. A proposed detailed legal agreement was drawn up and transmitted to the company. This proposed agreement was subsequently modified following meetings with the Jeanie Johnston Company.</P>
      <P>The council's initiative, including the commitment of £1 million, only provided for the takeover of the ship and its operation as a tourist attraction for 2002. It was made clear at the time that one of the major tasks facing the council was to develop an exit strategy before the end of the year. It is clear that substantial additional resources are required to operate the facility on the ongoing basis, either as a public private partnership or some other arrangement. Despite inquiries to various State and other parties and private individuals who expressed an interest, it has not been possible to identify a source of substantial funding to operate the vessel. Consequently, the ship will place a substantial, ongoing burden on the council in the future. The recommendation from the county manager to the council, which will be accepted, is not to get involved in this orderly wind-down.</P>
      <P>I am here to ask the Minister to allow his Department to become involved through Coiste an Asgard, of which he is the chairman. I am not asking his Department to bail out the project indefinitely, but to ensure an orderly wind-down and that a proper viability plan is set up. After all, most of this is State money. The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources grant-aided the project to the tune of £3 million and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands gave £750,000. Shannon Development gave £1 million and the County Enterprise Board, the Leader programme and several other State agencies were also involved. The project is really owned by the State: the amount of local and international fundraising only comes to about £2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand also that at the moment the <Col N="1665" /><i>Asgard</i> needs a major fit-out and that this ship may take its place as the national training vessel. I ask the Minister to give a commitment that he will involve Coiste an Asgard in the project and that he will take responsibility for the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i> until a medium to long-term viability study has been completed. This may, in the end, result in a public private partnership with the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i> replacing the <i>Asgard</i> due to the condition of the latter. I understand that it is the far superior vessel, having cost &euro;14 million. It is a State asset. At this stage, Kerry County Council has neither the capacity nor the finance to continue with the project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta as ucht an rud seo a chur ós ár gcomhair. I understand that the Marine Survey Office of the former Department of Marine and Natural Resources satisfactorily completed its survey of the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i> in Cork on 7 June 2002, as a result of which the vessel is entitled to be granted a load line certificate which covers all of its constructional and safety features. In effect, this is the certificate the vessel needs to proceed to sea and as far as that Department is concerned construction of the vessel has now been completed. The total grant allocated by the former Department of the Marine and Natural Resources to the project is &euro;3,968,750. Of this amount, &euro;3,506,735 has so far been drawn down to cover the costs involved in completing the vessel. This leaves a balance of &euro;462,015 yet to be used from that allocation.</P>
      <P>I am informed that since February 2002 Kerry County Council and Tralee UDC have been working on a joint initiative which should see the winding up of the promotional Jeanie Johnston Companies, with all trade creditors being paid and ownership of the vessel being taken over by a company set up by the councils to operate the vessel. However, the manager of Kerry County Council, as the Deputy has outlined, has recently advised the company and the various State stakeholders in the project that he is bringing a report to the elected members of Kerry County Council and Tralee UDC, to be considered at meetings of both councils scheduled for next Monday, 1 July 2002. In this report, the manager recommends to the councils that they should not proceed with their joint initiative to take over the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i> project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to my Department acquiring the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i>, the sail training vessel <i>Asgard II</i> is operated by Coiste an Asgard, which is a company limited by a guarantee set up under the Companies Acts. The Minister for Defence is <i>ex officio</i> the chairman of the board of directors of an Coiste and may appoint up to 14 other directors. Coiste an Asgard employs seven full-time staff, comprising five crew for the vessel and two office staff. Relief crew are also engaged as required. <i>Asgard II</i> carries up to 20 trainees on each cruise. The normal duration of a cruise is from one to three weeks. A total of about 504 <Col N="1666" /> trainees participate in sail training cruises aboard <i>Asgard II</i> each year. An Coiste receives an annual lottery-funded grant-in-aid from the Defence Vote. In the current year the grant is &euro;625,000. The income of an Coiste is supplemented by fees paid by the trainees, which amounts to about a further &euro;200,000 a year. This income provides for the cost of salaries as well as the operating and maintenance expenses of <i>Asgard II</i>.</P>
    <P>The resources at present available to Coiste an Asgard are only sufficient to cover the cost of operating <i>Asgard II</i>. I understand that the cost of operating the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i> as a sail training vessel would be well over &euro;1 million a year. In view of the legal and other issues that exist in relation to the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i> I do not consider it appropriate to make any further comment on the matter at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity of raising this important issue on the Adjournment. I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for coming in to reply. Next Monday is 1 July and that is why I have raised this issue in the House once again. In February or March of this year the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, made a commitment to the consultants of Monaghan General Hospital, in the presence of GP representatives, Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin from the North-Eastern Health Board and a number of the Minister's party and Oireachtas colleagues, that five junior doctors would be appointed and in place by 1 July 2002 to make sure that accident and emergency services could continue. I understand that as of today no doctors are in place and none have been advertised for by the health board. What is the Minister playing at?</P>
      <P>The Minister spent 11 hours in Monaghan in January and he knows first-hand the needs and requirements of Monaghan General Hospital. Fianna Fáil candidates stated in election literature that three new consultants and five junior doctors would be supplied to the hospital. I have Deputy O'Hanlon's literature here. It states that 80% of accident and emergency cases will be treated in Monaghan.</P>
      <P>It also states that all medical and surgical emergencies as determined by surgeons on call would be treated in Monaghan. These were the election promises and commitments from the Minister, Deputy Martin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts are different. Following discussions with the Minister in December 2000, Comhairle na nOspidéal undertook a review of the structures, operating staff and accident and emergency services and departments nationally. From that study, the review of the North-Eastern Health Board area recommended Drogheda as the regional emergency centre with two additional consultants based there and one additional con<Col N="1667" /> sultant in Cavan. None was to be based in Monaghan General Hospital.</P>
    <P>On 3 January 2002, Professor Arthur Tanner, on behalf of the Royal College of Surgeons, stated that it was the view of the college that Monaghan hospital should not accept emergency surgical cases. It is also on record that Professor Tanner had a meeting with the consultant surgeons in the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group in December 2001 at which a template for the future development of surgical services for the hospital group was agreed and the consultant surgeons felt that the template agreement was workable. As the Royal College of Surgeons will not recognise the training of young doctors in an emergency department unless an emergency medicine consultant is based in that department and as Comhairle na nOspidéal has not recommended that consultant for Monaghan, it is evident that no doctor will come to Monaghan unless the Minister changes this recommendation.</P>
    <P>When the surgeon, Mr. Maloney, retired, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, ensured that he was replaced by two rather than one surgeon. The Minister, Deputy Martin, has increased the allocation to the health board over the past five years and has claimed credit for it, but the person who pays the piper should call the tune. I question whether the Minister ever intended to follow through with his promises and commitments.</P>
    <P>I attended hospital information meetings organised by the staff of Monaghan General Hospital and they were chaired by one of the consultant surgeons, Mr. Liam McMullen, who advised that they were only information meetings and not ones at which politicians could speak. I question why he as chairman did not give us all the facts he knew. Despite statements to the contrary, he was involved in a political campaign.</P>
    <P>All the activities concerning Monaghan General Hospital should be the subject of a full public inquiry. This is a serious issue. We were promised five years ago by health board executives that plans were in place for a major expansion and upgrading of Monaghan General Hospital, including the maternity and surgical wings and the mortuary. All that has happened since is downgrading and transfers to Cavan and Drogheda. Several sections are already closed.</P>
    <P>It is vital in the short-term that the Minister or someone on his behalf acts as a mediator between the health board members from County Monaghan and the executive of the health board because the current lack of trust is leading to the worst possible results for Monaghan General Hospital and the people of Monaghan. Insurance companies, Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Royal College of Surgeons are being used as excuses to take away services which were originally put in place by Monaghan County Council and the people of Monaghan. Action is needed now because 1 July is next Monday.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Martin, I thank Deputy Crawford for the opportunity to clarify the position of accident and emergency services at Monaghan General Hospital. I remind the Deputy that the North-Eastern Health Board is responsible for the provision of services at the hospital. It is a matter for the board to determine service provision at the hospital in line with its commitment to the provision of a high quality, efficient and cost effective service.</P>
      <P>Approval from my Department has recently issued to the North Eastern Health Board for a consultant surgeon post at Monaghan General Hospital. Approval has also issued to the board for the upgrading of this temporary post to permanent status. Comhairle na nOspidéal is the statutory body with responsibility for regulating the number and type of appointments of consultant medical staff in hospitals which provide services under the health legislation. I understand that this post is under active consideration by Comhairle na nOspidéal in consultation with the North Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>In addition, five medical support staff have also been recently approved by my Department to support the NCHD team attached to this post and to support the recent extension of the opening hours of the hospital's accident and emergency treatment room. On receipt of approval from Comhairle na nOspidéal for the consultant post, the North Eastern Health Board will proceed to advertise for the recruitment of the additional medical personnel.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the recently published report by the Comhairle na nOspidéal committee on accident and emergency services undertaken at the Minister's request. The report not only deals with the staffing of accident and emergency departments at consultant level but also explores factors which affect the efficiency and effectiveness of hospital emergency services. It links reform of accident and emergency departments with the need to look critically at hospital processes and the flow of patients through hospitals.</P>
      <P>An increase in consultant in emergency medicine posts is one of a number of wide-ranging recommendations contained in the report. All the reports and recommendations, including the recommendation on increased consultant medical staffing levels are, as the report states, designed to be implemented on a phased basis. The report also states that their implementation will require detailed planning by health boards, hospitals and others involved in emergency services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of geographical and demographic factors, the hospital network, specialty distribution and international best practice, the committee recommends that a regional emergency department be established in the North Eastern Health Board area, based in Drogheda. The regional emergency service co-ordinator, who would be the director of the regional emergency department, would be based in Drogheda. <Col N="1669" /> The regional emergency department would co-ordinate accident and emergency services at the hospitals in Cavan, Monaghan, Dundalk, Drogheda and Navan.</P>
    <P>The committee also recommends the creation of three additional posts of consultant in emergency medicine &ndash; two in the Louth-Meath hospital group and one in the Cavan-Monaghan group &ndash; with access to the regional emergency department in Drogheda. The recommendations of the committee's report will help to inform the development of accident and emergency services in the North-Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that plans are being advanced by the North-Eastern Health Board for the development and upgrading of the high dependency unit at the hospital in addition to substantial upgrading and refurbishment of ward accommodation, the development of the treatment-minor injuries unit and the development of a midwifery-led unit. The associated capital cost is of the order of &euro;7 million.</P>
    <P>In addition, approval has recently issued for a replacement consultant anaesthetist and an increase in the number of sessions for this post from six to 11, all to be held in Monaghan General Hospital. This post will further support service developments at the hospital.</P>
    <P>My Department has recently agreed to the selection and appointment of a design team to prepare a development control plan for the Monaghan site and to advise the board on the future development potential of the site in line with the board's policies. The North-Eastern Health Board is in discussions with hospital management with a view to ensuring the continuation of accident and emergency services at Monaghan General Hospital. The health board is confident that this issue will be resolved soon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. When the rainbow Government left office more than five years ago, the Luas light rail system for Dublin was at an advanced stage of planning. A similar light rail system in Montpelier, the planning of which commenced at the same time as Dublin, is already up and running. After four years, we have yet to see one mile of Luas track laid. The Government's continually revised targets on the operation of Luas have failed to materialise and all that we have seen to date is the ghost train on Merrion Street,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the enactment of the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act, 2001, the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, now has responsibility for Luas. It is an independent statutory body with responsibility for procuring new metro and light rail infrastructure. The decision to appoint a banker as the chief executive officer of the agency and, as a consequence, as a member of the board contradicts the principle and thrust <Col N="1670" /> of section 20 of the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act, 2001. Under this section the then Department of Public Enterprise stipulated in the legislation for the first time the level of competence required for directors. The chief executive officer of the agency is to become a member of the board. The fact that the board, which is charged with the development of major infrastructural projects, is devoid of core engineering and public transport experience is a blatant contradiction of the principle of section 20 and raises a serious issue of major public interest.</P>
    <P>The board of the RPA has selected an individual from a financial background to address the public-private partnership aspect of the remit of the new agency. I call on the Minister for Transport to make a comprehensive statement on the selection of a banker as the new chief executive officer of the RPA. The Minister must explain the rationale for selecting a banker as the chief executive officer of the agency. The selection appears to fly in the face of the criteria set for his appointment and laid down in the advertisement in <i>The Financial Times</i> of 6 March 2002 which stated the successful candidate would have an excellent track record in delivering major engineering projects in either the public or private sector and that knowledge and experience of passenger transport services would be an advantage. Following such an appointment there is no member on the board of the RPA with such technical experience. That is a blatant contradiction of the principle of the legislation establishing the agency.</P>
    <P>A similar situation arose on the establishment of Railtrack in the United Kingdom where a board of persons with financial experience took control of the company. It was devoid of the core engineering experience required. We are all aware of the disaster which followed. The RPA is now taking a similar line which will sound the death knell for the development of rail transport in Ireland. There must be clarity and transparency surrounding such an influential appointment as the RPA has a major role to play in delivering the Luas and metro projects for the city of Dublin and in the development of rail services throughout the country.</P>
    <P>While we are unaware of the individual and the experience he will bring to this new role, following the recent speculation it appears the new chief executive officer does not come from the type of technical background required to ensure these projects are delivered on time and within budget. The Minister for Transport must answer the following questions. Were the criteria outlined in the recruitment advertisement ignored? Was the stipulation in the legislation on the level of competence required for the directorate disregarded when appointing the chief executive officer? Will he stand over a board charged with the development of a major infrastructural project which is devoid of core engineering and public transport experience? It now appears the intention of the House was ignored when consideration was given <Col N="1671" /> by the board to the type of appointee required for this role.</P>

      <P>The Railway Procurement Agency was established in December last year under the terms of the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act, 2001. It is an independent, commercial statutory State body. Its main function is to secure the provision of such light railway and metro railway infrastructure as may be determined from time to time by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agency has a hugely important role to play in the implementation of the Luas and Dublin metro projects. Responsibility for Luas trans<Col N="1672" /> ferred to the RPA from CIE at the start of this year. In addition, the agency is carrying out preparatory work for the implementation of the Dublin metro. This project represents the single biggest infrastructural project ever undertaken by the State.</P>
    <P>Section 20(5) of the Act provides that the members of the agency, other than the chief executive, shall be appointed by the Minister. Section 23(2) of the Act provides that the chief executive shall be appointed by the agency. Accordingly, the Minister has no role in the matter of appointing the chief executive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>Following an application from the US authorities, two US Air Force C-130 transport aircraft were granted permission to land at Shannon Airport on 30 May 2002 for a stay of four days duration. The purpose of the request to visit Ireland was described by the US side as crew rest and training. We understand this involved routine proficiency training including instrument approaches. The US indicate that it is customary to use different locations to practice these manoeuvres in order to broaden their experience.</P>
      <P>The visit was routine. The two transport aircraft arrived at Shannon on 30 May. On 31 May they conducted a sortie around the South West coast. On the following day they flew to Scotland and returned to Shannon. On 2 June the planes did not fly and they departed at 8.30 a.m. on 3 June to return to their base at Ramstein, Germany. The fact is that there was no request to carry out an exercise in Irish airspace and no such exercise took place.</P>
      <P>Under the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952, foreign military aircraft require the permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to overfly, or land in, the State. In the case of routine landings of military aircraft, permission is granted, on a case by case basis, subject to confirmation that the aircraft is unarmed, does not carry arms, ammunition or explosives and does not form part of a military exercise or operation. In accordance with standard procedures, the US side confirmed that these conditions were being met in respect of the two aircraft involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two aircraft in question were not in Ireland in connection with a military exercise. It is not <Col N="1674" /> the Government's policy to grant overflight or landing permission to foreign aircraft that might be engaged in any form of military exercise. There are no implications for Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality arising from the Government's decision to grant permission for these landings.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there was no involvement on the part of the Defence Forces. The US authorities have not requested landing permission for similar purposes since the flights in question. Any such requests would be considered on a case by case basis.</P>

      <P>With regard to the meeting of the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 17 June 2002 I refer the Deputy to the reply already given to priority question No. 4.</P>
      <P>The General Affairs Council examined a number of issues in advance of the Seville European Council, including a package of measures to tackle illegal immigration. A comprehensive debate on immigration policy took place, focused in particular on how to cooperate with countries of origin and transit in jointly combatting illegal immigration. The Council acknowledged the need to develop a wide-ranging and balanced approach to migration issues as an integral part of wider co-operation with partner countries within existing or future EU agreements.</P>
      <P>A number of member states, including Ireland, supported efforts to strengthen the role of the EU in tackling illegal immigration while at the same time underlining the need for proportionality in this area and highlighting the need to engage these countries in a positive way through assistance and co-operation in the field of illegal migration. A wide measure of support emerged at the General Affairs Council for the broad thrust of the package, which was forwarded to the Seville European Council on 21 June, where final agreement was reached.</P>

      <P>The circumstances of the case, as the Deputy may be aware, are that an Irish missionary, Father Declan O'Toole and two Ugandan citizens, Patrick Longoli and Fidele Longole, his driver and cook, were shot and killed on 21 March in Karamoja in northeast Uganda. The following day two Ugandan soldiers were arrested and charged. They were tried by field court martial, found guilty of the murders and executed by firing squad the same day.</P>
      <P>The Government conveyed to the Ugandan Government at the highest level the degree of concern occasioned in Ireland both by the circumstances in which Father O'Toole and his companions died and by the nature of the judicial process which was applied to those arrested, tried and executed in connection with these deaths. We emphasised the need for the full facts of the case to be clearly established.</P>
      <P>In response to these representations, the President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, gave an assurance that an inquiry would be carried out to determine whether there might have been any cover-up by the Ugandan defence forces. The Secretary General of my Department availed of a visit to Uganda a month ago to emphasise to the President and to the relevant Ministers our hopes that this inquiry would begin without delay, that it would be conducted in a transparent fashion and would help to bring closure to this tragic case.</P>
      <P>This week, our representative in Kampala was assured by the Ugandan Foreign Minister that the inquiry is in the process of being set up. We will maintain close contact with the Ugandan authorities in this regard. The deaths of Father O'Toole and his two companions have caused widespread shock and unease and it is important that the full facts of the case are disclosed clearly and speedily.</P>

      <P>Ireland will undertake its sixth Presidency of the European Union on 1 January 2004. Since the last Irish Presidency in 1996 there has been a significant increase in the Presidency's workload notably in the common foreign and security policy and in justice and home affairs areas. In addition, Ireland is likely to be the first member state to preside over an enlarged Union, with up <Col N="1676" /> to ten new member states expected to join the EU as full members in 2004.</P>
      <P>As we indicated in the Programme for Government our aim will be to run a pro-active and efficient Presidency. Planning for this is already well under way and will intensify over the next 18 months. Two interdepartmental committees were established in 2001, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs, to coordinate the preparations for the Presidency. The Inter-Departmental Committee for Coordinating the Presidency deals with programming and policy related matters and the Inter-Departmental Administrative Planning Group deals with logistical planning. Both groups report through the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Senior Officials Group and to the Cabinet Committee on European Affairs. The Centre for Management and Organisation Development, CMOD, at the Department of Finance is preparing a wide range of training courses to train staff at all levels for the Presidency.</P>
      <P>The calendar of Council meetings for the Irish Presidency is currently being developed and will include two meetings of the European Council and a large number of ministerial meetings in a wide variety of policy areas. More than 200 Council Working Group meetings, to be chaired by Irish officials, will also take place. A list of chairpersons and national delegates for the committees and working groups is currently being compiled in consultation with all relevant Departments. Work on designing the Presidency logo and developing new IT systems and the Presidency website is ongoing.</P>
      <P>In the run-up to the Presidency we will work with our partners in Europe, in particular with the preceding Italian Presidency and the succeeding Dutch Presidency, as well as the EU institutions in order to ensure that we are in a good position to take on our responsibilities and run an effective Presidency in 2004.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 43 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has been actively responding to the unfolding food crisis in Southern Africa. This crisis is already having a severe impact on the vulnerable people of Malawi and threatens millions of others across Lesotho, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The latest indicators are that it will worsen in the weeks ahead.</P>
      <P>An initial allocation of &euro;1.2 million has already been made to help cover immediate needs in Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Ireland Aid is working closely with Irish NGOs and other implementing partners on the challenges posed by this crisis and the Government's response may be expected to deepen considerably over the coming weeks. We are monitoring the situation closely through our missions in Zambia, Mozambique, Lesotho and South Africa.</P>
      <P>This latest crisis is the outcome of unusually dry climatic conditions which have resulted in crop failure and low crop yields over consecutive growing seasons. Poor governance and the mismanagement of grain reserves have also played a role. Regional grain stocks in Southern Africa, which were already drawn upon to meet last year's shortages, are currently at exceptionally low levels. A joint assessment mission by the World Food Programme, WFP, and the Food and Agricultural Organisation, FAO, estimates that 7.7 million people will require food aid during June to August while 12.8 million will need assistance by March of next year, almost one quarter of them in Malawi. An estimated 1.2 million tonnes of food aid will be required to provide emergency food assistance to the most vulnerable households. Poor nutrition, it may be noted, also contributes to the high prevalence of HIV-AIDS in the region.</P>
      <P>Of the initial &euro;1.2 million provided by the Government in response to the crisis, &euro;0.7 million has gone to emergency programmes being implemented in Malawi by Concern and the World Food Programme. The remaining &euro;0.5 million is being provided to help those who have been identified by the International Federation of the Red Cross as most immediately at risk, including in Zambia and Zimbabwe. Further emergency responses in Malawi and the other afflicted countries are being prepared by Ireland Aid with its Irish NGO and other implementing partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Commission is providing &euro;1.5 million through the European Humanitarian Aid Office, ECHO, for immediate measures supporting Malawi's network of nutritional rehabilitation units. As a direct result of the current crisis, the Commission is also supplying Malawi with an additional 95,000 tonnes of food aid worth &euro;29 million. This emergency aid will be implemented over a period of 18 months. It complements the Commission's &euro;42 million, three-year food security programme, which is helping to develop <Col N="1678" /> longer term approaches to Malawi's food needs. Ireland and our European partners are also paying particular attention to the situation in Zimbabwe, which accounts for 56% of the total emergency food aid requirement in the region.</P>
    <P>The Government is working closely with other members of the international community to develop strategies on how immediate food needs may best be addressed at both the national and regional levels. A Declaration on the Food Crisis in Southern Africa was adopted at the EU Development Council in Brussels on 30 May at Ireland's initiative. We also urged a strong and early international response to the crisis at the recent World Food Summit in Rome. I raised the matter with other EU Ministers at the meeting of the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 17 June.</P>
    <P>Ireland also took part in the special Regional Meeting on Humanitarian Needs in Southern Africa hosted jointly by the WFP and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Johannesburg on 6-7 June. This was an important meeting which brokered agreement on a regional emergency operation which will have effect from July. While the main focus was on the humanitarian aspects of the current crisis, the governance issues contributing to this and the need to firmly establish longer-term food security mechanisms across Southern Africa were also emphasised at the meeting. The Government will support the regional emergency appeal which is being prepared by the WFP following this meeting.</P>
    <P>In the critical weeks and months ahead, the Government will substantially deepen our support for the vulnerable populations of Malawi and the other countries of Southern Africa. At the same time, we will seek to ensure that the necessary sectoral, management and other reforms are put in place to address the underlying causes of food insecurity in Southern Africa.</P>

      <P>The National Forum on Europe published the second Interim Report of its Chairman, Senator Maurice Hayes, on 30 May. The report covered the second phase of the forum's work, in February and March of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I warmly welcomed the chairman's second report. The forum has proven itself beyond doubt to be a very effective vehicle for a wide-ranging discussion on Europe and Ireland's role in the European Union. Senator Hayes and his staff, and the members of the forum, are to be con<Col N="1679" /> gratulated for the manner in which they have ensured that all voices are heard and respected. The decision of the forum to &ldquo;go local&rdquo; and hear the views of citizens all over the country has also done much to widen the scope of the debate on Europe, and I understand that it intends to hold further regional meetings in the autumn.</P>
    <P>The chairman's second report identified a number of areas of common ground among all participants. I was particularly pleased to see the continued consensus that enlargement to bring about an end to the artificial division of Europe is a &ldquo;moral and political imperative&rdquo;. The Government remains committed to ratifying the Treaty of Nice, which represents the legal framework within which enlargement can take place as planned.</P>
    <P>The report also noted and explored areas of concern expressed within the forum and among the wider public. The Government has been working hard to address those concerns. In particular, the report underscored the potential value of a confirmation that Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality is not affected by the Treaty of Nice or previous treaties. The Seville Declarations provide such a clarification, in the plain terms called for by the forum. The report also emphasised the importance of enhanced arrangements for democratic scrutiny of European Union business through the Oireachtas, and indicated the broad support in the forum for the Government's proposals in this area, which will start to become operational as from next Monday, 1 July.</P>
    <P>The forum has met twice since the General Election, including this morning. It has begun to focus in greater detail on the work of the European Convention. The welcome decision of Fine Gael to take its place in the forum further strengthens its representativeness as a place for debate.</P>
    <P>The future work programme of the forum is in the first instance for the chairman and steering committee to consider. However, the Government believes the forum will continue to have a most valuable role to play at this vitally important time for Ireland and its relationship with the European Union. Subject to the forum's views, I envisage it continuing in parallel with the European Convention, which is expected to work into the first half of next year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, in a Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the member states of the European Union agreed that before any enlargement should take place, the five largest member states would lose their right to nominate two Commissioners, provided that agreement on re-weighting of votes in the Council was agreed. In the Treaty of Nice, it was agreed that from 2005 each member state, regardless of size, will nominate one Commissioner. This will continue to be the case until membership of the Union reaches 27. Each new state joining during that period will be entitled to nominate a Commissioner.</P>
      <P>It was also agreed that when membership of the EU reaches 27, the Council will decide, on the basis of unanimity, the size of the Commission, which is to be less than 27. It is absolutely guaranteed that membership of the Commission will be rotated between member states on the basis of strict equality.</P>
      <P>This is a good deal for Ireland which protects our national interests. Clearly, ratification of the Treaty of Nice by all member states, including Ireland, is necessary for these measures to take effect. In approaching this matter, the Government's bottom line will remain that maintenance of strict equality between member states &ndash; which has served both the EU and its members so well to date &ndash; is a fundamental principle from which we should not depart.</P>
      <P>On the question of recent comments by the President of the Commission, Romano Prodi, in the context of debate on the future of Europe, there are a great many suggestions being made about a number of issues, including the future composition and formation of the Commission. I understand that President Prodi's comments are personal and informal and should be viewed in that way. Similar ideas were mooted in the early stages of the negotiations that led to the Treaty of Nice. However, they were not pursued.</P>
      <P>While we favour a strong Commission, substantial change along the lines of suggestions in some media reports would, as a matter of political reality, require the endorsement of member states. As I have already mentioned, for Ireland the principle of equality as regards Commission membership will remain fundamental.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 52 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a statement to the Dáil on the current situation in India-Pakistan. Since I last made a statement to the Dáil on this issue, in February, tensions in the region have escalated considerably. As deputies will be aware, the two countries came extremely close to the brink of war. I am relieved to report that tensions have decreased somewhat, although the situation remains very serious.</P>
      <P>Against this background, last weekend, EU Heads of State and Government, meeting in Seville, issued a strong message of concern that the situation remains precarious and that the consequences of a break-out of war could be devastating for the region, and beyond. With the full support of the Government, the Seville Council called on Pakistan to take further concrete action in accordance with the assurances it has already given and with its international obligations, including UN Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001), to stop infiltration across the line of control and to prevent terrorist groups from operating from territory under its control, also through closing of training camps. The European Council called on India and Pakistan to establish an effective monitoring system, in a form acceptable to both, so as to stop infiltration. The Council encouraged India to be ready to respond with further de-escalatory steps as Pakistan shows that it is acting to fulfil its commitments. The European Council noted the importance of free, fair and inclusive elections this autumn in Jammu and Kashmir. The European Council called on both parties to adhere to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council further confirmed the EU's commitment to work with India and Pakistan and with others in the international community, seeking for possible confidence-building measures in order to defuse the immediate crisis, and to continue to encourage both countries to achieve a lasting settlement of the differences between them through bilateral dialogue. The current crisis was precipitated and exacerbated by a series of atrocities in both countries. In India, Pakistan-based militants targeted the Parliament in December, and Indian-controlled Kashmir in May, which resulted in 30 dead. Further attacks were carried out by militants in Karachi, in oppo<Col N="1682" /> sition to President Musharraf's attempts to clamp down on their activities, including an attack in May in which French citizens were among those killed, an attack on a US cultural centre, and most recently, an attack on the US consulate there.</P>
    <P>These atrocities increased the tension in the region, resulting in a massive military build-up along the India-Pakistan border and the threatened use of nuclear weapons, with potentially devastating consequences for the region and beyond. A series of key visits to the region were made by US Secretary of State Powell, EU Commissioner Patten, UK Foreign Secretary Straw, US Assistant Secretary of State Rocca, US Deputy Secretary of State Armitage and US Defence Secretary Rumsfeld. These contacts have resulted in a series of recent, de-escalatory steps by the Governments of Pakistan and India.</P>
    <P>In his visit to the region, at the beginning of June, US Envoy Richard Armitage secured a commitment from President Musharraf to order an end to infiltration across the border with India. Soon after, the US was able to back this up by intelligence reports that infiltration was substantially down. India responded with a number of measures aimed at reducing tension. However, India remains deeply sceptical about Pakistan's assurances, and continues to press for the closure of terrorist training camps.</P>
    <P>As a result, both sides remain fully-mobilised along the border. In this climate, there is a real risk that any further incidents, such as crossborder incursions, could spark an outbreak of hostilities, with grave consequences. The Government remains highly concerned that the current situation presents one of the most serious threats to international peace and security today. Ireland has made these concerns known to representatives of both Governments, both here in Dublin and in New York, New Delhi and Islamabad. Our Ambassador to Pakistan recently presented his credentials in Islamabad to President Musharraf and Foreign Minister Sattar, and took that opportunity to outline our views to them.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has met and discussed the situation in recent days with Afghan President Karzai and Spanish Prime Minister Aznar, and I also discussed developments with US Special Envoy Haass. At the UN, the Kashmir issue has not been discussed in the Security Council, as India, with the support of Russia in the P5, traditionally views the matter as an internal one. This position has extended to an objection by India to any discussion by the Security Council of the current tensions, even in an informal setting. Arising from this position, there is a view among some Members that a discussion in the Security Council at this time could be counter-productive. Every effort has been made to pursue progress through other channels, and so far these have been most effective, as demonstrated by the positive developments in the region.</P>
    <P>Ireland's view is that, given the seriousness of the situation and the potential consequences for <Col N="1683" /> international peace and security of any further escalation in tensions, the Security Council should, as appropriate, discuss the matter. It is our hope, therefore, that in time, and in a manner acceptable to both sides, the issue will be addressed by the Security Council. In the meantime, Ireland is taking a pragmatic approach to the situation and encouraging the use of those channels of international diplomacy which have been so far most successful in defusing tensions. Ireland has noted the general support among Council members for the intensive bilateral diplomacy under way on the part of those States best placed to influence the parties, without ruling out formal Council consideration should the situation suffer a sharp deterioration.</P>
    <P>An important initiative was taken by Asian and European Ministers in early June when they expressed their solidarity on this issue for the first time. The Foreign Ministers of the 15 EU member states, including Ireland, and 10 Asian Nations, meeting in Madrid at the ASEM Foreign Ministers' meeting, jointly urged India and Pakistan to reverse the present spiral of confrontation with unpredictable consequences, and to resume immediate dialogue.</P>
    <P>Over the coming months, Ireland will continue to carefully monitor the situation in the region, in particular in the light of the up-coming elections in Jammu and Kashmir. We will continue to seek, through the most acceptable and effective channels available, a further reduction in tension on both sides, and as soon as possible, a de-mobilisation of troops on both sides. Ireland, along with the EU, will stand ready to support this process in any way possible.</P>

      <P>Following the formation of a coalition government in Austria on 4 February, 2000 which included the Austrian Freedom Party, FPO1, the other fourteen member states adopted a series of measures under which official bilateral meetings with Austria were suspended, contacts with Austrian Ambassadors in EU capitals were restricted and support was withheld from Austrian candidates for positions in international organisations. These measures stemmed from concern that the FPO1 had espoused policies which were in conflict with fundamental EU values and norms of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.</P>
      <P>The agreed measures related to the bilateral relations between each member state and Austria. They did not touch on the conduct of EU business, nor on the standing of Austria as a member state of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortly after its formation in February, the new <Col N="1684" /> Austrian government published a programme endorsing EU integration and rejecting racism. Subsequently Jorg Haider resigned as leader of the FPO1 and at its party conference on 1 May 2000, the FPO1 committed itself to a statement reaffirming the common principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. At the end of June 2000, the EU Presidency issued a statement on behalf of the fourteen requesting the President of the European Court of Human Rights to appoint three rapporteurs to deliver a report on Austria.</P>
    <P>The commission of three presented its findings, known as the &ldquo;three wise men report&rdquo;, on 8 September, 2000 which stated that minority, immigrant and refugee rights were as well protected in Austria as elsewhere in the EU and that the actions by the fourteen other member states had helped to increase awareness in Austria of such rights and the common EU values in existence. Following the publication of this report the measures announced on 31 January 2000 were lifted on 12 September 2000. Since that date relations between Austria and its EU partners have continued as normal.</P>

      <P>Acting in support of an agreement between the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli government which brought a peaceful resolution to the siege of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, the European Union agreed that thirteen of the Palestinians who had taken refuge in the church would be received by member states and offered temporary residence. I announced on 13 May that the Government of Ireland would be one of those to offer residence to one of the men. Initially, the Government of Cyprus agreed to host the men until their eventual destinations could be worked out between the EU member states. At the General Affairs Council on 13 May, six member states indicated that they would receive one or more of the affected Palestinians. These were Belgium, Italy, Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain. In the end, Spain and Italy took three men each, while Ireland, Greece and Portugal took two each. One of them was permitted to remain in Cyprus by the Government of that country.</P>
      <P>On 17 May the EU agreed a Common Position setting out the terms under which the Palestinians were to be received in the various member states and the conditions under which they would be allowed to remain. Two of the Palestinians arrived in Ireland on 23 May.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 63, 67, 110 and 118 to 120, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ratification of the Treaty of Nice is a matter of the highest priority for the Government and we consider it fundamental to our continuing <Col N="1686" /> economic and social well being. We will, therefore, hold a second referendum on Nice in the autumn.</P>
    <P>The treaty, which resulted from a year long process of negotiation within the intergovernmental conference, represents a good deal for Ireland and protects both our fundamental interests and our position and influence within Europe. Clearly, any negotiation involves an element of compromise. Overall, the Nice treaty is a modest treaty &ndash; while substantial in its import &ndash; and a reasonable compromise. It prepares the way for the most significant enlargement in the Union's history &ndash; presenting Ireland with new and exciting opportunities. This is the case we will put to the Irish people in the months ahead. We will also underscore our belief that Ireland's interests are best protected through maintaining our commitment to playing a full part at the heart of the European Union.</P>
    <P>It is clearly set out in the Treaty of Nice that its function is to complete the process, started by the Treaty of Amsterdam, of preparing the institutions of the European Union to function in an enlarged Union. Enlargement is the greatest challenge facing the Union. Therefore ratification of the treaty remains an issue of key concern to current member states and to those waiting to join.</P>
    <P>In all of my discussions with our European partners and with the applicant countries, I have sought to stress to them Ireland's continuing commitment to the process of enlargement &ndash; as recently highlighted in the second report of the National Forum on Europe &ndash; and the Government's commitment to seeking the people's approval for ratification of Treaty of Nice in a second referendum. At the recent summit in Seville, the European Council welcomed the Irish Government's determination to have the Nice treaty approved, this being a condition for enlargement to take place within the scheduled timescale.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention to publish the necessary Referendum Bill shortly. We will also act to ensure that people have the necessary factual information available to them to assist them in making their decision. We believe the Referendum Commission will play an important role. Early publication of the Bill will enable a full and comprehensive debate of the issues involved. The current position in relation to ratification of the Nice treaty is that all other member states, apart from Belgium &ndash; where the process is nearing its conclusion, have completed the necessary domestic procedures to enable them to ratify.</P>
    <P>There is, I understand, no truth behind comments attributed to the German Foreign Minister. They do not represent the considered view of the German Government. The Irish Government has repeated to all of our existing partners, and to the applicant countries, our continuing commitment to ensuring that the Nice treaty can be ratified. Nobody is currently thinking beyond that point &ndash; certainly there are no alternative plans or proposals being considered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1687" />With regard to the position we will adopt in the Intergovernmental Conference, the Government has made clear its view that while, in the new circumstances facing the Union, there is a need for sensible reform and renewal, on the whole, the existing institutional balance has served both Europe and its members well. The EU is, and will continue to be, an outstanding success story. We also believe that, while member states will pool their sovereignty where that makes sense, the nation state will continue to be the fundamental building-block of the Union. We also believe that equality between members big and small is a fundamental principle.</P>
    <P>As the debate on the future of Europe continues, including at the Convention on Europe, Ireland will continue to work to protect and promote our national interests. In doing so we will continue to cooperate and to build alliances with like minded countries, including the applicant countries, with whom we have already identified many common interests.</P>

These concerns have been raised with the Colombian authorities through diplomatic channels. In addition, I have written and spoken to the Colombian Foreign Minister on a number of occasions to reiterate these concerns and to request that the case be expedited to the greatest degree possible. Consular officials from our Embassy in Mexico have visited the men several times and my Department has maintained close contacts with representatives of their families in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Taoiseach, in his recent meeting with President Pastrana, emphasised the importance of ensuring a fair trial, security for the men, and access to them for their families.

      <P>The European Union meets the United States at official and ministerial level in a variety of contexts, both formally and informally, to discuss matters relating to nuclear non-proliferation. Predominant in this area is the need to prevent the further dissemination of nuclear weapons. The primary multilateral regime to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons is the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to which all the member states of the EU adhere.</P>
      <P>The EU met the US at official level on 27 March 2002 to discuss issues specifically relating to non-proliferation and disarmament, including nuclear non-proliferation. The parties discussed the first meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the 2005 Review Conference to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which took place in April 2002.</P>
      <P>As both the EU and US are major contributors to non-proliferation efforts in the Russian Federation, the meeting also discussed preparation for the second Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Cooperation Initiative. The latter is a forum wherein technical experts from the Russian Federation and from donors contributing to Russian non-proliferation activities meet to discuss non-proliferation issues, from a technical perspective.</P>
      <P>The EU also met representatives of the Russian Federation at official level most recently on 31 January 2002 to discuss non-proliferation matters. Prominent among these was the European Union Cooperation Programme for Non-Proliferation and Disarmament in the Russian Federation which was established by the European Council in December 1999. The programme aims to assist the Russian Federation in its non-proliferation and disarmament efforts, both in the chemical and nuclear fields. In connection with this, the EU hosted the first Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Cooperation Initiative conference in March 2001 which facilitated the exchange of technical expertise between experts in this area from both the Russian Federation and donor states and entities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to nuclear safety, in October 2001 the European Atomic Energy Community concluded a cooperation agreement with the Russian <Col N="1689" /> Federation in October 2001 which covers; nuclear reactor safety research, research into and development of safety standards for radiation protection, assessment and optimisation of geological disposal and scientific aspects of nuclear waste management and strategies for decommissioning, decontamination and dismantling of nuclear installations. There is also ongoing contact between the Community and Russia on nuclear safety under the TACIS Programme through which the Community has been providing aid to Russia for specific nuclear safety projects.</P>
    <P>The European Union also meets regularly with the Russian Federation and the US in the context of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, a grouping of 35 states, of which Ireland is a member. The group co-operates to control the movement of nuclear material so as to minimise the risk of diversion of such material for non-peaceful purposes.</P>

      <P>Each year, a number of contentious parades in Northern Ireland require the attention of the Parades Commission because of failure to reach agreement between the marchers and local residents. The Orange Order parade in Drumcree on the first Sunday in July is undoubtedly the most high-profile of these parades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has maintained a consistent approach to the question of contentious parades. It is based on the need for mutual respect, dialogue and respect for the law, including the rights of local communities. We continue to believe the resolution of contentious parades lies through local engagement and agreement. There have been some positive examples in recent years, particularly between the Apprentice Boys and local residents in Derry. However, mediation <Col N="1690" /> initiatives in other areas have failed to resolve disputes surrounding parades, most notably in Portadown where no agreed and mutually-acceptable solution has yet been found to the Drumcree dispute.</P>
    <P>The Parades Commission has appealed to both sides to commence direct contacts but, as yet, no agreed talks process has emerged. The most recent mediation effort, undertaken by South African lawyer Brian Currin, ended last November despite his unstinting efforts from May 2000 onwards. A direct and genuine dialogue between representatives of the local residents group and the Portadown District Lodge would be an important and positive development. While the Parades Commission can &ldquo;manage&rdquo; contentious parades, disputes will only be properly resolved in the long-term through such local engagement.</P>
    <P>The continuing disagreements over Drumcree and other contentious parades &ndash; and their negative impact on community relations &ndash; are a cause of concern to the Government as this year's marching season approaches. We are keeping in close contact with the British Government and other interested parties to monitor the situation in the lead-up to Drumcree Sunday on 7 July next.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland, a founding member in 1949, has been a consistent supporter of the role and values of the Council of Europe since its earliest days and has <Col N="1691" /> contributed actively to its work, at intergovernmental and parliamentary levels. We continue to see the Council performing a key function in European construction. It is playing an essential role in ensuring that fundamental human values form the basis for the emergence of a democratic society throughout the European continent. Now with 44 member states, its rapid enlargement since 1989 has enhanced the relevance of the organisation.</P>
      <P>Full compliance with the obligations of Council of Europe membership by all member states remains however a key challenge. Ireland supports the requirement that all member states continue to bring their institutions, legislation and practice fully in line with Council of Europe standards, and resolve any situation of conflict by peaceful, political means. In this context Ireland strongly supports the Council of Europe's important role in efforts to reach a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Chechnya.</P>
      <P>Following the last summit in 1997, a far-reaching review of Council of Europe priorities and procedures was undertaken in order that future challenges were correctly identified and addressed in the most efficient way. The following priorities for the Council were adopted; human rights, democratic stability, the rule of law, culture and education, social cohesion.</P>
      <P>Ireland attaches the highest priority to the achievements of the Council of Europe in the area of human rights. Through its legal instruments, the Council has developed a unique acquis in the field of democracy and human rights; our objective is to ensure that the Convention on Human Rights, shortly to be incorporated into domestic Irish law, remains the essential reference point for the protection of human rights in Europe as a whole.</P>
      <P>Ireland is actively supporting the Council's human rights activities, both in Strasbourg and in the field. Ireland's Permanent Representative in Strasbourg has recently been appointed Rapporteur on Human Rights of the Committee of Ministers and also chairs the Liaison Committee with the Court of Human Rights. Following upon an initiative during our Presidency of the Organisation in 2000, Ireland chaired an evaluation group on guaranteeing the continued effectiveness of the Court of Human Rights which is facing an exponential increase in its case load; the recommendations of this group, including a significant expansion of resources for the court and changes in the convention system, were endorsed by the ministerial session last November. A progress report on the implementation of the recommendations is being prepared by Ireland for presentation to the next ministerial session this autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is committed to supporting the Council's assistance programmes in the field to promote democratic stability, human rights and the rule of law. Over the years 2002 to 2004, Ireland will provide bilateral assistance of more than &euro;1.8 million to Council of Europe projects including <Col N="1692" /> training in the jurisprudence of the Convention on Human Rights for the entire judiciary in Yugoslavia in preparation for its accession to the Council of Europe; training in human rights for the police in Russia; and a number of projects for the development of democratic citizenship in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria and Romania. These allocations reflect our commitment to the countries of transition in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to secure the ratification of Council of Europe Conventions and other legal instruments which, now totalling more than 170, codify and consolidate best practice and give concrete expression to the core values which the Council exists to promote and defend. So far this year, Ireland has ratified Protocol 13 to the Convention on Human Rights on the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances and the European Landscape Convention; we have also signed the Convention against Cybercrime. Our priority is to ratify a number of other instruments, including the European Convention on the Exercise of Children's Rights as well as the Anti-Doping Convention. Ireland is participating actively in the Multidisciplinary Group on Terrorism, set up by the Council of Europe in the wake of the atrocities of 11 September 2001. This group will shortly finalise its conclusions, including on the updating of the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.</P>
    <P>Ireland also this year ratified the Charter on Local Self Government. An important conference to develop awareness among representatives of all Irish local authorities of this instrument is being organised by the Government, in association with the Council of Europe, in Dublin in October this year. Ireland is a leading supporter of the Council of Europe's local democracy strategy now accepted as a priority within the Stability Pact for South East Europe. Three local democracy agencies are being established in Serbia and Montenegro and Kosovo with Irish funding; Carlow County Council is playing a leading role in one of these agencies and it is hoped to involve other Irish local authorities.</P>
    <P>Ireland is working actively to support the Council's role in promoting social cohesion throughout Europe. The Government, in cooperation with the Council of Europe, is organising a conference for the social partners in Ireland on social rights, including the Revised European Social Charter and the Protocol on Collective Complaints both of which were ratified by Ireland in 2000. In this context, the Government earlier this year decided to accede to the Council of Europe Development Bank. Accession, which will be the subject of special legislation to be presented by the Minister for Finance later this year, is an expression of Ireland's commitment to assist in the economic and social development of transition countries in Europe. Also in the area of social cohesion, the Government will, with Pavee Point, host a Council of Europe specialist meeting in Dublin in the autumn on problems faced in Europe by roma/gypsy and travellers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1693" />Ireland continues to support the reinforcement of cooperation between the Council of Europe and other organisations, in particular the EU and the OSCE. The EU is committed to using the expertise and mechanisms of the Council of Europe to advance human rights standards across Europe. These standards are also complementary to the criteria for future EU enlargement. The further development of cooperation between the enlarged EU and the Council of Europe, including in the implementation of joint programmes, will form an important part of Ireland's EU Presidency in 2004.</P>

It also decided to establish an embassy in Brasilia and a consulate general in Sao Paulo and to strengthen the staff resources of the Embassy in Buenos Aires. Since then, new embassies have been established in Estonia, Slovenia, Slovakia, Cyprus and Brasilia. In accordance with the Government decisions and with An Agreed Programme for Government, consideration will now be given to the timing of the establishment of further missions.</P>
      <P>Following the adoption by the Government of a Strategy for the Long-Term Development of Foreign Earnings in Asia, published in 1999, a new embassy was established in Singapore and new consulates-general in Sydney and Shanghai. The staff resources of the embassies in Beijing and Tokyo were also augmented. This increased representation provides a platform for a vigorous new approach to the development of Ireland's foreign earnings in the Asia-Pacific region. Representation in Asia, as well as in Latin America, will be kept under active review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>The European Convention was set up earlier this year, on the basis of the Laeken Declaration of December 2001, with a mandate from the European Council to consider the various issues emerging in the future of Europe debate and to draw up a final document which may comprise either different options, indicating the degree of support which they received, or recommendations if consensus is achieved. Its report will, together with the outcome of national debates, act as a starting point for the next intergovernmental conference, which is likely to take place in 2004.</P>
      <P>The Government has been participating very actively in the Convention to date. Mr. Ray MacSharry was chosen as the Government's representative for his wide experience at both national and European level, as a former Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, European Commissioner for Agriculture, and MEP.</P>
      <P>He is taking to the Convention the view that the European Union has been an enormous success story, for the Union as a whole and for Ireland in particular. While the Government believes there is a need for sensible reform and renewal of the Union, the objective should be to modernise the Union, and not to rebuild from scratch. The existing institutional balances and mix of policies serve Ireland, and the European Union, well. It is also our view that, while it makes sense to pool sovereignty in areas where we can do more together than separately, the nation state will remain the essential building block into the future.</P>
      <P>The Government is determined that the Convention must address the sense of disconnection between the Union and its citizens. The institutions of the Union must be made more open and more understandable.</P>
      <P>Much of this work needs to be done at national level, and the Government has responded to this need by securing agreement on new arrangements for Oireachtas scrutiny of proposed EU legislation. But we are also looking at other ways to involve national parliaments at EU level. For example, we believe that there is a strong case for involving national parliaments in the election of the President of the Commission. Parliaments might also have a greater role to play in the policing of subsidiarity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Convention is unprecedented in its scale and agenda. It is important that efforts be made to develop positions among like-minded members on particular issues. For example, Mr. MacSharry has co-signed a joint paper with the national representatives of France, Germany, UK, and Poland on the question of the allocation of competences as between the Union and the member states. Those who believe that the Union operates on a big state-small state basis might note that on this important issue Ireland could agree a paper <Col N="1695" /> with three of the Union's largest member states and the largest candidate State.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that young people, who benefit so much, as students and workers, from EU membership, often feel remote from and uninterested in the Union. The Convention is next month holding a Youth Convention alongside a session of the full Convention. The National Youth Council of Ireland, with the agreement of all of the Irish representatives, full and alternate, was tasked with seeking nominees from Ireland to the Youth Convention. The six chosen have already appeared before the National Forum, and have promised to bring a diversity of views to the Youth Convention. It is important that these views are heard, and I welcome the fact that it is intended that the involvement of the Youth Convention delegates is to continue for the duration of the Convention itself through contact with the National Forum and the Irish Convention Members.</P>

      <P>Serious allegations have been made over many years concerning collusion between security forces and loyalist paramilitaries in a number of murders in Northern Ireland. These allegations have been raised repeatedly with the British Government through the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference established under the Anglo-Irish Agreement and more recently through the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference established under the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>The recent Panorama programme &ldquo;A Licence to Murder&rdquo; has once again focused public attention on these disturbing allegations. In the case of Pat Finucane, the Government received a confidential report by British Irish Rights Watch in February 1999 which raised many of the allegations addressed by the programme. It was on this basis that the Government called for a public inquiry into the circumstances of his murder. In addition, the Taoiseach has expressed the Government's view that public inquiries should be established into the murders of Rosemary Nelson and Robert Hamill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was agreed at Weston Park to appoint a judge of international standing to undertake a thorough investigation of allegations of collusion in these cases and three others. Justice Peter Cory, formerly of the Supreme Court of Canada, has been appointed to conduct an investigation into these six cases. The two governments have agreed to abide by the findings and recommend<Col N="1696" /> ations of Justice Cory, including any recommendations for a public inquiry in any of these cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 121 together.</P>
      <P>The EU General Affairs Council on 18 February this year imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe as a result of its failure <i>inter alia</i> to end political violence and protect human rights. The targeted sanctions include an asset freeze and travel ban on senior Zimbabwean officials, a ban on arms exports to Zimbabwe and a ban on the export of equipment that could be used for repressive purposes. Incumbent President Robert Mugabe won the Presidential election on 9-10 March following a campaign marred by widespread political violence and intimidation, directed mainly at members of the MDC opposition party, and by irregularities in the polling process itself. The European Council meeting in Barcelona on 15-16 March stated that the elections had not been free and fair. The GAC on 15 April expressed concern at reports of continuing politically motivated violence against opposition supporters and abuses of human rights and decided to impose a moratorium on bilateral ministerial contacts with Zimbabwe except for contacts undertaken to redress the situation.</P>
      <P>Acting on a mandate from the Barcelona European Council, a high-level EU Troika visited the region at the end of May to hold discussions with countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) about the EU's concerns regarding Zimbabwe. The GAC on 17 June referred to the potential role of SADC in achieving a solution to the Zimbabwean crisis, and expressed the Union's willingness to enhance its dialogue with SADC and other relevant international actors in order to identify further action that could be taken to resolve the crisis in Zimbabwe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The GAC on 17 June also expressed its concern at the increasing and dangerous political and social polarisation taking place in the country. The Council welcomed efforts by Nigeria and South Africa to facilitate inter-party dialogue between the ruling ZANU-PF party and the opposition MDC, regretted the failure of the talks to date, and encouraged Nigeria and South Africa <Col N="1697" /> to continue their efforts. The Council expressed support for all efforts aimed at achieving a fully representative future government in Zimbabwe.</P>
    <P>While the political situation in Zimbabwe has not been discussed at the United Nations Security Council, I am satisfied the international community is actively seeking a solution to the issue. Furthermore, Zimbabwe is currently facing a serious food crisis along with five other southern African countries. Erratic rainfall and extended periods of drought have meant that cereal production in parts of Zimbabwe has dropped to approximately half of last year's harvest. The adverse weather conditions have been compounded by the Government's controversial land reform policy and the collapse of the commercial agricultural sector. Under the Zimbabwean Land Acquisition Act, from 25 June it will be a criminal offence for about half of Zimbabwe's commercial farmers to continue farming. The farmers will have 45 days to wind up their affairs before their farms become Government property. While the land is due to be redistributed among the landless, it is not immediately clear who will step in to continue farming. In the meantime, it is estimated that 46% of Zimbabwe's population of 12 million will require food aid from now until at least next spring.</P>
    <P>According to a recent joint assessment by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP), there will be a serious famine and loss of life in Zimbabwe in coming months unless international food assistance is provided urgently and adequately. However, a major crisis can be avoided with the timely delivery of food and good coordination among all stakeholder organisations.</P>
    <P>At the GAC on 17 June, the European Union undertook to respond generously to UN appeals to address the food and humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe and other countries in the region. Addressing concerns that the distribution of food aid is being politicised in Zimbabwe, the GAC expressed the view that civil society, NGOs and other stakeholders should be included in the implementation of this relief.</P>
    <P>As I have outlined in my separate reply to other questions on the matter today, the Government has, by way of an initial response, provided a total of &euro;1.2 million in emergency humanitarian assistance in response to the current food crisis in southern Africa. This is directed at those immediately at risk in Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe who have been identified by Irish NGOs, the World Food Programme and the International Federation of the Red Cross. The Government's overall response to this crisis is set to deepen considerably during the critical weeks ahead. Our ongoing response will build on Ireland's participation in the Special Meeting on Humanitarian Needs in Southern Africa which took place in Johannesburg on 6-7 June. This has resulted in the preparation of a coordinated response by international donors and agencies which is to be implemented across the region with effect from <Col N="1698" /> July. The Government will continue to strongly support these efforts. On 8 May, the European Commission approved food aid of &euro;6.5 million for Zimbabwe which is being distributed, in partnership with the World Food Programme, to the poorest families in the 19 most affected districts. An EU Declaration on the crisis was successfully tabled by Ireland and unanimously adopted at the EU Development Council meeting in Brussels on 30 May.</P>

      <P>The Communicating Europe Group (CEG) consists of representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs, Education and Science, the European Commission and European Parliament offices in Ireland, the European Movement and the Institute for European Affairs. The CEG is chaired by the Director General of the European Union Division in the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>In 2000, Communicating Europe had a budget of IR£115,000 &euro;146,019.88. The CEG funded the development of an interactive CD-Rom entitled &ldquo;Me, You and the EU&rdquo;, designed for secondary school transition year students. Funding for this project carried on into 2001 when the CD-Rom was released and distributed to schools. The CEG also sponsored regional consultation meetings on EU Enlargement and Institutional Reform organised by the European Movement in Ireland. Two media projects were also funded: the &ldquo;Europe Week&rdquo; radio programme broadcast information on local stations and the &ldquo;Eurolink&rdquo; newspaper series provided features to local and provincial newspapers.</P>
      <P>In 2001, the Communicating Europe budget amounted to IR£140,000 &euro;177,763.33. The CEG continued funding the Europe Week radio broadcasts. A series of television programmes, entitled &ldquo;Eurofile&rdquo;, was broadcast on local cable television. The CEG also funded the development of a series of leaflets and booklets produced by the Institute for European Affairs. Funds were also contributed to a new interactive IT public information facility at the European Parliament Information Centre (EPIC).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget for 2002 is &euro;180,000. This year, funding has again been allocated to the Eurofile television programme, and, funding will also be considered for a further media project. The CEG also mandated the Department of Foreign Affairs to undertake a tender process to select consultants for the preparation of a report on a comprehensive communications strategy aimed at improving the transmission of information on the EU to the public. The report will be completed in July. The Department is also currently consulting <Col N="1699" /> with a number of groups and representative organisations about producing general and group-specific information about the EU.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I attach the utmost importance to the promotion of foreign earnings and to advancing Ireland's interests abroad. It is one of the highest priorities of my Department and of Ireland's diplomatic missions. The Department recognised from an early stage that the Irish team's participation in the World Cup represented an ideal opportunity to raise awareness of Ireland in Asia, which is one of the key objec<Col N="1700" /> tives of the Government's Asia Strategy. The successes of the Irish team and the enthusiastic participation of the thousands of Irish fans have had, as expected, a major impact in raising Japanese and Korean media and public awareness of Ireland.</P>
      <P>In Japan the Embassy in Tokyo worked closely with the Japanese media and was involved in the organisation of a series of seminars, speeches, trade and musical and cultural events in Niigata, Kashima and Yokohama, the venues for the first round. In many instances these events were organised in conjunction with local authorities and Japanese supporters' groups. The Ambassador and the staff of the Embassy also briefed the press and gave interviews on Ireland to a wide-range of newspapers, magazines and television programmes. There was intense media interest in Ireland and extensive coverage of the Irish team and supporters during the first round and for Ireland's second round match in Korea. The Embassy will be building on this general interest in the period ahead, and already a number of Japanese journalists are planning articles inspired by their exposure to Ireland during the World Cup.</P>
      <P>The Embassy also worked closely with Bord Bia and with Tourism Ireland on the organisation of a major promotion of Ireland on 5 June, the day of the Ireland v Germany match. Some 150 business and media contacts and representatives of the Japanese food and travel trades attended presentations on the food and drinks sector and on Irish tourism, followed by Irish music and a pre-match meal in Kashima, Ibaraki.</P>
      <P>There were similar promotional opportunities in Korea. The Embassy in Seoul used the World Cup as a platform for the promotion of Ireland and Irish business in Korea. During advance visits to all the possible venues, the Ambassador and staff of the Embassy met with city mayors, provincial governors, chambers of commerce and local newspapers. They used every available opportunity to promote knowledge of Ireland and Irish business and to explore the potential for future cooperation. The Ambassador and his staff invited key Korean business contacts to the game between Ireland and Spain in Suwon and a number of Irish companies participated in an Embassy-sponsored promotional stand at the World Cup Nation's Day Festival.</P>
      <P>As part of the general awareness raising, Japanese and Korean versions of the Departmental booklet Ireland in brief were distributed before and during the World Cup to build on the increased interest. Overall, Ireland's participation in the World Cup served as an excellent promotional tool and greatly furthered the objective of raising awareness of Ireland, not only in Asia but around the world.</P>

      <P>UN Security Council Resolution 541 of 18 November 1983 calls upon all member states not to recognise any Cypriot State other than the Republic of Cyprus and UN Security Council Resolution 550 of 11 May 1984 calls on states not to recognise the purported state of the &ldquo;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&rdquo; set up by secessionist acts and calls upon them not to facilitate or in any way assist the aforesaid secessionist entity. Security Council resolutions are binding on all UN member states. The Government therefore does not facilitate activities which promote the economic development of the northern part of Cyprus.</P>
      <P>UN sponsored talks aimed at finding a solution to the partition of Cyprus have been taking place since January of this year. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has asked the parties to focus on the &ldquo;core issues&rdquo; including territory, property, security and governance. The Government supports this process and urges both sides to engage fully with the issues in a constructive and open frame of mind.</P>

A copy of Judge Cory's letter of appointment, which incorporates the terms of reference for the investigation, has been lodged in the Oireachtas library.</P>
      <P>While it is not for either Government to prescribe a time scale for Judge Cory, both Governments have made it clear that we are keen to see rapid progress. To this end, we have promised to make all relevant material available as soon as possible. The Taoiseach and I had a meeting with Judge Cory on 11 June, at which we discussed his task and welcomed his early arrival in Ireland as a sign of the importance which he attaches to this task. The judge indicated that he was very aware of the concerns of the families in regard to the time scale and that he was committed to as expeditious a process as possible. I wish Judge Cory every success in this important assignment.</P>

      <P>There have been no further indications of imminent military action since I answered a similar question from the Deputy in March. In the meantime, the UN Security Council has implemented Resolution 1409 which places the economic sanctions against Iraq on a new basis and which should result in a major improvement in the living conditions of the Iraqi people.</P>
      <P>The aim of the international community is to bring about the implementation of Security Council resolutions by Iraq, thus safeguarding peace and stability in the region and leading to the suspension and ultimate lifting of sanctions. The Government believe that diplomatic options have not yet been exhausted and would be seriously concerned at the use of military force. Primary responsibility for resolving international crises rests with the United Nations and in this regard we have welcomed the talks that Secretary-General Annan has held with the Foreign Minister of Iraq this year and expressed the hope that forthcoming rounds will be substantive and productive. The Government continues to believe that multilateral co-operation in the UN on the application of sanctions remains the best approach in tackling the threat from Iraq. Ireland will continue its work with our EU Partners and with others in the international community in an effort to ensure that any tensions are resolved without recourse to military action.</P>

I updated Ambassador Haass on recent political developments in Northern Ireland and the vital importance of encouraging and building support for the peace process on all sides of the community. I stressed the Government's concern at the current security situation, particularly at interface areas in Belfast, and the need for all parties to support the efforts of the <Col N="1703" /> Police Service of Northern Ireland to reduce community tensions. We also exchanged views on the Middle East, the situation in India and Pakistan and the fight against international terrorism.</P>

On both occasions we made it clear to the Israeli authorities that we were extremely dissatisfied that her request had been refused.</P>
      <P>We have not received a response to date from the Israeli authorities on this subject. I understand that it is the Israeli view that the Commissioner cancelled the visit while it was still under consideration by them. In practice, and as the working session of the Commission on Human Rights was coming to an end, it was no longer possible for Mrs. Robinson and her team to carry out effectively the mission mandate to them by the Commission on Human Rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In September 2000, the UN Millennium Summit endorsed the UN Millennium Development Goals. The first of the goals commits the international community to reducing by half, by 2015, the number of people, currently 1.2 billion, living on less than $1 per day and reduce by half the proportion of people living in hunger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the UN Millennium Summit the UN system has focused on how to mobilise the finance necessary to meet the goals. The International Conference on Financing for Development which was held in Mexico in April 2002 examined all possible sources of development finance includ<Col N="1704" /> ing domestic savings, trade flows, foreign direct investment, Overseas Development Assistance and debt relief. At the conference the EU announced that the member states would collectively increase EU ODA by &euro;7 billion per year by 2006 while the US indicated it would increase ODA by $5 billion per year.</P>
    <P>The absolute priority of Ireland's programme of development assistance, as underlined in the recommendation of the Review Committee on Ireland Aid, which the Government has accepted, is to reduce poverty, inequality and exclusion in developing countries. Both at the UN and in the EU the Government is actively supporting global efforts to reduce poverty and hunger and to meet the Millennium Development Goals. In 2002 our funding of key UN agencies dealing with poverty and hunger increased to &euro;38 million. The EU and its member states are collectively the world's largest donor of development assistance, funding over 50% of global ODA.</P>
    <P>Global hunger is now estimated as affecting 830 million people world-wide. The particular scale of the problem in Africa makes this a priority concern for Ireland Aid. We have co-operated closely with our EU partners and with other major multilateral donors in the UN system, such as the WFP, to tackle hunger on the continent. Ireland Aid has been actively involved in providing emergency relief to Somalia, Sudan, Rwanda and the Great Lakes Region, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Angola and Sierra Leone. In 2001, Ireland Aid provided almost &euro;14 million to fund emergency relief and rehabilitation programmes for Africa.</P>
    <P>The World Food Programme, WFP, has warned of a major food crisis facing Southern Africa, where up to 13 million people in six southern African countries risk starvation. WFP has described this as the worst humanitarian disaster in the region for a decade. Ireland Aid has allocated &euro;1.2 million so far this year specifically to help the people in that region.</P>
    <P>At EU level the meeting of EU Development Ministers in May 2002 adopted, at Ireland's initiative, a declaration which underlined the EU's concern at the food crisis in southern Africa, and called on major international donors to accelerate their response. Ireland has also been actively involved in efforts to improve the effectiveness of the EU's food aid and food security policy, a key element of the Union's reaction to famines and food crises. The European Commission has proposed a number of key recommendations which should help make EU food aid more effective and responsive.</P>
    <P>At UN level, the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Plan of Action, adopted at the World Food Summit in 1996, set out the way towards reducing the number of people living in hunger. Ireland chaired the Committee on Food Security at the recent follow-up conference to the World Food Summit, which took place in Rome between 10-13 June 2002. This conference reviewed progress towards meeting the WFS tar<Col N="1705" /> get and renewed the global commitment at political level to the task of eliminating hunger and malnutrition in Africa.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, since the Governments presented the parties with a set of proposals aimed at resolving outstanding aspects of the Good Friday Agreement on 1 August, significant progress has been made across the range of issues. David Trimble and Mark Durkan were jointly elected First and Deputy First Minister in the Assembly on 6 November and, in the period since, the institutions have been working on a full and inclusive basis.</P>
      <P>A recent Summit of the British Irish Council took place in Jersey on 14 June where the knowledge economy was the lead item for discussion. A plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council will take place in Armagh on 28 June. In addition, the Human Rights and Equality Commissions established under the Agreement continue to take forward their important work.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Government and pro-Agreement parties met for the second time in an Implementation Group to take stock of progress, following our first such meeting on 28 March. In October, the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning under General John de Chastelain reported the first act of decommissioning by the IRA. In April, the IICD reported that it had witnessed a further event in which a substantial and varied amount of weapons was put beyond use. In addition to the measures taken towards demilitarisation identified at Weston Park, the British Government has also announced the closure of Ebrington Barracks in Derry and the removal of a tower at Glassdrumman, South Armagh. Furthermore, a £200 million financial package has been created for Northern Ireland, which includes plans for the re-utilisation for local investment and regeneration purposes of Long Kesh &ndash; the Maze Prison, Crumlin Road Jail and the army bases at Magherafelt and Malone Road, Belfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Policing Board, comprising ten political members representative of the SDLP, UUP and DUP along with nine independent members, received its powers on 4 November, the same <Col N="1706" /> date on which the name change to Police Service of Northern Ireland took effect. The first PSNI recruits completed their training on 5 April. On 29 April, the board announced the appointment of Hugh Orde, formerly Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police, as Chief Constable. Since it was established the board has dealt effectively with some sensitive issues, including the design of a badge and uniform for the PSNI and the report of the Policing Ombudsman into the Omagh investigation. It will, however, continue to face challenges in the period ahead, including the report of the Stevens inquiry into the Pat Finucane case in the autumn.</P>
    <P>Reviews of the operation of the new policing arrangements, including by the Oversight Commissioner, Tom Constantine, and the review of Special Branch operations and procedures arising out of the Omagh investigation, are under way and reports are expected in October 2002, and before the end of the year, respectively. The British Government is committed to introduce legislation as soon as practicable thereafter to amend or clarify some provisions to reflect more fully the Patten report.</P>
    <P>On 29 May the two Governments announced the appointment of a Canadian Judge, Justice Cory, to investigate allegations of collusion in six cases of concern, including Pat Finucane, Rosemary Nelson, Robert Hamill and Billy Wright. I believe this to be an important step along the road to truth and justice for the families of the victims. Justice Cory has said that he hopes to have his work completed in 18 months.</P>
    <P>Despite this record of progress, sectarianism and paramilitary activity continues to be a serious cause of concern. Last autumn, loyalist protests around Holy Cross School in Ardoyne gave rise to inter-community tensions and violence in north Belfast, the repercussions of which continue to be felt. More recently, there has been serious violence and rioting in east Belfast around the small Nationalist enclave of Short Strand.</P>
    <P>The Government believes that people with influence on all sides must work to calm matters down and to find long-term solutions to difficulties at interface areas. However, it is also vital that such situations be policed in an effective and fair manner if Nationalist confidence in the new beginning in policing is to be underpinned.</P>
    <P>Despite the occasional stresses and strains in the process, good progress is being made in implementing the package of 1 August last. The two Governments will continue to work closely with the parties to maintain that forward momentum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>Since the events of 11 September 2001, the United Nations has been central to the efforts deployed against international terrorism. Following the adoption of Resolution 1368 on 12 September, reaffirming the right to self-defence and calling on all States to prevent and suppress international terrorism and to bring to justice the perpetrators of the attacks, the Security Council adopted the more detailed Resolution 1373 on 28 September, requiring all member states to take legislative and financial measures to combat terrorism, and establishing the Counter-Terrorism Committee to monitor the implementation of the resolution. The CTC requested all member states to submit a first report by 27 December 2001. To date, 157 reports, including the Irish report, on national implementation of the resolution have been received for evaluation by the CTC, of which Ireland is a member. Member states have been asked to follow up with supplementary reports on particular questions raised by the committee and, in this context, Ireland submitted a second report to the CTC on 14 June. Where required, assistance will be provided to those member states who need to upgrade their capacity for legislative, executive, or judicial action against terrorism.</P>
      <P>On foot of the Security Council Resolutions, the EU for its part drew up an action plan, approved by the European Council on 21 September, under the following headings:</P>
      <P>&ndash;Enhancing police and judicial co-operation</P>
      <P>&ndash;Developing international legal instruments</P>
      <P>&ndash;Putting an end to the funding of terrorism</P>
      <P>&ndash;Strengthening air security.</P>
      <P>A wide range of specific measures both internal and external are being implemented by the relevant EU Councils, including General Affairs, Justice and Home Affairs, ECOFIN and Transport. Progress is monitored by the General Affairs Council, which has overall co-ordinating responsibility for implementation of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of fufilling our obligations against terrorism under the prevailing Security Council Resolutions, and as a member of the Security Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee, the Irish Government is in regular discussion with our EU partners and more widely with other members of the international community, including of course the United States. I held a bilateral meeting with Secretary of State Powell in Washington on 26 September 2001 and we also met on 11 November during the United Nations General <Col N="1708" /> Assembly. The Taoiseach has held two meetings with President Bush, on 8 November 2001 and on 13 March 2002. These meetings, as with other meetings with foreign Governments since 11 September, naturally featured international terrorism as an important item on the agenda.</P>

      <P>Under An Agreed Programme for Government, the Government is committed to continue to play an active role in promoting development, human rights and democracy. Human rights are a priority of this Government and a central component of our foreign policy. The Government is actively pursuing its human rights priorities in a wide range of international fora, both on a national basis and also in conjunction with our EU partners.</P>
      <P>Ireland will continue to fulfil its obligation to promote the observance of universal human rights standards. We will continue to voice our concerns wherever possible in partnership with other like-minded countries in international fora such as the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the OSCE. Ireland has also been closely concerned with human rights issues at the UN Security Council since taking up our seat in January 2001.</P>
      <P>Ireland is actively engaged in the discussion of specific issues with like-minded countries, for example notably in the group known as the Human Security Network. The aim of this group is to establish the principle of human security as a central element in the international community's approach to situations of conflict. Its members are Austria, Canada, Chile, Greece, Netherlands, Jordan, Mali, Norway, Switzerland and Thailand. The Fourth Ministerial Meeting of the Network will take place in Santiago on 2-3 July and will be attended by Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the active promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards. The obligations we have assumed in relation to international human rights instruments to which we are party will continue to be met in the fullest way possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that &ldquo;No one shall be held in slavery or servitude: <Col N="1709" /> slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms&rdquo;. Full adherence to the absolute values enshrined in the declaration is of paramount importance. The concept of slavery has broadened from the traditional concept of the slave trade and now includes practices such as bonded labour and child labour.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the active promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards, including opposing and seeking the elimination of all contemporary forms of slavery. Contemporary forms of slavery include practices such as bonded labour, the sale of children, child prostitution, child pornography, the exploitation of child labour, the sexual mutilation of female children, the use of children in armed conflicts, debt bondage and trafficking in persons. We voice our concerns wherever possible, in partnership with other like-minded countries, in international fora such as the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the OSCE.</P>
      <P>Efforts to eliminate contemporary forms of slavery involve a wide spectrum of international organisations, NGOs and governments. Slavery and human rights issues in general are normally considered by the UN bodies which have a specific role and expertise in this area, notably the Commission on Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation. Ireland has ratified the ILO Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labour, in which Article 3 defines &ldquo;all forms of child slavery or practices similar to slavery&rdquo; as comprising the worst form of child labour.</P>
      <P>The then Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt, led the delegation to the 89th International Labour Conference in Geneva in June 2001. He raised the issue of bonded labour in the course of the discussion at the plenary session of the conference where he put forward a number of practical measures to address this specific problem. The Minister of State's proposals received the strong support of the majority of his EU member state colleagues. Mr. Juan Somavia, the Director-General of the ILO, made specific reference to the Minister of State's call for special measures to deal with the problems of bonded labour.</P>
      <P>At the 56th session of the General Assembly in 2001, the EU put forward a resolution welcoming the adoption of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish the Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, as a supplement to the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime. The EU put forward a resolution at the 58th session of the Commission on Human Rights, which called on all states to implement their commitments to eliminate child labour in its worst form, and especially where it interferes with the child's education, health or development. In this regard, states are asked to consider ratifying ILO Convention No. 182 on the worst forms of child labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, in a national statement at the CHR, <Col N="1710" /> highlighted the issue of slavery as one of the most complex challenges the international community face today and called for the ratification by all states of the relevant conventions. Additionally, the declaration and Plan of Action of the UN General Assembly Special Session on Children in May this year prioritised addressing the trafficking of children and protecting them from harm and exploitation. The Government remains committed to addressing the issue of slavery and the illegal trading of human beings in all appropriate fora.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The General Affairs Council on 17 June 2002 finalised a general framework for financing of possible future military crisis management operations. Ireland participated actively in the negotiations on the framework and our key concerns have been fully met.</P>
      <P>In Ireland's approach to the negotiations, particular attention was drawn to the general principle, reflected in the conclusions of successive European Councils, that participation in EU crisis management operations is voluntary. It was also made clear that Ireland's approach to participation in military crisis management missions is on a case by case basis and subject to UN authorisation.</P>
      <P>The framework now reached provides that the majority of the costs of participation in an EU-led military crisis management operation will be on a costs lie where they fall basis, that is, that member states will only be responsible for costs incurred through the participation of their own military forces in crisis management activities. This is already the financial basis for our existing participation in the UN-authorised peace support operations in Bosnia &ndash; SFOR &ndash; and Kosovo &ndash; KFOR. Additionally, any common costs that arise are to be limited to specific categories such as multinational headquarters costs and associated expenditure.</P>
      <P>I should emphasise that this framework for financing places no automatic commitments upon Ireland in terms of actual expenditure. This, as well all other aspects of possible Irish involvement in an EU military crisis management operation, will depend on the sovereign decision by Ireland in accordance with the triple lock provisions of Government decision, approval by Dáil Éireann and UN authorisation which are set out in our national legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In short, the framework provides for Ireland to take one of three alternative approaches in <Col N="1711" /> relation to any EU military crisis management operation agreed by the EU Council. This situation fully safeguards our position and ensures that we would not end up financing an EU-led operation which does not meet with our approval. The options are:</P>
    <P>(i) we decide to participate in which case we pay &ldquo;costs lie where they fall&rdquo; and contribute to the common costs that would arise, or,</P>
    <P>(ii) we decide not to participate but are prepared to contribute towards the common costs for the operation, or,</P>
    <P>(iii) we decide not to participate, abstain on the Council decision, and make a declaration under Article 23.1 of the Treaty on European Union in which case we would have no obligation to contribute to the financing of the operation.</P>
    <P>It has been agreed that more detailed work will be required during the forthcoming Danish EU Presidency to finalise a range of outstanding issues. Provision is made for review of arrangements by June 2004 at the latest. In the meantime, I am glad to advise the Deputy that a copy of the framework for financing agreed by the General Affairs Council has been placed in the Oireachtas library.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Presidency issued the following statement on behalf of the EU on 21 May:</P>
      <P>The European Union has followed with concern the unfolding of political and social events in Venezuela which led to the violence which took place between 11 and 14 April 2002, and which caused a brief rupture of the constitutional order. The Union reiterates its regret at the loss of life and its condolences to the families of the victims and to the Venezuelan people.</P>
      <P>The European Union welcomes the re-establishment of the democratic institutions in Venezuela, and the commitment made by President Chavez to seek the channels of dialogue and agreement necessary to enable the Venezuelan people to develop their democracy to the full. The European Union emphasises the importance which it attaches to the development of the rule of law and to the full respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>
      <P>In current circumstances, with a view to encouraging the necessary inclusive climate of tolerance and reconciliation, all political and social actors, as well as the media, must be capable of fulfilling their roles freely and responsibly. The European Union expresses its concern regarding actions taken against national and foreign economic interests, notably against citizens of member states of the EU who play an important part in the development of Venezuela. The EU takes a positive view of recent measures adopted by the Venezuelan authorities in favour of commercial enterprises affected by the recent events and hopes that President Chavez and the Government will give the necessary guarantees so that both Venezuelans and foreign residents may pursue their activities in a propitious climate. The European Union supports the Inter-American Democratic Charter and the efforts of the Organisation of American States regarding the situation in Venezuela. The European Union follows with interest and attention the situation in Venezuela and considers that the Second Summit between the EU and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean which took place on 16 and 17 May in Madrid has reinforced the democratic values and commitments which the two regions share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since that statement was issued by the European Union last month, the situation has remained tense in spite of some efforts at dialogue. It is earnestly to be hoped that the Venezuelan people will seek to resolve their problems and to achieve <Col N="1713" /> their objectives by exclusively peaceful, democratic and constitutional means.</P>

      <P>The Task Force on Policy regarding Emigrants, which was established in December 2001, was asked to recommend a coherent long-term policy approach to meeting the needs of emigrants, focusing especially on the needs of the young and vulnerable in the three areas of pre-departure services, services for emigrants overseas and services to returning emigrants. The task force held its first meeting on 12 December 2001 and has held eight further meetings since then.</P>
      <P>The task force has attached considerable importance to consulting with organisations and individuals involved in the field of emigration to ensure that anyone who wished to contribute to its work was able to do so.

Since 1999, a total of &euro;7.7 million has been provided by the Government in bilateral aid. This support, which began with emergency humanitarian assistance, has progressed to cover a range of recovery activities, including a number implemented by Irish NGOs. These have included support for the electoral process, voter education and media access; for human rights protection and promotion; for local and community recovery programmes; for agricultural recovery; and for capacity building in the health, education, water, sanitation, public administration and education sectors. The Government decided last year that its annual allocation for East Timor should be doubled to a figure in excess of &euro;3 million.</P>
    <P>The independence ceremonies marked a renewed determination on the part of the East Timorese people and their leaders to get down to the tasks of self-government and self-determination following the intervening period of UN transition and the successful holding of national and presidential elections. An independence support package of &euro;2.32 million which was recently announced by the Government focuses on enhancing the working capacity of the new administration at this crucial time. It includes the equivalent of US$1 million to help meet day-to-day policy administration costs through a World Bank administered trust fund. It also provides &euro;800,000 to help fill 165 specific, key technical posts across respective ministries which have been prioritised by the East Timorese leadership in conjunction with the UNDP. Other elements of the package include ongoing support for small quick-impact recovery projects at local level, core funding for the important work of the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation and follow-up funding for equality promotion and analysis. This package marks the Government's initial delivery on a recommendation by the Ireland Aid Review Committee that our aid programme in East Timor should be strengthened.</P>
    <P>Ireland Aid also funded the national consultations on planning which resulted in the adoption of a national development plan to coincide with independence. Technical planning is under way for a three-year programme which will succeed the transitional strategy through which Ireland Aid has been assisting East Timor during 2001-02. Ireland Aid has an office in Dili which is implementing our aid programme and building a very positive profile locally.</P>

      <P>The Good Friday Agreement provided that consideration be given to the establishment of an independent consultative forum appointed by the two administrations, North and South, and representative of civil society on the island. The Government also gave a commitment to work for the early establishment of this forum under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>At the second plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, held in Dublin on 26 September 2000, the Council agreed that a joint North-South working group, comprising officials of both Administrations, be tasked with studying the establishment of the Forum and reporting to the next Plenary. A report on the work of the joint North-South working group was made to the third plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, which met in Dublin on 30 November 2001.</P>
      <P>The matter was further discussed at the North-South Ministerial Council's first meeting in institutional format, held in Belfast on 17 December 2001, when it was agreed that the forum should be based on a formal interaction between structures representative of civil society in both parts of the island. The working group was charged with consulting with the Northern Ireland Civic Forum and the social partners participating in the central review mechanism of the PPF, with a view to formulating proposals for a possible structure for the forum. This consultation has now taken place, and the working group's report will be discussed at the forthcoming meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council on 28 June.</P>

      <P>Concern at the risk of conflict on the Indian subcontinent remains high. In view of this my Department, on 2 June 2002, advised against all travel to India and Pakistan for the time being and also advised Irish citizens resident in the region to consider leaving. The Irish Embassy in New Delhi has contacted all Irish citizens known to be in India in order to make this advice clear and we understand that all those who wish to leave have already done so. The majority of citizens remaining are in south India which is further from the potential zone of conflict. Ireland has an Honorary Consulate in Bangalore and measures have been taken to strengthen the consular services available to Irish citizens in south India.</P>
      <P>In relation to Pakistan, I understand that those Irish citizens who wish to leave have done so. My Department is continuing to monitor the situation in the region closely and will provide further advice and support to Irish citizens there in relation to their safety as appropriate.</P>

      <P>The Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) founded in 1996, brings together the 15 EU member states and the Commission and ten Asian countries &ndash; Brunei-Darussalam, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, The Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam &ndash; in an unique, informal process of dialogue aimed at enhancing co-operation between the two regions. It began in April 1996 with a Summit of Heads of State and Government in Bangkok. The process is in addition to the ongoing dialogue between the EU and the Association of South East Asia Nations (ASEAN) but has the added importance of participation by China, Japan and Korea.</P>
      <P>The dialogue focuses on political, economic and social and cultural issues and is carried out through summit, ministerial, expert and civil society level meetings. Because of the nature of the process, with its emphasis on informality, priorities are discussed and built upon from meeting to meeting. Recent meetings include the ASEM Foreign Ministers in June this year, the Ministerial Conference on Co-operation on the Management of Migratory Flows between Europe and Asia, in April, and an <i>ad hoc </i>meeting of Ministers of the Environment in Beijing, last January. Participants in all of these meetings engaged in active and constructive discussion which has led to better understanding, a deepening of the relationship and improved co-operation on issues of mutual interest.</P>
      <P>The next ASEM Summit will take place in Copenhagen in September and the Taoiseach hopes to attend. While the agenda has not yet been finalised, I can say that the summit will consider current international political developments, including the international security situation. It will consider the economic and financial priorities based on input from meetings of ASEM Finance and Economic Ministers which will take place this July and September. Finally, the summit leaders will look at human resource development including lifelong learning. The ASEM Foreign Ministers meeting earlier this month endorsed three proposals which will be discussed as key ASEM initiatives for the summit: an ASEM seminar on anti-terrorism, a workshop on the future of employment and the quality of labour, which Ireland has co-sponsored, and a conference on cultures and civilisations.</P>

      <P>The Government's overseas development programme supports a wide range of programmes designed to alleviate poverty and to support the development of poorer countries. Total spending in 2001 was &euro;320 million, including spending under my Department's Vote 39 &ndash; international co-operation &ndash; and amounts spent by other Departments such as Education and Science and Agriculture and Food. Political, education and development programmes, which are a high priority for Ireland Aid, are supported in a number of ways. These include support through multilateral organisations, principally the UN and EU, the co-financing of activities of NGOs and direct support to countries.</P>
      <P>In 2001, the work of Ireland Aid was directed at the following sectors: governance and civil society, &euro;35 million; education, &euro;41.6 million; health, &euro;31.6 million; agriculture and environment, &euro;16.6 million; water and sanitation, &euro;8.9 million; transport and roads, &euro;6 million; emergency relief, &euro;19.1 million; debt relief, &euro;12.1 million; social services, &euro; 5.1 million and &euro;27 million was spent on other areas. I am arranging to send the Deputy a copy of the latest Ireland Aid annual report, which sets out in detail the various programmes funded under it, including the critical areas referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>

It also gave unreserved support to the efforts of the Secretary General and the Security Council as a whole. It reaffirmed the attachment of the EU to the unconditional observation of the Security Council resolutions and called on Iraq to comply with the resolutions without delay. It welcomed the adoption of Resolution 1409 and called on Iraq to co-operate fully with the new sanctions regime.</P>

      <P>At the European Council in Seville, Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in the Middle East and the tensions between India and Pakistan and the European Council adopted declarations on both issues following the discussions. The declaration on the Middle East called for the implementation of the proposal to hold an international conference to discuss the situation in the Middle East. Along with our EU partners, Ireland supports an early convening of the conference, which should address political and economic aspects as well as matters relating to security. It should confirm the parameters of a political solution on a realistic and well-defined timescale and it should have wide regional involvement and appropriate participation by all the major actors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The declaration on the Middle East stressed the need for urgent action by the international community to address the political, security and economic aspects of the crisis there. It con<Col N="1722" /> demned all terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians and said that the fight against terrorism must be accompanied by negotiation of a political solution. The objective is an end to the occupation and the establishment of a Palestinian state on the basis of the 1967 borders, with minor adjustments. The result should be two states living side by side within secure and recognised borders enjoying normal relations with their neighbours. Fair solutions will have to be found to the issues of Jerusalem and refugees. The declaration supports reform of the Palestinian Authority and calls for an end to military operations and restrictions on movement in the Occupied Territories. It pointed out that walls will not bring peace and it renewed the EU's commitment to work with all concerned to pursue opportunities to bring peace to the region. It reiterated the commitment to contribute fully to building peace and to reconstructing the Palestinian economy as an integral part of regional development. Ireland is committed to contributing more than &euro;5 million this year to the Palestinian people and the EU remains a principal contributor to the Palestinian economy.</P>
    <P>The Seville European Council declaration on India and Pakistan is a strong message of concern that the situation remains precarious and that the consequences of war could be devastating for the region and beyond. With the full support of the Government, the Seville Council called on Pakistan to take further concrete action in accordance with the assurances it has already given and with its international obligations, including UN Security Council Resolution 1373, to stop infiltration across the line of control and to prevent terrorist groups from operating from territory under its control, also through closing of training camps. The European Council called on India and Pakistan to establish an effective monitoring system, in a form acceptable to both, to stop infiltration. The Council urged India to be ready to respond with further de-escalatory steps as Pakistan shows it is acting to fulfil its commitments. The importance of free, fair and inclusive elections this autumn in Jammu and Kashmir was noted and both parties were called on to adhere to the non-proliferation treaty and to sign and ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty. The Council further confirmed the EU's commitment to work with India and Pakistan and with others in the international community, seeking possible confidence building measures to defuse the immediate crisis and to continue to encourage both countries to achieve a lasting settlement of their differences through bilateral dialogue.</P>

      <P>The normal practice is that the incoming Presidency makes its programme available in the final days <Col N="1723" /> of the outgoing Presidency. The incoming Danish Presidency intends to publish its priorities for the second half of the year tomorrow, 28 June. The Danish Minister for Europe, Mr. Bertel Haarder, visited Ireland on 18 June and delivered a public address at the Institute for European Affairs, in which he indicated priority areas which would be pursued during Denmark's Presidency. The overriding priority for the Danish Presidency is enlargement of the European Union. Denmark is committed to concluding a process which began ten years ago with the establishment of the Copenhagen criteria. Mr. Haarder noted in his speech at the IEA that Denmark was morally obliged to push enlargement through after the efforts of the new democracies to prepare themselves for membership. The Danish Presidency will also pursue the wider EU agenda, particularly in the areas of safety and security, sustainable development, food policies and food safety, and global responsibility. More information on the Danish Presidency, including its programme once it becomes available, can be obtained at the following Internet address: www.eu2002.dk.</P>

      <P>The World Food Summit, which was held in Rome from 10 to 13 June, provided an opportunity to review the progress made since the first world food summit in 1996, when the international community pledged to halve the number of people suffering from hunger by 2015. The Irish delegation to the summit was led by Mr. John Malone, Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture and Food. Ireland played a central role at the summit in its capacity as co-chair for the negotiation of the summit declaration. In its submission, Ireland focused on poverty reduction and stressed the importance of food security as a means of combating hunger. We made it clear that rapid and targeted responses to food shortages, together with supporting programmes which address future food security needs, would continue to be important priorities for Ireland's development assistance programme. We referred to the support which Ireland Aid was providing to a range of activities in the agriculture sector in sub-Saharan Africa, where subsistence agriculture is the main source of income for the rural poor and helps to ensure food security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Underlining the Government's commitment to addressing global poverty, we drew attention to our undertaking that Ireland would reach, by 2007, the UN target of overseas development <Col N="1724" /> assistance expenditure amounting to 0.7% of GNP. The declaration adopted at the summit is entitled the International Alliance against Hunger. It renews the global commitment made in the Rome declaration in 1996 to halve the number of hungry in the world no later than 2015, and it calls on Governments, international organisations, civil organisations and the private sector to help in the achievement of this target. The declaration recognises that progress has been inadequate and that meeting the 2015 target requires a rate of hunger reduction of more than 22 million per year on average. It highlights as central elements in the fight against hunger the need for political will, the importance of overcoming challenges such as gender inequality, disease and standards of food quality and the need for adequate resources.</P>
    <P>An important advance achieved at the summit was the decision to establish an intergovernmental working group to devise a set of voluntary guidelines to support efforts to achieve the progressive realisation of the right to adequate food. Ireland fully supports the commitments outlined in the summit declaration and will continue to work closely with the FAO and other donors to help achieve the target of halving the number of malnourished people in the world by 2015.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government welcomed the decision on 29 May to appoint Mr. Hugh Orde, the Deputy Assistant Chief Constable of the London Metropolitan Police, as the new Chief Constable for the Police Service of Northern Ireland. In publicly congratulating Mr. Orde, I stressed the significance of the Chief Constable being chosen for the first time through open competition by representatives of the community which he will serve. Mr. Orde will take up duty at a challenging and potentially rewarding time. Dealing with public order situations in a fair and effective manner, earning the confidence of the whole community and establishing a positive working relationship with the Policing Board are key objectives. Overriding these is the central challenge of making the vision <Col N="1725" /> outlined in the Patten recommendations a reality for the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>There have been many positive policing developments since the inauguration of the Police Service of Northern Ireland last November. The Policing Board has demonstrated its professionalism and strength of purpose in being able to craft skilful solutions to a host of issues. These included the decisions on the new emblem and the considered response to the Omagh reports. The first batch of new police officers selected on a 50-50 basis graduated on 5 April. North-South policing co-operation has been enhanced with the signing on 29 April of an intergovernmental agreement covering all areas of co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, as recommended in the Patten report.</P>
      <P>Upon gaining his new position, Mr. Orde promised that his tenure as Chief Constable would be as open and transparent as possible. The Patten proposals for restructuring special branch and amalgamating it with criminal division need to be implemented fully and without delay. The role of Tom Constantine, the independent oversight commissioner with responsibility for overseeing the full and effective implementation of the Patten recommendations, is crucial in this regard. He has already signalled concern at a lack of progress in implementing the relevant Patten recommendations on special branch restructuring and he is expected to return to this issue again in his next progress report, due in September.</P>
      <P>I also look forward to the establishment in the near future of the district policing partnerships, as recommended by Patten, which will assist the process of building local confidence in policing. Overall, the Government looks forward to continued implementation of the Patten recommendations and the creation of new policing structures in Northern Ireland. I would like to take this opportunity to condemn the despicable bomb attack on a Catholic recruit to PSNI which occurred recently in Ballymena and call on everyone in the community to give the new Chief Constable, the new recruits, and the new police service as a whole, the support they need to provide an effective, impartial and accountable policing service to all the people of Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75, 76 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>Intense and continued sectarian violence has blighted a number of areas of Northern Ireland, particularly over the past year. Areas of Belfast and several towns and villages, particularly in County Antrim, have been affected by sectarian attacks. These have ranged from sectarian pipe bomb campaigns to individual assaults and, last January, Danny McColgan, a postal worker, was murdered as a result of sectarian hatred. Last weekend a nationalist pensioner, a taxi driver and a group of students suffered vicious attacks in Belfast. In Larne, where officials from my Department have been in contact with residents, a campaign of sectarian attacks targeting Catholics continues unabated.</P>
      <P>There has been a pervasive sense of siege in the Short Strand area of east Belfast in the past six weeks. Residents have been attacked by pipe bombs, blast bombs, paint, petrol bombs and ball bearings and have been denied access to essential amenities such as post offices, pharmacies and doctors' surgeries. There have also been attacks on loyalist homes in the area. The Government is gravely concerned about the intensity and frequency of sectarian attacks and their devastating impact on those targeted. The Taoiseach raised his concerns about the Short Strand and other areas of sectarian violence with the British Prime Minister on 14 June. I have met political representatives from the Short Strand and, during a meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, I stressed the need for effective and impartial policing and increased security measures to protect the residents of Short Strand and the interface areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said on many occasions that concerns about policing and security measures apply equally to nationalist communities in north Belfast, Larne, Ballycastle, Carrickfergus and elsewhere in the North where residents have suffered as a result of sectarianism. It should not be overlooked that nationalist youths have also subjected the Protestant Fountain estate in Derry to sectarian attacks. Officials from my Department and the Government's representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference in Belfast have been in regular contact with local elected and community representatives in north and east Belfast, Larne and elsewhere. They have visited these areas a number of times to assess the situation at first hand. Delegations of local residents have also met with officials of my Department <Col N="1727" /> to outline their concerns. The residents' concerns have been raised with the British authorities on a number of occasions, including through the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>It is important to acknowledge that nationalist communities are not the only ones under attack. As I said earlier, sectarian attacks have occurred in the Fountain area in Derry. They have also occurred in areas near the Short Strand, such as Cluan Place where Protestant pensioners have been forced to leave their homes, and Protestants have suffered at certain interfaces in north Belfast. A call for impartial policing means, of course, that those who attack Protestant communities should be brought to account. I know Deputies will join me in condemning sectarian attacks, irrespective of the constituency from which they emanate. As the marching season unfolds, officials of my Department will continue to maintain close contact with local political and community representatives and will liaise on an ongoing basis with the British Government to ensure that the right to freedom from sectarian harassment and attack, as set out in the Good Friday Agreement, is upheld.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that Holy Cross primary school is in danger of closing due to recent sectarian strife and the proposed building of a so-called security wall; and if he will intervene in a positive way to save the school.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The protest at Holy Cross Girls' primary school in Ardoyne was suspended in late November, following a series of meetings between the First and Deputy First Ministers and representatives of the protesters and the Ardoyne parents. These meetings, together with proposals aimed at addressing local concerns about security, traffic and community development, helped to create the context for a discontinuation of the protest. Since then, officials have been involved in efforts to finalise the proposals and reach cross-community agreement on their implementation. In mid-May and again in early June, the First and Deputy First Ministers wrote to the involved parties proposing a programme of action covering three elements: community dialogue, community safety and agreed principles for building trust and confidence. However, the Glenbryn and Ardoyne communities have yet to reach agreement on this package of measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although there was broad agreement on many aspects of the package, the proposal to erect a 2m high wall around a number of houses at Alliance Avenue-Ardoyne Road as part of the community safety measures has become a source of contention between the two communities. In the absence of local agreement on the package, work has not proceeded on the erection of the proposed wall. Despite the disagreement over the <Col N="1728" /> wall, the agreed principles for building trust and confidence proposed by the First and Deputy First Ministers were acceptable to both communities. These principles stated, <i>inter alia</i>, that both sides will work to discourage attacks, that a contact mechanism will be put in place on a 24 hour basis to enable both sides to defuse incidents, that community facilities such as leisure centres, health centres and post offices will be safely accessed by all residents, that the respective communities hold Holy Cross and Wheatfield primary schools in special regard and that the future of both schools should be recognised and protected. Agreement on these principles was an important step forward and can form the basis for future agreement.</P>
    <P>A number of community representatives have stated that dialogue between the two communities may represent the best way out of the current disagreement. Given the levels of hurt and distrust between the two communities &ndash; which clearly existed prior to the school protest but were greatly exacerbated by it &ndash; efforts must be made to build contacts and relationships across the community divide. I encourage political and community representatives to take this work forward as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed about the possibility of the school protest being reactivated by the Glenbryn residents in response to the disagreement over the wall. Therefore, the assurances given by the Glenbryn residents at a meeting on Monday night last that they would not reinstate the protest are most welcome. That protest and the tensions surrounding it were deeply wounding to the children and parents and were not in the best interests of the residents of the area. There should never be a repeat of the dreadful scenes witnessed outside the school last autumn. Since last June, when the protest began, the Government has followed developments in Ardoyne very closely. Officials of my Department have maintained ongoing contact with those directly involved in the Holy Cross situation and with political and community leaders in north Belfast. I have asked them to continue to monitor the situation in the coming weeks and to report to me on developments there.</P>

      <P>The insurance division of my Department and the Competition Authority are actively considering having a consultancy study undertaken with a view to a vigorous examination of the competitiveness of the Irish insurance market. Such a study would be reflective of the commitment in the programme for Government to remove unwarranted constraints on competition in all sectors of the economy. Under the programme, we are committed to supporting the achievement of a single EU market in insurance.</P>
      <P>In the specific case of motor insurance, the MIAB report made it clear that the market for private motor insurance was not competitive. The MIAB was of the view that the imperfect state of the market was such that consumers' concerns were unlikely to be allayed without an investigation by the Competition Authority. The chairperson and a senior member of the authority met with the MIAB recently to discuss the question, which will be further considered in the context of undertaking the consultancy study referred to above. I was pleased to learn that, at that meeting, the chairperson indicated his willingness to respond positively, if requested, to carry out an examination of the insurance sector generally.</P>

      <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies. As EU law prevents me from intervening directly in the matter, I am not in a position to supply the Deputy with information on indices of insurance costs. The Central Statistics Office publishes monthly indices of insurance costs for a number of classes. My Department's annual insurance report contains information on aggregate insurance premiums paid to insurance companies in respect of various classes of business. With reference to motor insurance, the recently published MIAB report contains an analysis of a wide range of raw data obtained from insurance companies by the MIAB. The report makes clear, however, that valid comparisons cannot be made, for a variety of reasons, between Ireland and other EU member states.</P>

      <P>County enterprise boards have responsibility for companies with under ten employees in the areas of international services and manufacturing, other than those identified as high potential start-ups. The boards are also involved in the local provision of management training for small enterprises through training programmes delivered by qualified trainers usually from a number of outside agencies or third level institutions.</P>
      <P>FÁS is responsible for apprenticeships and traineeships in all companies. FÁS also provides a training support scheme for firms, regardless of the number of employees, engaged in sectors related to business services, including the motor, retail, wholesale, insurance, auctioneer-valuer-real estate, advertising, contract cleaning, transport, postal, telegraph and radio communications, logistics and storage and warehousing sectors. Grants are usually a percentage of the training cost and companies with between one and 50 employees are given 70% towards the cost of approved courses.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland is responsible for companies with over ten employees in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors and high potential start-up companies. Enterprise Ireland also works closely with county enterprise boards to ensure that high potential start-up companies are assisted to develop to their full potential. Enterprise Ireland works with county enterprise boards, where relevant, to deliver specific technology, marketing and human resource supports to those companies.</P>

      <P>The commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to encourage a better spread of jobs throughout the country is underpinned by the provisions in the programme relating to balanced regional development. This chapter sets out an extensive list of policy initiatives which will be pursued in <Col N="1733" /> the coming period. The relative position of regions, in terms of employment and other variables such as GDP per head, is a very significant determinant of policy at both EU and national levels. These factors determine the focus of policy on matters such as Structural Funds and state aid to enterprise. For example, the maximum approved rate of grants to support new investment in the manufacturing and internationally traded service industries in the period 2000 to 2006, for large firms, is 40% in the BMW region and 17.5% in Dublin. The rate in the other four regions in Ireland is currently around 30% and will be around 20% for the period 2004 to 2006.</P>
      <P>Regional emphasis is a strong feature of the various programmes adopted under the national development plan and carried out through the Structural Fund operational programmes. It is underpinned by the stronger regional emphasis which has been introduced into the work of agencies such as IDA and Enterprise Ireland. The IDA is committed to delivering half of all new greenfield jobs to the BMW region in the coming years, an objective which it is on target to achieve in the period to 2003. In 2002, Enterprise Ireland aims to commit in excess of 30% of its financial supports to projects in the BMW region. In supporting the provision of incubator space in the institutes of technology, Enterprise Ireland has recently committed over &euro;14 million to six colleges in the south and east region, and &euro;7.9 million to four in the BMW area. Both agencies have focused their resources on regions outside Dublin and particular account is taken of the needs of the regions in matters such as transport, roads and telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Regional development will continue to be a strong focus of policy. This will be facilitated by the completion of the national spatial strategy, which is under way at present. Regional impact will also be one of the main factors to be considered in the mid-term review of the operational programmes from 2000 to 2006, to be carried out in 2003.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to an individual whose sheep were depopulated as a result of scrapie prior to Christmas 2001. In this case a veterinary assessment of the flock concerned determined that a number of the animals categorised as lambs at the time of slaughter should have been categorised as hoggets at that time and payment was made on that basis. Flock owners whose flocks were slaughtered prior to Christmas 2001 clearly understood and agreed the basis upon which their flocks were depopulated and were aware of the categorisation attributed to their animals and the price they would obtain for each category. It would be inappropriate at this juncture for either party to this agreement to seek to alter its terms retrospectively.</P>

      <P>The following table shows profile and actual expenditure for the period 1 January to 30 June 2002 for the major estimate headings. Total expenditure in the period was &euro;610.9 million against a profile Estimate of &euro;676.2 million. The fact that many Department schemes are demand driven makes end-year projections difficult at this stage of the year. As can be seen from the following table, there are pressures under the heading of livestock improvement and eradication of disease, but I do not anticipate an overrun on overall gross expenditure for 2002.</P>

      <P>I introduced a scheme for the distribution of the balance of the Agenda 2000 milk quota among certain producers. Producers who satisfy certain criteria and who had been involved in the farm modernisation scheme or the reduced interest scheme for farmers in financial difficulty <Col N="1737" /> during the early 1980s, or who were affected by an outbreak of animal disease in their herds during the late 1970s, were eligible to apply. A large volume of applications well received under this scheme and processing of these is taking place at present.</P>
      <P>An application was received from the person named. My Department will not be in a position to confirm whether individual applications are acceptable until a full assessment has been conducted of the accompanying documentation. The assessment of these applications involves a considerable amount of work and I am unable to say at this point when that work will be completed and, accordingly, when allocations will be announced. My Department will endeavour to have the applications processed as quickly as possible. Allocations made under this scheme will be effective from the 2002-03 milk quota year.</P>

      <P>In general, the owners of sheep flocks which were depopulated as a result of scrapie prior to Christmas 2001 have been paid compensation on the basis of an agreement reached at that time between my Department and the IFA, representing farmers concerned. My Department prioritised the depopulation of early lambing flocks, in order to avoid imposing additional labour, veterinary and other costs on the farmers concerned and to minimise any potential animal welfare problems. These flocks were depopulated on the basis of a compensation package which was clearly agreed, understood and accepted by all concerned.</P>
      <P>In relation to flocks whose depopulation was delayed until the new year, the IFA then made the case that lambs which were born in the spring of the previous year were commonly understood to be hoggets and should attract a price commensurate with this status. The Department accepted that the IFA and the flock owners concerned had an arguable case, on the very clear and explicit understanding that this arrangement applied only to flocks which were not depopulated until 2002, and would not apply retrospectively to flocks slaughtered prior to Christmas 2001. In these circumstances I regret that there is no prospect of a revision of this aspect of the compensation package agreed with the IFA. The flock owner referred to was informed of this decision by telephone and in writing.</P>

      <P>Permitting requirements were introduced throughout the country for the movement of cattle from farm to farm on the resumption of animal movements in 2001 after the foot and mouth disease emergency. The permit system, which replaced the post-movement notification requirements in place since September 1998, has been retained because it provides greater assurances for cattle buyers. The origin, identity and location of the cattle are verified against the central CMMS database before the cattle are permitted to move off the farm. The system also provides more prompt information about the movement of cattle which would be of vital importance should a need arise to trace animal contacts in a potential disease situation. There are no special arrangements for the movement of livestock in County Louth.</P>

    <P>As undertaken in An Agreed Programme for Government, we are committed to moving forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies, taking account of the national spatial strategy. Given the range of important issues which need to be taken into account in taking decisions in relation to a new programme of decentralisation, I am not in a position to say when I expect the Government to be in a position to take such decisions. Deputies can be assured that all submissions and represen<Col N="1741" /> tations made will be taken into account as part of the Government's deliberations.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the absence of tax relief for couples who are both disabled; if, in view of the tax provisions for parents who have a disabled child, he will give consideration to the introduction of similar relief where both members of a married couple are disabled in view of the substantial additional living costs which they incur; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15180/02]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The incapacitated child tax credit of &euro;500 per annum, to which I assume the Deputy refers in her question, is a long-standing relief under the income tax code which recognises the particular expenses involved for parents in taking care of a child who is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity. I will outline a number of reliefs other than the incapacitated child tax credit which may be of benefit to married couples where both spouses are disabled.</P>
      <P>Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides for tax relief at the marginal rate in respect a defined range of health expenses which are otherwise not reimbursed. Prior to the Finance Act, 2002, claims could only be made by an individual in respect of his-her own expenses, or expenses met for a dependent relative or child who is not a relative but is being maintained by the individual. In the Finance Act, 2002, I extended this relief to allow an individual to make a claim in respect of expenses met for a wider range of relatives and for other individuals, whether they are relatives or not, aged 65 or over or who are permanently incapacitated.</P>
      <P>Section 468 of the Tax Consolidation Act, 1997, provides for a blind person's tax credit, which in the current tax year amounts to &euro;800 in the case of a single person and &euro;1,600 where a person and his or her spouse are both blind. The definition of a blind person for the purposes of the credit is set out in section 468 of the Act.</P>
      <P>Under section 446 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, and subject to certain conditions as set out in that section, an individual may claim the dependent relative tax credit &ndash; currently &euro;60 per annum &ndash; if he-she maintains at his-her own expense a relative of a claimant, or of the claimant's spouse, incapacitated by old age or infirmity from maintaining himself or herself, or the widowed father or widowed mother of the claimant or of the claimant's spouse, whether incapacitated or not, or a son or daughter of the claimant who resides with the claimant and on whose services the claimant, by reason of old age or infirmity, is compelled to depend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 467 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, a tax allowance may be claimed by an individual at his-her marginal rate for the cost of <Col N="1742" /> employing a person to care for a family member who is incapacitated. In this year's budget, I increased significantly the ceiling on the amount that may be claimed under this relief from &euro;12,700 per annum to &euro;30,000 per annum. The increase took effect from 1 January.</P>
    <P>Tax relief is available for covenants to individuals in certain limited circumstances. Covenants to individuals aged over 65 qualify for tax relief to the extent that the amount covenanted does not exceed 5% of the total income of the payer. This restriction includes covenants by children in favour of their elderly parents. There is no limit on tax relief for covenants to adults, including elderly parents, who are permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity.</P>
    <P>There are also two situations where a refund of DIRT paid is provided. Couples where one spouse is over 65 are entitled to a refund of DIRT if their income is below the income tax exemption thresholds. Couples of any age, where one spouse is incapacitated due to permanent ill health, are entitled to a refund of DIRT paid if their income is below the income tax exemption thresholds. In this year's budget, I increased the exemption limits for over 65s to &euro;13,000 single or &euro;26,000 married: any income up to this limit is free from tax.</P>
    <P>The disabled drivers' scheme, details of which are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passenger (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994, provides valuable benefits to those severely and permanently disabled persons who qualify under its terms. Under the scheme, a new car may be purchased every two years free of VAT and vehicle registration tax, subject to certain monetary and engine size limits. In addition, the annual road tax is not charged and the qualifying person is eligible for the provision per annum of 2,728 litres of motor fuel free of excise duty.</P>
    <P>The Value-Added Tax Act, 1972, provides for the application of a zero rate of VAT on a limited range of medical equipment and appliances, such as hearing aids. Certain disabled persons may be entitled to a refund of VAT for certain equipment under the VAT (Refund of Tax) Order (No. 15) 1981. Income arising from the investment of compensation payments made by the courts to those who are permanently incapacitated is free from income tax. There is a special exemption from income tax in respect of income derived from leases for incapacitated farmers who by reason of mental or physical infirmity are unable to carry on a trade of farming.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the foregoing, I have no plans at present to extend the range of reliefs available to include a specific relief for married couples where both spouses are disabled. As the Deputy will appreciate, I receive numerous requests, many from very worthwhile causes, for the introduction of new reliefs or the extension of existing ones. Tax reliefs by their very nature reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system much more difficult. Government policy in recent years has resulted in significant reductions <Col N="1743" /> in the burden of taxation which has benefited all taxpayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Special savings incentive accounts are managed by qualifying savings managers who operate the scheme under the guidance of the Revenue Commissioners. I understand that all qualified savings managers are registered with the Revenue Commissioners and were issued with a detailed set of guidelines setting out among other things the registration procedure for each new account and the steps that need to be taken to validate the personal details for each person opening an SSIA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to commencing an SSIA, an individual must have completed an application form giving personal details including name, address, date of birth and PPS number. The qualifying savings manager must have ensured that the PPS number quoted is valid and is appropriate to the person opening the account. To this end, the Revenue Commissioners set out in the guidelines the official documents that can be accepted by the qualified savings managers as confirmation of the PPS number. The official documents include a social welfare services card, a pension book, an item of previous correspondence from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, a PAYE notice of determination of tax credits, a payslip from the individual's employer with the PPS number quoted, an income tax return form <Col N="1744" /> or a notice of assessment issued by the Revenue Commissioners, a P60 or P45 issued by an employer or previous correspondence issued by the Revenue Commissioners where the PPS number is quoted. Where none of the above documents was available, the person opening the account was advised to contact the Department of Social and Family Affairs who would arrange to issue written confirmation of their PPS number. The qualified savings managers are in turn obliged to retain a copy of the document used to verify the PPS number.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the drugs refund card referred to by the Deputy was not considered as adequate confirmation of a person's PPS number as the number quoted does not always relate to the particular individual involved. Where a family is concerned, the same PPS number, that of the head of the family, is used for all family members. All qualifying savings managers were notified of this in June 2001.</P>

      <P>In common with our EU partners and the wider international community, we have strongly condemned the persistent and increasing attacks by Colombian paramilitaries against human rights defenders, including trade unionists. While we welcomed measures undertaken by the Colombian Ministry of the Interior to protect social and human rights defenders, including the establishment of a protection programme for trade union activists and journalists, in addition to the previously existing and broader special programme for the protection of witnesses and threatened <Col N="1745" /> persons, we continue to urge the Colombian authorities to take action to ensure that these measures are fully implemented and adequately funded.</P>
      <P>Human rights abuses against trade unions and voluntary groups in Colombia were raised at the 58th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights earlier this year. The commission deplored &ldquo;attacks against the life, physical integrity and safety and freedom of movement of human rights defenders, trade union leaders and Church dignitaries&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At the same session, the EU condemned &ldquo;the abuses of human rights committed against all who work towards justice and the respect of human rights, namely judges, human rights defenders, indigenous leaders, members of Parliament, journalists, unions leaders and dignitaries of the church&rdquo;. The EU will continue to stress to the Colombian authorities the need to address the lack of effective judicial investigations into crimes against social and human rights defenders, as well as the insufficient legal, administrative, security and financial measures to protect those social and human rights defenders who find themselves at risk. This emphasis on full respect for human rights will continue to underpin Ireland's policy toward Colombia, as well as our contribution to the EU programme of support for the peace process in Colombia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am looking forward to engaging with my Northern colleagues at the North-South Ministerial Council plenary session in Armagh tomorrow. This will be the fourth plenary meeting since the North-South institutions were established in December 1999 and the second one to take place in Northern Ireland. In addition to meeting in plenary format, the council has met almost 60 times at ministerial level to take forward an extensive programme of co-operation in a wide range of agreed areas for mutual benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the Government's overriding priority of securing peace on this island through the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the consolidation of its institutions, my priority is to ensure that the North-South Ministerial Council delivers to the maximum on its potential, both in terms of mutually beneficial practical co-operation and, more broadly, in contributing to the development of a spirit of friendship and co-operation between North and South. I have been pleased to witness the positive and constructive engagement between Ministers within the council. Our work in the council, along with the activities of the six <Col N="1746" /> all-island implementation bodies and Tourism Ireland Limited, represents a clear and practical example of the positive working of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific agenda for tomorrow's meeting and without wishing to prejudge our deliberations, I am particularly looking forward to having the opportunity to discuss issues such as how the council might best give effect to the Agreement's provisions that we consider the European Union dimension of North-South co-operation and the potential for expanding co-operation within the scope of the North-South Ministerial Council. The council will further progress work on obstacles to cross-Border mobility and will discuss the working group's recommendations on the establishment of an independent North-South consultative forum. A copy of the joint communiqué of the plenary meeting will be lodged with the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, the consolidation of its institutions and the development of a spirit of friendship and co-operation between North and South. Paragraph 18 of Strand Two of the Agreement provides for &ldquo;the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Oireachtas to consider developing a joint parliamentary forum, bringing together equal numbers from both institutions for discussion of matters of mutual interest and concern&rdquo;. While consideration of the establishment of a joint parliamentary forum is primarily a matter for the two Legislatures to take forward, the Government would encourage and support such a development. I hope to discuss this issue with our Northern ministerial colleagues at the plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in Armagh tomorrow. As the Deputy will be aware, the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution's recent progress report strongly endorsed the establishment of such a forum. In response to this endorsement, the Taoiseach stated that the Government fully shares this view and wishes to see early progress in that regard.</P>

      <P>Under An Agreed Programme for Government, the Government is committed to continuing to play an active role in promoting development, human rights and democracy. Human rights are a priority of this Government and a central component of our foreign policy. The Government is actively pursuing its human rights priorities in a wide range of international fora, both on a national basis and also in conjunction with our EU partners. Ireland will continue to fulfil its obligation to promote the observance of universal human rights standards. We will continue to voice our concerns wherever possible in partnership with other like-minded countries in international fora such as the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the OSCE. Ireland has also been closely concerned with human rights issues at the UN Security Council since taking up its seat in January 2001.</P>
      <P>Ireland is actively engaged in the discussion of specific issues with like-minded countries, for example, in the group known as the human security network. The aim of this group is to establish the principle of human security as a central element in the international community's approach to situations of conflict. Its members are Austria, Canada, Chile, Greece, Netherlands, Jordan, Mali, Norway, Switzerland and Thailand. The fourth ministerial meeting of the network will take place in Santiago from 2 to 3 July and will be attended by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the active promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards. The obligations we have assumed in relation to international human rights instruments to which we are party will continue to be met in the fullest way possible. As stated in the programme for Government, we are committed to achieving the UN target of 0.7% of GNP by 2007. The programme will be developed along the lines of the Ireland Aid review report with the principal aim of contributing to the reduction of global poverty, inequality and exclusion. Particular initiatives will be taken to combat the spread of HIV and AIDS.</P>

      <P>The interrelated problems of starvation and poverty in Africa are a matter of serious international concern. Global hunger is now estimated as affecting 830 million people world-wide, and the problem is particularly critical in Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has co-operated closely with our EU partners and other major multilateral donors in the UN system, such as the world food programme, to tackle the humanitarian crises which have affected Africa. Ireland Aid has been actively involved in providing emergency relief to <Col N="1749" /> Somalia, Sudan, Rwanda and the great lakes region, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Angola and Sierra Leone. In 2001 almost &euro;14 million was provided to fund emergency relief and rehabilitation programmes for Africa.</P>
    <P>The world food programme has recently warned of an emerging food crisis in southern Africa, which poses an immediate threat to up to 13 million people in six countries in the region. It has launched a major appeal for additional funds from international donors to meet the requirement for the 1.2 million metric tonnes of food aid which it estimates is needed immediately to relieve grave food shortages. In total, four million tonnes must be imported over the next year merely to cover the minimum food requirements of the subregion's population. So far this year, Ireland Aid has allocated &euro;1.2 million specifically targeted at the emerging food crisis in southern Africa.</P>
    <P>To co-ordinate the movement of food aid to nearly 13 million people in the region threatened by starvation, the WFP has also set up a regional logistics centre in South Africa. The regional office, expected to be up and running in the next few weeks, will co-ordinate logistical and transport operations, intervene where local bottlenecks are identified, and liaise with major donors and UN agencies.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the necessary measures are put in place at UN and EU level to ensure that aid is delivered swiftly and effectively to alleviate starvation in southern Africa. Ireland Aid will continue to monitor developments closely, and to liaise closely in this connection with other major donors, including the EU and the UN.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is deeply concerned at the suffering caused by the civil conflict in Algeria. The internal security situation has not improved in recent months and remains extremely volatile. Some progress was made earlier in the year, most notably the Algerian Government's decision to recognise the Berber language, but the Berbers boycotted the recent elections, which returned the current Government to power by a significant majority. However, Ireland and our EU partners are continuing their dialogue with Algeria and encouraging the Algerian Government to take further measures for the strengthening of democracy and respect for human rights. We will continue to impress upon this Government the importance of implementing these necessary reforms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland and our EU partners made reference to the situation in Algeria at the 58th UN Commission for Human Rights in Geneva. The EU <Col N="1750" /> delivered a strong statement at the Commission in which it outlined concerns at human rights abuses in Algeria. We urged the Government of Algeria to take concrete measures to improve the human rights situation in the country. We also urged it to respond positively to the requests for visits by the UN special rapporteur on torture and the UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial executions.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to present its view that a more co-operative approach by Algeria to the utilisation of the human rights protection machinery of the United Nations, including the role of the special rapporteurs, would be a constructive step in helping to facilitate a peaceful resolution to the current tragic situation and to develop the rule of law and strengthen the democratic process in Algeria.</P>
    <P>I continue to believe that the human rights dialogue between the EU and Algeria will only be enhanced by the recently negotiated EU-Algeria association agreement under the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. In particular, Article 2 of the agreement states that respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights, as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, will guide the internal and international policies of the parties and will constitute an essential element of the agreement. The agreement also commits Algeria to develop the rule of law and democracy, including the upholding of fundamental freedoms. Ireland expects to see these commitments implemented fully in practice. An EU troika delegation recently visited Algeria to discuss the agreement and further progress this dialogue.</P>

      <P>Apart from some notable exceptions, the ceasefire between the signatories of the 1999 Lusaka agreement has held since March 2001. However, the security situation in the east of the country remains poor. In the north-east, the armed conflict between the rival Hema and Lendu ethnic groups is continuing, and in the east, clashes between DRC and Rwandan-backed rebels occur on a regular basis, as well as unprovoked attacks against civilians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most recently, the lack of an all-inclusive outcome of the inter-Congolese dialogue &ndash; held in Sun City, South Africa &ndash; appears to be linked to increasing instability in eastern DRC. At the Sun City talks, which ended on 18 April, the current DRC Government and the MLC rebel group agreed on a power-sharing arrangement whereby current President Joseph Kabila will remain as President during the transitional period, while MLC leader Jean-Pierre Bemba will become Prime Minister until democratic elections are <Col N="1751" /> held. The second main rebel group, RCD-Goma, was offered the positions of Minister of Defence and President of the National Assembly, but rejected the offer and called for the interCongolese negotiations to be reopened.</P>
    <P>In mid-May, the eastern city of Kisangani witnessed a fresh outbreak of violence which, according to an assessment by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and MONUC, the United Nations Observer Mission in the DRC, claimed the lives of over 100 people. The violence began on 14 May with an apparent mutiny, when dissident RCD-Goma soldiers seized the local radio station. Local residents took to the streets and at least six people were killed, apparently because they were considered to be Rwandan. Following these killings, RCD-Goma launched reprisal attacks against the civilian population. It is reported that police officers and soldiers who took part in the mutiny were subjected to summary execution.</P>
    <P>Upon the outbreak of violence, MONUC personnel in Kisangani made repeated attempts to meet with the RCD-Goma authorities to demand that they exercise restraint in restoring order. MONUC also provided shelter to a number of individuals who claimed that their lives were at risk at the hands of RCD-Goma.</P>
    <P>Following MONUC's actions at Kisangani, RCD-Goma accused the special representative of the UN Secretary-General, Namanga Ngongi, of bias in favour of the DRC Government and banned Mr. Ngongi from all territories currently under RCD-Goma control. Three senior MONUC officers were arbitrarily expelled from Kisangani and Goma. RCD-Goma elements also forcibly entered MONUC facilities.</P>
    <P>The UN Security Council has strongly condemned the killings at Kisangani and the subsequent intimidation and harassment of MONUC by RCD-Goma. It has reaffirmed its full support for special representative Ngongi and for MONUC. The Council has stressed to RCD-Goma that it must carry out all its obligations if the Council is to continue to treat it as a full partner in the peace process.</P>
    <P>Ireland has joined with other Security Council members in strongly condemning the killings at Kisangani and the subsequent harassment of MONUC personnel. We have also supported the decision of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to dispatch a special rapporteur to the DRC to investigate the violence in Kisangani. We have stressed the need for all Congolese parties to enter negotiations on an all-inclusive agreement on the future leadership of the DRC, in a spirit of openness and compromise. Agreement on a powersharing government is key to the peaceful resolution of the wider conflict in the DRC. It is critical to avoiding further violence and easing the current tensions in the east.</P>
    <P>We have also highlighted the need for progress in addressing the security concerns of the DRC's eastern neighbours as a means of reducing viol<Col N="1752" /> ence. Ireland took part in the Security Council mission to the DRC from 27 April to 7 May 2002 which put forward a proposal to create a &ldquo;curtain&rdquo; of troops along the eastern borders of the DRC, for a limited period, to ensure border security in the final stages of withdrawal of all foreign troops from the DRC.</P>
    <P>Only when all three elements of the Lusaka agreement have been fully implemented: the establishment of an all-inclusive transitional government, the securing of the DRC's eastern borders, and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from the DRC, can the people of the DRC hope to be freed of the violence and insecurity which have plagued them for so long.</P>

      <P>My Department does not produce a &ldquo;top ten&rdquo; list of countries in regard to human rights violations, nor do the EU or UN produce such a list.</P>
      <P>Human rights are a priority of this Government and a central component of our foreign policy. In co-operation with our EU partners and other concerned states, the Government continually monitors the human rights situation in many countries throughout the world. The international community has an obligation to act when it has concerns and believes that these concerns should be pursued whenever possible in a constructive spirit of co-operation and dialogue, conscious of the responsibility which devolves on all Governments to promote and protect human rights.</P>
      <P>This Government has commented publicly on many occasions on those situations which give rise to grave concern, in a national capacity and as a member of the EU and the Council of Europe. These concerns have also been raised on a consistent basis by this country's representatives at the UN General Assembly and at the UN Commission on Human Rights. Ireland plays an active role in the third committee of the UN General Assembly and is currently closely co-ordinating with EU partners in identifying priorities and strategies for the forthcoming General Assembly. At the most recent session of the Commission on Human Rights, the EU sponsored resolutions on the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Burma-Myanmar, Sudan, Iran, and Chechnya. The EU also drafted chair's statements on Colombia and East Timor. In addition, the EU sponsored a resolution on Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab territories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has also been closely concerned with human rights issues at the UN Security Council, <Col N="1753" /> since taking up our seat in January 2001. Concerted international pressure applied through multilateral organisations such as the UN, EU and the Council of Europe is one of the most effective means of combating human rights abuses. However, despite the efforts of the global community in international and regional fora, it has to be acknowledged that the systems in place for preventing and tackling flagrant human rights abuses do not always prove adequate. Reasons for this range from the failure of states to ratify relevant international instruments, to a lack of resources and political will to focus on these problems.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the active promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards and will continue to voice its concerns, wherever possible, in partnership with other like-minded countries, in international fora such as the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the OSCE and the UN Security Council.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school for a particular school year is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year. This is in accordance with an agree<Col N="1757" /> ment on staffing entered into between the Government and the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of this school on 30 September 2001 was 74 pupils which warrants a staffing of a principal and two mainstream class teachers for the 2002-2003 school year. As the agreed appointment figure for the third mainstream class teacher is 82 pupils, I regret that there is no basis on which I may sanction this post at Brannockstown national school for the 2002-2003 school year.</P>
      <P>A report on the staffing and enrolment at this school was considered recently. However, the school can only obtain an additional teaching post in the 2002-2003 school year if it satisfies the developing school criteria as outlined in Paragraph 2 of Circular 9/02.</P>
      <P>If the board of management feels that the enrolment on 30 September 2002 will be 99 pupils or more it may apply to the primary payments section of my Department for a developing school post.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers in primary schools under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. While these posts are fully funded by my Department, the secretaries and caretakers involved are employees of the individual school authorities. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has <Col N="1758" /> been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, the money that has been transferred to this Department from FÁS has been used, in the main, to put in place a scheme of ancillary services grants for all primary schools. Funding to primary schools for secretarial and caretaking services has increased from the &euro;50.79 per pupil that applied in the 2000-01 school year to the &euro;102 per pupil that recently issued to all eligible schools. In this regard, Scoil Plas Mhuire boys national school and Scoil Mhuire Iosof have been issued with grants of &euro;9,792 and &euro;10,914 respectively. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the rate of &euro;102 per pupil will be further increased in 2003 to &euro;127 per pupil.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the Deputy will agree that these increases in the level of the ancillary services grant will be of benefit to the vast majority of primary schools. The transfer of the money to this Department from FÁS also ensures that this money will now be available to the primary school sector on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the student at risk programme in St. Aidan's community school. This programme was funded under the fund for the development of targeted educational responses to certain children at risk in 2000. The purpose of this fund is to develop preventative and supportive programmes that are targeted at children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage and social exclusion. Commitments to funding under this fund are given for one year only and projects that receive funding are advised that no liabilities should be entered into which assume the availability of funding in future years.</P>
      <P>St. Aidan's community school together with its four feeder primary schools have recently been invited to participate in the new school completion programme. The objective of the school completion programme is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education. The schools involved have been requested to come together with relevant local statutory, voluntary and community bodies, the city-county development board and the local drugs task force to form a local management committee and develop and submit a three-year plan to tackle early school leaving in their area. It is a matter for each local committee to identify local priorities and provide for a range of services and activities that address the education needs of children at risk in the area concerned. It is open to St. Aidan's to seek to have the student at risk programme included in the pupil retention plan for its area and funded under the school completion programme. The plan submitted will form the basis of funding allocated.</P>

      <P>In framing examination papers, chief examiners nominate and brief drafters, usually experienced teachers of the subject, to produce draft examination papers. All questions are checked carefully to determine that they are relevant to the content of the prescribed syllabi. However, examination papers in any given year do not ask questions on each and every topic within the syllabi. There are changes from year to year in the range of topics examined and in the type of questions that are used to examine aspects of topics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1767" />Any correspondence received in my Department in relation to the leaving certificate examinations in biology and mathematics has been brought to the attention of the relevant chief examiners and their advisory teams of examiners. They considered this correspondence at their respective pre-conferences where the chief examiners and the advisory teams worked on the development of the marking schemes for both subjects. These finalised marking schemes will be published and will be available to candidates who seek to view their scripts. In this way, candidates can study how the marking schemes were applied to their respective scripts.</P>
    <P>It would be inappropriate for me or any politician to interfere with the work of the chief examiner and the examining teams. I should also add, however, that there is a well-developed appeals system in place, involving the viewing of scripts by candidates, lodging and consideration of appeals, second viewing of appealed scripts and, if necessary, final appeal to the examination commissioners.</P>

      <P>Enhanced capitation grants are paid by my Department in respect of children with special needs who attend special schools or special classes dedicated to children with particular special needs. On 14 June 2002 the school account of Glencastle national school was credited by electronic fund transfer with the second moiety of the capitation grant in respect of the current school year. The enhanced rate of capitation grant was paid in respect of seven pupils. The school received &euro;6,090 in respect of the standard rate of capitation grant payable in respect of 58 pupils and a further amount of &euro;3,779 in enhanced grants payable in respect of seven pupils with special needs. A letter detailing the breakdown of the amount of capitation grant paid to the school in respect of the current school year has since issued to the school.</P>
      <P>The running costs of schools are not individually budgeted for by my Department. It would not be feasible to grant aid approximately 3,000 schools in this way. Schools' running costs are discharged by making funds available through my Department's capitation grant scheme.</P>
      <P>These grants go towards the operating costs of national schools which include heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, painting and teaching aids. The capitation grant has been increased substantially since the last Government took office in 1997. It has been increased from &euro;57.14 &ndash; £45 &ndash; per pupil in 1997 to &euro;105 per pupil in the current school year. This constitutes an increase of almost 84% over that period.</P>
      <P>I regret that there are no additional capitation funds available to my Department from which moneys can be provided for grant assistance over and above that already paid.</P>

      <P>As the agreed retention figure for the fifth mainstream class teacher is 146 pupils, I regret that there is no basis on which I may sanction a further post at St. Joseph's national school for the 2002-03 school year.</P>

      <P>The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, agency was established on 1 September 1999 and is an executive agency of my <Col N="1771" /> Department. NEPS has delegated authority to develop an educational psychological service to all students in primary and post-primary schools, giving priority to those with special educational needs. Provision of assessments is part of the work of the educational psychologists in NEPS. This service is provided in collaboration with the psychological services provided by health boards and certain voluntary bodies, many of whom have a traditional association with certain categories of disability.</P>
      <P>Each psychologist in NEPS is responsible for a number of named schools and visits each on a regular basis. At the beginning of the school year, the psychologists are encouraged to discuss the needs of each school with the principal and other relevant teaching staff and to draw up a programme of work for the school year. The educational psychologists in NEPS provide advice to schools on the identification and screening of children who might need to be assessed. Assessment of special educational needs is a staged process, involving teachers, parents and, if necessary, other professionals such as psychologists. Even if the psychologist is not directly involved with a child, he or she will act as a consultant to teachers and parents, offer advice about educational and behavioural plans and monitor progress. There is no quota of assessments for schools served by NEPS, although there are inevitably limitations related to the amount of time that psychologists can devote to individual schools.</P>
      <P>As NEPS does not yet have sufficient staff in post to provide a psychological service to all schools, my Department allocated, in summer 2001, funding for NEPS to administer a scheme for commissioning psychological assessments from private practitioners. This scheme is a short-term, interim measure pending the expansion of the service provided by NEPS to all schools.</P>
      <P>During the school year 2001-02, only schools that did not yet have access to the NEPS service were generally eligible to avail of the scheme. In order to allow equal access to the allocated funding, eligible schools have initially been allowed to commission psychological assessments for up to 2% of their pupils. NEPS management has conducted a review of the scheme's operation over the past year and has reported the findings to top management in my Department. Subject to Department of Finance sanction, it is intended to continue to operate the scheme for a further school year and to allow increased access in needy cases to the available funding. By the end of the next school year, NEPS should have reached its full staffing quota and therefore should be able to provide a full psychological service to all schools.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, the State meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years' duration, at approved colleges. It only applies to first time, full-time undergraduate students pursuing courses to which free fees apply. The position is similar to the third level student support schemes, maintenance grants are not payable to candidates who already hold an undergraduate degree and are pursuing a second undergraduate degree. These restrictions apply to every student who already holds a qualification at any level, irrespective of whether funding was previously awarded.</P>
      <P>The objective of the free fees initiative and the student support scheme is to assist as many students as possible in obtaining one undergraduate degree and one postgraduate degree. Any proposal to change these guidelines would have significant financial consequences for the Exchequer in respect of all third level colleges, which currently benefit under the free fees initiative.</P>
      <P>However, section 21 of the Finance Act, 2000, and section 29 of the Finance Act, 2001, provide for the introduction of tax relief for undergraduate fees paid in publicly and privately funded colleges here and in other EU member states. This new relief, which will apply at the standard rate of tax, will be available to full-time and part-time undergraduate students. Further details on claiming this relief are available from local tax offices or on Revenue's Internet site at http://www.revenue.ie.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>New measures have been introduced specifically aimed at increasing access to third level education. There is a provision within the <Col N="1775" /> national development plan for a third level access fund totalling &euro;120 million, over the period 2000 to 2006, to tackle disadvantage at third level. The provision for measures to promote access to further and higher education has increased significantly from &euro;0.5 million in respect of 1997 to &euro;26 million in 2002.</P>
      <P>In line with a commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, my predecessor, Deputy Woods, established the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education to advise on the development of a co-ordinated strategy to increase participation of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability at third level. The action group's report was published in July 2001. To date a number of measures have been taken in response to some of the main recommendations in the report:</P>
      <P>Special rates of maintenance grant, usually referred to as &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grants, payable to disadvantaged grant holders, have been introduced with effect from the 2000-01 academic year, with the full rate of the special grant amounting to &euro;3,809. A review of the operation of the special grants has been undertaken by my Department, in light of the initial take-up and with a view to extending eligibility.</P>
      <P>A new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was introduced with effect from 2001. The fund provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families. Area Development Management (ADM) Limited under whose aegis the partnerships operate, accepted my Department's request that it would administer the fund for the 2001-02 academic year. The total allocation for the 2001-02 academic year was &euro;1.2 million, with 37 partnerships and community groups receiving allocations from the Fund. Ballyfermot Partnership received &euro;44,440 from this fund towards its support schemes for students. My Department is at present considering a report from ADM on the operation of the fund during 2001-02.</P>
      <P>Financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the Student Assistance-Access Fund. The objective of the fund, which is ESF-aided, is to assist students who might, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered on a discretionary basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. The provision for this fund has increased significantly from &euro;2.49 million in respect of the 2000-01 academic year to &euro;7.49 million in respect of the 2001-02 academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the initiatives outlined, University College Dublin operates an Equal Right to Access programme which seeks to address the inequalities in gaining access to higher education. The ERA initiative focuses on the student in the <Col N="1776" /> context of family, community, school and university. As part of this initiative UCD has active links through its Outreach Programme with schools in Ballyfermot; Caritas College, Kylemore College, St. Dominic's and St. John's College.</P>
    <P>I am committed to progressing other recommendations in the report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education and to ensuring that the issue of equity of access to third level education remains a priority during my tenure of office as Minister for Education and Science.</P>

      <P>Within the State funded education sector alone, at least 180,000 students annually pursue part-time courses varying from hobby and leisure courses to basic education, personal development, vocational training and formally certified further and higher education programmes. Additional expenditure on free fees has to be considered in the light of other demands in the education system in increasing lifelong learning opportunities, tackling educational disadvantage at all levels, addressing capital and equipment needs and improving support services across the system. To abolish fees for all part-time students would be extremely costly and there are no plans at present to do so.</P>
      <P>However, the importance and impact of funding arrangements is recognised in the light of the challenges facing education institutions in regard to issues such as equity, flexibility, competitiveness, workplace learning and demographic change.

The issue will be reviewed in the light of the recommendations in the task force report, which is due shortly, and the budgetary situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Primary education is designed to cater for the intellectual, social, emotional, spiritual and physical development of the child. Physical education is part of the prescribed curriculum for <Col N="1779" /> primary schools and is a very important element of every child's educational experience. In teaching physical education, schools can be influential in promoting a healthy lifestyle as well as teaching a wide range of physical skills.</P>
      <P>Schools are required to teach physical education for at least one hour per week and have discretion to teach physical education for longer periods, if school authorities believe that physical education is an educational priority for their pupils.</P>
      <P>Physical education is included in the programme for pre-service education for all teachers and a number of teachers also take additional elective courses in various aspects of physical education, such as aquatics and games. Additionally, in-service courses in physical education are provided by education centres and other agencies as part of the summer programme of professional development for primary teachers. All primary teachers are therefore fully qualified to teach the physical education curriculum in primary schools.</P>
      <P>My immediate plan for physical education for primary schools will involve providing a comprehensive programme of in-service training for primary teachers to support the implementation of the revised physical education curriculum. To this end, a dedicated team of 26 specialist teachers has been recruited to the primary curriculum support programme where they will design a programme of in-service training. Training in the implementation of the revised physical education curriculum is planned for all primary teachers in 2003-04 and 2004-05.</P>
      <P>There are 3,291 national primary schools in Ireland, including special schools. My Department does not have a comprehensive record of physical education facilities available to primary schools at present.</P>

      <Quest> if public service obligation commitments will be introduced to ensure that towns in County Mayo will be provided with a natural gas service; if there will be a re-negotiation of the agreements with the oil and gas companies, in view of the dismal return to the State of those agreements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe an approach involving public service obligations is an appropriate one for extension of the gas transmission and distribution network. Such an approach would have to be funded at the expense of existing gas users and therefore raises risks for national competitiveness. Bord Gáis Éireann, which has a commercial mandate, is actively considering which towns in County Mayo can be supplied on a commercial basis.</P>
      <P>As regards re-negotiation of agreements with the oil and gas companies, I presume the Deputy is referring to the petroleum lease granted for the development of the Corrib gas field. The Corrib gas field was discovered in 1996 as a result of an exploration well drilled under a licence issued in 1993 under the 1992 licensing terms to the companies involved. The Corrib discovery was declared commercial in January 2001 and under the conditions of the licence the companies applied for and were granted a petroleum lease. Exploration licences and petroleum leases are legally binding contracts and it would not be possible to change the terms under which the companies explored for oil or gas.</P>
      <P>The current licensing terms introduced in 1992 were very carefully designed to compensate for Ireland's perceived disadvantage in terms of prospectivity and operating conditions and to encourage interest in exploration and development. Since the introduction of the 1992 licensing terms, a total of 37 exploration licences have been granted, of which 26 were frontier exploration licences. Out of those 37 licences, a total of 29 have been relinquished, including 19 of the frontier licences, which means that there are now only eight offshore exploration licences in place compared to a peak of 32 in 1997.</P>
      <P>The assertion that vast oil and gas resources in Ireland's offshore have been given away as a result of the 1992 terms is not supported by the facts. The facts are that to date there have been only two commercial discoveries in 30 years and, apart from the Corrib find, exploration in recent years has seen a succession of dry and disappointing wells.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stark reality is that Irish prospectivity is not comparable with our oil producing neighbours. The Corrib gas find, although very welcome, cannot be regarded as changing that view. Only four exploration wells have been drilled in the Irish offshore in the past three years, despite the existence of the 1992 terms. We have only had three successful exploration wells out of 125 wells in 30 years. Over the same period the <Col N="1781" /> United Kingdom has drilled about 3,000 wells of which about 250 are in production.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that operating conditions off our west coast are more difficult than anywhere in Europe, the 1992 terms are not very different to those in place in the UK which also does not have a system of royalties for current exploration.</P>
    <P>In the light of these factors calls for a review of the 1992 licensing terms are premature and cannot be justified at this time. Any indication of our intention to do so would send the wrong signals to the industry at a time when we need to encourage the companies to increase the level of exploration. However, it is my intention to keep the terms under continuing review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an extensive public campaign by lobby groups, in opposition to the further development of aquaculture in Lough Swilly. While the campaign gives the impression that Lough Swilly is overwhelmed by aquaculture, the reality is that this is far from being the case. The surface area of Lough Swilly is 15,400 hectares and the total water of the lough which, on average, exceeds 2 billion tonnes, is changed every two days or so by tidal movements. To date, the total area licensed for intensive aquaculture such as salmon farming, rope culture of mussels or the growing of oysters in bags on trestles amounts to just over 1% of the surface area of the lough. In addition approximately 7.5% of the area of the lough is licensed for the bottom culture of mussels, a traditional and unobtrusive method of cultivating shellfish that does not require any equipment in or on the water and, therefore, has no visual impact. Most of the licences date from the 1980s and to date there has been no evidence of adverse consequences arising from this aquaculture.</P>
      <P>This means that more than 91% of the area of the lough is entirely free of aquaculture and the vast majority of it will stay that way for the foreseeable future. The few remaining licence applications currently on hand, which amount to no more than about 280 hectares in total, are being considered on their merits, within the legal framework governing the licensing of aquaculture and with no prior commitment to licensing any or all of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Carefully focused research can yield valuable information with regard to the interactions between aquaculture and the environment. In recognition of this, it is already a mandatory requirement that a detailed environmental impact assessment be carried out in respect of all salmon farming projects, the only aquaculture which involves artificial feeding anywhere in Irish <Col N="1783" /> waters. Only one such project exists in Lough Swilly and has existed for decades without evidence of adverse impact.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that all licence applications are subject to public consultation. In addition to canvassing the views of the public, applications are also scrutinised by specified statutory consultees including, amongst others, An Taisce, Dúchas, Bórd Fáilte, the Commissioners of Irish Lights, the Central and appropriate Regional Fisheries Board and the relevant local authority and harbour authority.  The broad range of responsibilities and expertise which the statutory consultees bring to this process ensures that all aspects of proposals to engage in aquaculture are given due consideration and that possible impacts are clearly identified before a decision is reached on whether or not to grant a licence.</P>
    <P>Beyond the safeguards built into the licensing process, the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board provides a fully independent review of licensing decisions. Any party who is still dissatisfied is entitled to seek a judicial review of a licensing decision within three months thereof.</P>
    <P>In view of the detailed scrutiny to which aquaculture proposals are subjected, I do not believe that the imposition of a moratorium on the licensing of aquaculture in Lough Swilly would be justified. I understand, however, that the Save the Swilly Group has commissioned a scoping study for an integrated coastal zone management &ndash; ICZM &ndash; strategy for Lough Swilly. This study will be carefully considered by my Department, when it has been completed.</P>

    <P>The overall objective is to match the Department's expenditure to the voted amount, as per the amended Estimates. Most of the marine programmes are expected to come within target for year end, with reallocations between programmes to occur, as necessary, to cover any situations where programme expenditure exceeds the amount in the amended Estimate. Therefore, an overrun on the overall 2002 Vote Estimate provision is not anticipated.</P>
    <P>For information, the position as of end May 2002 on two of the major programme areas within the marine and natural resources Vote is as follows. The &euro;1.4 million forecasted excess on inland fisheries relates to expenditure under the fisheries boards' &ldquo;This is Our River&rdquo; initiative and additional overhead costs within the boards while the &euro;1 million forecast under other services relates to exceptional payments to be made under the Minerals Development Act, 1979.</P>

      <P>The following schedule outlines the current membership of the boards of the ten commercial State port companies, the date of each appointment, the recommendations received by various persons or organisations on foot of the statutory and non-statutory consultations as prescribed by the Harbours Act, 1996, and the nominations of local authorities and port employees as prescribed by the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1786" />The composition of the boards of the commercial State port companies is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Harbours Act, 1996. In accordance with section 17 (3) of the Act the number of directors shall be not more than 12. Each director is appointed by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources with the consent of the Minister for Finance. The chief executive officer of each port company is an <i>ex-officio</i> director in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 30(6) of the Act and the Port Companies (Appointment of Local Authority Directors) Regulations, 1996 and 2002 provide that the Minister shall appoint three members of a prescribed local authority or local authorities, each of whom has been nominated in the prescribed manner by a prescribed local authority or local authorities, as port company directors.</P>
    <P>Section 30(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Act provides that the Minister shall, in respect of a company the employees of which are more than 50 in number, appoint to be each a director of the company, two company employees nominated following an election process.</P>
    <P>The remaining six directors are appointed by the Minister and in accordance with section 30(7) of the Act. The Minister is obliged to consult with the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and various other persons seeking their recommendations in relation to these appointments.</P>
    <P>I have not personally received any complaints from any person or organisation regarding appointments to port company boards. However, I am advised that at least two complaints were made to my predecessor regarding appointments to Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company. I have asked my Department to check the position further and I will furnish the Deputy with details as soon as possible.<Col N="1787" /></P>

      <P>One of the principal factors which affects the uptake of broadband services is the price at which they are available. The price is in large part determined by the supply of the infrastructure and services which, in a fully liberated communications market is the responsibility of the private sector companies offering these services. The ODTR also has a role in regulating the prices at which broadband is made available. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy.</P>
      <P>However, recognising that there are areas of the country that are not as economically attractive for firms to invest in infrastructure and services, my Department has undertaken a number of initiatives to facilitate the roll-out of advanced communications infrastructure which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in regional Ireland.</P>
      <P>In 1999, under the National Development Plan 1994-1999 and INTERREG II, &euro;26 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Thirteen projects which rolled out broadband nationwide to a value, both public and private funding, of &euro;70 million were supported and are now completed. These projects entailed the roll-out of broadband services in the Border, midlands and west region and the south and east region.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the figure allocated to telecommunications initiatives was approximately &euro;200 million. Funding under this communications and e-commerce measure of the NDP will be utilised to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced information and communications infrastructure and services which will enhance the potential for the development of electronic commerce facilities and enable the electronic provision of public services, including education services, virtual libraries, welfare and health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A first call for proposals was run in 2000 and on foot of submissions received, nine contracts were signed at the beginning of last year which will result in additional investment in the regions in <Col N="1796" /> broadband infrastructure. The projects involved will be completed over the next two years and will entail overall investment of &euro;160 million in broadband leveraged from grant assistance of approximately &euro;55 million. Details of these programmes are available on the Internet at www.ndpcomms.gov.ie </P>
    <P>At the beginning of August 2001 I announced a second call for proposals. In all, 31 proposals were received. These submissions were independently evaluated and the results of the evaluation were finalised at the beginning of this year.</P>
    <P>On 8 March phases one and two of a regional broadband programme were launched and will ultimately see investment of up to &euro;160 million in delivering town fibre optic networks in key locations regionally. A further phase of investment in broadband based on the outcome of phase one will involve each of the 26 counties.</P>
    <P>Phase one of the broadband programme will see 19 towns, many in the Border, midlands and west, BMW, region targeted immediately. Metropolitan area fibre optic networks will be built in these towns to link up with the existing backbone network in the country. The town links will facilitate consumers, educational establishments, industry and business and provide &ldquo;always on&rdquo; low cost and high speed Internet access which will drive the Government's e-commerce agenda. The relevant local authorities have been asked to enter procurement to establish firm prices for their proposals. Once procurement is completed, and subject to satisfactory pricing, contracts will be offered for these projects. It is anticipated that this will take place over the next two months. The first phase is being conducted in association with local and regional authorities which will receive 90% funding from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Encouraging the uptake of e-commerce by small businesses is the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment which has, in conjunction with its agencies, developed a number of e-business initiatives to assist Irish companies in developing the appropriate strategies to successfully harness the full potential of the new information and communication technologies, ICTs.</P>
    <P>The key initiative towards these ends, which have been implemented by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the development agencies is the Enterprise Ireland e-business acceleration fund. In addition, Enterprise Ireland has spent approximately &euro;13 million to raise awareness and provided information and advice for companies seeking to adopt e-business through a dedicated e-business website, www.openup.ie. The Department of the Taoiseach has the responsibility of the overall stewardship of the information society and the implementation of the eEurope action plan 2005.</P>

      <P>The following table shows the 2002 estimates of public capital spending by my Department. Net expenditure, with the exception of inland fisheries, is likely on present trends not to be exceeded in 2002.</P>
      <P>An additional &euro;1 million has been allocated to the catchment management programme under subhead J1 &ndash; payments to the Central Fisheries Board, the regional fisheries boards and miscellaneous payments in relation to inland fisheries, in respect of the &ldquo;This is Our River Initiative&rdquo;. However, this will be offset by savings under other programme areas and, therefore, an overrun on the overall 2002 Estimate provision is not forecast.</P>

      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, 2000-02, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are: preliminary report; contract documents; tender and construction. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been received for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>
      <P>There are 46 applications in hand in the current swimming pool programme and these applications are at various stages of progress. The funding for the current swimming pool programme is a combined total of &euro;57.15 million for the years 2000, 2001 and 2002.</P>
      <P>Following the completion of a feasibility study on swimming pool provision in Kilkenny, Kilkenny Borough Corporation decided to construct a new pool rather than refurbish the existing pool. My Department approved the appointment of consultants for the preliminary report stage of this proposal in July 2000. In view of the time which has elapsed and to enable the Department to consider its priorities under the programme my Department has recently written to the corporation seeking an update on the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The work of the post mortem inquiry commenced in March 2001. It had initially been agreed by the chairperson of the inquiry, Ms Anne Dunne, that this work would be likely to take approximately <Col N="1802" /> 18 months. I have had no formal indication of a significant change in this position and I understand that the work of the inquiry, which is considerable, is proceeding apace.</P>
      <P>The inquiry is a private, non-statutory inquiry. It depends upon the voluntary co-operation of those involved in its work. The inquiry took the view from an early stage, that in these circumstances, it would be conducive to the success of its work if its proceedings were confidential and were not subject to dissemination publicly. The confidentiality undertaking requires that anyone contributing to the work of the inquiry is requested to enter into a written confidentiality agreement and undertakes to treat as strictly private and confidential all information, given or received, relating to the work of the inquiry, whether written or oral. This undertaking ensures that the work of the inquiry will be totally private and confidential. The inquiry has received a satisfactory response to its request for this undertaking and has explained its reasons for seeking it to the persons concerned. It is not intended that the undertaking would in any way limit or restrict the scope of the inquiry's work or its report.</P>
      <P>It had been agreed by Government that when Ms Dunne submitted her report to me that I would then submit it to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children for examination in order that the committee could draw its own conclusions on the matter. The powers of the committee in this context will need to be clarified in the light of the Supreme Court judgment in the Abbeylara case. I have written to the Attorney General's office seeking clarification on the relevant issues and will consider this matter further on receipt of formal legal advice.</P>

The review titled Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &ndash; A National Review, which was published on 16 January 2002, helped to inform the Government in its decision to provide a total of 3,000 additional acute beds for public patients over the next ten years. This represents the largest ever concentrated expansion of acute hospital capacity in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In tandem with the publication of the report, I announced the first phase of these additional beds with the commissioning of an extra 709 acute hospital beds at a cost of &euro;65 million. My Department has been advised, by the ERHA and the health boards, that 148 of these beds have been commissioned and that an additional 85 beds will come on stream by the end of July 2002. My Department is further advised that the balance will be introduced on a phased basis over the coming months.

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, in December 2001 I launched the development control plan, approved by my Department and the Eastern Regional Health Authority, for the Mater and Temple Street Children's Hospitals. This is undoubtedly the most significant capital development in respect of both the Mater Misericordiae Hospital and The Children's Hospital, Temple Street. The new hospital will be the largest in the State and will serve the catchment area of north Dublin and the wider community through its tertiary specialties. Funding in the region of &euro;340 million at December 2001 prices has been identified in the national development plan for the re-development of the Mater campus, incorporating the transfer of services from Temple Street.</P>
      <P>There are two locations identified by the development control plan to provide temporary accommodation for a number of hospital functions during the construction of the main campus development and planning permission for these was lodged in December 2001. On-site work is expected to begin in the autumn of 2002. The completion of these buildings will allow on-site work for the main development to begin. It is expected that the construction, equipping and commissioning of the development will be completed in 2009.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to revise the childhood immunisation programme in relation to the MMR vaccine. This programme provides for the immunisation of children against a range of potentially serious infectious diseases. Under the programme parents may have their children immunised free of charge by the general practitioner of their choice. The schedule of immunisation is in accordance with the recommendations of the Immunisation Advisory Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The World Health Organisation has indicated that MMR vaccine does not cause autism and that there has been no new scientific evidence that would suggest impaired safety of MMR. The WHO strongly endorses the use of MMR vaccine on the grounds of its convincing record of safety and efficacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international consensus from professional bodies and international organisations is that MMR is a safe and effective vaccine and that the recently published research does not support a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. The institutions include the Medical Research Council Expert Committee UK, the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) USA and the American <Col N="1810" /> Academy of Paediatrics. Recently, the United States Institute of Medicine concluded that there was no link between the vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. This consensus is based on large-scale epidemiological studies and more specific studies done in the laboratory setting. A large Finnish study involving 1.8 million individuals demonstrated that no case of inflammatory bowel disease or autism was linked to the MMR vaccine. A similar Swedish study found no increase in cases of autism in the ten years during which MMR vaccine was introduced. A recent UK study where researchers analysed some 2000 studies from 180 countries found no evidence of a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease.</P>
    <P>Recent newspaper articles alleging a link between MMR vaccine and autism referred to a study by Professor John O'Leary into measles virus. In response to these articles Professor O'Leary issued a statement indicating that the research referred to in no way establishes any link between the vaccine and autism. He further indicated that he and his research team have consistently advocated the use of MMR vaccine to protect the nation's children from measles, mumps and rubella.</P>
    <P>MMR vaccine is in use worldwide. Most countries implement a two-dose MMR vaccine programme and this policy has been very successful in controlling measles where high uptake of the vaccine has been achieved.</P>
    <P>The primary concern of the Department of Health and Children in relation to immunisation is that the vaccines in use are safe and effective. The Irish Medicines Board and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland support the use of MMR on the grounds that it has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective vaccine. There is a sound evidence basis for the use of MMR in the national programme.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board, IMB, is responsible for the monitoring and safety of all pharmaceutical products in Ireland. The monitoring of vaccine safety is ensured through clinical trials prior to licence and post-licence surveillance by the IMB. The IMB liaises closely with international bodies, including the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and the World Health Organisation.</P>
    <P>In addition, the report of the Joint Committee on Health and Children on Childhood Immunisation, published in July 2001, concluded that there is no evidence of a proven link between the MMR vaccine and autism and that there is no evidence to show that the separate vaccines are any safer than the combined MMR vaccine. In order to reassure the public as to the safety of MMR vaccine and to address the negative media coverage on this issue which adds to the confusion of parents in deciding whether or not to vaccinate their children, I recently launched a document entitled Measles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccine Discussion Pack &ndash; an information guide for health professionals and parents. The pack <Col N="1811" /> was produced by the National Disease Surveillance Centre and the Department of Public Health, Southern Health Board and was published by the Health Boards Executive on behalf of the health boards. This document sets out the facts in relation to the most common concerns about MMR in a way that will help health professionals and parents to explore these concerns together, review the evidence in relation to MMR and provide the basis for making an informed decision. The pack addresses such issues as the alleged link between MMR and autism; the safety of the vaccine; combined versus single doses; and contraindications to the vaccine.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to again urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme in order to ensure that both their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned. General practitioners are aware of the contraindications to the recommended childhood immunisations and parents should discuss any concerns they may have with their general practitioner before making a decision about their child's immunisation.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, smoking is prohibited on all public service vehicles owned or operated by Dublin Bus. Under Dublin Bus by-laws, authorised persons, including inspectors, drivers and conductors, have powers to enforce regulations in this area.</P>
      <P>I am advised that Dublin Bus currently operates plain clothes monitoring to detect breaches of smoking bye-laws on its services. Dublin Bus has also advised that this operation has resulted in the initiation of legal proceedings against 47 individuals over the last number of months and that 20 people have been summoned to appear before the courts on these charges in July.</P>
      <P>I am advised that Dublin Bus proposes to continue with this type of covert monitoring operation. This approach is a very positive one and deserves our full support. It is in everyone's interest that the prohibition on smoking on bus services is observed and enforced to ensure protection of passengers from the harmful effects of environmental tobacco smoke.</P>

Investment in the health system is therefore a priority for this Government and the level of investment each year will be determined taking into account the overall Exchequer position and the various demands for resources.</P>
      <P>Commitments for 2003 on the level of additional funding for the health services, including the continued implementation of the strategy, have not yet been decided upon by the Government as the increased expenditure arising from the health strategy will be decided as part of the normal annual Estimates process.</P>

      <P>It has been the policy of my Department for some 15 years that persons with an intellectual disability should not be admitted to psychiatric hospitals unless they have an underlying psychiatric disorder which cannot be appropriately treated elsewhere. In the case of St. Ita's Hospital, persons with an intellectual disability are admitted to St. Joseph's intellectual disability service, which, while it is based on the St. Ita's campus, is a specific and dedicated intellectual disability service.</P>
      <P>The programme to transfer persons with an intellectual disability or autism from psychiatric hospitals to more appropriate care settings is an integral part of the overall development programme for services to persons with an intellectual disability or autism.</P>
      <P>Between 1999 and 2001 additional revenue funding of &euro;9.206 million and &euro;27.4 million capital allocated to the programme to provide more appropriate care settings for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism accommodated in psychiatric hospitals; those accommodated in de-designated units, which were formerly designated as psychiatric services; and others who moved some years ago from psychiatric hospitals to alternative accommodation which is now unsuitable for their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of persons with an intellectual disability accommodated in May 2002 in psychiatric hospitals was 485, down from 970 in 1996. This <Col N="1816" /> programme is ongoing with further additional revenue funding of &euro;1.27 million allocated to it in 2002. There is specific mention of this programme in the health strategy with a stated objective to complete the transfer of persons with an intellectual disability from psychiatric hospitals as soon as possible and not later than 2006. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was informed of this objective and its recommendation in relation to this area is one which the Government had already undertaken to implement.</P>

      <P>Additional funding has been made available annually in recent years to the health boards in respect of the provision of health related support services for children with an intellectual disability and those with autism. In addition to this ringfenced funding, children with disabilities would also have benefited from the additional therapy posts which have been put in place in services for persons with physical or sensory disabilities.</P>
      <P>However, many health boards and specialist service providers have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting allied health professionals and specifically speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. This is due primarily to the general shortage of available staff in these grades nationally. Health boards and agencies have been and are continuing to undertake intensive recruitment drives at home and abroad. The Northern Area Health Board has just undertaken a concerted overseas recruitment drive for speech and language therapists on behalf of all health boards.</P>
      <P>Procedures are being streamlined to minimise the length of time taken to validate foreign qualifications consistent with the overreaching need to ensure that all therapists working in the health sector are appropriately trained and qualified. My Department has asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision or an enhancement in line with agreed service developments using the resources allocated to the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to my concern regarding the high level of vacancies my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The study was published in July 2001. The report recommends an annual increase of 75 course places for speech and language therapy in <Col N="1817" /> order to achieve a fourfold increase in the number of speech and language therapists over the next decade.</P>
    <P>To enhance this core recommendation, an interagency working group was established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, HEA. The HEA, following a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions, has allocated an additional 75 training places for speech and language therapy to respond to the training needs identified in the study. The report of the expert group on various health professionals recommended the establishment of a therapy assistant grade, where appropriate, to provide practical support to speech and language therapists in their work and also to address the issue of skills mix. These recommendations will be progressed in 2002 in the context of the continuing implementation of the expert group report.</P>

      <P>The Government, in April of last year, published a consultation paper on institutional arrangements for land use and transport planning in the greater Dublin area. The consultation paper proposed that a new greater Dublin land use and transport planning body be established, which would have responsibility for strategic regional land use and transport planning and have statutory powers to supervise and ensure implementation of strategies and programmes by all implementing agencies. The consultation paper provided that the body would also act as a public transport regulator for the greater Dublin area, and be responsible for the allocation of funding to implementing agencies, including local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1818" />The consultation paper indicated that local authorities, including Meath County Council, would continue to be responsible for the preparation and adoption of local development plans and the making of decisions on individual planning applications and the implementation of transport infrastructure projects within their remit. The paper also proposed that the new body would have powers similar to those available to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, to ensure compliance with the regional land use and transport plan.</P>
    <P>During the consultation period a total of 57 submissions were received by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Work is now advanced on the preparation of the legislation on the basis outlined above taking account of the views expressed during the consultation process. The intention is that the general scheme of a Bill will be approved by Government at an early date with a view to its drafting and publication as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The East Wall Road bridge replacement project commenced in February of this year. I understand from Iarnród Éireann that the first phase of the railway enabling work has been completed and the old west bridge deck removed. The new west deck has been fabricated and is available for lifting into position. Iarnród Éireann expect to do this by mid-August. The second phase of the works will then commence. This will involve further railway works to allow for the removal and replacement of the existing east bridge deck. The final phase of the project will involve the removal of the retaining wall along Stoney Road and Iarnród Éireann expects to complete this early in 2003.</P>

Consistent with this strategy, the Luas line from Connolly Station to Tallaght is under construction at present and will be completed by the end of 2003.</P>
      <P>The Government has also approved, in principle, the development of a Metro for Dublin. The Metro system will be developed in phases and the procurement for phase 1, involving a line from Dublin Airport and Blanchardstown through the city centre to Shanganagh, has begun. Phase 2 includes the extension of the Blanchardstown line to Tallaght with a spur to City West. The Railway Procurement Agency has been established to deliver the Metro on a public private partnership basis.</P>

      <P>The national development plan provides for investment of &euro;5.59 billion, 1999 prices, in the national roads programme over the period 2000-2006.</P>
      <P>In relation to the funding of the programme, the position is that the Exchequer provision of &euro;2,488 million for the national roads programme over the period 2000-02 has exceeded NDP forecasts by 10%. The Exchequer provision for 2002 at &euro;958 million is more than three times the 1997 level and nearly twice the 1999 level. This level of investment has enabled the NRA and local authorities to make good progress to date in the implementation of the national roads programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of the programme, however, has risen <Col N="1822" /> at a faster rate than anticipated at the time the NDP was prepared. This is attributable to a variety of factors including construction cost inflation. However, there are indications that construction cost inflation is now easing and this will assist in securing a better level of output for the high levels of investment being made in the programme.</P>
    <P>The Government remains committed to the implementation of the NDP national roads programme and the pace and volume of the 2002 programme reflect this. Subject to overall economic and budgetary conditions it is envisaged that the high levels of investment of recent years in the national roads programme will be maintained. My Department, together with the Department of Finance and the NRA, will be considering the future funding of the roads programme taking these factors into account.</P>

    <P>For a variety of reasons, it is not unusual to have differences between actual expenditure and the monthly profiles prepared at the start of the year. A 3.29% variance is not in itself particularly significant at this stage of the year.</P>
    <P>At this point in time I am not forecasting that there will be any year end overrun on any of the justice group of Votes with the exception of the prisons Vote where an overrun of &euro;20 million is forecast. This overrun has already been noted and approved by the Government.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>the statistics for headline and non-headline assault in Dublin over the past four years; if he has ensured that data has been collected under the new and the old system of classification for some number of overlapping years in order that strategic understanding of the changes occurring can be assured; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15173/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the most recently published Garda annual report, relating to the year 2000, assault offences were recorded under the indictable and non-indictable offence categories. In the annual report for 2000, these offences were recorded under comparable headline and non-headline categories, respectively.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that statistics in relation to the number of headline and non-headline assaults in Dublin for the years 1998 to 2000 cannot be obtained in the available timeframe, but I will undertake to forward them separately to the Deputy as soon as possible. I have been further informed that statistics for the year 2001 are not yet finalised.</P>
      <P>In the annual report for 2000, the Garda Síochána changed the system of crime presentation as part of the PULSE information technology project. Specifically, the changeover to the PULSE platform allowed a re-organisation of the crime classification system, so that it more accurately reflects the complex, modern criminal activities reported or known to the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>On the question of crime statistics generally, it is fair to state that there has been a certain amount of unease in the minds of some about matters, such as the counting rules that apply in the compilation of crime figures; similar questions have, I understand, been raised from time to time in other jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the National Crime Council has published a report entitled Crime in Ireland, which was prepared by the Institute of Criminology in University College, Dublin, and which contains a recommendation that an independent expert group be established with the following remit.</P>
      <P>To: (a)</P>
      <P>(i)&nbsp;examine the collation of information relating to crimes reported to and recorded by the Garda Síochána, mindful of the capabilities of the PULSE system;</P>
      <P>(ii) examine the principal offence rule used by the Garda Síochána, which is incident focused rather than victim focused, and other counting rules used by the Garda Síochána;</P>
      <P>(iii) examine the distinctions currently made between offences classified as indictable and non-indictable, as contained in the Garda Commissioner's report, having regard to the seriousness of the crime committed, with a view to possible changes in the classification of offences; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iv) examine the collation of information relating to other crimes where the Garda Síochána is not the prosecuting authority, for <Col N="1827" /> example, white collar crimes prosecuted by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>(b) identify the needs of the key stakeholders within the criminal justice system and the wider research community to get appropriate information on crime statistics.</P>
    <P>(c) make recommendations on the necessary structures and resources to be provided which will allow statistics compiled within the criminal justice system to be analysed, so that emerging trends can be identified and appropriate policy formulated by Government.</P>
    <P>This recommendation seems to me to have considerable merit, and I propose to act on it very soon.</P>

      <P>It is policy to provide prisoners with access to health care services on the same basis as would be available to persons covered by <Col N="1828" /> the general medical services scheme. Access to acupuncture services is not provided under the public health scheme and accordingly is not available to prisoners. The prisoner mentioned has been provided with full access to health services both within the prison and externally through referral by the prison doctor.</P>

      <P>The following table sets out details of the individuals appointed to prison visiting committees and their dates of appointments. It is not the practice to furnish members' personal details and the table therefore outlines the county in which each member resides, rather than their individual addresses.</P>
      <P>Members of prison visiting committees are appointed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for a term not exceeding three years. At that point they are automatically removed from the committee and are either re-appointed for a further term or are replaced by new members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 27, 31, 133 and 154 of 21 February 2002.</P>
      <P>During the period 1994 to 2001 approximately 5% of all applicants were granted refugee status at first stage. When the results of appeals lodged during the period are taken into account, this figure rises to approximately 8%.</P>
      <P>It is evident that the increase in processing capacity which has been put in place in both the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal as part of the Government's asylum strategy is making a real impact on the backlog of cases and is helping to reduce progressively the processing times.</P>
      <P>I am informed that at 31 May 2002, 2,542 cases in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and Refugee Appeals Tribunal, RAT, were over six months old, with the majority of these being in the final stages of processing. This compares to 4,902 cases over six months old on 31 October 2001. I am also informed that interviews are at present being scheduled by the ORAC for applicants who arrived in January-February 2002 and the situation will be reached in the near future where the main focus of that office will be on applications made this year.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the ORAC that as at 31 May 2002, there are some 5,736 asylum applications awaiting final decision in that office. Of this figure, 4,216, 74%, applied in 2002. Of the remaining 1,520, the vast majority of these have had an interview or are scheduled for interview.</P>
      <P>The Refugee Appeals Tribunal has informed me that the estimated number of appeals on hands is 2,541. This figure refers to all appeals received up to 31 May 2002. Over 70% of these are at an advanced stage of review and processing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1836" />Since July 2001, cases scheduled, processed and completed significantly exceeded intake and the increase in processing capacity as well as the tackling of apparently abandoned cases has had a real impact on the backlog of cases on hands.</P>
    <P>In the ORAC, 12, 085 interviews were scheduled in 2001, which is over twice the number scheduled in 2000. In the period 1 January 2002 to 31 May 2002, 5,676 interviews were scheduled, an average of 1,135 per month. By the end of 2001, almost all applicants who lodged a claim before 2001 had been offered a substantive interview. The total number of cases processed by the ORAC in 2001 and 2002, to 31 May, was 12,144 and 7,058 respectively. The total number of appeals completed by the RAT in 2001 and 2002, to 31 May, was 3,472 and 2,296 respectively.</P>
    <P>The Refugee Appeals Tribunal scheduled 170% more hearings in 2001 as compared to 2000.</P>

      <Quest>the number of asylum seekers who have been repatriated to their native countries; if there are difficulties in carrying out the repatriations; and the way in which this compares with the number whose application for asylum has been refused.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15229/02]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should state at the outset that asylum seekers have the right of temporary residence in the State under section 9 of the Refugee Act while their asylum applications are being considered and are not deported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may make a deportation order under section 3(2) of the Immigration Act, 1999, in respect of nine categories of persons, one of which is persons refused refugee status in the State. The vast majority of the removals involved former asylum seekers whose applications were refused. A total of 823 persons have been deported from the State from the commencement of the Immigration Act, 1999 in November 1999 to 21 June, 2002, including 72 persons returned to other EU countries under the Dublin Convention. A further 49 persons left the State before their deportation orders could be effected and are deemed to be deported. In addition, 810 persons are known to have left the State voluntarily since the beginning of 2000 <Col N="1837" /> in so far as they have notified my Department of their departure.</P>
    <P>The main difficulties in carrying out deportations include evasion of deportation order. There are currently over 2,600 persons evading orders who are being sought by the Garda National Immigration Bureau. However, it may be that many of these have left the State without informing my Department or the Gardaí. Many states insist on documenting their nationals before readmitting them. This can delay the removal process, especially where the country of return does not have a consular mission in Ireland and the persons concerned have destroyed their identity papers. Disruptions by deportees on return flights has necessitated the chartering of two aircraft earlier this year to remove persons to Algeria in January and Nigeria last March. The potential for such disruptions requires significant Garda presence on flights to escort deportees to their country of origin, thereby making the process labour intensive and costly.</P>
    <P>Re-admission agreements concluded recently with Romania, Poland, Bulgaria and Nigeria are helping to facilitate the easier return of their nationals.</P>
    <P>In the period November 1999 to 21 June 2002 a total of 4,420 deportation orders have been made. Of this total 823 orders have been enforced, representing approximately 18% of the total number of orders made. The number of applicants for asylum whose applications have been refused and have been informed of the intention to consider their deportations is 11,312. Deportation orders have been made in respect of 3,778 of these representing 34% of the total asylum refusals and 85% of the total number of deportation orders made under the Immigration Act, 1999 to date.</P>
    <P>Consideration under section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, has yet to be made in respect of more than 7,000 persons whose applications for asylum have been refused as to whether they are to be deported or allowed to remain in the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 255 and 256 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000 to 2006, makes grant assistance available under a range of measures to develop child care services through<Col N="1838" /> out Ireland. Funding for the programme is part of the national development plan and is funded by both the European Union and the Exchequer. To date we have committed more than &euro;137 million in grants to support the provision and development of child care. Of this amount more than &euro;118 million has been committed to approximately 1,200 projects on the ground and this funding will support almost 19,000 existing childcare places and lead to the creation of 16,000 new child care places. A further &euro;18 million has been committed to support quality improvement projects under the programme.</P>
    <P>Grants for child care services are available as part of my Departments equal opportunities childcare programme under capital, staffing and quality Improvement sub-measures. The grants available under the squal opportunities childcare programme were developed in line with the recommendations of the Expert Working Group on Childcare established under Partnership 2000. There is no set limit for capital grants to community based-not for profit groups. However, each project is evaluated under the criteria of the programme with particular reference to the focus the project has on disadvantage and as such there is no guarantee of 100% funding for a given project.</P>
    <P>Under the programme, capital grants, for the first time, have been made available for self-employed &ndash;  private child care providers for building, renovation or upgrading of child care facilities and for the purchase of permanently based child care equipment. These grants are subject to a maximum amount of &euro;50,790. To date, I have committed funding of &euro;12.86 million to approximately 400 self employed-private sector childcare providers at an average grant of &euro;32,000 per applicant.</P>
    <P>Under the programme, staffing grants are available for community-based not-for-profit organisations and are targeted towards services which operate in areas of disadvantage or services which have particular focus on disadvantage and as such could not operate without State assistance.  In the case of private sector child care provision, these services are operated for profit and are expected to generate income to sustain the enterprise. Funding by State authorities within the EU is restricted in terms of the level of aid that can be provided to private enterprise. This is especially relevant in the case of supports for staffing or running costs in private enterprises. Taking these considerations into account, a staffing grant scheme for private sector child care provision has not been made available under the programme.</P>
    <P>An Agreed Programme for Government includes commitments to: increase the capital grants for community and private child care facilities; seek to streamline the capital grant application process for child care capital grants and increase the grant limits for all providers, subject to overall compliance with EU state aids rules. I have asked the child care directorate of my Department to examine the commitments in An Agreed Programme for Government and to make recommendations to me in relation to these com<Col N="1839" /> mitments. Following this examination I will be in a position to decide what, if any, changes can be made to the programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided on 17 April, 2002, on foot of a proposal submitted by my predecessor, to introduce a measure to address, in the short-term, a shortage in the capacity of special schools for young offenders under 16 years of age which are run by the Department of Education and Science. The Government decision approved the making available by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of up to 20 places in St. Patrick's Institution, or other accommodation under the control of the Prison Service, for the reception of offenders under 16 years of age, subject to the certification by the Minister for Education and Science that the selected accommodation is a fit place for the reception of such offenders.</P>
      <P>St. Patrick's Institution has been selected as the most suitable location for this temporary facility, given its proximity to the courts, its accessibility for the families of the children who will be accommodated there, and the considerable body of expertise in dealing with young offenders which has been developed by the staff of all disciplines and grades over many years. Extensive consultations and discussions are ongoing between officials of my Department, the Irish Prison Service and the Department of Education and Science on the policy and practical arrangements for the proper care and custody of children under 16 years of age. The Northern Area Health Board, the Special Residential Services Board and the Social Services Inspectorate have also been of considerable practical assistance in providing advice on the residential requirements of the children of this age group.</P>
      <P>The new facility will operate in accordance with the appropriate national and international standards for residential and custodial care and will comply with the relevant provisions of the Children Act, 2001. It is intended that the facility will have self-contained living, education, counselling and recreation accommodation for up to 20 children under 16 years of age. Because the facility will be self-contained and will effectively operate independently from St. Patrick's Institution, it is necessary to construct a separate building alongside the residential wing of the institution to contain a dedicated education unit, a sports hall, counselling rooms, as well as other ancillary services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that it is envisaged that the <Col N="1840" /> necessary site and fit-out works will be completed by the end of November at which stage the phased admission of the first boys will commence. In the intervening period, the recruitment of specialist staff will take place and the dedicated prison officers will receive specialised training in child care. This measure is intended to be time limited to a period not exceeding two years pending the coming into use of sufficient appropriate dedicated facilities.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the answer to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 572 and 573 of 17 April, 2002 which dealt comprehensively with the issue of clearance arrangements in respect of child related employments. I emphasise that Part 4 of the Sex Offenders Act, 2001, obliges convicted sex offenders, which includes persons convicted abroad as well as in this jurisdiction, and before as well as after the commencement of the Act, when seeking or accepting employment or a voluntary position involving unsupervised access to children, to inform their prospective employer of the fact of the conviction. Failure to do so is an offence attracting a maximum penalty, when convicted on indictment, of a fine not exceeding &euro;12,697 and-or imprisonment for up to five years. This new offence, which came into operation on 27 September, 2001, along with the rest of the Act, is designed to act as a deterrent to unsuitable persons from seeking to gain access to children through the workplace, where relationships based on trust or fear can develop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided in March 1993, that Ministers should endeavour to have a minimum of 40% of both men and women among the chairs of boards of State bodies and among other persons nominated by Ministers to state bodies under their aegis. The Government further decided that all Ministers should advise bodies nominating persons to boards under their aegis of the Government's gender balance policy and ask them formally to follow a similar practice. The Government decision was issued to all Departments as guidelines which were further extended in March, 1995 to include advisory committees, visiting committees, committees of a temporary nature etc.</P>
      <P>Each Minister is responsible for implementing the Government's gender balance policy in his or her own area. My Department monitors the progress in appointing women to State boards on a quarterly basis and constantly keeps the situation under review.</P>
      <P>Substantial progress has been made since 1992 on gender balance on boards. Women's representation in all appointments, including external nominations from nominating bodies, increased from 15% in 1992 to 29% at 31 March, 2002 and from 17% to 35% of Ministerial nominations in the same period.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons for the imbalance between men and women on State boards is that women have not yet reached top management levels in significant numbers in many areas. Recent research on gender equality in the Civil Service demonstrates this. The NDP gender equality unit in my Department is providing funding of &euro;54,922 to the National Women's Council of Ireland to conduct research on the representation of women in decision-making bodies in Ireland. As part of this funding, a debate on women in politics, which was attended by representatives from all political parties, was held on 8 March 2002, International Women's Day. Further outcomes of this work will include a research report, and a photographic exhibition of women in decision-making bodies.</P>
      <P>The NDP gender equality unit also promotes gender balance on monitoring committees which oversee spending under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The unit actively monitors the representation of women on these committees, and has also provided guidance to monitoring committees interested in increasing their female representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While significant progress has been made towards the target of a minimum of 40% of both men and women on State boards, I am anxious to close the remaining 5% deficit in ministerial nominations and 11% deficit in overall nominations. The Government is committed to the principle of a minimum target of 40% representation of both women and men on state boards and has declared its commitment to achieving this target in the programme for Government. I will examine this issue with a view to formulating pro<Col N="1842" /> posals to put before Government as soon as is practicable.</P>

      <P>Better Local Government &ndash; a Programme for Change recognised the need to strengthen political and management structures in local authorities to ensure they were better positioned to meet future demands for delivery of quality services. The new management structures involved <i>inter alia </i>the creation of a new grade of director of services at assistant manager level, the creation of a new grade of senior executive officer at county secretary level and making senior engineer level technical posts available across local authorities generally. It was a matter for each local authority to decide on the appropriate numbers of posts in each grade for that authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has not incurred extra costs as a result of this process. Expenditure arising as a result of additional staffing costs, however aris<Col N="1846" /> ing, is a matter for local authorities in the context of the determination of their annual estimates. The funding of such expenditure is from a variety of sources, including the local government fund and other State grants, rates, fees and charges.</P>
    <P>While the cost of implementing the new structures in individual local authorities is not available, it was estimated in April, 2001, that the overall additional annual salary costs arising from the creation of the new management and staffing structures envisaged under the BLG programme was &euro;19,05 million exclusive of costs arising under the county-city development boards and separate reviews of finance and IT functions.</P>
    <P>There is no value for money audit in place and ongoing in relation to BLG. However, each manager is expected to continuously monitor his or her staffing numbers and deployment to ensure that they are appropriate to the current needs and demands of the local authority.</P>

      <P>The regulations underlying the disabled persons grant scheme are as far as practicable, designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility to local authorities in administering the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1847" />Within broad overall guidelines set by my Department, it is a matter for each local authority to set the general criteria which they apply to the administration of the scheme, to assess the circumstances of each individual applicant, to decide what works are necessary for the accommodation of the disabled person or persons, to determine the level of grants in individual cases and the circumstances in which a grant may be paid and to ensure that there are no undue delays in the processing of applications for the disabled persons grant.</P>
    <P>My Department's funding of the disabled persons grant scheme relates to the recoupment of up to two thirds of local authority expenditure on the payment of individual grants. The grant scheme is also funded at local authority level from the authorities own resources and within the amounts included for that purpose in the local authorities own estimates of expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for each local authority to decide the level of funding to be provided for the scheme in their area from within overall allocations from my Department for house purchase and improvement loans, disabled persons and essential repairs grants. While it is open to a local authority to seek a higher allocation in the event of increased demand under the scheme, an increased capital allocation would not, of itself, allow increased expenditure by a local authority without a corresponding upward revision of the authority's own estimates of expenditure.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the amount of recoupment payable by my Department to local authorities has increased significantly under this scheme. Prior to 2 December 1998, local authorities were recouped 50% of each disabled persons grant paid up to a maximum of &euro;5,079 in each case. Since that date two-thirds of the amount of grant paid is recouped, up to a current maximum recoupment of &euro;13,547 in each case. My Department will continue to keep the terms and conditions of the scheme under review.</P>

      <P>Two orders were signed by the Minister on 26 May 1989 &ndash; an Order approving the motorway scheme with modifications and an order declaring the proposed public road, as indicated on the map attached to the order, to be a motorway. Public notice of the Minister's decision was given by Kildare County Council on 28 June 1989. The Minister's approval of the motorway scheme gave the council the legal right to compulsorily acquire the land required for the scheme. The motorway was subsequently constructed under the supervision of Kildare County Council and opened to traffic in October 1994.   </P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is a new Department that will carry out functions previously held by five different Departments. The Deputy will also be aware that section 4 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, requires that the Secretary General of each Department submit a statement of strategy to the Minister of the Department within six months of their appointment. The process of preparing a draft statement of strategy for the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs covering the years 2002-05 has already commenced. This will take due account of the new programme for Government. I look forward to receiving this document for my consideration and approval.</P>

      <P>My Department has been to the forefront in implementing a wide range of family friendly/work life balance arrangements which enable staff to combine work with their personal commitments and choices. For instance, this summer, some 310 of the Department's staff are availing of term time leave, which is designed to allow parents to match their working arrangements to their children's summer holidays. This scheme was piloted by my Department in 1998 and is now available to all grades.</P>
      <P>More recently, the Civil Service worksharing scheme provides for a wider range of work attendance patterns than had been available previously under the jobsharing scheme. Some 650 employees are currently availing of worksharing on half attendance basis and a further 130 are availing of a four-day week attendance. In so far as shorter working days are concerned, flexitime is available to a significant proportion of employees. This gives flexibility to staff to vary their starting and finishing times and to build up extra hours which may be taken later as leave. In addition, staff have the option of working on a mornings or afternoons only basis under the worksharing scheme. Commencing in September next, my Department intends to make available further worksharing options, such as three days per week, three weeks at work out of four and a daily attendance regime of 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rents chargeable to certain tenants in the private rented sector were subject to control under the Rent Restrictions Acts until parts of those Acts were held to be unconstitutional in the early 1980s. In response, the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, was passed to give certain protections to tenants of dwellings that had been subject to the Rent Restrictions Acts on the day the Housing Act, 1982, was enacted, 26 July 1982.</P>
      <P>A tenant who was the tenant of a rent controlled dwelling in July 1982 will retain the full protection of the Housing Act, 1982, for their lifetime. A tenant who is the spouse of a person who was the tenant of a rent controlled dwelling in July 1982 will retain the full protection of the Housing Act, 1982 for their spouse's lifetime. The position for tenants in these situations will not change in July 2002 and no new regulations are needed to extend protection to these tenants beyond 26 July 2002. The rent tribunal will continue to be responsible for setting the rent and other terms of the tenancy and entitlement to the special rent allowance will continue as before. People who assumed the tenancy of a formerly rent-controlled dwelling after 26 July 1982 are in a different position. In the case of a person who assumed the tenancy between 26 July 1982 and 26 July 1997, the protection of the Housing Act, 1982 expires on 26 July 2002. In the case of a person who assumed the tenancy after 26 July 1997, the protection of the Housing Act, 1982 expires on the fifth anniversary of their assuming the tenancy. The protections of the 1982 Act will no longer apply to them from 26 July 2002 or from the fifth anniversary of their assuming the tenancy, whichever is later. However, these tenants will be entitled to claim renewable leases of up to 35 years duration under the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980. Their rent will be set by the Circuit Court and will apply for at least five years. Provision was made in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2002 to enable my Department's rent allowance to be paid in these cases after 26 July 2002. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government will make an order commencing the relevant parts of the Housing Act, 2002 shortly and I will make regulations under that Act to extend payment of rent allowance to the people in question. In addition, the Government has also decided to improve the rent allowance scheme to provide a greater level of support to successor tenants who may face increases in their rents from 26 July 2002. These improvements will also be implemented in regulations from 26 July 2002.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 291 and 299 together.</P>
      <P>The free schemes, including the electricity/gas allowance, telephone allowance and free television licence schemes, are generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who fulfil a means test. The schemes are also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. People aged over 70 years of age can qualify regardless of their income or household composition.</P>
      <P>In order to be eligible for the schemes a person who is under 70 years of age must, as well as receiving a qualifying payment be living alone or with an excepted person. In this connection, the person concerned, whose husband has applied for the free schemes is in receipt of unemployment benefit and she is, therefore, not regarded as an excepted person for the purposes of the schemes. Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement. The cost of extending the free schemes to all widow/ers, regardless of age, income and household composition, could be in the region of &euro;30 million annually. The current arrangements for the free schemes will be kept under review in the context of the future budgets and available resources.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for the maximum rate of the old age contributory pension a person must, among other qualifying conditions, achieve a yearly average of at least 48 contributions paid or credited on their social insurance record. Reduced pensions are paid to those with yearly averages as low as ten contributions and arrangements are also in place for the payment of pro-rata pensions to those with mixed rate insurance records or contributions from different countries. Reduced rate or pro-rata pensions are paid at a <Col N="1857" /> fixed percentage of the full rate payment and in order to ensure that the differential between the various rates is maintained, budget increases are also applied on a pro-rata basis. For instance, a person receiving a payment of 50% of the maximum rate receives 50% of any budget increase applied to the full rate pension. Applying the full budgetary increase to those with reduced payments would erode the differentials which exist and which are intended to reflect the level of contribution which a person has made to the social insurance fund. It would also mean that those on reduced rate pensions would, on an ongoing basis, benefit disproportionately from budget increases.</P>

      <P>Establishing a new targeted scheme of school meals for disadvantaged pupils is a very significant task that will require consultation between the relevant Government Departments, schools and other interested bodies. These consultations will commence during the summer and will include consideration of the appropriate criteria for selecting areas or schools for inclusion in the new scheme. In that regard, the commitment in the review of the national anti-poverty strategy, &ldquo;Building an Inclusive Society&rdquo;, to reduce the number of young people who leave the school system early will be particularly relevant. Proposals emerging from a review of the existing school meals scheme which has been undertaken by my Department, will provide the basis for preparing the proposals for a new school meals system and for the necessary consultations. The interdepartmental working group that is undertaking the review considers that school meals have continued relevance and propose an enhanced programme of food provision in the school setting. These proposals will be finalised shortly and will provide the basis for reaching agreement with other interested parties on the arrangements for the new system of school meal provision. </P>

      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, the Secretary-General is required to submit a strategy statement to me within six months of the date of my appointment. This will outline my Department's key objectives and performance indicators relating to the achievement of those objectives. I am at present discussing the matter with the Secretary-General and other senior officials with view to producing a statement which reflects the responsibilities of my Department. It is intended to build on the significant progress which has already been achieved to date and to provide an opportunity to re-examine the Department's existing mission statement, objectives, outputs and related strategies. These discussions are being informed by the programme for Government, the Department's current statement of strategy &ndash; People, Policies, Services &ndash; which was published in November 2002, our customer action plan and our internal customer service plan.</P>

      <P>Unemployment benefit is payable to unemployed people who are capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work, provided they have sufficient PRSI contributions. Parental leave, which lasts for 14 weeks, is available to each parent of a child aged under five years, to enable them to take care of their child. In the circumstances, as a person taking such leave is not unemployed, unemployment benefit cannot be paid during the period of parental leave. Any proposals to extend unemployment benefit along the lines suggested by the Deputy would have major implications for the scheme, and there are no proposals for such an extension at present.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 to 19, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Prior to the start of the general election campaign the Government decided that ministerial private office appointees who worked in the election campaign should take annual leave. This decision was conveyed in a letter issued by the Department of Finance to all Departments stating that where such appointees worked in campaign offices during the general election, the following arrangements should apply: staff who moved to work in campaign offices during the election period should take annual leave to cover the period of unpaid voluntary work in question; staff not involved in campaign offices who remained in their Departments and continued to perform their official duties, should continue to do so on the same basis; where staff were on annual leave to work in the election campaign, arrangements could be made to interrupt annual leave &ndash; and election campaigning &ndash; if this became necessary for the purpose of attending to official duties.</P>
      <P>In complying with these arrangements the following contract staff in my Department availed of paid annual leave during the general election campaign to avoid the conflicting demands of official business.</P>

      <P>During 2001, the team continued to focus on the key priorities originally identified for its work: the core national roads network and public transport in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Excellent progress was made in these areas during the year, notwithstanding the continued effects of capacity constraints. The team continued to work with the implementation agencies and lead Departments to monitor progress and maintain momentum on the NDP objectives.</P>
      <P>The team also focused on emerging priorities, including energy infrastructure, waste management and broadband telecommunications. These will continue to receive sustained attention during 2002. The working group's report on broadband telecommunications was accepted by Government in March 2002 as the basis for a Government action plan with three and five year targets.</P>
      <P>The working group will meet this afternoon to progress the action plan. It will work with the new Department of Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources throughout this year to ensure co-ordinated and timely implementation of the plan.</P>

      <P>The Nally Report contained two recommendations specifically relating to the reorganisation of the Chief State Solicitor's office. One recommended that, subject to agreement on adequate staffing levels and appropriate staff structures, the criminal division of the CSSO should be transferred to the DPP's office to form a unit headed by a solicitor to the DPP, with statutory clarification that its professional staff would be professional staff of the DPP within the meaning of the 1974 Act. The second recommended that responsibility for the state solicitors should be transferred from the Attorney General to the DPP, with legislative provision to enable the DPP to delegate to them.</P>
      <P>Following intensive negotiations with staff interests, agreement was reached on the transfer of responsibility for criminal prosecution work to the office of the Director of Public Prosecution. The formal transfer took place on 3 December 2001. In January of this year the staff involved moved into new premises in Abbey Street.</P>
      <P>The transfer of responsibility for the state solicitor service, which will require legislation, has been under consideration and a discussion process with the State Solicitors' Association is being established.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to make a statement to the House on the recently agreed programme for Government between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>In the general election for the 29th Dáil, the electorate strengthened the mandate of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. The policy platforms of the two parties have been endorsed as a blueprint for our future.</P>
      <P>Our programme for Government is both clear in intent and specific in detail. It is the agreed agenda for this partnership Government over five full years. The Irish people can justly be proud of the achievements of the peace, prosperity and progress of recent times.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in government have worked extremely well and productively together in providing good government for the country. But now for the future much more remains to be done. A five year programme for Government is by necessity an ordered series of priorities and An Agreed Programme for Government 2002-2007 sets out further objectives to build on the success we have achieved as well as the important issues remaining.</P>
      <P>In implementing the commitments in An Agreed Programme for Government, we will bring forward and progress the most ambitious legislative programme in the history of our State. Given the large number of specific commitments set out in the agreed programme, it would be impossible in the time allotted to detail each of the important pledges we have made.</P>
      <P>The cornerstones of An Agreed Programme for Government are based on our desire to build a better Ireland for everyone and our promises at the last election to protect and expand prosperity for all, to strengthen peace and reconciliation, to pursue the fight against crime, to guarantee improved pensions, to reform and develop our health services and to invest in better public services.</P>
      <P>The programme sets out an agenda for all major aspects of Government activity. It is divided into five major parts and contains 477 specific pledges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part One contains sections on peace, defence and international affairs. As I said in the Dáil on the day I was re-elected Taoiseach, building a lasting and just peace on this island is this government's great political goal, the priority that I have and will continue to put above all else. The <Col N="1867" /> agreed programme also repeats the very clear commitment of both parties in their election manifestos to hold a new referendum on enlargement later this year.</P>
    <P>Part Two deals with a range of economic issues. It reflects the great task of not only extending prosperity in time but expanding it in scope to reach all our people. The overall target for public spending is set at keeping within the terms of the EU Stability and Growth Pact.</P>
    <P>In relation to tax, the key priorities are removing people on the minimum wage from the tax net and reducing the numbers who pay tax at the higher rate. Other changes will be made if economic and fiscal circumstances permit, implementing the objectives of An Action Programme for the Millennium. The phased reduction in corporation tax will be completed.</P>
    <P>A new national development finance agency and a national transformation fund will be established to push forward major infrastructure investment plans. A major emphasis is placed on supporting research and development as part of ensuring that Ireland remains a centre of innovation.</P>
    <P>Part Three deals with seven different areas under the broad heading of ensuring balanced regional development. The national spatial strategy will be published. The central priority for the new Government, will be to ensure that all parts of Ireland see real progress. A new integrated transport policy will be implemented. A range of commitments on agriculture and rural development are outlined. The programme also outlines commitments in the areas of the environment, tourism, housing and the marine.</P>
    <P>Part Four deals with 13 areas under the general heading of building a caring society. A commitment is made to reach a minimum &euro;200 per week for pensioners and &euro;150 for all social welfare payments. The health strategy will be implemented in full. A programme to recruit 2,000 more gardaí will be implemented and they will be targeted against public order offences and drugs. Class sizes will be reduced, with an emphasis on infant classes. A new schools modernisation fund, which will be funded by the new NDFA, will be established and it will ensure that all school buildings meet modern standards. Significant increases will be implemented in child benefit as part of a co-ordinated effort to tackle child poverty. Measures to target drug dealers and regenerate our most disadvantaged communities are outlined. This part of the programme also deals with equality, law reform and asylum issues.</P>
    <P>Part Five is called supporting civic life and deals with good government, sport, culture and the Irish language. The programme gives a commitment to supporting the commercial semi-state sector and to securing a viable long-term future for State companies. It also points to a number of ways to improve value for money and the quality of state services. The programme signals this <Col N="1868" /> Government's wish to negotiate a renewed partnership agreement.</P>
    <P>In relation to sport, the programme sets out a continued commitment to sport at all levels. It also sets out a commitment to construct a world-class national stadium. Other facilities which service the needs of sporting bodies at both national and local level will also be constructed. The new arts and heritage plans will be implemented. A range of policies to support the Irish language and improve supports for Gaelscoileanna are outlined.</P>
    <P>The key areas for which my Department is responsible in terms of An Agreed Programme for Government can be broadly summarised as follows: supporting the development and implementation of policy in a co-ordinated way across Departments, including servicing the activities of relevant Cabinet committees; working with the British Government and the pro-agreeement parties to achieve the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects; working towards a new social partnership agreement; co-ordinating the eGovernment initiative to bring about an expansion in the range and quality of online Government services; and ensuring that Ireland's key objectives in the European Union are carried forward in the context of the Taoiseach's role as a member of the European Council.</P>

      <P>The farm structure survey, which is conducted every two to three years, provides information on the number of farms with more than one hectare of land farmed. A breakdown of the number of full-time and part-time <Col N="1870" /> farmers is available from the 1980 survey onwards. In this context, full-time means farmers whose sole occupation is farming; those who answered that farming was either a major or subsidiary occupation are classified as part-time.</P>
