    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House in my reply of 24 April, considerable progress has been made by the high level group on regulation since its establishment in May 2001 following publication of the OECD review on regulatory reform in Ireland. As I stated when the report was published, the Government was broadly in agreement with its overall findings and one of the tasks of the high level group was to test the validity of its recommendations in specific areas. The group has met 13 times to date and will shortly report to Government on progress.</P>
      <P>The group has focused on two areas of work in particular. First, it has begun the process of framing a national policy statement on better regulation through the publication of the public consultation document, Towards Better Regulation. The consultation document, which I was pleased to launch in February of this year, was designed to highlight the key issues that are likely to feature in the national policy statement and to promote public debate and awareness in relation to better regulation. The consultation document sets out the key questions we need to address in considering why we regulate, what we need to regulate and new approaches to governance in a global economy. It is important to emphasise that this process is not about resolving micro-level regulatory issues or specific market problems, but about giving us a set of core principles to guide future regulation and policy making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultation process was widely publicised in the media through Government websites, seminars and presentations. Approximately 4,000 copies of the consultation document were distributed and 89 submissions were received from a wide variety of interested parties. A full list of submissions is available on the Internet. To inform the subsequent formulation of the national policy statement, these submissions have been studied and analysed. My Department will shortly publish two papers, the first summarising the submissions received and the second offering an independent analysis and commentary on the submissions by an independent economist. A drafting group composed of officials from key <Col N="4" /> Departments will meet shortly to commence preparation of a draft national policy statement. It is anticipated that the draft text of the policy statement will be submitted to the Government early next year with a view to publication before the end of June 2003.</P>
    <P>The second priority of the high level group has been the development of a system of regulatory impact analysis as recommended by the OECD in its report. As Deputies may know, this is a systematic, rigorous assessment of proposed regulations before they are enacted. The introduction of RIA will help to improve the policy-making process and complement other regulatory reform initiatives with positive effects on the economy, on systems of governance and on the quality of the public service. At EU level, the European Commission has announced its intention to apply impact analysis to all its major proposals for draft directives on a phased basis from 2003, with full implementation by the end of 2004.</P>
    <P>After examining a range of the RIA models used by other countries and taking account of developments at EU level, the group has proposed a model of regulatory impact analysis specifically suited to the Irish policy-making processes and structures. This model will be submitted to Government shortly with a view to piloting it in a small number of Departments in the first instance. This pilot phase will be an opportunity to refine the model and address practical issues, such as training, guidelines and supports.</P>
    <P>The high level group on regulation has made significant progress since its establishment last year. I look forward to continued progress on the issue of better regulation as part of the overall process of public service modernisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The OECD report specifically refers to opening up the gas and electricity markets in Ireland. When the report was published, the Taoiseach correctly referred to it as a highly impressive and important document. However, the pace of deregulation is painstakingly slow. Does the Taoiseach accept that such slow progress has the potential to seriously undermine the economy, particularly in view of the recent publication of the world economic forum on competitiveness which states that Ireland's overall ranking in terms of competitiveness has fallen from 11th position in 2001 to 24th position in 2002? What is the Taoiseach's analysis of that? How does he propose to expedite deregulation in view of the critical importance of this report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept Deputy Kenny's comments about regulatory control. We were privileged to be part of the OECD report because it chose only two countries a few years ago to become involved in it. We had not been involved in such work before. An enormous amount of effort was required by officials across Departments. It is better understood within the system. That report has now moved to the implementation phase. I have spelt out the action being <Col N="5" /> taken. A number of areas were mentioned in the OECD report, such as gas, telecommunications, electricity, pharmacies, pubs and professional services. Each of those is moving on under the Departments and action is being taken. Some have moved further than others and Ministers have been answering questions on those.</P>
      <P>While regulatory control is not the only issue, it is a very important one and I am convinced, having been involved in the discussions on the OECD report and having met the experts involved, that good regulatory reform and good regulatory impact analysis helps competitiveness. What we propose in legislation and decisions regarding changes we wish to make will be assessed according to regulatory impact analysis to ensure that regulation is meaningful. That is not to say that the process is against regulation, it is to ensure that if we do regulate, the effect is not simply to add a large cost to business. If the impact of regulation is to add a price tag, there has to be a good social reason behind it. I accept that we were slow to get into this area. We have never been involved in regulatory impact analysis and our legislation has traditionally been drafted on the basis of ignoring these kinds of issues. Perhaps it is not correct to say it never dawned on people, but it was certainly never part of the process in the way it is now. I am pressing this on and I am not here to defend against claims that we are being slow about it. We can move on with it and within the high level group I am pressing for the report to come to Government to be published this year and for the regulatory impact analysis to be produced early in the new year. I am also asking people in the Departments to get on and introduce this in their areas because it will have economic benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach concerned that electricity generating capacity is almost at breaking point at peak times when the inability to deliver the service is potentially catastrophic economically? Given that European Union regulations do not allow for further development of power stations by the ESB, how is it proposed to introduce competition in a market that is significantly small in European terms? Is it proposed to privatise the ESB, or are reports of that untrue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to get into individual issues in individual areas. There is no proposal to privatise the ESB, though the Deputy knows there has been discussion about it for a number of years and analysis has been done. There is no immediate decision on that. In the past three years, the ESB has only been stretched on two or three occasions and the company is working to improve its grid. It is looking at wind power and other forms of generation where it sees significant potential for the future. It needs to improve investment in its grid and that is happening though I do not claim to have all the facts about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="6" />Regarding regulation, the ESB is pressing on with work on regulatory analysis, but the primary question for the company is one of infrastructure. It requires infrastructure to improve its grid because of the enormous growth in the economy. The capacity it must have now is far beyond what was believed would be the case previously, but that is being addressed and some of the investment proposals being examined are quite exciting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá trí cheist agam don Taoiseach faoin ábhar seo.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that regulatory reform is very much market led and can he address the need for regulatory reform which does not apply only to the financial cost, but to the environmental cost as well? Will the lesson of the tanker <i>Prestige</i> be learned and will the Taoiseach address the need for regulatory reform in the area of environmental protection?</P>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach ensure there is a level playing pitch <i>vis-à-vis</i> the State funding that went into Moneypoint to connect it to the grid and the lack of State funding to connect offshore wind farms? If that is to be part of the regulatory reform will he ensure a level playing pitch between what practices were State funded then and what should be State funded now to maintain parity? Does he believe the Irish financial services regulatory authority will be truly independent when Dr. Liam O'Reilly, director general of the Central Bank, has been appointed as new chief executive and given that the Central Bank did not cover itself in glory regarding the Ansbacher scam and allowed the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to run off with &euro;610 million of its money?</P>

      <P>Brevity please, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct to say this will not be a fully independent body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While I wish to keep to the areas for which I am responsible, the Deputy's last question is not one of them. Deputy Sargent will agree that if there is an open competition and a person from an agency is successful in that competition, just because he or she is from an agency that may have had a particular view should not in any way disqualify him or her. The agency is to be fully independent. It is pulling together two organisations that will be fully independent &ndash; a new one and the Central Bank that has been independent since 1946. The problem we usually hear about in the House is that it is a pity it is so independent. I do not think we can argue about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his first question Deputy Sargent raised an important issue. The whole idea of regulation is not just about the costs and I agree totally with him. We are committed to better regulation. The idea is that it recognises the fact that State regulation is excessive in quantity or is an unnecessary <Col N="7" /> burden on economic and social activity. The approach to regulatory reform adopted by the Government is, I hope, pragmatic and it is not based on either ideological preference for deregulation <i>per se.</i> Two reasons have been set out in all of the work done in preparation for the OECD work a few years ago &ndash; the OECD report Towards Better Governing and the paper that will now be presented. One is the better contribution which regulation can make to sustained economic growth and competitiveness in a non-inflationary way. The issue for us is that regulators are facing a different set of challenges than was the case in the recovery years. The economic challenges are related to capacity, infrastructure, competitiveness and counter-inflation to economic performance and it is not just an instrument for the market. All the work has been put it and that is not the intention. It is about providing a better service and a better society and environmental and other issues will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>In terms of the economy, regulatory reform involves freeing up markets, making it easier to enter and exit, minimising regulatory burdens on business, entrepreneurship and promoting greater competition for the benefit of the consumer. The consumer is uppermost in the minds&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Hopefully not. That is not the case with the telecommunications regulator as prices have not gone up.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It simplifies the regulatory environment, the trade environment and investment. The second one is public service modernisation. This is about the need to improve the way Government collects information, administers service and intervenes in social and economic life so there is transparency, accountability and accessibility in our public services. At best, the barriers created by poor regulation are frustrating and inhibiting. At worst, they can contribute to a loss of credibility and effectiveness in Government structures. They are the two reasons for regulatory reform going forward. This document was the outcome of a consultation process which has been widely used by consumer and investor groups and broader public opinion and it will affect what we do in the future. It is a slow process but it has worked well in other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach concerned that the thrust of regulatory reform as set out by the OECD is almost entirely business-oriented and takes no heed of the social obligations of corporations? Is it not the reality that this puts trade and markets before democracy? That is one <Col N="8" /> of the key concerns people will have about this. The OECD says that while Government regulations generally aim to achieve justified objectives in the areas of health, safety, environment and so on, they may distort international trade. Is this not a very negative model for the State to follow? Does the Taoiseach share my concern that this process is being driven by privatisation and the desire of multinational corporations to make profits regardless of the social and environmental costs? Will the Taoiseach tell us his position on the proposed privatisation of our State airline, Aer Lingus? </P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no different from any of the others addressed by Deputies Kenny and Sargent in terms of the ESB and so on. We are faced with what is potentially a major national scandal where the national airline, having come through difficult years, is again in profit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that arises out of this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question generally, I do not disagree with the Deputy that the whole question of regulatory reform is driven by markets. The question I am answering relates to the work being carried out by a high level group within the Civil Service based on a report drawn up by officials across a range of Departments and OECD officials some years ago with a view to making markets more attractive and more efficient for consumers. It was very much driven by the consumer. For many years legislation was driven by whatever the purpose of the Act was, without reference to the consumer. Legislation was always built around what we were trying to do, whether in relation to gas, electricity or whatever. There was no reference to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The high level group on regulation is trying to see where regulation makes sense and, where it does not, to see whether matters could be simplified. We should not go back to the old eastern European philosophy of complicating procedures. They should be streamlined as much as possible and the consumer should be taken fully into account and should have a say. That is our aim here. If Deputy Ó Caoláin does not want to do this, it means he is happy to have cartels in pharmacy, in professional life, in relation to liquor licences and in other areas. However, we want to get best value for money out of systems that are not over-complicated. We do not want to make life complicated for consumers and busi<Col N="9" /> ness people. If there are simpler ways of doing things we should adopt them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in reply to Deputy Sargent, the whole point of regulatory impact assessments is to see everybody's point of view and avoid over-bureaucratic systems of regulation. We must also make sure the consumer and those who have to operate the system are dealt with and that we do not have restrictive practices. Many members of the public want to start up some operation. In some areas we may not have enough regulation. The regulatory impact analysis does not say we should get rid of everything. It wants to look at each case and decide what is best practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Following what Deputy Kenny said with regard to electricity supply being virtually at breaking point, is the Taoiseach aware that many data centres in Dublin are requested to shut down at peak times because of the pressure on the electricity system? Will we see the opening up of regulation in regard to telecommunications and local loop unbundling? With regard to the regulatory impact analysis is there any analysis of existing regulations, for example in regard to agriculture, company law, health and the CSO? There is a huge burden put on small businesses in regard to paper work and bureaucracy in that area. Will the Taoiseach reform the existing legislation also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the issues raised by the Deputy arise in the OECD report which sets out what is happening in those areas. Individual Ministers will follow through. Before we get to the middle we must go to the start. As I pointed out we want to complete the national policy statement which comes directly from the OECD report and to get the regulatory impact analysis. We will have one of these before Christmas and the other after it. Both have generated a great deal of debate, these questions and recent written articles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Naughten asked about updating the existing law. Legislation on statutory law revision is before this House or the Seanad. The statutory law revision unit has been working on improving the clarity, coherence and accessibility of statutory law &ndash; that is all our existing legislation and regulation. In other countries this is an important <Col N="10" /> part of the regulatory reform process and statutory law revision accompanies and supports programmes of simplification. We have not done that since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>The last Attorney General drafted a statutory law revision Bill and based on what a predecessor, Attorney General Mr. Gleeson, did on the technology aspect, it has been brought to the stage that when we pass this legislation we will be able to update present legislation and make simple changes. That will lead to better regulation and will be helpful to business. Not alone will we be able to update and consolidate legislation but we will be able to remove or simplify legislation. Rather than having to take ten Bills in the House to regulate gas, electricity etc. &ndash; in one area there are something like 33 Bills &ndash; this Bill will update, codify and remove fallen or cumbersome mechanisms from legislation. That will be helpful to practitioners in business, to accountants, to legal people and to consumer groups.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This high level group was set up in April or May 2001 with the promise that it would deliver its report within a year. Is there any reason it has not managed to do that? What is the Taoiseach's view of the multiplicity of regulatory authorities? Is the high level group looking at this issue and is there a case for a single regulatory authority? Does the Taoiseach think we need to develop expansive bureaucracies to support each regulator? This scenario seems to be emerging and I am not sure it is necessary. Is the high level group expected to report on the issue and does the Taoiseach agree that we could have a number of divisions of a regulatory authority &ndash; whether they are gas, telecommunications, electricity or airports &ndash; because the theory as to why regulation is necessary is the same, especially in monopolistic situations? When will the high level group report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the second question first. The group's two main functions are to look at the regulatory impact assessment and to develop a national policy. In devising a national policy, the question the Deputy raises is key &ndash; should we continue to have a separate regulator in each area and the necessary staff and infrastructure around each regulator? I do not want to pre-empt the report of the high level group but it has spent a great deal of time on it. For good reasons, a decision was made that, where the State was a shareholder &ndash; in part or whole &ndash; it should not also be the regulator. I can see the sense in that. The straight answer to the Deputy's question, is that we should not continue to have separate regulators in every area. Much of what a national strategy and regulatory impact analysis does in fixing rules, codes, prices or standards is what we should have always done. Down through the decades, in the normal course of work, we should have worked through the official system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="11" />However, if we were to continue in this way, in every State service and agency there would be a separate regulatory system. I do not have a problem with a separate regulatory system. However, the Deputy suggests in his question that they could all be different departments in a regulatory system and that should be possible. Having a separate system where regulators become very important people is not a good idea. However, the whole focus is on that and we must work our way through it. There are probably areas which have a large workload and where it is not possible to divide them up, but there are not many. If we have a national system &ndash; which is the direction in which we are moving from the OECD where we had no system &ndash; and work to a proper regulatory impact analysis, which means that we set something up a system incorporating the proper rules, guidelines and codes, there should be no problem in the future.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputy Rabbitte to accept that these are my views and are not necessarily shared by everyone in this debate. Otherwise, we would make the system almost a third system &ndash; we already have an Executive and Departments and now, 20 years on, we will end up with a regulatory department. I do not think that is desirable or good and it will cause problems down the road.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first question raised, the report has been prepared in three phases, the first of which was on the work of the OECD. As the group prepared the report, it gave aspects of it like pharmacy, professional and other services, to individual Departments and Ministers are now working on it. The report will be with the Cabinet before Christmas. The group has not lost time, it is being independently worked on. The report concerns the areas to which I have referred and while the group is made up of people working in other areas, they are putting a huge amount of effort into this. We can get a flexible, user-friendly and appropriate system for the Irish context and we can do it quickly. While it may need primary legislation and, ultimately, secondary legislation, I hope that, within the next year, a great deal of progress can be made on this end of the work as well as what is going on in other Departments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying the regulatory system is now up for grabs, following the report of the high level group, and that it might indeed be possible to look at a different configuration of regulation? Is he saying it would be possible to disestablish some of the regulators already in being? Will that not become more difficult the more time elapses, if it were considered desirable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that. Obviously, regulators are needed in certain areas, but there is a question as to whether they are needed in each separate area under a totally separate system. I am indicating that I do not think <Col N="12" /> that is necessary. As Deputy Rabbitte will have noted, I said this originated from pressure on the State not to be both shareholder and regulator, not to be involved in price fixing or controlling all the issues. Out of this process, I believe we will get the first examination of this situation since moves were initiated in the past ten years in relation to regulators. In the first instance, we will hear what the committee has to say. We will also get a national system that fits the Irish context. In my view, the Irish context does not necessitate a separate system in every area because, as I outlined earlier, that approach would create many difficulties into the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. Does the Taoiseach accept that private operators will not &ndash; indeed cannot &ndash; enter the market because they see electricity prices as being too low and that, therefore, privatisation will inevitably lead to a hike in prices for consumers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kenny's earlier comments answer that question &ndash; one can keep people out of the market because of low prices. We have to deal with the deficiencies of the system as the grid no longer has the capacity to cater for an economy which has doubled in the past decade or so. The reality is that a small country such as this, especially our regional areas, must have the capacity to take on new industries. For example new, modern industries such as the Wyeth plant represent an achievement which any country would be proud of and there will be many further such developments in the next five years in pharmaceuticals and other related plants. We must ensure we have the capacity to secure such industries. Although the new Abbott Laboratories plant in the west has a relatively small consumption of electricity compared to some other industries, it exceeds that of the rest of the county in which it is situated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving forward in that context, we must be in a position to generate sufficient electricity and I fully support the concept of alternative energy sources. Over the past year or two, I have read numerous reports and seen videos on wind energy, including developments in Denmark where it is hoped to produce 15% to 20% of total electricity generation from wind power by 2007. There are also developments in Germany in that regard. I do not claim expert knowledge other than what I have read on this subject. However, if it is the case that the wind energy generation capacity of the Irish Sea is three times greater than that of other seas where that system is in operation and we only produce about 1% of our electricity from that source, there would appear <Col N="13" /> to be enormous capacity for utilisation. The ESB is doing this but it also needs the private sector, which will not get involved if the return on the investment is not big enough. I do not think the State, either this year or even in a good year, would be able to do it. I am not advocating that we continue with our present electricity capacity but if we must have a large increase, as Deputy Kenny said, we should look at ways of doing it that are within the Kyoto pact and within what we have signed up to do. Wind power seems to be one of these.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the heat wastage in electricity power generating stations is about the equivalent of 21 million barrels of oil every year. Is there any plan to reduce that heat wastage? Also, in the context of provision of electricity, proper regional development, spatial strategy and fair play for provincial Ireland, a stable supply of power for electricity generation is critical for the placement of industry.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Wastage of resources in any area is bad and inefficient. The question of Moneypoint and the technical issues which the Deputy has raised are obviously ones for the ESB and our technical people want to get beyond them. The second question, about BMW regions and rural Ireland generally, raises the important issue that the necessary capital programme and resources are available, in whatever form, for the ESB to upgrade and extend its grid so that the capacity will be available, particularly in regional areas, to attract industries. There is considerable potential to do this and if there is not telecommunications and power they will not be attracted. This is what we have to do and it is what the ESB infrastructural plans propose for the future. As to how we do that, the ESB is examining investment in wind power, which will greatly help its capacity.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that in the case of the banking and the financial services sector more and better regulation, not less, including Government controls, is needed to properly address the exorbitant charges that banking and insurance companies are imposing on an ever more fleeced consumer base in this economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The new regulatory authority for the financial services sector will ensure there is better and tighter regulation because of the flow of money in the international domain and <Col N="14" /> where that money comes from. All the regulations about money laundering and criminality in some parts of the world about the supply of money will be examined. Equally important are the changes that arose, not mentioning any institution because it would be wrong to do so, due to what happened in some institutions where consumers' interests were not protected. The new agency will have the power, control and ability to implement and improve regulation, particularly to protect the consumer. It was felt the Central Bank Act, 1946 did not give it such a remit. The agency had a job to do for the industry to ensure the good name of the country was protected in the financial derivatives and other markets but it did not include the consumer.</P>
      <P>The new authority, however, has a consumer dimension and retains all the other aspects that have been mentioned. This is particularly important as a consequence of the enormous amounts of money that flow through our society, thankfully, as a result of the success of the IFSC over 15 years or so. The financial services sector has to be run to a high standard, as the huge amount of employment it provides will be undermined at international level if it is not. I assure the Deputy that the agency will ensure the sector will meet best practice, as a result of the legislation we have enacted.</P>

      <P>The Green Party is thrilled that the Taoiseach is looking at videos and reading books about wind power. It is the most encouraging news I have heard since I came into this House. Does the Taoiseach agree that the regulator should give preferential treatment, in terms of how the transmission grid network is developed, to encourage the development of offshore services, particularly wind generation? The State backed the transmission connection when Moneypoint was being developed. Should the State take a positive and proactive role in supporting the transmission connections to offshore wind farms and other wind farms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to take the job of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, but it is obvious the State has to take a position on this matter. I am sure the Deputy will agree with me that the ESB is unlikely to be able to provide the money and other resources necessary to complete this project and that private sector involvement will be needed. It seems to me, if all I read and hear is true, that this country has the potential not alone to generate a far higher proportion of the ESB's necessary capacity within the State, but also that we have the ability to export the energy we generate. I have read what the ESB and others have had to say about this matter and it is clear an opportunity exists. I am sure the Deputy is more familiar than I am with the report that makes a good case for increased use of wind power. In regard to regulation, all the reports states that if we are to have a good return, the present level of <Col N="15" /> costs does not make it attractive enough. It seems this is one of the areas where we have to increase the costs for people to get in, so it can be made to work. As currently structured, we will not get the necessary level of investment. The experts in this field have to deal with that issue. I hope the Department takes a proactive view of the matter, as officials are also examining the reports I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined in detail, as part of a statement to the Public Transport Partnership Forum on 7 November, my proposals for reform of the public transport market both within the greater Dublin area and in the rest of the country. My proposals on the bus market in the greater Dublin area are the result of extensive policy research, analysis and consideration by myself, my Department and the Public Transport Partnership Forum. In this reply, I intend to outline the proposals for regulation of bus services in the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Transport, I will continue to set overall regulatory policy and approve the broad public transport investment strategy for the greater Dublin area. Within that framework, I will establish an independent body to procure public transport services and to allocate current and capital funding for specific purposes from an overall allocation provided by the Exchequer. I do not intend to deregulate the bus market in the greater Dublin area, but rather to introduce controlled competition in the form of franchising of routes or groups of routes. This will begin with new services and will be extended on a phased basis to the existing service network in the greater Dublin area. It is intended that the first phase of franchising will commence at the beginning of 2004, with up to 25% of the market being franchised out in that year, and there should be annual progress thereafter.</P>
      <P>Long distance commuter services in the greater Dublin area will also be procured and regulated by the independent regulatory body. The body will be given responsibility for regulating public transport fares and setting and enforcing quality standards for public transport services. My proposals took particular account of the views expressed by the Public Transport Partnership Forum. In my statement to the forum, I made it clear that I was anxious to deal with these issues on a partnership basis, while also making speedy progress on reform. I look forward to discussions with the social partners on these issues.</P>

      <Col N="16" />I have recently received a consultants' report, which was commissioned by my Department, on the regulation of bus services outside the greater Dublin area. I have published the report without commitment and I have invited comments on it from all interested parties. When I have considered the report and the public response to it, I will publish proposals for regulation of the bus market outside the greater Dublin area early in 2003.</P>

      <P>The report has been taken off the website and only the recommendations are there at present.</P>
      <P>Two important issues in deregulation are funding and dealing with congestion. They are not addressed in relation to competition, as it relates to Dublin Bus, or the proposals to deregulate Bus Éireann. Can these issues be dealt with? How does the Minister intend to do this in the short-term? There are also question marks over the proposals for Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann. It is feared that the elements of deregulation and competition will not actually improve the level of service provided to the consumer. There are also serious concerns in the unions about competition and deregulation of the industry. The employees of both Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus received letters of comfort. Has the Minister investigated the financial implications of opening up competition within that sector?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We need the number of buses we need. The issue is whether the CIE group is allowed a total monopoly on the bus service. I have made my position clear and I would be pleased if the Deputies opposite also made theirs clear. I pay tribute to the great work of the CIE companies. I believe that in a market <Col N="17" /> of deregulation or controlled competition with franchises, they will match the competition, as they have done in the area of long-distance buses, beating it in many cases. Employment has grown and CIE now has a bigger market share. The same happens in aviation &ndash; the market grows when franchising, deregulation or controlled competition is introduced and the service is procured independently of the shareholder, who is also the regulator. I am unapologetically in favour of moving to that system. I would welcome equal clarity on the position from all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>To deal with congestion in Dublin we must do practical things: finish the port tunnel, the M50 &ndash; once the problems in Carrickmines are sorted out &ndash; and the Kildare bypass and create more quality bus corridors to add to the ten or 12 we have. Every year &euro;40 million or &euro;50 million goes into traffic management systems. The Dublin Transportation Authority has many programmes to tackle congestion but the number of cars is growing very rapidly &ndash; there are over 1.3 million cars in the country although the number of households is 1.2 million. Low interest rates are encouraging more and more people to buy cars. I will not be the Minister for Transport who promises no more traffic jams &ndash; I will leave that to somebody else. It is difficult to keep up with the number of cars being purchased in terms of infrastructural investment. We are making every effort to do so.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the unions. Through the Public Transport Partnership Forum I will engage in full consultation with the unions on these proposals. I will come back to the letter of comfort later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE submitted an application for a fares increase to my Department in July of this year. The application was made by CIE in the context of losses that had arisen as a consequence of the expansion of services in recent years, increasing congestion, rising overheads and increased wage costs following recent wage agreements. I carefully considered the application taking into account the following criteria: the need to address the deteriorating financial position of CIE; an increase of approximately &euro;12 million in Exchequer subvention for 2003. A total of &euro;233 million in State subvention is being provided in the current year and this was increased to &euro;245 million in the recent Estimates for 2003. There has been an 84% increase in the subvention since 1997; the significant capital funding being made available to the company under the national development plan; the fact that CIE has received only two fares increases over the last ten years <Col N="18" /> and fares have declined in real terms by approximately 20% over the period; and the need for reform of the public transport sector to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and customer responsiveness of the public transport system in response to changing demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>It was interesting to listen to the Minister listing the things that have to be done to deal with traffic congestion. He did not include on the list the need to get people to move from private to public transport. I take it that is a central element of the Minister's policy. If that is the case, surely a fares increase flies in the face of that policy. The fares are already high by European standards. It seems an act of folly to put in place a further discouragement for people who are considering making the move from private to public transport.</P>
      <P>What are the Minister's views on the level of subvention currently being provided to Dublin Bus? Does he accept that in spite of increases in recent years, by European standards the subvention is still extremely low, whether to the bus companies or to Iarnród Éireann? This is the fundamental problem in public transport. There is no ideological commitment to adequate funding which could provide a proper public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that modal shift, as they call it in the transport industry &ndash; getting people out of their cars and onto public transport &ndash; is a policy that should be supported. I am trying to drive policy in that direction. It is changing &ndash; at one time we were trying to persuade people, by providing that service, not to buy cars but to get on buses and trains. However, we are now increasingly trying to persuade people not to use their cars every day but to leave them at home and get the bus, the train, the Luas and so on.</P>
      <P>With regard to fares, we must remember the taxpayer. The consumer price index has gone up by 30% in ten years and fares have gone up by approximately 10%. That means that in real terms fares have fallen 20% in ten years. That is a significant fall. While passengers and consumers are very important, there are also taxpayers. This year's cheque from the taxpayer to CIE is approximately &euro;500 million &ndash; that is &euro;10 million every week. It is incumbent on any Minister for Transport, Government or Dáil to make sure that we demand a response to that. The subvention is not particularly high by international standards but it is growing rather alarmingly. This year, between current and capital, it stands at more than &euro;500 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister say that the subvention is growing &ldquo;rather alarmingly&rdquo;? Should we not be aiming for at least an average European level of subvention for public transport? The Minister's reply indicates a particular ideological view of public transport services. Is it <Col N="19" /> not the aim to increase the subvention to bring it up to average European standards so that we can have adequate public transport services? Is the Minister aware that the price of the annual bus ticket has been increased by 19% from 1 January? What are his views on this?</P>
      <P>In the greater Dublin area the business community is claiming that traffic congestion is costing it about &euro;600 million per annum. Would it not make sense to increase the subvention substantially to the public transport companies and keep fares low, providing a real incentive for people to use buses and thereby clearing the traffic congestion in the city? I do not get the impression that the Minister has an overall plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I really thought that it was fares that kept people off buses, I would debate the issue with the Deputy. I have doubts that if fares were halved the numbers using buses would increase significantly. Fares would not change the habits of a lifetime for people. It is a factor but it is not the central factor. Other countries pay higher subventions but they also pay substantially more in income and corporation tax. As for the 19% increase on annual tickets, I cannot confirm the figure but I know it is in double digits. I do not control those fares in the same way as I control the ordinary fares.</P>

      <P>I hope that is why I am remembered and not because of other issues. It is a unique monument, I accept that, and I visited it. The Deputy may not have had the opportunity to look at the measure in great detail, but section 14 of the National Monuments Act, as amended by the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, not section 14 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, to which the Deputy referred incorrectly, applies only to national monuments and prohibits interference. It is clear that we have taken no illegal action in this area.</P>
      <P>I accept that Carrickmines Castle is unique and we have achieved the best compromise. I arranged for An Taisce to meet the National Roads Authority and I asked the National Roads Authority to ensure the preservation of the maximum amount of the castle. The road is not going through the castle, the castle is to the side. It will, however, go over some of the outer walls. I asked the NRA to consider raising the roundabout so that the outer walls can be viewed, and that is being done.</P>
      <P>We have achieved the best result with the castle being preserved and those parts of the outer walls that are affected by the road visible to those interested by descending a flight of steps. We need this motorway. There are 80,000 cars on the M50 and the idea that the ring-road of the M50 would not be finished would cause chaos around Dublin.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
      <Quest>the reason the railway system is being allowed to deteriorate, in view of the importance of rail travel and freight transport in the provision of a balanced and sustainable regional development policy.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to the ongoing and future development of the rail network as a critical element of a strategy for sustainable economic growth. Under the national development plan, &euro;2.8 billion has been committed to public transport projects, with a significant proportion of this allocated for the development of the rail network. Exchequer capital funding of &euro;1 billion will have been invested in public transport under the national development plan by the end of 2002. This historically high level of funding will be maintained in 2003 with the provision of in excess of &euro;400 million in Exchequer capital funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to see, therefore, how the Deputy can argue that the railways are being allowed to deteriorate. Significant progress has been made to date in developing the rail network, with 333 miles of track renewed, 192 miles of safety fenc<Col N="21" /> ing erected, 282 bridges renewed and 489 level crossings improved or permanently closed. There has been a 100% increase in the capacity of the Maynooth line and a 50% increase in the capacity of the DART network. A major upgrade of Heuston Station is well under way and this work is scheduled for completion in June 2003.</P>
    <P>This progress will be maintained in the coming years. I recently approved Exchequer funding for 67 new mainline carriages, 36 additional DART units and the DART upgrade project to allow the operation of eight carriage DART trains. This latter project will result in a 100% increase in the capacity of the DART between 2000 and 2005. In addition, all mainline passenger lines will have modern continuous welded rail and the signalling system on the Galway line will be upgraded by the end of 2003.</P>
    <P>My Department has also initiated a strategic rail review of the entire network and I expect to publish that report by the end of January 2003. The review is designed to determine a strategic approach to the future development of the railways in Ireland as part of the overall delivery of the objectives of a public transport policy. Those objectives are to ensure the provision of a well functioning, integrated public transport system which enhances competitiveness, sustains economic growth and contributes to social inclusion; a defined standard of public transport at reasonable cost to the customer and the taxpayer; and the timely and cost effective delivery of the accelerated investment in infrastructure and facilities necessary to ensure improved public transport provision.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>The consultants undertaking the study have liaised closely with Irish Rail in considering options for the future development of the network. I recently conveyed my views to the chairman of CIE that no decisions should be taken on the withdrawal of freight services until the completion of the strategic rail review. The board of CIE at its meeting on 6 November 2002 agreed to postpone any decisions in this regard. The review will provide the Government with a basis for establishing a strategic policy framework for future development of the rail sector in Ireland for the next 20 years.</P>

If the Minister is as pro-rail as he says, why did he and Iarnród <Col N="22" /> Éireann cut the lines on the LimerickClaremorris line at Athenry last week? In my time as a Deputy, I have never seen track that has been lifted being welded back. Before the strategic review was announced, why did the Minister axe this part of the rail system? Will he give a commitment to the House that planning and resources equal to those being put into roads will be put into rail travel and freight to take into account of towns and cities outside Dublin? Will those towns and cities be integrated with the mainline railway to Dublin? There is no trouble with the intercity lines but if the Minister wants to solve the problems on our roads, he will not do it without putting more resources and planning into the rail network.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>My information about Athenry shows that, as part of the CTC signalling upgrade on the Galway line, Irish Rail removed the points to the Claremorris line. That will result in an improved service on the Dublin-Galway line when it is completed next year. These points can be replaced easily and quickly. There are currently no services on the Claremorris route, which has been the case for some time. The strategic rail review report will comment on these issues and no other track work will be disturbed. That hardly amounts to an assault on Ireland's national rail network.</P>
      <P>We have invested heavily in the rail network. Yesterday we signed an order for new carriages. There is significant work going on at Heuston Station. The 333 miles of track does not apply just to Dublin, it includes 192 miles of safety fencing, 282 bridges, 490 level crossings and continuous welded track being put in place throughout the country.

      <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
      <Quest>in regard to his recent statement of his intention to franchise out certain bus routes in the greater Dublin area, the way in which these pro posals will improve services; the consideration he has given to the experience of other capital cities in this regard, prior to making a final decision in regard to Dublin Bus; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23628/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On 7 November last I made a statement to the Public Transport Partnership Forum in which I outlined in detail my proposals for the reform of the bus market in the greater Dublin area involving the phased introduction of franchising.</P>
      <P>Initial proposals for franchising were made in a Government consultation paper, A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport, published in September 2000. These proposals took account of research by my Department which looked, in particular, at experiences in London, Stockholm and Helsinki. That research concluded that where franchising had been introduced, operating and subvention costs had reduced and service quality improved</P>
      <P>In response to the proposals outlined in that consultation paper, the Public Transport Partnership Forum commissioned a consultancy report, the NERA report, to examine models of transport regulation in a range of cities around the world to assist it in making a formal statement of its views in response to that consultation paper. Nine cities were identified as being representative of the wide range of approaches to public transport regulation that exist. The report summarised key aspects of each city's performance as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each city's approach. In general, the report supported the introduction of some form of competitive tendering for bus services in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The European Commission also undertook independent research which supported the case for introducing controlled competition in public transport. This research led the Commission to publish proposals for a regulation which would require member states to tender for the provision of subvented public transport services. These research findings led me to propose that controlled competition in the form of bus franchising should be introduced in the greater Dublin area. I am convinced that properly designed and implemented, it can lead to significant improvements in service provision and reductions in the level of subvention for a given level of service. I look forward to further discussing these issues with the social partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the cost base of Dublin Bus is probably as low as possible and that significant progress has been made in recent years in that company? Far from having difficulty in extending the level of service, it is only too keen to increase the number of routes. It applied to the Minister in this regard on a number of occasions but has been refused licences. Will he accept that deregulation of bus services in Britain, for example, has been unsuc<Col N="24" /> cessful? Initially many players become involved but the number decreases quickly. The result is local private monopolies, which are not in the interests of the travelling public? What reassurance can the Minister give that there will not be similar developments here where bus services end up being worse than when there was a public monopoly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that Dublin Bus has made great strides. It has purchased virtually a whole new fleet, streamlined its operations, is a strong company and it has my support. I do not recall refusing licences to CIE. My information is that a licence is required when non-CIE companies operate. When CIE wants to operate a route which is not already serviced, I do not believe it requires a licence. However, I will double check that aspect for the Deputy.</P>
      <P>On UK deregulation, I am not going down the UK route which made a mess of the railway system and the bus service outside London. I am interested, however, in going down the franchise route, which is not head-to-head competition with everyone rushing for the same bus stop. It is a franchising model similar to that used in London, Stockholm and Helsinki where the bundle of routes is tendered out by the regulator and a subvention is attached if required. The model which works in these three cities is the one I am interested in pursuing. I agree with the Deputy that many errors were made in the UK and I do not propose to repeat them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>What evidence has the Minister that private operators could provide a more competitive and reliable bus service than Dublin Bus currently operates? What is the position in regard to Dublin Bus routes where there is crosssubsidisation between the routes? If the Minister franchises out a profitable route, will he compensate Dublin Bus for the loss of profit on that route to enable it to subsidise some of the non-profitable routes? What are the implications of the Minister's proposals for people who currently enjoy free travel passes on all public buses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The free travel pass is provided by the operator, whether CIE or a different operator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. The State purchases that service, therefore, it will purchase it from either the private sector or public sector so there is a level playing field. On the cross-subsidisation of routes, I propose to appoint a regulatory authority which will work out all these details. I am not being totally prescriptive because at this point I am just laying down the broad policy and deadlines. I will ask the regulator to work out the details of how routes are parcelled, subventions attached, cross-subsidisation and so on. I am confident these issues can be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="25" />On whether there is evidence that the private sector can do better, many years ago the same question could have been asked. When Aer Lingus was doing fine people asked why allow Ryanair or anyone else into the market? The reality is that the competition grew the market. One could say the same about radio stations. Many years ago there was one big fine radio station, now there are 30 or 40 radio stations. That is no reflection on the one station, it just means there is room to grow the market because tastes change and so on. I could give ten such examples. If one applies the same thinking to public transport one will get the same buzz.</P>

      <Quest>if, with regard to a recent NRA publication identifying 109 blackspots on the Irish road network, he intends to issue a direction to the NRA to prioritise these projects over all other NDP roads projects over the current term of the NDP; if all of these blackspots will in fact be physically improved under the current NDP roads programme; and if not, the number of them which will remain unaltered as they will be bypassed by new routes on greenfield sites which may or may not be tolled.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the recent report, to which the Deputy refers, was undertaken by the National Roads Authority in order to identify high accident locations on the national road network.</P>
      <P>In the context of the national development plan, approximately half of the 109 locations identified in the report will be bypassed or substantially altered under the national roads programme as set out in the NDP. Fewer accidents should result at these locations as a consequence. The scheduling of any necessary remedial works at locations identified in the report will be a matter for the NRA, together with relevant local authorities, in the context of available resources under the NRA's remedial measures programme. It should be noted that at the end of 2001, accident reduction measures had been put in place at 342 locations on national roads as part of the Government strategy for road safety 1998-2002, and measures at 58 further locations are due for completion in 2002.</P>

Given the current lack of resources and the fact that spending on these new roads means we cannot improve these accident blackspots throughout the country, would it be better if the Government was honest and reverted back to the NRA's recommended policy to upgrade existing roads instead of going ahead with motorways which we cannot afford, for which there is no need and which will not include safety benefits?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and I are unlikely to agree on this matter. The country needs major new inter-urban motorways between the major population centres. That is Government policy and I do not know of any other party in the House which shares Deputy Ryan's view that motorways are not needed and that only other roads should be improved. Motorways are substantially safer than other roads. About half of the 109 locations identified in the report will be bypassed or substantially altered. Good progress is being made on that.</P>
      <P>I recently asked the NRA to give additional attention to improving areas which we are not in a position to bring to motorway standard yet and to see if it could introduce short-term solutions without compromising longer-term investment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am encouraged by the last comment because I understand that none of the new motorway sections has been started and none of the CPOs has been enforced. Does the Minister agree it is not too late to implement the policy he has just mentioned and, while we do not have the money, to make the current primary road network safe while completing the sections of motorway that are under way? We can then develop motorways if finance is available. Does he think that is prudent policy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at the expense of giving up on the motorway programme. I have asked the NRA to make sure that, without compromising its future investment in motorways, it should look at things like climbing lanes and improving roads. If it is an either-or question, we must build the motorways. However, I have asked the NRA to tackle, within its resources, the spots the Deputy is talking about. There is no point making a huge <Col N="27" /> investment in an old road if it is to be abandoned in two or three years' time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>Metrication of speed limits is in principle desirable for consistency with road distance signs and with general national and EU policies in favour of metrication. In general, I support the policy of speed limit metrication. Such a change will, however, have to be managed so as not to compromise road safety. We must also be conscious of the effect that the metrication of speed limits could have on the application of the penalty points system which has recently been applied to speeding offences. In that context, it is essential that the speed limits we use are credible and that they are applied in a reasoned manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The adoption of metric values for speed limits will of itself create the need for alterations to the imperial values applying at present. The last comprehensive review of speed limits was carried out between 1990 and 1992 and resulted in the adoption of the current structure. I intend to take the opportunity afforded by the process of metrication to review that structure in consultation with the Garda Síochána, the National Roads <Col N="28" /> Authority and the local authorities, in view of the particular role given to the latter in the Road Traffic Acts in the application of speed limits at specific locations.</P>
    <P>In advance of the adoption of a new statutory code to underpin a metricated system of speed limits, regulations to amend the European Communities (Units of Measurement) Regulations, 2001, need to be put in place by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I will shortly be in contact with the Minister with a view to the determination of appropriate dates for the full metrication of speed limits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that speed limit signs are poorly designed and, in many cases, poorly visible? This has been highlighted by the introduction of the penalty points system. There is an urgent need for them to be redesigned. Will the Minister ensure that speed limits which do not make practical sense are immediately addressed? On the M50, the speed limit up to the Tallaght junction is 70 miles per hour but after that is 50 miles per hour. That is a crazy situation as the road is the same specification throughout. There are 400-metre stretches of road where the speed limit goes from 40 miles per hour to 60 miles per hour and back to 30 miles per hour. These issues need to be addressed immediately.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that reform of speed limits is necessary in the context of reductions of limits on county roads and in housing estates? Perhaps 20 miles per hour speed limits could be introduced for housing estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about redesigning speed signs, in many cases they need to be more visible. I will take that matter up with the relevant authorities. The speed limit on the M50 is 70 miles per hour and it then comes down, I am told, to 60 miles per hour, although the Deputy says 50. I am told this is because traffic is moving onto a section which is under construction and it is desirable that the traffic is slowed further. However, I take the point.</P>
      <P>On the issue of a 20 miles per hour limit for housing estates, I do not want to cherry-pick or to drive around the country and decide where to make changes. That would have all sorts of implications, including for housing policy. The speed limits of villages are almost linked to the planning process and to where a village starts and ends. I do not want to reach that point but I share the Deputy's sense of urgency and will press ahead on this.</P>

      <P>On the 20 miles per hour or 30 kilometres per hour speed limit in residential areas, I am confused when the Minister says he does not want to cherry-pick figures. Does the Minister agree that if a person is hit by a car travelling at 20 miles per hour there is a 20% chance of death whereas, at 40 miles per hour there is an 80% chance that person will be killed? In those circumstances, does the Minister not think it incumbent on Government to immediately change the legislation so that local authorities can introduce a 20 miles per hour limit, which is prohibited at present, to make roads safer for children and old people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, has reminded me that to have a child hit by a car at 30 miles per hour is the equivalent of dropping that child from 52 feet. Therefore, I share the Deputy's concern. This has not been undertaken for a long time and now needs to be done comprehensively and properly and not in a piecemeal manner. I will press on with it as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the maximum speed limit on major roads now applies on county roads where, with the dramatic increase in traffic, there is obviously much greater danger, does the Minister intend to apply specific speed limits to county roads? Given the change in driver behaviour that has taken place since the introduction of the penalty points, a 20 mph speed limit, if applied, would be adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Early indications suggest the penalty points system is having the desired effect. The monitoring of this will continue and I will include county roads in our review. The overall national speed limit applies everywhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56, 59 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the implementation of the commitment set out in the programme for Government to establish a dedicated traffic corps is being developed by my Department, in consultation with the Garda Síochána. Once this preparatory work is completed, I will engage in detailed discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has overall responsibility for the Garda Síochána, to determine how this commitment can best be progressed. The powers and functions of the proposed traffic corps, its financing, its relationship with the Garda Síochána, the extent of legislative change required to establish it and arrangements for supervising it, are matters to be decided by Government following consideration of proposals which will be submitted on foot of the discussions with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatBreen" hpid="Mr. P. Breen Mr. P. Breen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister entered his position with great aspirations last June and road safety was a key priority for him. What impact will the cutbacks in the Estimates have on the establishment of a Garda traffic corps? Who will have the overall responsibility for the traffic corps when it is established? Will it be the Department of Transport or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform? Will the corps comprise gardaí or civilians?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>These matters have yet to be decided. I am strongly committed to the introduction of a new traffic corps that will be separately identifiable and visible. Many countries have such a corps and Ireland should have the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will have further discussions with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on how to shape the corps. There are many options, one of which is having routine matters dealt with by civ<Col N="31" /> ilians under Garda management. Another view &ndash; one that I do not share &ndash; is having a corps separate from the Garda. The programme for Government spoke of a six month consultation period but we are running a number of months late. We intend to progress it as rapidly as possible from here on. I do not have a specific date on which it will commence but I hope to have it established and operating by the end of next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the establishment of a special traffic corps require legislation? Does the Minister envisage members of this corps having powers of arrest? Is it not the case that no money has been provided for such a corps in the Department's Estimate? If that is not the case, perhaps the Minister will indicate the subhead under which provision is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will almost certainly require legislation if we embark on the scale I envisage. Operationally, a traffic corps within the Garda Síochána can be established by the Commissioner. Garda members of the corps would obviously have powers of arrest. Civilians, subject to further discussions, would not have the same powers of arrest as a garda. They may have powers of referral the details of which could be worked out in legislation.</P>
      <P>There is no specific sum provided for this in the 2003 Estimates. Necessary funding will be made available, as it is required, to support the development of the corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister be more specific? Given the cutbacks across all Departments, on what basis is he giving the assurance that money will be found for this corps? Money will be required but there is no indication it has been provided. Despite the promises in the programme for Government, is the Minister talking about a long-term project? Is it not the case that there is not a hope in hell of a traffic corps being established within the next 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my aim to have something organised by the end of next year. Funds are available in the general Estimate to carry out the consultation and administration processes leading to the establishment of the corps. It is not yet clear what additional funding will be required &ndash; that will have to be worked out in discussions. It is not clear whether serving gardaí will be used or if additional recruitment is required but substantial restructuring may achieve a lot. I am fully committed to this project and will find the funds for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's thinking on this seems to be at a very early stage. I am shocked to hear him say funding will not be required and gardaí may be redeployed from their current duties to specific traffic duties. This is not what <Col N="32" /> the traffic corps is supposed to be about. There is agreement on all sides of the House that gardaí need to give more attention to crime, especially public order crime. Does the Minister accept there is a need for much greater enforcement of traffic regulations and that we should deploy substantial additional personnel to ensure such enforcement? There is an element of smoke and mirrors in this. The Minister says we want a new service but it may not cost any money and is just about administrative changes. Is this to be a proper new traffic corps or will it simply be a wing of the Garda Síochána? If it is the latter, there will be no net increase in personnel and no improvement in the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>These issues have not yet been worked out. I have only commenced discussions with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is a matter for him, through the commissioner, to deploy the Garda. I am not saying the new corps can be created without considerable extra expense, I believe it will cost a substantial amount of money.</P>

      <P>As regards the Minister's meetings with the DTO, the DTO was responsible for the initial metro plans for Dublin. During the summer the Minister said publicly that the plans had been changed in that the metro would not go from the airport to his constituency, but would only go as far as the city centre. Has the Minister liaised with the DTO about this proposal? Has a strategic review been carried out to determine the transport and planning implications of not running a metro link to his constituency? Does he envisage a further meeting with the DTO prior to the completion of the rail procurement study on the metro options to see whether it is right to go ahead with a rail link from the airport to the city centre at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Railway Procurement Agency is examining the metro project. I have asked it to extract from its considerations the possibility of a link from the city centre to Dublin Airport. A modern airport must have a rail link and it is considering that proposition. There are a number of alternatives to provide that. One is the metro, while another is to take some spurs off the existing rail network. As regards the metro in general, the Railway Procurement Agency is about to submit to me what it calls a business case. Funding has not yet been identified for the metro project. Its final design is still a substantial way off. However, I have asked the agency to focus on the metro link to the airport and to bring that forward because that is the heart of it.</P>
      <P>As regards our constituency, the proposed Luas will run from Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green. The RPA has proposals to convert that to the metro at a later stage. That will ensure the metro will run from Sandyford and perhaps further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP" hpid="Mr. Eamon Ryan Mr. Eamon Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that funding is not available and that there are no designs for the metro, will the Minister consider reverting to plan B, which was included in the original DTO proposal, to provide extensive other light rail routes <Col N="34" /> around the city, one of which would go into our shared constituency in Rathfarnham? That would be a substantially cheaper option. Will the Minister consider other light rail routes instead of the metro if funding is not provided for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed rail link from the city centre to the airport is a central plank of the DTO's strategy. Given the lack of funding, the serious delays and the fact that public consultation on the proposed routes has not yet commenced, does the Minister accept that not only will his own target date of 2005 not be met, but the original DTO target date of 2007 will not be met? Has he had discussions with or received proposals from the authorities in Croke Park to link the proposed airport line to the Croke Park area to alleviate traffic congestion there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the Minister's meetings with the DTO, did he discuss Operation Freeflow? Have there been discussions with the DTO about the Luas works in the city centre which will cause congestion during the Christmas period? Have there been discussions with the DTO about faulty traffic lights in the city centre? There were two recent incidents involving faulty traffic lights, one happened on a Sunday morning and the other happened in the afternoon before rush hour. If traffic lights are faulty in the city centre or on the outskirts, the city will grind to a halt. Has the Minister proposals to deal with that issue? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards Deputy Eamon Ryan's question about other light rail projects, I do not have proposals for additional light rail extensions at this time. There is a general proposal for an extension to Cherrywood and another idea &ndash; I cannot put it any stronger &ndash; about a route to Rathfarnham. There are no firm proposals in the latter case. However, fairly advanced proposals are being considered by the RPA in the former case.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shortall asked me about my target for the airport link. I would like to have it completed by 2005 if I can. I have been criticised for giving dates and trying to get things done on target. The danger of not doing that is that one does not meet targets. I had the same difficulty with the penalty points system. However, by choosing a target and trying to keep to it, we were able to make it happen. By setting deadlines, I run the risk of not meeting them, for which I will be criticised. However, I prefer to take that risk, to set a deadline and see if we can reach it by pushing the system towards it. I have not had discussions with Croke Park about the rail link.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure my question is predictable. Last Sunday the <i>Sunday Independent</i> carried a story that a senior member of the Government was involved in what is known as the Aer Rianta drinks scandal. Will the Taoiseach confirm whether there is any veracity in the allegation made in last Sunday's newspaper that brandy, whiskey and cigars to the value of &euro;5,000 was delivered in a van to a Minister in the 1990s and that the bill has not yet been paid? Has he called in his Ministers and asked them if there is any truth in the allegation in the newspaper report? Are current Cabinet members or members of the second bench involved centrally or otherwise in this story? Has the Taoiseach spoken to Aer Rianta's auditor? Has he contacted Mr. O'Leary, a former board member and member of Fianna Fáil, who assisted former Deputy Lawlor through a side door when he was on his way to serve a jail sentence? I am sure Mr. O'Leary would be more <Col N="36" /> than anxious to help the Taoiseach to sort out this problem.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach have any sense of the outrage felt by the public? If a Minister used the facilities of a semi-State body as a personal shop, it would amount to a gross abuse of public trust and he or she would not be deemed fit to hold public office. Given that this puts the members of the Cabinet in the spotlight, will the Taoiseach explain why it will take a fortnight to get a report on what should be a simple matter? Will he ask each of his Ministers individually this evening, if he has not already done so, to confirm that he or she is not the subject of this allegation and that he or she is not and has not been involved in any such ministerial profligacy of the State coffers?</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Kenny's last sentence. It is important that this issue be addressed as quickly and as thoroughly as possible and I want to bring it to a speedy and definitive conclusion. I am hopeful that the inquiry being carried out by the Secretary General of the Department of Transport will be concluded a good deal sooner than by the end of the period allowed. I am not sure how long it will take to go through all the records, but I understand it will be done as quickly as possible &ndash; by later this week at the latest. The results of Aer Rianta's inquiry are also awaited. The company has investigated this as far as it could over the last day and a half and has asked an auditor to examine any issues.</P>
      <P>The Opposition is right to ask for answers and those answers should be provided, which I will certainly do. The Minister does not want to give any incorrect answers, nor do I. He wants to give proper answers to the questions that have been raised. Deputy Kenny is being careful and I appreciate that he has not mentioned the name of a colleague. I did not have to call in my second row or my first row because it was very clear who was being spoken about. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, contacted me over the weekend to tell me that an article about him would appear, which I confirm to the House. That is big news to the House. The Minister issued a statement this afternoon which he hopes to discuss during Question Time. I will read his statement to the House. It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to state that to the absolute very best of my recollection, it being approximately 12 years, and in the strongest possible terms, lest there be any doubt, that I never personally received, authorised, or had knowledge of the ordering of, purchase, or delivery, of the <Col N="37" /> alleged goods referred to in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> article, on Sunday last.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the full facts relating to this allegation will be established within days. I reiterate that when the reports are available I will publish those details immediately.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Kenny and the House that I will make available any other information brought to my attention as soon as we have a full statement. In so far as it has been possible to talk to past and present staff that might know something about this, there has been no result in terms of throwing light on the matter. I spoke to Mr. O'Leary and he has not been able to tell me anything besides what is in the public domain, which still amounts to an allegation. I cannot give the House any more information as to whether there is any truth in any of this, all I can do is seek the information as quickly as I can and, in the meantime, state what the Minister involved has told me. I cannot speak for anybody who might have something to answer on this or say whether there is anything to answer. All I can do is to assure the public that this is a serious matter. I do not disagree with anything Deputy Kenny has said and I will report as soon as I have something to report. If I have nothing to report, I will report that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for this explanation and for the forthrightness of the comment made by the Minister who has now been named publicly as Deputy Brennan. There are reports that this matter goes back as far as 1989 and the problem is that it casts a cloud over a member of the Government. The Minister said yesterday that he would not issue any statement until the report is published in two weeks time, but things have moved on apace and he has issued the statement we have just heard. Does the Taoiseach think it is proper that this Department should be investigating and reporting to the Minister? Does he consider that there are revenue implications for the Minister or any board member arising from this? In view of the fact that allegations are being made that this may go back to a further period in the early 1990s, will the Taoiseach speak to each member of his Cabinet and each member of his party who was then a Member of the Oireachtas and confirm to the House in the morning that they have assured him they have not been involved in what amounts to a borrowing if not a theft of State property? Whoever was involved could have one hell of a Christmas party with 250 bottles of brandy or the equivalent.</P>
      <P>This is a second serious allegation against a member of the Cabinet, the other involving the receipt of £80,000, which the Taoiseach dealt with to some extent. In terms of democracy and public life this is not good, which is why I would like the Taoiseach to show strong moral leadership and clear this matter up with everybody in his Cabinet and in his second rank tomorrow morning.</P>

It is fair to ask if the investigation should be carried out by the Secretary General of the Department of Transport, but that is where all the records are. The Department will consult with whoever it needs to and I am keeping a close watch on this in so far as I can. I assure Deputy Kenny and the House that we have been able to contact many of the officials we thought could help us on this and we have contacted the Minister's staff and advisors of the time, as well as officials of Aer Rianta. I am not sure where the figure of £5,000 originated, because no one I have spoken to has quoted that figure to me. I am trying to find out and I do not know if there is any foundation to this. I do not want to guess because I have made that mistake before, but as soon as I have the facts I will disclose them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to hear the Minister's statement again, though I am prepared to take it at face value. I am puzzled that it has taken two days to issue it when, if there was no truth to the allegation, one would have expected a rebuttal by lunchtime on Sunday or a statement to the effect that there was some truth to it, though the essential facts were incorrect. The only third option I can think of is that an admission would be have been made and a resignation tendered.</P>
      <P>Why did it take this long and why is it presumed that an investigation should take 14 days? If the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism was accused of inadvertently or otherwise taking artefacts from the National Gallery, he would remember whether he did it or not. I can understand that the passage of time makes recollection imprecise, but on something like this, as the Taoiseach said, if somebody consumed that much drink, they would be inclined to remember it, even if it was with others. Will the Taoiseach say whether or not he thinks the merchandise came from the bonded warehouse system in Aer Rianta?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Taoiseach says his own inquiry is under way in parallel, is it the case that there is an internal dispute and that people not likely to <Col N="39" /> be re-appointed to the board of Aer Rianta are spilling the beans, in this case, the brandy, so to speak? It is important that the Taoiseach can assure the House that the bond system that Aer Rianta operates was not operable here. What did the Minister, Deputy Brennan, mean when he said he did not know whether there was one Minister or ten Ministers involved? Was he or whomsoever, if there is truth in this allegation, acting on behalf of a number of Ministers? Was the booty being shared out? Is the Taoiseach saying to the House that he is satisfied there is no basis at all for this allegation? What does he mean when he says he cannot find any basis for the £5,000 figure. Is there a basis for some figure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to answer some of those questions. I understand it would be impossible for any of the spirits to come out of the bonded warehouse in Aer Rianta. Obviously there is some way of checking if anything came out on any occasion, and Aer Rianta is quite satisfied that could not have happened. When the Minister, Deputy Brennan, said he did not know if there were more Ministers involved this was because dates in 1989, 1991 and the mid-1990s were mentioned. He thought people were talking about a cumulative figure. Whether it was one year or not I still do not know because I do not know the basis of the £5,000 and whether a number of Ministers were involved. I have made whatever inquiries I can but as of now, other than hearing what is said here and reading what is in the newspapers, I gather that somewhere in the 1990s it is stated that there was a bill or an invoice within the Aer Rianta system that was due to a Department and was not paid. I do not have any other information on whether that existed but it was stated some years ago that such a bill existed.</P>
      <P>The Minister's original idea was that the auditor should come in and check everything. That would involve checking some records because it covers a number of years. The Department officials worked on it last night. Aer Rianta is working on it. It is best left until we get facts. Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte will appreciate that in the past I have tried, and so have other colleagues, to give a quick answer and to work totally on recollection. I am not saying one would not remember something like this. However, with the passage of time one does not remember all the details and when one tries to give some detail on recollection it then emerges that one has changed position. It is better to check the basic facts as quickly as possible and, I hope that can be done in the next day or two. As soon as I have that information I will gladly put it before the House because I am anxious that this matter be addressed as quickly and as thoroughly as possible.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach says it might have been a cumulative figure over a number of years, is he saying he has established that this practice went on even if over several years? In the probability that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, will increase excise duties on tobacco and drink next week, if there was any breach of the bonded system at Aer Rianta it would be a disgrace if it was breached either on the instructions of a Minister or, as the Taoiseach is now saying, a Department. Was this a corporate decision of a Department or was it a decision of a Minister? If it was a decision of a Department why is the Secretary General of that Department investigating it? Does the Taoiseach understand how the remark of the Minister, Deputy Brennan, leaves open the suggestion that the Cabinet of the day, or many members of the Cabinet of the day, seem to regard the Cabinet as a duty free zone like Dublin Airport? That is the impression that is out there. Does he agree the reason it is imperative to clear this up quickly is that it is demeaning to his Government and to all politics that this allegation should hang in the air and if it is part of Aer Rianta departmental politics on the part of some aggrieved individuals to make malicious unfounded allegations against a Minister the quicker that is put out into the public domain the better. Two days have elapsed. It defies most of public understanding why it should take longer than that to put this allegation to bed if unfounded malicious allegation it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish there was a button one could press when an allegation is made that could prove whether it was unfounded but there is not and Deputy Rabbitte is well aware of that. In this case it is reported that an invoice existed somewhere between 1989 to some period in the 1990s and was not paid by somebody, maybe a Department, Minister, official, or adviser and it was raised by an acting board member with a chief executive and somewhere along the way after that there was some other discussion but nobody ever paid it and it was written off, and this has given rise to many questions. All I and the people involved can do is methodically go through the records, invoices, bills, statements, what was written off by auditors, all the cash receipts and all the other issues to try to establish the facts. It is no good just stating that it is a puff of smoke. If I did that people will ask how I know. I do not know. All I can say is that I have a colleague who is clearly the brunt of this allegation. Whether it is for any of the reasons set out by Deputy Rabbitte, or some other reasons, or no reason, there is no point in my speculating. If I did so, I would be accused of blindly supporting a colleague. Naturally, what he says, I believe, but we have to go through the examination. When the examination is complete we will report it. Needless to say the person who would like to see this dealt with more quickly than anyone else is the person sitting on my left, because he is the brunt <Col N="41" /> of all these accusations which have been floating around this town, non-stop for about a week.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach appears satisfied that his Cabinet colleagues can hold their drink or someone's drink. Is he equally satisfied that the Department of Transport officials have the appropriate powers to investigate the whiskey and cigars allegation? Is it appropriate that Aer Rianta management is conducting inquiries which, if proven, surely would point to culpability on its part at the very least? Surely, if the situation as indicated in the news of the recent past is shown to be the case then, undoubtedly, Aer Rianta management also has a case to answer? I wonder how appropriate that approach would be? Is it not the case that there is undoubted public concern at the make-up of the Aer Rianta board which is dominated by one political view, that of Fianna Fáil, as a result of appointments over several years? Is it not the case also that there is real concern that Aer Rianta is seen almost as an extension of the Fianna Fáil fiefdom where it has had the opportunity to make use of Aer Rianta services at Dublin and other airports in terms of, as referred to by Deputy Kenny, very special treatment of former Members of this House in avoiding members of the press and so on. As far as an inquiry into this matter is concerned, will the Taoiseach consider widening its terms to take into account the full gamut of Aer Rianta?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Aer Rianta, through its auditors and senior staff, is assisting in bringing these matters to completion. Considerable powers are available if necessary, but perhaps there is a better way of dealing with the situation. The Deputy is not very well informed about internal politics in Aer Rianta or what the Minister is trying to do in regard to aviation transport here, otherwise he would not make the remarks he made.</P>

      <P>If the Taoiseach is proposing that he should have a greater input, I would have to oppose that, whatever the level of representation of his views. As to being informed about Aer Rianta, how well informed is the Taoiseach about the current reality in relation to very serious staff concerns <i>vis-à-vis</i> the running of Aer Rianta and specifically the current chairperson, Mr. Noel Hanlon, in terms of his role and the carrying out of his functions within Aer Rianta? I am sure the Taoiseach cannot be unaware of the express concerns of members of the staff of that body. What is his view of those? Does he agree that what we are looking at in terms of whiskey and cigars is but the tip of an iceberg of a culture of corruption and that that must be addressed? Would the Taoiseach be prepared to initiate a proper and full inquiry into the conduct of the affairs and business of Aer Rianta?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Policy changes within Aer Rianta will have to be dealt with, and the Mini<Col N="42" /> ster is involved in that.

I do not believe an investigation is required, whatever the policy issues. I will say no more.</P>

      <P>I have a question on No. 11 which is the motion re leave to introduce Supplementary Estimates. The Taoiseach has informed the House that Supplementary Estimates, to the tune of about &euro;450 million, are being sought today. Is this the full and final list of Supplementary Estimates that will be sought by Government for approval from the Dáil? There is considerable confusion at the moment with Government spending running nearly 20% ahead while the Minister is insisting that he will come in at 13.5%, excluding benchmarking which was provided for in the original Estimates. Will the Taoiseach assure us that this is the full and final list of Supplementary Estimates? Will he furnish to Opposition spokespersons on finance the position relating to balances and demand-led schemes as there can often be confusion as to the amount of money owed by agencies like the health authorities at the end of the year? We want to have a full and accurate picture of end year finances before we face into the budget tomorrow week.</P>

      <P>I wished to raise the same matter. In addition, given the extent by which the Minister for Finance has missed his figures, should these matters not be debated in the House rather than in committee? Before agreeing to No. 10 on the Abbeylara inquiry, is the Taoiseach aware of recent publicity to the effect that the sole member, Mr. Justice Barr, has not been provided with premises from which to conduct his inquiry? Has that matter been resolved? To where are the documents being released? Has any work already been carried out by this tribunal or is the work impeded as a result of not having premises?</P>

      <P>I agree with previous speakers and seek clarification on the actual spending proposed between this year and next year. It is clear from previous changes in Government policy that we do not always agree in this House on what the Government actually does. Will the Taoiseach clarify what the Government is proposing in these motions? Motion No. 9 refers to the report by the Minister for Defence pursuant to section 4 of the <Col N="46" /> Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993. Given the level of activity at Shannon Airport at the moment, many people outside the House will be interested to know if there is an unwritten aspect to this referring to the defence forces of another jurisdiction &ndash; the United States of America. This issue of whether we need to debate that matter in the Dáil is important.</P>

      <P>On the matter of Supplementary Estimates, at this time of year there are normally a number of Estimates passed. I cannot confirm that this is the only list of Supplementary Estimates but I can confirm that their number this year will be reduced from previous years. Only those absolutely necessary will be passed and the total amount will be less. This is most of them but there may be others. Deputy Bruton is aware that the figures come in up to the end of November and there are likely to be some switches and balances both in savings and expenditure. They will be resolved within the Department of Finance. I cannot say there are no more.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Bill entitled an Act to amend the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999 for the purpose of giving effect to the international agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland entered into for the purpose of enabling necessary arrangements to be made consequent upon the temporary suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly and constituted by the letters exchanged by those Governments the texts of which are set out in the Schedule to this Act.<Col N="55" /></P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill I introduce today is essential to preserve and protect a key element of the Good Friday Agreement &ndash; the North-South bodies. The purpose of it is to amend the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999, to enable the decisions of the North-South Ministerial Council &ndash; NSMC &ndash; in relation to the North-South bodies to be taken by the Irish and British governments together, during this period in which devolved government in Northern Ireland is temporarily suspended. I am grateful to the House for agreeing to take the Bill as a matter of urgency and for its co-operation in agreeing to take all Stages today.</P>
      <P>Immediately following the suspension of devolved government, the Irish and British Governments issued a joint statement which made clear that, while the Assembly was suspended, the Agreement was not. This is a vital distinction. We also gave a commitment to work together during the temporary suspension period to ensure that the Agreement and its achievements were protected and developed. Pending the restoration of devolved government, therefore, it falls to the two Governments, as guardians of the Agreement, to take whatever steps are necessary to fulfil this mandate and to manage the period ahead. In so doing, I firmly believe we are acting in accordance with the wishes and desires of the majority of the people on this island who voted for the Agreement and whose support gives it an enduring democratic strength and authority, which must be respected. We therefore have a clear and compelling responsibility to take action to maintain the North-South bodies during this interim period.</P>
      <P>The British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Bill amends the British-Irish Agreement Act of 1999. That Act gave domestic legislative effect to the agreements between the British and Irish Governments to establish the North-South Implementation Bodies. The North-South bodies were a central element of the Good Friday Agreement of 10 April, 1998 and, in particular, the strand two institutional arrangements which formed part of that Agreement. The bodies come under the overall policy direction of the North-South Ministerial Council and are accountable to it for their operations. They must receive Council approval for their annual budgets, operating plans, recruitment plans and other arrangements. During the current temporary suspension of devolved government, no meetings of the NSMC can take place. Therefore, the Council is unable to make decisions affecting the bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="56" />The bodies were established by an international agreement between the British and Irish Governments. As long as that agreement remains in force, unamended, the bodies continue to exist and must operate in accordance with its provisions. That means they must seek NSMC approval for matters such as those I have mentioned. If the bodies are not in a position to obtain NSMC approval for their annual budgets and business plans, they will be unable to operate successfully. They would also, effectively, be left unaccountable to any outside authority. This is not a desirable state of affairs from the political point of view nor from the point of view of good corporate governance. The two Governments want to ensure the continued successful operation of the North-South bodies. Therefore, we have temporarily amended the terms of the international agreement establishing the bodies, by means of a supplementary agreement. This supplementary agreement allows for the decisions of the NSMC in relation to the North-South bodies to be taken by the two Governments, pending the restoration of devolved government.</P>
    <P>The terms of the supplementary agreement, which was effected by an exchange of letters between my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the British Ambassador, form a schedule to this Bill. The Bill gives domestic legislative effect to the supplementary agreement, by amending the British-Irish Agreement Act of 1999, in similar fashion. The continued success of the North-South bodies is of critical importance to the Government. They have major work programmes under way in their various areas of responsibility and since their establishment almost three years ago, they have built up good working relationships with the key stake holders in their sectors. The six bodies in question are: The Trade and Business Development Body, under the brand name of InterTradelreland; the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission; the Language Body, comprising Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency; the Special EU Programmes Body, which has responsibility for the management and delivery of the Peace 2 and TERREG EU-funded programmes; Waterways Ireland; and the Food Safety Promotion Board.</P>
    <P>It is clear these bodies operate across a wide range of sectors and have diverse areas of responsibility and that the work which the bodies have brought this far should not be endangered. I will also make a brief reference to Tourism Ireland Limited the new North-South Tourism marketing company. It is responsible for marketing the island of Ireland overseas as a tourism destination. Deputies will note that Tourism Ireland Limited is not mentioned in the Bill before the House, although it is mentioned in the supplementary agreement which is attached as a schedule to the Bill. Tourism Ireland is not a statutory body. It is not mentioned in the original British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999. Instead, it is a company limited by guarantee, incorporated in this jurisdiction, and governed by the Companies <Col N="57" /> Acts. Tourism Ireland has a similar relationship to the NSMC as the statutory North-South bodies. It is accountable to the North-South Ministerial Council and requires NSMC approval for its annual budget and other key decisions.</P>
    <P>It is essential that Tourism Ireland is in a position to proceed with its very valuable and important work. The tourism industry is one of great value to the economy on this island and many Deputies will be aware of the very impressive start made by Tourism Ireland in its role of marketing the entire island of Ireland overseas as a tourism destination. Therefore, for the period in which the supplementary agreement is in force, Tourism Ireland will be accountable to the two Governments. In our case, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism will be the Minister who will act on behalf of the Government in this regard. I emphasise that this Bill and these arrangements are being put in place solely on a temporary basis in the interests of good order and good corporate governance and in order to deal with the range of routine administrative decisions which are required by the North-South bodies. This will allow them to continue with their day to day operational activities as mandated by the NSMC. It is not the intention of the Government that this mechanism should be in place on a long-term basis.</P>
    <P>The North-South bodies have been described as the &ldquo;secret success&rdquo; of the Good Friday Agreement. If so, it is not that anyone has been keeping them a secret but simply that they have been so effective and non-controversial in their activities that they have not been in the spotlight. They deserve our recognition. Having been in operation for nearly three years, the North-South bodies have bedded down very well and currently employ a staff of more than 700 people, drawn from both North and South. Their headquarters and regional offices are located throughout the island. They are based in locations such as Dublin, Belfast, Cork, Derry, Scarriff, Newry, Monaghan, Omagh, Carrick-on-Shannon, Eniskillen, Carlingford and Coleraine.</P>
    <P>In a relatively short space of time they have become a vital part of the social and economic fabric of the island. The extent of their combined budgets, over &euro;140 million, demonstrates the breadth of activity which their responsibilities embrace, activities of interest and benefit to all the people on the island. For example, Waterways Ireland, which incorporated the Shannon Erne Waterway Committee and now manages all the navigable inland waterways on the island, hosted a highly successful world canals conference held in Dublin, Belfast and Lisburn and is currently establishing a new permanent headquarters in Enniskillen. It has also completed a major navigation project in Limerick, which allows cruisers to travel from the top of the Erne navigation all the way to the Shannon Estuary.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Promotion Board, with headquarters in Cork city, has been running an important television advertising campaign, pro<Col N="58" /> moting the safe preparation of food and the health issues involved. It also provided a very useful all-island helpline during the foot and mouth disease outbreak.</P>
    <P>The trade and business development body, InterTrade Ireland, whose impressive headquarters were opened by the Tánaiste in Newry earlier this year, is tasked with improving cross-Border trade. As part of this work, it recently launched its equity network programme, which stimulates the use of private equity and venture capital as a means to accelerate business growth in the SME sector, and Focus and Fusion, two cross-Border graduate placement programmes. InterTrade also continues to make a valuable contribution to work on enhancing all-island competitiveness. The special EU programmes body, based in Belfast, Omagh and Monaghan, has just launched the new INTERREG programme in Newry last week. It is also the managing authority responsible for the ongoing delivery of the PEACE 2 programmes, worth over &euro;700 million to the people of Northern Ireland and the Border region.</P>
    <P>Foras na Gaeilge, the Irish language agency of the languages body which took over the responsibilities of Bord na Gaeilge on an island-wide basis, published a parliamentary dictionary, which was launched both in this House and at Stormont, a few months ago. It has also had good success with its major all-island marketing campaign, which attracted thousands of calls to the agency. It commenced work on producing a modern, high quality English-Irish dictionary and is leading a consultation process on the steps necessary for a review of the official standard of written Irish. The Ulster Scots Agency of that body successfully launched a series of informative leaflets on the Ulster Scots heritage in America and made a number of successful presentations on Ulster Scots in the United States. It has also hosted a conference of Ulster Scots organisations in County Antrim. The Loughs Agency of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission, which has replaced the Foyle Fisheries Commission, is developing an impressive interpretative centre at its newly built headquarters at Prehen in Derry.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the importance of the tourism industry for the economy, and Tourism Ireland's overseas promotional campaigns are undoubtedly critical to the success and development of this key industry throughout the whole island at a time of challenge and change in the global tourism market. Tourism Ireland was a major exhibitor at the World Travel Market Trade Show in London this month, attended by my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. These six implementation bodies and the all-island tourism company are true pioneers. They brokered a new way of doing business together on this island. In mutually defined areas, where a co-operative approach makes the best sense, we are now united in bringing forward key <Col N="59" /> policy initiatives, taking decisions together, pooling resources and sharing expertise.</P>
    <P>However, the bodies have not just had practical successes. They also play an important role in the normalisation of relationships on the island by bringing together colleagues and board members from North and South, by demonstrating the advantages of working together and by providing an enhanced and jointly-delivered service to the public. They make a unique contribution to the erosion of historic fears and suspicions, of the negative mindsets and narrow ways of thinking that can hold back progress on the wider implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>This is also an opportunity to acknowledge the vital contribution made by the chairs, vice-chairs and other board members who serve on the implementation bodies and Tourism Ireland. The members of the boards, who are drawn from all traditions on the island, are to be commended for the extent of their commitment to the North-South bodies and for the professional manner in which they have discharged their important responsibilities. The achievements of the bodies prove the merit of the principles enshrined in the Agreement, principles of equality, partnership and respect. Their very existence demonstrates that the trust and confidence which we are currently seeking to re-establish in the wider process is attainable and deliverable.</P>
    <P>We are currently addressing a situation where trust and confidence has been badly eroded. The key to moving forward now will be the re-establishment of that hard-won trust. This is a challenge which cannot be met purely by the determination of the two Governments alone. It is one to which all of us who subscribe to the fundamental principles and purpose of the Agreement must rise. The House will be aware that round table talks, chaired by the two Governments, were convened in Stormont last Thursday, 21 November. I assure the House that these talks were in no way the opening of a renegotiation of the Agreement which remains our only template. The two Governments felt it was important to get all those who subscribed to the Agreement in the first place back around the table to begin to address the key issues of confidence and trust in an open, constructive and collective way. The Good Friday Agreement was a collective endeavour. Therefore, there needs to be a collective effort to tackle the current impasse.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about the challenge we face and, as I told the House recently, time is of the essence in the context of the forthcoming Assembly elections in Northern Ireland. All the parties will need to engage fully on all the issues to facilitate the progress that we all want to see. An encouraging start was made at the round table talks. There was complete agreement that the Good Friday Agreement remained the template for political progress in Northern Ireland. While some parties identified the destabilising effects of paramilitary activity as the key issue that needed <Col N="60" /> to be addressed, others pointed to the need for full implementation of the residual areas of the Agreement. In my view, these are not mutually exclusive positions. The political realities are that the continued operations of paramilitary organisations, both republican and loyalist, have created a crisis of confidence. Equally, however, experience has shown that this issue cannot be effectively addressed without an enabling political context, that is, full implementation of the Agreement in all its aspects.</P>
    <P>It was agreed on Thursday that there is now a compelling need to fast-forward progress in all these outstanding areas. On the basis of the discussion to date and papers submitted by some parties, the two Governments are now preparing a comprehensive agenda for the next round table meeting, which will take place in Belfast this Thursday, again co-chaired by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State. While the approach to addressing the outstanding issues should be both collective and comprehensive, it need not be lengthy. It is, after all, about reaffirming the Agreement and rededicating ourselves to the values, principles and commitments it contained. With the necessary political will and the required intensive engagement, which are already in evidence, it will be possible to resolve the current difficulties and restore the Northern Ireland institutions in sufficient time for the scheduled Assembly elections on 1 May 2003.</P>
    <P>One thing is clear, there must be no turning back on the agenda for positive change which the Agreement represents. The North-South bodies are an intrinsic part of that new landscape which the Agreement has helped to create. This legislation will safeguard their achievements to date and ensure that the bodies can continue to carry out their important functions, protecting jobs, funding and services for the whole island. It will thereby guarantee that the North-South bodies are in a strong position to continue to play their part in ensuring the full implementation of the Agreement and in particular its strand 2 provisions on North-South co-operation.</P>
    <P>One of the great opportunities created by the Agreement is the potential for enhanced North-South co-operation. Held back for too long by suspicion, the perception that it cloaked a hidden agenda and that it was some sort of stalking horse for political or constitutional change, co-operation between North and South, within the context of the Agreement and as exemplified by the bodies, is now part of everyday life on this island. Before suspension, the North-South Ministerial Council had held 65 successful meetings in locations all over the island, largely without a whisper of controversy, protest or dissent.</P>
    <P>Ulster Unionist Ministers have played a full and productive role in that inclusive process, as indeed have Nationalist Ministers, with cross-community participation and support a vital, built-in feature of every meeting and decision. Four of those meetings were in plenary session, which I co-chaired with David Trimble and <Col N="61" /> Seamus Mallon, and subsequently of course with Mark Durkan, and which were attended by the Government and our colleagues in the Northern Ireland Executive. I am saddened that the NSMC cannot meet at present and I greatly look forward to renewed meetings of the Council, including attending the next plenary, following the restoration of the Assembly. I look forward to resuming that mutually beneficial partnership with Unionist and Nationalist Ministers.</P>
    <P>When I addressed the inaugural NSMC plenary meeting in Armagh, nearly three years ago, I began by saying that it was a day quite unlike any other. It was true to say so at that time, but one of the great achievements of the peace process has been that we have had many days like that one. The fact that council meetings have become commonplace, even routine, does not make them any less significant or valuable and the same holds true for the North-South bodies.</P>
    <P>The commitment of the two Governments to the Good Friday Agreement remains resolute. It was never going to be a short haul trip. We have only one route map and there is only one journey. There were bound to be significant obstacles and setbacks along the journey, bearing in mind its newness. As I have said before, a setback becomes a terminal crisis only if we allow it to happen. However serious the difficulties, we have worked to overcome similar problems in the past and we are determined, with the continued support of the House, to overcome them in the future. Despite the current difficulties and the persistent efforts of some to undermine it, the Agreement continues to be supported by a considerable majority of the people of the North. I was struck by a recent poll to this effect carried out by the US consulate in Belfast which suggested that 66% of northern people think the political parties there should continue to operate within the Agreement. If we can secure the acts of completion that it is accepted are essential, we can move forward with confidence and without the hesitations and disruptions of the past. Our goal is to recapture the optimism and hope of the Agreement and to ensure that we will come to accept and appreciate the principles of partnership, fairness and equality on which it is based.

      <P>I would like to share time with Deputy Gay Mitchell, with the agreement of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this critical and timely Bill, which my party will support fully. It is particularly welcome in light of the betrayal and erosion of trust and confidence inflicted on the fragile political process in Northern Ireland recently. There is a clear message to those who are ambivalent about the Good Friday Agreement &ndash; the hopes and aspirations of this generation, not to mention future generations, will be ended if the political process and the numerous initiatives provided for in the Agreement are immobilised. Those who <Col N="62" /> have suffered so much were within an inch of having it all. This is especially true of the poor on both sides of the conflict, caught miserably in the trap of intergenerational disadvantage sprung in the dog-days of Teebane, Loughinisland and Moneygall. Immobilising the process would paralyse their hopes, aspirations and once wild, but almost realised, dreams of a better, more prosperous, peaceful and peaceable existence. They know that jobs, more money, better homes, equal opportunity, better education and the chance of university and a fulfilling degree will bite the dust if we do not continue with the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>There are, as we know, those in Northern Ireland for whom the Good Friday Agreement was like a meteor falling from the sky. They knew, at an instinctive level, that the Agreement could and would end forever their hereditary economic and social superiority, their higher caste status and the legitimacy and currency of the &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; cant. Their instinct is shared, ironically, albeit differently, by the greener than green brigade &ndash; their polar and infinitely poorer opposites. The Agreement and all it facilitates is a diabolical enterprise for these bible-belters and bombers, whose objections to the new-fangled ideas of peace, shared prosperity and, God forbid, partnership hold the people and the process to ransom. With innuendo and vitriol they whittle the stake that will kill it, by peddling half-truths and untruths and by stalling, posturing, beating, threatening and killing. Such tactics did the job for 30 years and in their minds, who says it will not do it for 30 more? Those of us who represent pro-Agreement parties are charged with ensuring that they cannot stall the process and that their tactics do not work. This Bill and its implications must, therefore, be enacted speedily.</P>
    <P>Members are aware that the Good Friday Agreement provided for enhanced co-operation in six main areas: transport, agriculture, education, health, the environment and tourism. It was agreed that a number of bodies, including Waterways Ireland, the Food Safety Promotion Board, the Special EU Programmes Body, the North-South Language Body and the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission, would implement the policies agreed by the North-South Ministerial Council. In addition, Tourism Ireland, a limited company publicly owned by Bord Fáilte and the NITB, markets this island as an international tourism destination. Having served as Minister for Tourism and Trade in the rainbow coalition, I do not doubt the great successes that have been and can yet be achieved by enhanced co-operation in this lucrative if struggling area. The implementation bodies have enormous potential to deliver greater understanding of, participation between, and prosperity and efficiency to the people of all areas of the island of Ireland. After generations of defining what divides us, we have begun to look courageously and with real hope at what beneficially we have in common.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" />It is not long since a visit to Belfast was seen by people in the South as something akin to an expedition to the polar regions and the North remained <i>terra incognita</i> for thousands of us. Names like Crossmaglen, the Droppin' Well, the Bogside, Divis and the Creggan, as well as terms like internment and the B-specials, conspired to keep us at a discreet and safe distance, although it is not as if we did not wonder. As a result of black and white television, the vast majority of people in the Republic agreed that it was terrible up there. The advent of colour television showed that it was worse than we had imagined. Although people felt like they would like to do something, or more accurately that something should be done, they were not quite sure what measures were needed. Thankfully, all parties, including Fine Gael, played their part in the process that led to the Good Friday Agreement. The Agreement means that we know more and that our knowledge is of a better quality. We no longer rely on reports of bombings, riots and killings for our information about the North. The work of bodies like the joint business council of IBEC and the CBI managed to make Northern Ireland a home for hundreds of small and medium-sized enterprises.</P>
    <P>Broader public knowledge of the North received a great boost from a most unlikely source in the shape of the foot and mouth disease. The people of the North were seen on our television screens for the first time in two generations not as Protestants, Catholics, Unionists, Nationalists or republicans, but as farmers, farmers' wives and children, vets inspecting sheep and cattle and anxious neighbours obeying quarantine regulations but worried about, and offering support to, their friends up the road. Last year's foot and mouth disease outbreak marked a watershed in North-South relations, to the extent that the Centre for Cross Border Studies commissioned the first independent study of it. The report called for an all-island expert advisory group to be convened, modelled on the group that successfully advised the Minister, Deputy Walsh, last year. The new group would become active in the event of a future animal health emergency affecting the island as a whole.</P>
    <P>Critically for our purposes, the report identified a number of key advantages in tackling animal health issues on an all-island basis. It recommended the use of the natural water barrier around this island as a means of containing an outbreak and preventing future emergencies. It advocated harmonising identity systems for all animals on a North-South basis as an effective means of tracing animal movements. As Deputies are aware, this has traditionally been a problematic area. The report proposed that record systems be put in place to facilitate mutual access across the Border. Most critically of all, the report found that the co-operation between the Department of Agriculture and Food here and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Develop<Col N="64" /> ment in the North was very effective in containing the disease. It operated at the highest level, to the extent of a joint team of officials travelling to England to interview a particular livestock dealer. The political process and, by extension this Bill, are all about such matters &ndash; co-operating to improve life and enhance opportunity for all the people of the island.</P>
    <P>I want to discuss the key areas of health and education. There are mutual gains to be made in the health sector. Under the North-South Ministerial Council, the stated co-operative areas are accident and emergency planning, high-tech equipment, cancer research and health promotion. The Food Safety Promotion Board is also relevant in this regard. I spoke last week in Monaghan about the potential of co-operative health ventures between Enniskillen and Monaghan, especially given the disgraceful abandonment by the Government of Monaghan General Hospital. As I speak, families from Monaghan are protesting outside the gates of Leinster House. There is a collaborative opportunity in this case, although we must take into account research published last year that failed to find strong evidence that concentrating acute hospital services on a cross-Border basis, specifically for economy of scale purposes, would significantly enhance benefits to patients.</P>
    <P>In April 2001 the CCBS concluded that while collaborative opportunity existed in the area of health, greater clarity was needed about the precise objective of improving North-South co-operation in this area and on the obstacles standing in the way of such improvement. Those obstacles include problematic separate registration of medical personnel, university accreditation, the mix of private and public health care, jurisdictional differences in health policy, cross-Border costs and currency fluctuations, the necessity of choosing one development site over another where two jurisdictions are involved and, critically, medical defence insurance, which is funded privately here but provided by the health authorities in the North.</P>
    <P>The advantages of co-operation, however, are myriad. The Border region is a natural geographic entity. That said, its border status has created disadvantage. Collaboration would address the relative disadvantage. The CCBS noted too that health threats do not obey political boundaries. Surely co-operation is not only desirable but highly advisable. There are further observations on universal best practice, improved emergency response and better planning, all of which I agree with.</P>
    <P>Apart from health, education must surely be acted upon with some political alacrity. Here, the well paid spin machine talks about our highly educated workforce and our stellar standards of learning and application. The figures and people's individual stories tell it differently. Twenty-five per cent of our adult population have problems with basic literacy &ndash; they find it difficult to write a letter, follow written directions or, more worry<Col N="65" /> ingly, understand the instructions and dosage on prescription medication. This is hardly surprising when on the waning cusp of the tiger boom more than 100 primary schools are rat-infested, 2,000 young people leave school every year with no qualifications and 8,000 children never even make it to secondary school. The education system in Northern Ireland has been, to put it bluntly, dangerously discriminatory. The eleven-plus is a perennially thorny problem. If one goes the wrong school in the wrong neighbourhood one risks being ghettoised for life. It is only marginally better here. Only 7% of people in Ballyfermot make it to third level education; in Foxrock it is 77%.</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland's so-called learning poor have learned well, and in a remarkably short time, just how much they have to lose if the process goes off track. All over Northern Ireland people on both sides of the divide know exactly what Thomas Davis had in mind when he said &ldquo;Educate, that you may be free&rdquo;. I am pleased to see that co-operative ventures include education for children with special needs. I trust this will include children of all ages and that we will not see a cross-Border version of the Sinnott or O'Donoghue cases. Educational underachievement, teacher qualifications and cross-Border youth exchanges should have a powerful impact on people North and South. A scheme involving children from the Shankill and the people of Shankill, County Dublin is proving extraordinarily successful and I look forward to more of the same.</P>
    <P>Our universities are also collaborating more, some of them under the INTERREG programme. I am particularly interested in the joint research venture between UCC and Queen's in the area of biomedical science. This project looks at the biological phenomena and mechanisms which cause the neurodegeneration that results in Alzheimer's disease. The outcome is expected to provide a greater understanding of what causes Alzheimer's, with a view to developing treatments to ameliorate its devastating symptoms. UCC has a further collaborative project with Queen's and the University of Ulster at Coleraine on the topical subject of coastal resources and climate change. Many of the senior professors in universities here feel the way forward for Ireland and for the future of job creation is through research, development, innovation and patenting. I am glad to see that the traditional isolation of the universities has been broken down and there is a far greater degree of co-operation between these educational facilities.</P>
    <P>Topical, too, is the area of currency. Just two years ago, well into initiatives such as the IBEC-CBI Joint Business Council, a survey by the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland found that three out of four businesses polled identified exchange rate risks as the biggest barrier to North-South trade. It is worth noting that at the time, net exports from the Republic to Switzerland were greater in volume than total exports to <Col N="66" /> Northern Ireland. Last week I spoke to a businessman in the Border area who told me that after the advent of the euro it was now easier for him to do business with people in Central Europe than with the people a few miles up the road. The euro has serious implications for business in and with Northern Ireland and it must be looked at as a matter of urgency. How does one explain to an American investor, totally preoccupied with efficiency and getting the best possible bang for his or her buck, that we are trading as an all-island entity but he or she will have to deal in two different currencies?</P>
    <P>So, yes, we fully support this Bill. It will be of critical import in areas as diverse as the environment, all-island consequences, the CAP reforms and transport and infrastructure &ndash; the latter floored here by Deputy McCreevy's Estimates last week. Right now the institutions are suspended but their work must be facilitated and ensured. The strategic guile of the anti-Agreement forces can and will destabilise the lives and the very future of the hundreds of thousands of people of all creeds who want more, who want better and who want it now. This Bill will see to it, in part, that such guile is overcome. The Good Friday Agreement is not perfect. It is a compromise, so by its nature it cannot be. It is there, however, and as a compromise between idealism and pragmatism for the sake of the people it must be worked fully. Fine Gael welcomes this Bill. It will facilitate the working of the institutions and therefore of the Good Friday Agreement, which remains our best and our only hope.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my party leader Deputy Kenny in supporting this Bill and I am grateful to him for giving me time to speak. I read with interest the comments and writings in recent days of Paul Murphy MP, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, particularly his comments on policing and his article in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning. I was pleased to note the credit he has given to the SDLP for its contribution at Weston Park to the movement in policing. It is extraordinary for those of us who grew up with the B Specials and the RUC to see the progress that has been made in the Northern Ireland police service and the useful proposals from the SDLP. If this progress continues it will be one of the great achievements of the Good Friday Agreement. Given where the proposals came from and the progress that has been made, if the institutional supervision which has been put in place north of the Border comes to fruition, we should consider it as a model to follow here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resulting from an innovation of some Members of the House, together with the Garda Commissioner, in which I was involved, we have prototypes of partnership boards in inner city communities involving the Garda, public representatives and the local community. Perhaps it is time for us to move this on so that at a micro level as well as a macro level there is accountability and exchange between the communities, <Col N="67" /> public representatives and the Garda at senior level. My experience so far is that it is welcomed by the Garda Síochána. It gives the force an opportunity to engage and, sometimes, to break down prejudice and unfair comment that arises because of its duties. The Taoiseach should look further than a Garda inspectorate, although it is welcome and timely, to see how there can be more structured contact between the community and gardaí and how we might learn from what is happening in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>While Sinn Féin participates in elections to Westminster, the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Oireachtas, the same does not apply to the SDLP, which contests Westminster and Assembly elections. Only from time to time does it have representation in the Oireachtas. It is a pity there is not a strong voice for the SDLP in Seanad Éireann. Given the Sinn Féin presence in the House, and it has a mandate and I say nothing derogatory about that, the great work done by the SDLP should be recognised. Dr. Garret FitzGerald wrote about this at some length in <i>The Irish Times </i>on Saturday. If a vacancy arises in the future, the opportunity should be taken to facilitate an SDLP presence in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>If paramilitarism permanently disappears in Northern Ireland, there is a possibility for further innovation. We should expand on what I have already said about the SDLP in the Oireachtas and think how we might engage with the institutions in Northern Ireland. I had the honour of studying politics at Queen's University Belfast. Following a referendum some years ago, graduates from beyond the National University of Ireland and Trinity College can be elected to the Seanad. At the time we were thinking of graduates of DCU, Dublin Institute of Technology and other institutes of technology. Will the Taoiseach consider the possibility of extending such legislation to allow graduates of Queens University and the University of Ulster to vote in Seanad elections? It might be controversial for some but for others it would be welcome.</P>
    <P>While at Queen's University, I was struck by the access available to Nationalists. In Ballyfermot, in my constituency, there is 7% participation in third level education, while in Foxrock participation is 77%. In parts of my constituency flat complexes as large as sizeable villages have never had a university graduate. In Northern Ireland the minority has been given increasing access to third level education but that has not been the case here. These are issues we can learn from through the North-South bodies.</P>
    <P>When we think of discrimination, we are inclined to look north of the Border. Perhaps it is now time to look at the experience of Northern Ireland and visit some of the outrageous elements of institutionalised apartheid in the Republic. Apartheid is the only word that describes it. It is clear that where a person lives, as was the case in Northern Ireland, determines attendance at third level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" />Medical care displays similar characteristics of apartheid, not just at secondary level where people can pay, but at the primary level, with the wealthy given the medical card while those in poverty, afraid to turn on a heater or to light a fire at home because they cannot afford it, cannot afford to take a child to the doctor. That is institutionalised apartheid. Did we not learn from Northern Ireland how these issues can erupt into street violence? We need to learn from things that have happened in Northern Ireland before they get out of hand here.</P>
    <P>The possibility of devolving justice issues, in certain circumstances, to the Executive and Assembly in Northern Ireland has been mooted in recent days &ndash; the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland refers to it in <i>The Irish Times</i> today. If we could reach that stage it would be a welcome development. We in the South, however, would not dream of sharing Government with Sinn Féin in the current circumstances. We are a sovereign Government and we deal with justice and defence issues. It would be unacceptable for P. O'Neill or his colleague to sit at the Cabinet table when there is a military organisation attached to the party. We should not expect people in Northern Ireland to accept anything different. We have gone along with fudge until now, and that fudge was justified to get people around the table, but if important affairs of state such as justice and security are to be devolved to the Northern Ireland Executive, Sinn Féin cannot expect that someone representing the military wing can sit in such an Executive. There is a time and place for things to come to an end and it is now time that P. O'Neill and the organisation for which he speaks retired.</P>
    <P>As Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs, I was invited to address the Committee of the Centre in Belfast on the day the two DUP Ministers resigned from the Executive. The committee covers the offices of the First and Deputy First Ministers and it was exploring with the Scottish Assembly, Westminster and the Oireachtas how it might improve its supervision of Ministers in relation to European affairs. This is an area where there could be greater co-operation, not just at ministerial level, or between the Assembly and the Oireachtas, but between the assemblies and parliaments on these islands. We could examine how we, as parliamentarians, might take a greater interest in closing the democratic deficit, one of the major issues being considered by the Convention on the Future of Europe.</P>
    <P>Westminster has an advanced system for supervision and I envy its staffing arrangements. Progress has been made in arrangements for the Oireachtas committee, but I still find it exhausting to carry out the duties without even one extra assistant. There is, however, room for us to co-operate on a North-South and east-west basis to see how we can influence the European agenda and hold Ministers to account. We are collectively different from the rest of Europe in that we are <Col N="69" /> not part of the Schengen Agreement and part of the common travel area. I was struck recently by the facilities being made available to Kaliningrad and Russia for travel through Lithuania on a lesser document than a passport. Politicians collectively should put their minds to deciding how those of us who live in the British-Irish common travel area might do away with this &ldquo;foreignness&rdquo; we have to the rest of the European Union whereby we must carry a passport going into the Union. We should try to build on the Kaliningrad precedent and perhaps find a lesser document than a passport which could be used when travelling throughout the European Union.</P>
    <P>During my term as Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1992-93, I was the first Lord Mayor in ten years to go north of the Border. I was received courteously by the Lord Mayor who was interpreted as saying that he would welcome me as he would any foreigner. The man said, in fact, he would welcome me as he would any lord mayor of a foreign city. I was surprised at the reaction from the Unionist community. I received many letters for a long time afterwards from members of the Unionist community who were offended at how they felt I was treated, even though I was treated quite well on a private basis. That taught me there are reasonable people north of the Border who are not spoken for by the extremists and, however mild the extreme comments, do not want to be associated with them. As soon as that Lord Mayor's successor &ndash; a Unionist &ndash; came into office, he immediately came south and invited me north, therefore we had two visits within ten years. He did so to make amends at the behest of the Unionist community. We sometimes get the impression that anyone north of the Border who dares to have as their aspiration unity with Britain, to which he or she is entitled, is of an extremist or bigoted nature, which is not the case. Perhaps we might learn to reflect on how we see the Unionist minority on the island of Ireland and learn to treat them equally with respect, dignity and consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which I believe all Members of the House would prefer we did not have to enact, as the legislation is a direct consequence of the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly on 14 October last. There was some hope when the Assembly was suspended that the period of suspension would be relatively short and that it might be possible to secure restoration within a matter of weeks, as happened previously. Clearly that will not now happen. There are fundamental problems in Northern Ireland which need to be addressed. It seems to be recognised in the general consensus among the two Governments and the parties in Northern Ireland that we now need an all out effort to deal with all the underlying problems that form an obstacle to political progress and that have undermined confidence in the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" />These talks began last week and there is little likelihood of their successful conclusion prior to Christmas. The Taoiseach expressed the hope in the Dáil last Wednesday that the talks would be successfully concluded by the end of February. Given the painfully slow rate of progress in talks on Northern Ireland previously, this may be an optimistic scenario. It is important that we take the legislative measures necessary to protect the position of the various cross-Border bodies established under the Agreement and that have been operating with some success, as the Taoiseach said. What we all hope will be the temporary suspension of the Assembly should not lead to the suspension, even temporarily, of other bodies operating successfully under the umbrella of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>It must be a frustrating experience for those who put so much effort into negotiating the Good Friday Agreement in the first instance and who have spent so much time overcoming the difficulties and obstacles that have continually arisen, as well as for ordinary people who have invested so much hope, that the momentum towards political progress in Northern Ireland should be continually interrupted by crisis after crisis. I am sure when all parties signed up to the Agreement in April 1998, neither Prime Minister Blair nor the Taoiseach believed that more than four years on it would still be taking up so much of their time. Too often over the past four years it seemed to have been a case of two steps forward and one step back or even, on some occasions, one step forward and two steps back.</P>
    <P>We must never lose sight, however, of what has been the primary achievement of the Good Friday Agreement, that it has brought a degree of peace, albeit flawed and imperfect peace, not experienced in Northern Ireland over the previous 30 years. The passage of time can dull the memory to the horrors inflicted on Northern Ireland over such a long period. Just a decade ago, in 1992, 91 people died in politically motivated violence arising from the Northern conflict. In January, eight Protestant workers were murdered in a sectarian massacre at Teebane. In April, 15 year old Danielle Carter was among three people who died at the hands of IRA bombers in London. In February, 18 year old Peter Magee was one of five Catholics murdered when the UFF opened up on a betting shop in the Ormeau Road. Loyalist and republic paramilitaries came close to achieving a balance of terror in that bleak year, with 39 people murdered by loyalists and 42 by republicans.</P>
    <P>There is still violence in Northern Ireland. One death from politically motivated violence is a death too many, but the fact is that were it not for the Good Friday Agreement many more people would have died. For this, above all other reasons, we must put every possible effort into maintaining and strengthening the Good Friday Agreement. There is no viable alternative to the Good Friday Agreement and its commitment to equality and mutual respect as the basis of <Col N="71" /> relationships within Northern Ireland, between North and South and between these islands. No one has come up with a realistic alternative to the Agreement and there can be no attempt to renegotiate it. The general approach of seeking to deal with all outstanding issues arising from the Agreement in the talks now taking place is the correct one. We must end the stop start approach and remove the instability and uncertainty. Most of all, we must end the series of crises that have bedevilled the process from almost the beginning and replace it with stability and certainty.</P>
    <P>Primary responsibility for what sometimes seems like the endless cycle of crises rests with the republican movement and the Unionist parties. If the momentum is now to be restored we need a clear and unconditional demonstration from the republican movement of its absolute and unequivocal commitment to exclusively peaceful and democratic means of advancing its political objectives. The joint statement issued by the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair on 14 October put it clearly when it stated:</P>
    <P>It must be clear that the transition from violence to exclusively peaceful and democratic means, which has been ongoing since the Agreement, and indeed before, is being brought to an unambiguous and definitive conclusion.</P>
    <P>This is all the more essential in light of the extraordinary decision of the IRA to withdraw its co-operation from the de Chastelain commission and a number of recent incidents and arrests, North and South, including the conviction earlier this month of an active member of Sinn Féin from Cork on serious arms charges. No one can be allowed to take an each-way bet on democracy. One cannot choose to be a democrat one day and revert to terrorism the next.</P>
    <P>Following the IRA ceasefire in 1994, there was general acceptance that the republican movement would need time and space to make the transition from violence to democracy. There was an understanding that the leadership was committed to moving towards full participation in the democratic system, but that it would require time to convince the slower learners among the republican movement. Anyone who understands anything about our political history knew it would take time and that there would be slippage and problems. There were times when we all bit our lips and remained silent, when there were harsh things crying out to be said, simply because we did not want to lose sight of the big prize. The Taoiseach put it in his unique way last Wednesday during Question Time when referring to the continued involvement of the republican movement in paramilitary activities. He said: &ldquo;All of us have managed to stretch our minds to a position where we can tolerate that, if not like it, providing we can get to a closure on it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" />It would be churlish not to acknowledge the remarkable progress made by Sinn Féin under the leadership of Mr. Gerry Adams and Mr. Martin McGuinness. It seems that they are also on the verge of another historic decision, by members of Sinn Féin taking their place in the new policing system in Northern Ireland. However, the time has also come to say &ldquo;enough is enough&rdquo;. The republican movement has had the time and it has got the space. Others have made sufficient allowances. It is now time for the republican movement to make up its mind. It is its turn to repay the trust put in it and the allowances made, by showing that the transition referred to in the joint statement by the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair is to be completed.</P>
    <P>At the same time, there is a requirement for the Ulster Unionist Party to accept that in the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland it will be a requirement, for the foreseeable future, to have the sort of institutionalised power-sharing provided for in the Good Friday Agreement. It also needs to show that, providing all parties live up to their obligations under the Agreement, Ulster Unionism will work the institutions to the full and they will be allowed to proceed, free from the threat of collapse every few months.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for consistency in the approach of the Ulster Unionist Party to terrorist organisations and their political wings. Loyalist paramilitary organisations that have subjected many Nationalist areas to a prolonged period of siege and attack during the past year do not appear to have come in for anything like the same degree of constant criticism as the IRA has from Mr. David Trimble and his colleagues. Representatives of the two main Unionist parties apparently had no difficulty in sitting down with the same loyalist paramilitary organisations during a recent conference in South Africa.</P>
    <P>In making these criticisms of Unionism, however, all who support the Good Friday Agreement must ask why Unionist support for the Agreement has fallen steadily since the referendum in 1998 and how this trend can be reversed. Part of the reason for the collapse in support among Unionists is the failure to deliver on decommissioning, which was to have been completed within two years of the Agreement. It has also been undermined by the reported involvement of republicans in the unexplained events in Columbia, the convictions of republicans for arms smuggling from Florida, long after the ceasefire and the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, and the convincing reports suggesting continued involvement in crime and paramilitary actions. These genuine Unionist concerns must be addressed, not just by statements, but also by demonstrable action on the part of the republican movement.</P>
    <P>The concerns among Nationalists about the perceived lack of enthusiasm for the Agreement among Unionists must be addressed, not just by statements, but by demonstrable actions on its <Col N="73" /> part also. It is important that we take all possible steps to preserve and protect the progress made to date under the Good Friday Agreement. The operation of the North-South implementation bodies is one such area of progress. Whether you approach the constitutional issue from the perspective of a Nationalist or a Unionist, a joint North-South approach in regard to areas like tourism or inland waterways makes commercial sense.</P>
    <P>The implementation bodies are answerable, under the terms of the Agreement, to the North-South Ministerial Council. However, as a result of the suspension of the Executive, the North-South Ministerial Council cannot function. Without the legislation before us, the implementation bodies would become, in effect, political orphans. This would place in jeopardy many of the major programmes of work already under way as well as the jobs of the 700 people employed by the various bodies.</P>
    <P>Bodies like these can play a significant role in increasing North-South understanding. If the recent unfortunate comments on the nature of this State by the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, Mr. David Trimble, proved anything, it was that we need to promote a better understanding of life on both sides of the Border. When meeting members of the Unionist community in Northern Ireland, I am often struck by how few have ever travelled south of the Border. In the same way, there are huge numbers of citizens of the Republic who have never had any real contact with Unionist people. Increased understanding and tolerance has to be a two-way process. The cross-Border bodies can help in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are two legal issues in the Bill to which I draw attention. The Labour Party has decided, in the interests of maintaining our supportive approach, not to submit amendments but, nonetheless, I highlight these matters for the purpose of obtaining clarification.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises suspension, which hitherto was not recognised legally. It recognises that the Northern Ireland institutions have been suspended and provides accordingly for the continuation of the North-South bodies which will continue to exist as accountable to the two Governments. My party's basic position is that the Good Friday Agreement binds all participants and no one can opt out. That is why we want to hold Sinn Féin, the IRA and loyalists to their decommissioning obligations, why we want to see the IRA and other terrorist organisations close up shop and why we want to see the institutions re-instated.</P>
    <P>The suspension of the Northern Ireland institutions, however, comes to us via the Northern Ireland Act, 2001, passed at Westminster without agreement from the Irish Government. It was arguably necessary legislation at a pragmatic level, but it was unilateral legislation &ndash; ultimately, unilateralism is not the way forward to full implementation of the Agreement.</P>

      <Col N="74" />At the time, while Government and Opposition did not condemn the Northern Ireland Act, 2001, as illegal, neither was the legality of that approach accepted. It would have been much better if the matter could have been dealt with by way of bilateral agreement which would have preserved the agreed legal basis for dealing with Northern Ireland. It is important that we do not accept the legality of any unilateral move to interfere with the Agreement, even one as arguably pragmatically necessary as the suspension of power. The Labour Party sees this Bill as simply recognising the suspension of the institutions <i>de</i><i>facto</i>, not as a <i>de jure</i> acceptance of the legality of that suspension.</P>
    <P>My next point concerns the timing of the re-instatement of the institutions. The Bill provides that the Act will cease to be in force on the earliest practicable date after the restoration of the institutions. This seems unduly vague as the agreement of 19 November 2002 set out in the Schedule provides that it will terminate on a definite date, namely, when notifications are exchanged. Why can this Bill not cease to have effect on that date? That would seem clearer, although I assume this is the intention of the Taoiseach, even though not stated expressly. I put these points on the record while making clear that the Labour Party will be supporting this Bill and facilitating its speedy enactment.</P>

      <P>I speak on this Bill on behalf of Sinn Féin, but under strong protest. This legislation should not be before the House. It is necessitated by the unilateral suspension of the All-Ireland Ministerial Council, inclusive Executive and Assembly by the British Government. That Government gave itself powers under suspension legislation passed at Westminster, powers that form no part of the Good Friday Agreement but that have been used, once again, to dismantle the political structures which the people of Ireland supported by referendum in 1998.</P>
      <P>The British-Irish Agreement of 1998 was a bilateral agreement between two Governments and was a key part of the Good Friday Agreement negotiated between the two Governments and the political parties. I stress that the British Government has acted unilaterally in suspending the institutions and has thereby undermined the Good Friday Agreement. I regret the Irish Government accepted that unilateral suspension meekly and with only token dissent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the Government to represent the national interest. This suspension is clearly against Irish interests. Behind the diplomatic language of the exchange of letters repro<Col N="75" /> duced in the Bill is something with which we are all too familiar &ndash; bad faith on the part of the British Government. Unfortunately we are equally familiar with weary acceptance of that bad faith on the part of the Irish Government. It is time we saw a much more robust approach. Let it not be forgotten that the Good Friday Agreement is every bit as important to the citizens of this jurisdiction as it is to citizens in the Six Counties. The people of this State made changes to fundamental articles of the Constitution. The <i>quid pro quo</i> for those changes was the very institutions that have been suspended by the British government. Moreover, there was the expectation that the Good Friday Agreement would allow all the people who share this island the opportunity to shape our political destinies together, without the negative veto of the British Government-Unionist axis. Yet it is this axis that has thwarted the wishes of the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is how republicans view the present situation. We will make every effort to help resolve the impasse but we have no illusions about the cause of the difficulties. On 21 September the Ulster Unionist Council passed an anti-Agreement motion. The resolution, hammered out between Mr. David Trimble and Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson, was meant to dismantle the Agreement and it is, as I have described it before, a wreckers' charter. The resolution does not even mention the Good Friday Agreement. It seeks the exclusion of Sinn Féin from the Executive and the rolling back of such policing reform as has already taken place. This was the real reason the suspension was declared unilaterally by the British Government. It could not countenance the Ulster Unionist Party and Mr. David Trimble being clearly seen as responsible for the crisis, hence the contrived collapse of the Executive with the raid on the Sinn Féin office in Stormont and a wave of propaganda on both sides of the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>Last week an initial round table meeting between the parties and the Governments took place in Belfast. Sinn Féin made clear then, and reiterates here, this process of renewed talks cannot and must not be a re-negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement. I welcome and appreciate the response the Taoiseach gave to this question in the House last week when he accepted and reiterated that very important point. The negotiations must centre on the restoration of the institutions and the full implementation of the Agreement across the range of outstanding issues. These include policing, the equality agenda, human rights issues, the courts and the judiciary and, very importantly, demilitarisation.</P>
    <P>Since my election to the Dáil in 1997, I have felt a special responsibility to the communities in the Six Counties, especially those in South Armagh, which endure continuing occupation by the British army and its massive military infrastructure. It is a disgrace and a scandal that, five years on, the people of that area and other areas in the <Col N="76" /> North of Ireland still endure this military occupation, and in some cases it has actually increased. The British Government is in breach of its responsibilities and commitments. The Irish Government must do much more to end the plight of these communities. It is not enough to offer concern and platitudes &ndash; these communities need real delivery.</P>
    <P>The British Government, and principally Mr. Tony Blair, made a number of commitments to deliver on a process of rolling demilitarisation and other matters, but it has failed to deliver on them. Successive British Secretaries of State have excused their failure to deliver on commitments citing the likely impact on Unionism of any further movement. We have to challenge this and question whether new commitments will be subject to the same pressures from Unionism. After this negotiation will we find the same excuses being trotted out to excuse further failures and inaction? Despite the historic distrust between Irish republicans and any British Government, there was a widely held view that it was willing to take risks for peace and that we could do business with it. This view has been seriously undermined. I want to refute the impression given about the further policing legislation published by the British Government yesterday.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Rabbitte's contribution earlier and noted what he had to say. This legislation imposes a significant new restriction on the ability of the Police Ombudsman to root out human rights abusers within the PSNI. The Police Act prevented the Policing Board from being the accountable mechanism envisaged by the Patten report. It gave the PSNI Chief Constable the power to refuse the board information relevant to wrongdoing by members of the PSNI. The legislation published yesterday missed the opportunity to put the Patten report on policing back on track. Instead the restrictions on the policing board I have described have now been extended to the Ombudsman and doubly undermine the accountability structures recommended in the Patten report. The RUC Special Branch remains a powerful force within the PSNI. We do not yet have the new beginning to policing promised in the Good Friday Agreement. The Patten report has not been implemented and, regretfully, yesterday's legislation was a further disappointment and a missed opportunity.</P>
    <P>Tá an Foras Teanga luaite sa Bhille seo agus ba mhaith liom díomá a chur in iúl maidir leis na gearrtha siar ag an Rialtas seo ar bhuiséad an Fhorais. I am deeply disappointed at the Government's 11% cut in the budget of Foras na Gaeilge, part of an Foras Teanga, published in the Estimates. In the context of the difficulties of the Agreement and the implementation bodies this Bill addresses, this was a particularly regrettable move.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin will not oppose the passage of this Bill; the party understands the important function it is designed to address. My party does this under the strongest protest. This is legislation we should <Col N="77" /> not have had to address. It is imperative that the Government takes further and concerted action in view of the repeat debacle provided by the British Government and the UUP.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa a rá freisin go bhfuil díomá orm go bhfuil an Bille seo os ár gcomhair amach. The Green Party supports the passage of this Bill as a necessity to maintain the operation of the institutions, in so far as the cross-Border bodies are concerned. We hope this Bill will be as short in its operation as it is in length.</P>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an leanúnachas atá taobh thiar de na hinstitiúidí Thuaidh-Theas ar an oileán seo ar fad. Tá sé tábhachtach ar go leor bealaí go bhfuil na hinstitiúidí ann, ní amháin ar mhaithe le síocháin ach ar mhaithe le heacnamaíocht agus comhshaol na tíre.</P>
      <P>The North-South institutions are important for all of us. They are as important for the Green Party in this jurisdiction as they are for the Green Party in Northern Ireland, the Scottish Green Party and the Green Party in England and Wales. In 1981 and 1982, when the Green Party was set up in this jurisdiction and north of the Border, respectively, one of our first policies was to adopt a joint approach towards the crisis in Northern Ireland. That approach was similar to the template for the Good Friday Agreement in that it stressed the three strands which are part of the Agreement. It also stressed the need for a voting system which would work towards consensus. Unfortunately, the Good Friday Agreement was not able to deliver that.</P>
      <P>While we acknowledge that the Agreement is a well crafted document, it is not a panacea. That must be recognised by people who celebrate the Agreement but who fail to understand that it is nothing more than a beginning and that we must all work at it. It is worrying that it copperfastens the reality of division in Northern Ireland, but we must work to overcome that. There is no substitute in the Agreement for continuous hard work and support for many of the community groups and bodies which seek to overcome sectarian divisions in areas such as education. Bodies, such as Educate Together, Co-operation North and others promote visits in the North and the South, as Deputy Rabbitte said.</P>
      <P>Although the referendum on the peace process was carried overwhelmingly in this country, referenda in other jurisdictions have sparked conflict. The former Yugoslavia is an example of where referenda started conflict as well as tried to end it. We hope, pray and plead that there will be full decommissioning of weapons and that demilitarisation on all sides will take place because it is a constant cause of conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must take initiatives, but this is not the time for cross-Border bodies to do so. This is an exercise in marking time. We must give the Assembly time and space to get up and running again. One way to exacerbate the situation is to assume that the all-Ireland bodies are intact and can, therefore, work as if the Assembly is still operating. <Col N="78" /> However, that is not the case. I would like to know what level of consultation has taken place with the Unionist parties about this Bill and the continuation of the all-Ireland bodies. We must show that there is still a level of mutual respect across the political divide which will not be exacerbated by the continuation of the all-Ireland bodies. It is important to send a strong message that the all-Ireland bodies are not a Nationalist concession or an attempt by one side to lord it over the other. They are a practical and vital part of our common interest, north and south of the Border.</P>
    <P>The sinking of the <i>Prestige</i> tanker shows that when there is doubt about who takes responsibility for problems as well as day-to-day issues, the situation can become more disastrous than it should. The Unionists should remember the benefits of the cross-Border bodies. The former Senator, Sam McAughtry, often talked about how the fire brigades from Dublin went to the rescue of the people in Belfast who suffered during the blitz in the Second World War. It should be clear that there is a practical reason beyond politics or any historical traditions which are part of the conflict in Northern Ireland for the existence of such cross-Border bodies. That message should be clearly emphasised.</P>
    <P>During the foot and mouth disease every person in the North and the South had to co-operate to avoid an all-Ireland catastrophe. There is no reason for complacency. It is also important from a tourism point of view. Years ago people from other countries thought the whole country was engulfed in conflict. The same is true of Nigeria today. If one sympathises with Nigerians over what is happening in their country, they will say they do not know what one is talking about because the part of the country in which they live is peaceful. The international perception of this island is that it is a small place where everyone lives side by side. It is difficult for people to recognise that there are different parts to the island. However, we must respect the fact there are different parts to it.</P>
    <P>The establishment of institutions, such as Waterways Ireland, is a common sense approach. Rivers, such as the Rhine, the Rhone and the Danube are managed by catchment area bodies. When water flows through a number of jurisdictions, a common administrative body must be set up to take account of the problems which can affect different jurisdictions. The cross-Border bodies were established to try to avoid problems and to assist people.</P>
    <P>Many people feel overwhelmed and alone, such as the Irish speaking communities in the North and the South. The cutbacks, to which Deputy Ó Caoláin referred, highlight that further. The Ulster Scots community also feels overwhelmed. Perhaps in our diversity, particularly our language diversity, we can appreciate our common cause. The spirit of agreement in the Good Friday Agreement is that we will learn from each other and thereby raise the standards on both sides of <Col N="79" /> the Border through our collective efforts. We must always respect diversity and make decisions which allow and respect difference rather than polarise dissent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I, and the majority of right thinking people on the island of Ireland, regret the necessity for the Bill. Our overriding concern should be to ensure that, irrespective of the length of the enforced period of suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly, the continuity of the North-South Ministerial Council and the implementation bodies should be held as sacrosanct. The current period of suspension should not continue indefinitely. We should regard it as an imperative to nurture the all-island institutions in the absence of the Northern Ireland Assembly. A significant measure of the level of achievement of the North's institutions lies in the fact that it is quietly assumed by all sides in the North, including the more pragmatic members of Ian Paisley's DUP party, that the current suspension of the Assembly is a temporary arrangement and that the institutions are merely in temporary hibernation. Hence the necessity for the Bill, the purpose of which is to amend the 1999 British-Irish Agreement Act to enable the British and Irish Governments to jointly take decisions relating to the island's implementation bodies.</P>
      <P>Prior to the Assembly's suspension, we had the spectacle of balanced or reciprocal brinkmanship by both the IRA and hard-line Unionists. Both groups viewed each other with jaundiced eyes as each waited for the other to blink first. The North's power sharing institutions were in grave danger of being destabilised due to the depressing failure to agree on policy issues of police reform, IRA disarmament and demilitarisation by the British Army and the fledgling PSNI. It is incomprehensible that consensus cannot be reached by all sides without constant retreat into the sectarian mire. Even former First Minister Trimble managed to succumb to this tendency during his recent sojourn in the USA. The stark fact is that a political vacuum exists in the North and this Bill will ensure the vacuum is not filled by the men of violence on both sides. That can also be precluded by simultaneous action from the IRA, Britain and loyalist paramilitary groups. The IRA should make a clear and unambiguous demonstration of its commitment to disarmament and lasting peace, Britain should demonstrably scale down and indicate the eventual withdrawal of its military presence in the North, particularly in Nationalist areas, and all loyalist paramilitary groups should disarm. The removal of all conceivable threats to the fragile peace process would make possible the restoration of the Northern Assembly and the various institutions and the prospect of a real and lasting peace would be a reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, the North-South Ministerial Council has aimed to develop consultation, co-operation and <Col N="80" /> action within the island of Ireland on matters of mutual interest. Its work covers 12 sectors, not merely the six North-South bodies, but six others which operate through existing agencies in each jurisdiction. The principal areas for which the council has responsibility include strategic planning and cross-Border development of transport; discussion of the Common Agricultural Policy and North-South research and development in agriculture; special needs education, under-achievement, accreditation of teaching qualifications and youth and teacher cross-Border exchanges; research into environmental protection, water quality management and waste management in a cross-Border context; marketing of island of Ireland tourism overseas by a company publicly owned by Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board; and, in health, my personal principal area of concern, accident and emergency planning, emergency services, co-operation on high-technology equipment, cancer research, health promotion and the food safety promotion board.</P>
    <P>The co-operation and working together initiative, or CAWT, was launched in 1992 and involves the Southern and Western Health and Social Services Board in the North and the North-Western and North-Eastern Health Boards in the South. The principal aim of CAWT is to work for health gain and social well-being in the Border area. CAWT was involved in specific projects such as the CAWT region population health profile, the GP out-of-hours initiative, the Craigavon and Monaghan hospital partnership and an all-Ireland working group under the auspices of the North-South Ministerial Council. Under the British-Irish agreement, the two Governments must fully implement the CAWT initiative in the interests of cross-Border co-operation in the area of quality health care. A gaping void exists in the area of acute emergency services on both sides of the Border and my wish is for the CAWT initiative to be further developed to provide a meaningful level of service to Border communities.</P>
    <P>In the area of economic co-operation there is enormous scope for mutual efficiency and competitiveness gains through North-South co-ordination by the two Governments. Co-operation should take place in the development of telecommunications infrastructure, facilitation of cross-Border labour mobility, promotion of energy efficiency, development of transport infrastructure, development of an all-island energy market, development of joint research and development projects and in the promotion of life-long learning by various institutions.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement and all the institutions which stemmed from it have been described as the only game in town and they have provided a bright new day, not merely for the North, but for all Ireland. The implementation bodies and their subsidiaries have contributed to the improvement and normalisation of relations together with the enhancement of mutual confidence and respect. Last week's round table talks <Col N="81" /> at Stormont demonstrated the virtually unanimous agreement that the way forward lies in the complete implementation of the Agreement. Under this Bill, both Governments will continue to operate the institutions under the Agreement and will maintain them in trust, as it were, until the Assembly is restored. I have no doubt they will be worthy of that trust.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt.</P>
      <P>Coming from the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body meeting at the weekend, it is with relief that I observe this Bill being brought before the House. It continues to move things that have already been started. We would prefer not to have to come to the House to take power from where it should reside, which is the message I want to convey tonight. All politics should be local and that needs to be the case again as soon as possible. This legislation should be only a temporary provision and the real power should go back to where it belongs.</P>
      <P>I look at this in the context of the number of cross-Border activities in which I am involved. I am involved in the north-west region crossBorder group and when we had local issues to raise with Ministers, Derry City Council, Limavady Borough Council and the Strabane District Council had much in common with the Donegal County Council. We had successful meetings with many Ministers across the political spectrum and at the first few I wondered if I would be a help or a hindrance coming from the Republic. I found that local Ministers were extremely competent and I would like to see these meetings resume. It is important the progress that has been made is maintained and continued and I was very happy to hear the Secretary of State, Paul Murphy, say that 22 Bills have been brought from the Executive to Westminster to ensure they are progressed. I was also pleased to hear him say this is not the way he wants to see things done. He does not want to scrutinise these Bills in this way when they would get better scrutiny from the people directly concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see the Taoiseach here tonight. It is essential the revision of the Foyle Fishery Act, 1952, is progressed as soon as possible. I live on the Foyle and many of my votes come from the fishermen who use it. There is no licensing of aquaculture and we rely on the goodwill of people to manage the fishery. There have been successful years with mussels and oysters, but it would be far better to put in place a proper management structure under licence. I ask the Taoiseach to ensure this legislation is progressed. I would prefer if it were dealt with locally, but it is six or seven years in the offing and we cannot afford to allow these circumstances to obtain <i>ad infinitum.</i> The legislation should be ready and the institutions should be up and running to allow the Bill to be passed by the Assembly before the May <Col N="82" /> election deadline. Whatever has to be done the elections must not be deferred.</P>
    <P>The locks agency in the Foyle has had a chequered history between fishermen and staff but the situation is improving. The people see the progress being made, the plans for the development of marine leisure, sustainable development, aquaculture licences and the interpretative centre. We are probably on a better footing than for a number of years. Given that about 90% of the fishermen using the Foyle are from Donegal this is an important issue for me. Perhaps the Taoiseach would respond to the following question at another time. If we get aquaculture licensing on the Foyle and it comes under the locks agency I am confused as to why the issue of the seabed was not clarified under the Good Friday Agreement. I do not wish to expand on the issue at present but it should be addressed. It makes sense that if the locks agency is dealing with the water that the seabed would also come under the locks agency. I would appreciate a note on that issue at the Taoiseach's convenience.</P>
    <P>The locks agency has a role in relation to the Foyle but it did not lead on a wind farm that was promoted on the mouth of the Foyle. I am not opposed to wind energy but I have to protect those I represent who are fishermen. I am not convinced that this wind farm of 85 30-storey turbines will not have an impact on a river whose tributaries come under European protection. If we have a river which is protected for its substantial salmon stocks I remain to be convinced that 85 30-storey wind farm turbines will not cause adverse affects. The locks agency has asked simple questions. The salmon rely on electromagnetic fields to leave their spawning ground and return. If they pass this wind turbine and the electricity it is exuding, will it interfere with the magnetic fields? The promoters of the turbines say they will create a sanctuary effect. If we have a sanctuary effect and the smolts are all gathered around these turbines they will be the victims of bigger fish. Is that a positive part of sustainable development on the Foyle for salmon fisheries?</P>
    <P>I have been informed that the environmental impact assessment will address the issue of fisheries and will provide me with the answers I seek. However, the environmental impact assessment will be concluded in April before the smolts have left their spawning ground. I would like those three issues addressed. If there is a reasonable argument that the salmon fishery will not be adversely affected, that is fair enough. I am not getting those answers or an indication that the issue is being properly addressed.</P>
    <P>At the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body yesterday, Paul Murphy and I asked that a public inquiry into this project be initiated, and we were supported by John Hume. It is important to the north-west as we have only tourism and fishing left. That is why under the trade and business development body I want to see progress in cross-Border trade. As the Taoiseach will be aware another 100 jobs will be lost at Fruit of the Loom <Col N="83" /> before Christmas. Between 60 and 80 jobs were lost there in September. Whatever we can do to progress cross-Border trade should be done. Whatever chance we have with angling tourism measures, our commercial fishermen should not be put out of business over a wind farm from which we are getting nothing. If we got green credits or energy from it that would be a plus. I ask the Taoiseach to take on that issue and have the questions answered. We do not want the locks agency to become redundant due to a lack of co-operation between the Governments. This project has the potential to put the locks agency out of business. There is no point in the agency talking about sustainable development and advancing new plans if it is ruled out by an activity into which we have had no input.</P>
    <P>As chairperson of the committee with responsibility for Gaeltacht affairs I welcome the fact that we have the PEACE II and INTERREG moneys to disperse. I commend Foras na Gaeilge and those involved in the Ulster-Scots language which is also part of the Good Friday Agreement and wish them well.</P>
    <P>We need to get the Executive up and running as soon as possible. The elections must take place on 1 May and many people are working hard to ensure that happens. In areas such as my own there could be far more interaction between the north-west as a unit. Statistics issued during the week show a 29% increase in burglaries in Donegal when the national average is 3%. These issues can and need to be addressed on a cross-Border basis. I do not necessarily want it dealt with by a Minister coming from England but by a person from our own neck of the woods whom we know and to whom we can relate.</P>

      <P>I join in commending this Bill to the House.</P>
      <P>The Good Friday Agreement of 1998 was an historic breakthrough for all the people on this island, both North and South. We all recall the great sense of hope at that time as we looked forward to a new era of peace and reconciliation.</P>
      <P>Since then, we have all been involved in the work of implementing the Agreement and realising its considerable potential. The North-South bodies, which are the subject of the Bill, have played a vital role in this task. The bodies, which have an impressive range of responsibilities from trade and business development to EU Structural Funds to inland waterways, have been one of the undoubted successes of the Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It could also be argued that they have been one of its unheralded successes. This may be a classic example of where no news is good news. The lack of media focus on the bodies is largely a function of their own success in concentrating and delivering on the job in hand. The bodies have a job of work to do and are busy getting on with it. They are concentrating on work, which is of <Col N="84" /> practical and tangible benefit to all of us on the island, both North and South.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Bill is to ensure that such work can continue successfully. Although with the suspension of the Assembly, the North-South Ministerial Council is unable to meet, that does not mean that the work of the bodies does not continue. So vital have the bodies become to the overall well-being of the sectors in which they operate, that one could reasonably say that they must continue. I would cite the example of Tourism Ireland, which is responsible for the overseas marketing of the island of Ireland as a tourism destination. The tourism industry on this island relies on overseas visitors for its survival. We cannot afford to allow the current temporary political setback to hold back the future of an industry which has such importance for the economic well-being of the island. Therefore, it is vital that Tourism Ireland can be allowed to get on with the job of marketing Ireland overseas.</P>
    <P>Another North-South body which is making a valuable contribution to our economic development, is InterTradeIreland, the cross-border trade and business development body. InterTradeIreland is located in Newry, in a purpose-built headquarters which was recently opened by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. In discharging its responsibility for enhancing cross-Border trade on this island, the body has put in place a number of programmes, including North-South business graduate placement programmes and an equity network programme aimed at boosting growth in the small and medium enterprise sector.</P>
    <P>North-South trade is a growing feature of the island economy. Total trade between North and South has been increasing over the past decade at an average annual rate of almost 10%. Cross-Border trade accounts for approximately 13% of Northern Ireland's total external sales.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a brief comment at the outset of the debate. It is stating the obvious to remind Members that the subject matter of the debate relates to a sitting tribunal of inquiry. In doing so I should like to draw the attention of the House to the position laid down in the tribunals of inquiry Acts whereby the sole member of the tribunal, in consenting to a request for a change in the terms of reference, can do so only where he is satisfied that such an amendment would not prejudice the legal rights of any person who has co-operated with or provided information to the tribunal under its terms of reference. This provision mirrors to a great <Col N="85" /> extent long-standing rulings of this House, two of which are of particular relevance, namely, that Members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him identifiable, as he is defenceless against accusations made under privilege of the House. Another ruling of my predecessor was that there is an onus on Members to avoid if at all possible referring to persons outside the House in a manner which could be construed as being prejudicial to any subsequent investigations which may be deemed necessary by the appropriate authorities. The House is not a court of law and adjudication of aspects of current controversy and any individuals associated therewith under fair and proper procedures rests elsewhere in accordance with the law and not in this House.</P>
      <P>In addition, I remind Members that under Standing Order 56 a matter should not be raised in such an overt manner as to appear to be an attempt by the Oireachtas to encroach on the functions of the courts or a judicial tribunal, and when permission to raise the matter has been granted there will continue to be an onus on Members to avoid if at all possible comment which might affect or prejudice the outcome of proceedings.</P>

      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;instructs the Government to use the powers available to it, under section 1 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1998, to have the Attorney General consult with Mr. Justice Morris with a view to seeking his consent for an amendment to widen the terms of reference by the inclusion of the following paragraph;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(<i>k</i>)&nbsp;The response of the Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Office of the Attorney General and any other relevant State agencies to the allegations arising from the foregoing paragraphs and, in particular, the extent to which they exercised the powers and functions available to them fully, properly and in a timely manner.';</P>
      <P>and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;requests the Attorney General to enter into discussions with the McBrearty Family with <Col N="86" /> a view to meeting their concerns regarding legal costs, through an arrangement similar to that reached between the Minister for Health and Children and the Irish Haemophilia Society in April, 2000 regarding legal representation at the Lindsay Tribunal, so that they can be legally represented for the duration of the Tribunal.</P>
    <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Howlin and O'Sullivan.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the sensitivities and importance of this issue. If the Chair allows me the latitude Deputy Gildea was given the last time this matter was raised in the House I will have plenty of scope.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Labour Party's Private Members' motion tonight is to direct the Government to use the powers available to it to seek the consent of Mr. Justice Morris for a widening of the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry into certain Garda activities in County Donegal and to require the Government to enter into discussions with the McBrearty family to agree acceptable arrangements to enable them to be legally represented for the duration of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Given the seriousness of the allegations, it is unthinkable that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Department, who have overall responsibility for the Garda Síochána, as well as the key State agencies, such as the Office of the Attorney General, should be excluded from the remit of the tribunal. When the Lindsay tribunal was established two years ago to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the infection of haemophiliacs with HIV and hepatitis C, the role of the Minister and the Department of Health and Children was specifically included in the terms of reference of the tribunal. Why should the role of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his Department be immune from examination by the Morris tribunal?</P>
    <P>The second area the Labour Party's Private Members' motion seeks to address is the question of legal representation for the McBrearty family. More than any other group of people, the McBrearty family are at the heart of the Morris inquiry. There is <i>prima facie</i> evidence to suggest that a serious injustice was done to the McBrearty and McConnell families and their relatives over the years since the arrest of Frank McBrearty senior in December 1996 for the murder of a man, Richie Barron, who, it transpires, was not murdered at all.</P>
    <P>There is now a real danger of a double injustice being done if the family is not allowed to be legally represented for the duration of the tribunal. I am confident that at the end of the tribunal, the McBrearty family will be awarded their legal costs. However, it is entirely unreasonable to compel them to produce in advance the large amount of money that would be required to pay lawyers for a tribunal that could run for a number of years, especially when we consider the substan<Col N="87" /> tial financial losses they have already incurred. The Minister, as a senior counsel, knows how expensive senior counsel can be.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party again points to the precedent in the Lindsay tribunal where the Irish Haemophilia Society faced similar problems regarding the funding of its legal team. On that occasion, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, offered money to the society to enable it to meet 75% of the legal costs in advance of any decision by the tribunal on the awarding of legal costs. In a press release on 14 April 2000, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>I think it is important that the Irish Haemophilia Society can participate in this Tribunal. I am delighted and happy that we have arrived at a solution regarding costs, and that the Society now feels that it can take part with confidence in the Tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party motion calls for similar arrangements to be made for the McBrearty family. Government sources have repeatedly suggested that the terms of reference of the tribunal can be changed only if there is a request from Mr. Justice Morris. This is not the case. The consent of Mr. Justice Morris would certainly be required for any change. However, there are specific procedures set out in the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Amendment Act, 1998, which allows the Attorney General, on behalf of the Government, to consult a tribunal to seek its consent for a change in its terms of reference. Mr. Justice Morris was at pains to make this point at the tribunal hearing last week.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party motion, if passed, would instruct the Government to initiate this process of consultation. There is already a precedent for such a consultation. The then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, in October 2001, requested Ms Justice Lindsay to consent to a widening of the terms of reference of her tribunal after she declared that she did not think they were broad enough to cover the role of the multinational drug companies in the infection of more than 260 haemophiliacs with HIV and hepatitis C. On that occasion the present Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, then serving as Attorney General, acted as the go-between, relaying the request of the Minister for Health and Children to Ms Justice Lindsay and her reply to the Minister. Less than a week following the request, Ms Justice Lindsay had replied, declining to extend the terms of reference on the grounds that they would be unfair and unjust to various parties. In the light of the present furore over the Government's failure to deliver its promised inquiry into the role of the multinational drug companies, and the Minister's unhelpful intervention, perhaps in hindsight it would have been better to have amended the terms of reference of the Lindsay tribunal in 2001 and to have got on with pursuing the multinational drug companies <Col N="88" /> and holding them accountable as other countries have successfully done.</P>
    <P>After opening statements by the Morris tribunal inquiry team to the tribunal, Mr. Justice Morris declared on 19 November that he would not be seeking an extension of the existing terms of reference as he did not think it appropriate for him to do so. He said: &ldquo;I would have no business reversing the decision of the people of Ireland&rdquo;. He did, however, sympathise with the financial burden placed on the McBrearty family. A couple of days later in the Dáil the Taoiseach stated that he would not be seeking an extension to the terms of reference either but that he was prepared to consider a request from the tribunal chairman. Neither party to the proceedings was prepared to take the initiative though both appeared willing to move forward if the other moved first.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party motion facilitates a meeting of minds on the matter. It allows the elected representatives of the people to address the issue once more in the Dáil and to vote on it. If adopted, the Labour Party's motion would satisfy the expressed concerns of Mr. Justice Morris about changing the terms of reference and would enable the Attorney General, on behalf of the Government and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to consult with the tribunal chairman to seek to widen the terms of reference and to consult with the McBrearty family with a view to meeting its concerns about the cost of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Unless the terms of reference are widened at this point in time before the substantive work of the tribunal begins, there is a danger that the deliberations of the tribunal could be frustrated and the inquiry run into the sand as has already happened with so many of the individual Garda investigations and internal Garda inquiries to date. Neither justice nor the Exchequer can afford another inconclusive inquiry.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the excellent parliamentary work of my colleague and former spokesperson on justice, Deputy Howlin, and the former Fine Gael spokesperson on justice, Senator Higgins. They did Trojan work for democracy in highlighting the issues and arguing the case for a tribunal of inquiry.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of that tribunal of inquiry, established in March of this year, read like the chapter headings for a macabre, blood-curdling novel. The tragic death of Richie Barron in 1996 and the subsequent Garda investigation gave rise to allegations of cover up, wrongful arrest and detention, harassment of the McBrearty family members and others, planting of explosives and finds of bomb-making equipment, hoax telephone calls, an arson attack on a telecommunications mast and a plethora of internal Garda inquiries and investigations. Each allegation was more bizarre than the next.</P>
    <P>No report of any investigation or inquiry has been revealed publicly to date. Already in the tribunal the opening statements by Peter Charleton <Col N="89" /> SC reveal further startling allegations, namely, that the signature of Frank McBrearty junior confessing to the murder of Richie Barron was forged by a garda, that two gardaí refused to co-operate with the inquiry by assistant commissioner Kevin Carty in regard to their activities on the night of the death of Richie Barron, that two gardaí had killed Mr Barron, and that a garda had pointed a loaded gun in the face of another garda. The allegations are becoming more shocking and more serious by the day.</P>
    <P>In the last analysis the buck stops with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the State agencies. Why was the initial request for the exhumation of the body of Richie Barron not proceeded with by the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, in 1997? Had he granted the exhumation immediately, a murder inquiry and all that followed could have been avoided. The Minster has never satisfactorily answered this question. Why were the 165 Garda summonses against Frank McBrearty withdrawn after years had elapsed? Why has no action been taken by the authorities after the plethora of investigations proved inconclusive? Why were the internal Garda reports allowed to gather dust in the Garda Commissioner's office? Were the Minister and his Department and the Office of the Attorney General apprised of the progress of inquiries, the allegations that abounded and the contents of the inquiry reports? Where was the leadership, the sense of responsibility, the transparency and the accountability?</P>
    <P>Every time the issues of transparency and accountability arise the present Minister and his predecessor loudly proclaim their commitment to a Garda inspectorate. At this stage the proposal has been dusted down at least half a dozen times in the last 18 months. Now the present Minister promises to have the legislation in place by Easter 2003. I will believe it when I see it.</P>
    <P>It is imperative to put in place immediately a set of structures that will restore credibility to the workings of the Garda Síochána. The Garda Síochána was established in 1923 in the middle of the Civil War as a proud force, unique in its time, that would keep the peace not by force of arms but by the strength of its moral authority.</P>
    <P>That sound principle has given quality policing to this country over the last 80 years and through some difficult times. We owe the Garda a lot in recent times. I am keenly aware in my own constituency of the degree to which gardaí have adapted to confront the scourge of drugs in ghettoised urban communities. The partnership between the Garda and the community is everything. If the Garda loses the credibility and trust of the people mayhem will ensue and we will have an ugly society.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believes that it is time for a new beginning, a fresh start and a new partnership with the people. First, however, the unfinished business must be dealt with. The allegations of Garda misconduct and misbehaviour must be <Col N="90" /> addressed fairly and honestly in the Morris tribunal, the Barr tribunal, the reclaim the streets inquiry and other current inquiries. It is nothing short of scandalous that Mr. Justice Barr, who was appointed in May to inquire into the controversial shooting of John Carthy at Abbeylara two and half years ago, has still not been given a suitable premises by the Office of Public Works and cannot carry out his work properly.</P>
    <P>Internal Garda investigations into serious allegations against gardaí must be a thing of the past. There can be no credibility in an internal inquiry in which workmates investigate allegations of misbehaviour by their colleagues. An independent complaints mechanism must be put in place to investigate allegations of Garda wrongdoing. Otherwise we face an increasing number of tribunals of inquiry being established at great expense to the taxpayer. That will almost certainly undermine further the credibility of the Garda.</P>
    <P>There is greater reform required than a new complaints mechanism. In the first instance the Labour Party proposes a new Garda authority with responsibility for the recruitment and maintenance of the Garda Síochána and for the introduction of public accountability into its operations. At local level we propose the establishment of county policing liaison committees. Their function would be to provide a forum of local authority members representing the community and gardaí. They would work together in drawing up local policing plans for their functional areas and would monitor the effectiveness of these plans.</P>
    <P>Finally, we propose the establishment of an office of Garda ombudsman to replace the Garda Complaints Board. The ombudsman would have his or her staff independent of the Garda Síochána and would have the authority to investigate specific complaints and to initiate inquiries or investigations even where no specific complaint has been received.</P>
    <P>It is in the interests of the Garda and the community that the major allegations of the present are fully inquired into, that new structures of accountability and transparency are established and that a fresh partnership is forged with the people. As an essential step towards achieving that goal I urge the Minister to accept the Labour Party's Private Members' motion and to begin the process of widening the terms of reference of the Morris tribunal so that justice can be done and be seen to be done in Donegal.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points that need to be made on the circumstances in which the original motion establishing the tribunal was taken in the Dáil last March. On previous occasions where there were proposals to establish a tribunal under the Tribunals of Inquiry Act, there was extensive discussion between the Government and the Opposition parties with a view to securing broad agreement on the terms of reference. There was extensive consultation with the Opposition parties on the draft terms of reference for both the <Col N="91" /> Flood and the Moriarty tribunals. In the case of the Flood tribunal there were consultations over several days and many drafts were produced and discussed before anything was brought before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There was absolutely no consultation with the Opposition parties on this occasion, although everyone would acknowledge that this is one of the most serious issues ever to have been considered by the Dáil. Not only was there no consultation, but there was little advance notification of the Government's proposals in regard to the proposed terms of reference. The terms of reference were only circulated to Opposition spokespersons late on the night prior to the debate on 28 March. There was little time for the Opposition parties to consult with anybody, or to take advice on their contents.</P>
    <P>It is now clear that the reason for the failure of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consult with the Opposition, or to give adequate notice of the resolution he was going to bring before the House, was because he was determined that whoever was going to be called to account for the shocking events in Donegal during his term of office, it would certainly not be him.</P>
    <P>The shocking allegations read out during the opening statement in the Morris tribunal of what went on when Deputy O'Donoghue was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may go some of the way to explain the enthusiasm with which he fled the Department after the general election. However, he cannot be allowed to evade his political responsibility for the conduct of gardaí and law officers of the State. That is why these terms of reference are seriously flawed and why they must be changed.</P>
    <P>It is unusual but not unprecedented to have a tribunal's terms of reference changed by a resolution of the House. The terms of reference of the Flood tribunal were amended twice and the law was changed on two occasions to allow this to happen. There is no legal impediment to the course we are proposing. All that is lacking is the political will. We have read much about how Deputy McDowell is going to be a reforming Minister, that he will tackle wrongdoing and vested interests and be a champion of the truth. This is the first real test of his bona fides. Is he going to bring down the shutters and ensure that his office while he was Attorney General is to be immune from scrutiny in regard to these matters? Is he going to close ranks and ensure that the record of his predecessor as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not subjected to the scrutiny that it deserves or is he going to do his best to ensure that the full truth emerges? The choice is his.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Costello, for sharing time. I did not expect to be addressing the issue of policing in Donegal again. I recently read the contributions I made by way <Col N="92" /> of parliamentary questions, priority questions, Adjournment debates and substantive motions to this House from when I was appointed party spokesperson on justice in 1999 until the last general election. On every occasion I contributed, I dealt substantively with issues that were a cause of concern in Donegal and that I considered required investigation. My contribution tonight will be of a different order because, finally, such an investigation is under way. However, what we seek is a full investigation, to bring this matter to a conclusion so proper terms of reference, that bring in all relevant parties, can be deemed to be appropriate and all can be assured that the truth &ndash; wherever it leads &ndash; will be investigated and exposed to the full light of day.</P>
      <P>On 20 November 2001 &ndash; almost a year ago to the week &ndash; the Opposition parties in Dáil Éireann tabled an extraordinary motion calling for the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry into Garda conduct in Donegal. That motion, which I helped draft, specifically stated in subsection (<i>g</i>) that the terms of that investigation specifically included, &ldquo;the role of the State, the organs thereof and relevant public bodies and officials in relation to these matters&rdquo;. From the outset, it was deemed to be critical that the State, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and its agents would be included in the scope of these investigations because, as some of the individuals concerned have rightly asserted, they know well what happened to them but it is more important to know how it happened, why and why it was prolonged for years on end.</P>
      <P>During the course of that debate, I said that it was one of the most significant motions to come before that Dáil. The tension of that debate, a year ago this week, underscored the seriousness with which the Members of the House regarded it. The debate ended in a vote and Members will recall the House divided 73 to 72, which in my memory was the closest division of the last Dáil. Of all the issues of substance we debated, none divided the House so evenly. As I said on the night, had there been a free vote, that motion &ndash; including paragraph (<i>g</i>) &ndash; would have been carried overwhelmingly. What was carried the following night when a vote was taken was an amendment in the name of then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, appointing an eminent legal person to conduct an independent review of all relevant papers. Consequent to that decision, Mr. Shane Murphy, SC, began that review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Friday, 22 March 2002, in the dying weeks of the last Dáil, this House debated the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill, 2002, which made changes in the Tribunals of Inquiry Acts to facilitate the holding of a tribunal into all the matters that had been debated for so long in this House relating to Garda activities in Donegal. That Bill, debated in this House &ndash; unusually on a Friday &ndash; was published two days before and passed all Stages within 48 hours of being published without any consultation with Members on this side of the <Col N="93" /> House. All Stages were passed, by guillotine, in three hours on Friday morning. This is one of the most important issues to be debated in this House. The terms by which the Tribunals of Inquiry Acts were to be amended were never debated and serious issues tabled by way of amendment by former Deputy Shatter, then Fine Gael spokesperson on justice, and me were not entertained nor could they be in the time frame allowed &ndash; virtually nothing on Committee Stage and certainly nothing on Report Stage on the day. I commend that debate to the current Minister &ndash; it makes for interesting reading. I do not have the time to quote at length but the case to include the full scrutiny of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the last Minister is worth reading.</P>
    <P>On Thursday, 28 March 2002, six days after the guillotining of the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill, this House debated a motion to finally establish a tribunal of inquiry into the events in Donegal and it was passed. That day, Deputy Shatter tabled an amendment to the motion which read:</P>
    <P>to include in the terms of reference the manner in which the Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda authorities carried out their functional and statutory responsibilities in respect to the matters referred to in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>j</i>).</P>
    <P>In no previous tribunal of inquiry &ndash; and I have been involved in negotiations for many &ndash; has the parent Department been excluded from scrutiny. It was an extraordinary omission &ndash; deliberately and shamefacedly forced through this House in the dying days of the last Dáil by way of guillotine. It is not too late. There is still an opportunity for us to undo that wrong and to address the issues that justice requires us to address. I strongly agree with Deputy Costello that the bona fides of the Minister &ndash; who I believe to be a man of substance and principle &ndash; will be tested by his attitude to this motion. It is well known that many a strong individual has been blinded by the lights of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Minister's predecessor acted like a rabbit caught in those headlights on this matter and others. The test will be whether the Minister can avoid that glare and accept the broadening of the terms of reference as demanded by this motion. I am intrigued and surprised by the Minister's amendment. I am glad there is no outright move to seek to vote down the motion.</P>
    <P>However, the amendment does not give us real scope to ensure this investigation is carried out in a way I believe a majority in this House would really like if that opportunity was open. In his amendment, the Minister notes that &ldquo;the terms of reference place no limitation on the tribunal in respect of the scope of any findings or recommendations it may make, including in relation to any relevant agent of the State&rdquo;. It is true there are no limitations in relation to its findings but is <Col N="94" /> there limitation on the scope of the investigation itself? </P>
    <P>The final sentence of the Minister's amendment states that &ldquo;the House requests the Minister, without prejudice to any request the tribunal may make for an amendment to its terms of reference, to keep under review the need for such consultation in the light of developing circumstances [this is important] and affirms its openness to consider on its merits any proposal by the tribunal to amend the tribunal's terms of reference, notwithstanding any previous decision of the Dáil on the matter&rdquo;. That is a circular argument. The tribunal has already stated, on foot of a formal submission from Mr. McBrearty &ndash; one of the people universally recognised as being at the centre of these matters &ndash; for an extension of the terms of reference. The tribunal has stated its hands are tied inasmuch as the Dáil has spoken on this matter. Yet, the Minister seems to want to bring it back to the tribunal by saying that if the tribunal wishes to have its terms of reference amended, he is open to that. I ask him to be positive and assertive in allowing this amendment to be made and to have the scope broadened. Otherwise, he will give nothing but false hope to people who were hurt grievously in this matter and will avoid the full and proper investigation and ventilation of these matters.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a further point in relation to an issue which will concern every Member of this House. I wish the Oireachtas Commission had been established. I wish this House had its own separate Vote. I wish the recommendations we have talked about for a long time were implemented, including an established Leader of this House, with an independent Vote, to establish the rights of Members of the House which, I strongly believe, have been circumscribed by others over a very long period. In June 2000, I passed on to the then Minister for Justice information I had received from a person known to me concerning the investigation in Donegal. The Minister passed that information to the Garda Commissioner who ordered an inquiry into these matters by an assistant commissioner. Those matters are now subject to the Morris tribunal and I heartily welcome and support a full investigation.</P>
    <P>There is an issue which reaches to the heart of this Parliament and the rights of Members, namely the rights of Members of the Oireachtas to receive information from citizens and the right of those citizens to have their identity protected. Members of the journalist profession hold that right as vitally important. It has already been tested right up to the Supreme Court in relation to the beef tribunal, where whistleblowers gave information to my colleague, former Deputy Dick Spring and to Deputy Rabbitte. That right is very precious to us. It causes me some concern that, in the opening statement of the tribunal, it has set itself the task of &ldquo;attempting to ascertain the author of these facts and any information which would justify the allegations contained therein and, in that regard, to ascertain the identity of <Col N="95" /> such person and to seek his or her assistance with the work of the tribunal&rdquo;. This House needs to have a very clear view of this issue which has direct implications for information received by Members, at clinics or privately, on a wide range of matters as to whether it can be received in confidence. That right goes to the heart of our rights as a parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the cornerstones of civil society that people should feel confident the forces of law and order will deal with each citizen fairly and impartially and that when serious questions are raised in this regard, they will be clearly and comprehensively addressed by the State. This is one of the most serious debates we have had in this House, addressing those questions about the confidence of citizens in the forces of law and order. I support what my colleagues have said about the importance of this tribunal's investigation being absolutely comprehensive, taking in all relevant organs of State, including the ministry, the Attorney General's office and the Garda Síochána. Very serious allegations and questions have been raised but not adequately answered over the years in past investigations. Those matters have not been addressed publicly in any satisfactory way. This debate provides an opportunity to have a fully comprehensive tribunal set up.</P>
      <P>As well as the events in Donegal, other questions have been raised in recent events such as the reclaim the streets parade and in the interim report of the Garda Complaints Board on that incident. Public comments on these issues by gardaí and former gardaí, such as on the Joe Duffy radio programme, raise very serious questions which need to be addressed. Public confidence in the Garda Síochána is of the utmost importance and that was the case until relatively recently. It is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice to ensure those questions are addressed. As my colleague, Deputy Costello, has said, it is possible for the Minister, under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 1998 and in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, to initiate a wider debate with the Morris inquiry. Mr. Justice Morris has indicated that he is carrying out the will and decision of the Oireachtas. I believe the door is open to the Minister to initiate a wider inquiry, as we are advocating in this debate. I urge him to make sure the inquiry is wide enough to give satisfaction, clarity and transparency on all the very serious allegations that have been outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a former member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, I am well aware of the work of my colleague, Deputy Howlin and the former Fine Gael spokesperson and former Deputy, now Senator, Jim Higgins, in trying to bring to light the very serious issues in relation to the McBrearty family in particular. It is regrettable that Deputy Howlin has had to raise the issues he referred to regarding the right &ndash; the duty &ndash; of <Col N="96" /> Members of this House to bring to the appropriate authorities issues properly raised with them as Opposition spokespersons. That very serious issue must be addressed in this debate. I stand over the work of those two colleagues on that committee. They, as well as the public, are owed a full and proper investigation.</P>
    <P>I refer to the other aspect of the motion, the question of the McBrearty family having the opportunity to be properly represented and knowing they will not have an enormous bill at the end of the tribunal. It would be a travesty if that family were not properly represented at the tribunal. It appears at present that this will not be the case. I urge the Minister to intervene. It has been done before, as my colleague Deputy Costello said, and there are precedents. The McBrearty family should be properly represented at the tribunal in the interests of justice, the public at large and our confidence that this is a full, transparent and complete tribunal.</P>
    <P>That is the second part of our motion before the House. I urge the Minister, because he is new to the job, he is someone who has shown the ability to think for himself and use his judgment, to take the opportunity the motion presents to ensure the tribunal includes the relevant organs of the State. We know there have been previous Garda investigations. We do not know what was involved in those investigations or what happened to them. They were brought to the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. They have not been brought before the public in any way that satisfies justice.</P>
    <P>As my colleague Deputy Howlin said, the Government amendment does not close all the doors. It is important that there is absolute clarity on the Government's position before the debate is over.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete all words after &lsquo;That Dáil Éireann' and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;having regard to the resolution passed by it on 28th March 2002, providing for the establishment of a Tribunal under the Tribunal of Inquiry Acts, 1921 to 1998, to inquire urgently into certain matters of urgent public importance relating to complaints concerning some gardaí of the Donegal Division;</P>
      <P>recalling that these matters are based upon the recommendations of an independent review conducted by Mr. Shane Murphy S.C.;</P>
      <P>recognising the authority given by the terms of reference contained in the resolution to the Tribunal to make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit in relation to these matters;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>noting that the terms of reference place no limitation on the Tribunal in respect of the <Col N="97" /> scope of any findings or recommendations it may make, including in relation to any relevant agent of the State;</P>
    <P>acknowledging that the tribunal, while mindful of the views of Dáil Éireann at the time of the passing of the resolution on the scope of the terms of reference, has expressed itself open to arguments or submissions based on evidence on the desirability of seeking an amendment of the terms of reference;</P>
    <P>having regard to the provision in the Tribunal of Inquiry Acts whereby the Tribunal may request such an amendment; and having regard also to the provision in the Tribunal of Inquiry Acts whereby the Tribunal may consent to a proposed amendment, following consultation between the Tribunal and the Attorney General on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform,</P>
    <P>requests the Minister, without prejudice to any request the tribunal may make for an amendment of its terms of reference, to keep under review the need for such consultation in the light of developing circumstances, and affirms its openness to consider on its merits any proposal by the tribunal to amend the tribunal's terms of reference, notwithstanding any previous decision of the Dáil on this issue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the question of the terms of reference of the Morris tribunal. I have many detailed points to make but let me state at the outset that my only ambition is to protect the public interest and to get to the bottom of what really happened in Donegal. Before I go further I wish to commend the tribunal on the work it has done to date. It is clear from the detailed opening statement in Donegal earlier this month that it has a mammoth task ahead, but that already it has a great appreciation of the issues and a clear understanding of the sequence of events.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate what I have said on many occasions and what the Ceann Comhairle has said. It is a matter of grave concern to the Government, as it is no doubt to the members of the Opposition and right-thinking members of the public, that allegations of serious impropriety and wrong-doing have been made against members of the Garda Síochána. I join members of the Opposition in seeking to get a complete picture of events. It is of the utmost importance that the truth is established and that public confidence is restored in the Garda in so far as it has been affected by the events in Donegal. It is particularly important that this is done as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In conducting any debate on the matter at this time, however, I must reiterate the need for caution in what is said on both sides of the House. I do not need to remind all Members that there are a number of criminal and civil cases before the courts which are directly relevant to the questions <Col N="98" /> at hand and the risk of prejudicing those proceedings is great.</P>
    <P>The Morris Tribunal of Inquiry, established on foot of resolutions of both Houses of the Oireachtas, is charged with investigating some of the most serious allegations ever levelled against the Garda Síochána, both in terms of the nature of those allegations, their extent, their implications for the force, and their effect on public confidence on what has long been a valued and trusted institution of the State, an institution which has a central position in our criminal justice system. Its establishment arose from a decision by my predecessor as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to appoint a senior counsel, Shane Murphy, a nominee of the Bar Council not chosen by the Department, to conduct an independent review and undertake a thorough examination of allegations that members of the Garda Síochána in the Donegal Division had engaged in criminal, unethical or unprofessional behaviour, particularly in the context of the investigation into the death of Mr. Richard Barron and finds of bomb-making equipment, to advise on whether all appropriate steps had been taken with due diligence and expedition, and to advise on what further measures, if any, might now be taken to bring to account at the earliest opportunity, so as to address public concerns, those who engaged in criminal, unethical or unprofessional behaviour.</P>
    <P>A key recommendation of Mr. Murphy was the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry, and his report suggested the elements which might go to make up the tribunal's terms of reference. All of Mr. Murphy's suggested elements were incorporated in the terms of reference approved by the resolution of this House of 28 March this year. When my predecessor was faced with the situation that had arisen he sought a nomination from the Bar Council of an independent expert to examine all the issues and come back to him with a report. He suggested in that report that there should be a tribunal of inquiry and suggested the key elements of the terms of reference which were adopted later by the House. It is not the case that my predecessor, Deputy O'Donoghue, decided to cut out, edit or self-exculpate in any sense. The terms of reference put to the House were those which were suggested to my predecessor by an independent and, as my friends put it earlier in the debate, an eminent senior counsel not chosen by my predecessor.</P>
    <P>It is of course open to this House to extend the terms of reference beyond those suggested by Mr. Murphy's report, although at the same time it cannot be lightly overlooked that those suggestions were based on a detailed examination of an extensive volume of documentary and other material, and a careful consideration of the complex issues to which they gave rise. I stop there again to make the point that Mr. Murphy had the advantage over nearly everyone in these Houses of having seen the documentation available to the various organs of State. In those circumstances&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know, but the Minister on this occasion, in the face of a blistering attack that he was trying to avoid a tribunal, asked an independent person to examine the issue. That person fixed the terms of reference by identifying the key elements thereof.</P>

      <P>The Deputy must realise that person was in a far better position than they were to judge the issues they are now canvassing. Nevertheless, it is the responsibility of this House to decide whether there are additional matters which ought to be included in the terms of reference of the tribunal. The tribunals of inquiry Acts specifically envisaged the possibility of such an amendment, which can be made by a resolution of both Houses arising from one of two possible developments. Either the tribunal can, in consultation with the Attorney General acting on behalf of the Minister, consent to a proposed change, or the tribunal can, of its own initiative, request a change. That is the mechanism for changing a tribunal of inquiry's terms of reference. I am not sure that the motion before the House tonight is fully in keeping with that mechanism, but I am not going to quibble over technical details.</P>
      <P>I want instead to address the substance of the proposal. It seeks to include in the terms of reference the response of the Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Office of the Attorney General, and any other relevant State agencies to the allegations contained in the rest of the terms of reference, in particular the extent to which they exercised the powers and functions available to them fully, properly and in a timely manner. To consider the effect, and intention, of this, it is worthwhile looking at the existing terms of reference. I am not going to go through them one by one, but Deputies looking at them will see that, with one exception which I will come to, they deal with specific allegations of serious wrongdoing, identified by Mr. Shane Murphy as warranting investigation by the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tribunal is charged with inquiring into these definite matters of urgent public import<Col N="100" /> ance, reporting to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and making such findings and recommendations as it sees fit in relation to these matters. The last element of the tribunal's responsibilities bears repetition and deserves to be emphasised: the tribunal must make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit in relation to these matters. It seems to me that this element of the tribunal's terms of reference gives it the power to make any findings of relevance to the allegations set out in those terms. In other words, in so far as the tribunal may find wrongdoing on the part of a person in connection with the comprehensive and serious allegations listed in the terms of reference, it can make such findings as it sees fit in relation to the matter, which could certainly, if the evidence so warranted, extend to culpability on the part of any person or agency in contributing to, or neglecting any duty to address, such wrongdoing. The approach of the terms of reference, as approved by the House, is that allegations of wrongdoing are identified and the tribunal is given broad powers to make relevant findings.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of Deputies to the recent proceedings of the tribunal, which are of some significance to this motion. In his recent ruling on an application to vary the terms of reference, Mr. Justice Morris said:</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that I am mindful that the present terms of reference of this tribunal have been debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas, which framed the terms of reference after due deliberation and debate, following which a resolution establishing the tribunal was passed by both Houses. I must have regard to that democratic decision in considering applications of this nature and that it is not appropriate to seek an amendment of the terms of reference unless good grounds exist.</P>
    <P>He continued:</P>
    <P>It is equally clear to me that there may be circumstances in which a tribunal may request an amendment of its terms of reference in accordance with the quoted provisions. If a submission were to be made to the tribunal which the tribunal accepted, or the tribunal determined of its own motion that it could better or more effectively carry out its work by means of extending its terms of reference to include further issues or persons not presently captured within its terms of reference, it could seek an extension. If, by seeking an extension of the terms of reference, the tribunal could thereby secure additional potential material or evidence which would enable it to determine the truth relating to the issues and the facts which have arisen before the tribunal in the course of its work, then it may be appropriate to seek an extension in respect of such issues or persons, particularly if this would help the tribunal to address the issues which are of serious public concern, about allegations that members of An Garda Síochána in the <Col N="101" /> Donegal division engaged in unethical and criminal behaviour and assisting it in fulfilling the task for which it was established. A mere assertion or request for an extension of the terms of reference is not sufficient. As already stated, the tribunal will entertain submissions and argument based on the material and evidence which will be canvassed before the tribunal by any party appearing before it and who wishes to make a submission seeking an extension of the terms of reference. In saying this, I do not wish to preclude myself from exercising the statutory power vested in me to seek an extension of the terms of reference if, at any stage during the course of the tribunal's work, I believe this to be necessary. For the moment, I do not think it is appropriate to act on Mr. Frank McBrearty's assertion because I believe it is too general in its nature and scope and premature in its timing. Mr. Frank McBrearty senior or anybody acting on his behalf may at any stage renew this application in accordance with the procedures which I have indicated.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that it is also open to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to seek, through the Attorney General, to amend the terms of reference of the tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>He can do it primarily through this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make clear that it is not the case that something is being ruled out. The Government is not seeking to pre-empt anything tonight and it is not trying to escape anything. It is simply the case that the Government, for the reasons I have just mentioned, believes the present terms of reference are adequate and appropriate for the purposes of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>The approach taken in this motion is substantially different, in that, so far as I know, no substantive allegations have been made against the persons or agencies sought to be included in the terms of reference. It may be that substantive allegations will be made, but no such allegations have been made so far. I can say without equivocation that any action or inaction of those persons or agencies relevant to any finding of wrongdoing should be determinable by the tribunal, as should any other relevant factor. However, that is what was sought to be achieved by the broad remit given to the tribunal in its power to make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit in relation to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exception I mentioned in the terms of reference, or what might be regarded as an exception, is the reference to the effectiveness of the Garda Síochána's complaints inquiry process <i>vis-à-vis</i> the complaints made by Mr. Frank McBrearty Senior and his family between 1997 and 2001. It must be borne in mind, however, that what is at issue here is, to the extent that it is an exception, an exception that proves the rule. I am at pains to make clear here, as I am on every other matter before the tribunal, that I am not in any <Col N="102" /> way commenting on the substance of the issue, as to the extent to which the statutory system for the investigation of serious complaints made against members of the Garda Síochána worked effectively. I do not see that there is an equally identifiable and specific issue to be addressed in relation to the persons and agencies referred to in the motion. As I have argued, the tribunal has a broad power to make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit, so that such persons and agencies are not immune from adverse findings based on evidence. There is no limitation on the tribunal's scope to find fault.</P>
    <P>The Government's amendment to this motion recognises that this position should be kept under review. I cannot rule out the possibility that there may be a need to change the terms of reference and I have no difficulty with the House calling on me to keep the need for such change under review. Equally, while I know the tribunal is open to considering the case, based on arguments or submissions, for the tribunal to request a change in the terms of reference, I am conscious that the tribunal has indicated that it is mindful of the views expressed by this House when an amendment along the lines contained in this motion was previously rejected by it. It is possible that the tribunal might consider, on evidence, that there is a case for such an amendment, but might hesitate to appear to contradict a clear view of this House. The Government's amendment makes clear that the House is completely open to considering any proposal of the tribunal for change, even if the House has previously considered the matter. The way is left clear, therefore, for any appropriate proposal for change to be brought to the House. I will conscientiously discharge my duty to keep under continuing review the need to initiate consultation with the tribunal, through the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>I must again refer Deputies to legislation in dealing with the second issue in the Labour Party's motion, the question of legal costs for the McBrearty family. The question of costs is governed by the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Acts, 1921 to 2002. The Acts allow a tribunal which is of the opinion that, having regard to its findings and all other relevant matters, there are sufficient reasons rendering it equitable to do so, to order the whole or part of the costs of representation of a person appearing before it to be paid. In other words, it is a matter for a tribunal at the completion of its affairs to make its determination in relation to the issue of costs. Anyone who has read the Salmon report on tribunals of inquiry will appreciate that the general pattern is that those who co-operate with a tribunal in good faith, regardless of whether their evidence is accepted or rejected, or whether they stand condemned or approved in the final analysis, are entitled, in general terms, to their costs. This is because of the imposition that any other practice would place on ordinary citizens.</P>
    <P>There are good reasons a tribunal makes its decision at the end of its deliberations. The Acts <Col N="103" /> make clear that a tribunal can use its power on determining costs to ensure that people fully co-operate with its proceedings. In particular, a tribunal, when determining whether costs should be paid, may take into account failure to co-operate or to provide assistance to, or knowingly giving false or misleading information to, the tribunal. This is a powerful tool but it is a very suitable one, as we have seen in other cases. It would undermine the work of a tribunal if a decision was made to pay costs in advance. Equity requires that all parties to a tribunal be treated equally. Not only would it run counter to the maxim of equity to seek to guarantee the costs of one party in advance, but it would require me to pre-empt the findings of a tribunal and obviate perhaps its greatest power in its search for truth. If I were to select any group of people, however meritorious, for special treatment and pay their costs in advance, regardless of the effect it would have on the capacity of the tribunal to secure co-operation, how could I look in the eye anybody else who told me he or she was in a similar situation? How could I look him in the eye and say &ldquo;No&rdquo;, or tell him that from what I have read in the newspapers I would not be so keen on him? How could I go down the road of saying that some people look to me to be decent so they will get a leg up in terms of costs?</P>

The terms of reference are not only concerned with the individuals of whom the Deputy is speaking. There are many other people, in relation to such things as the planting of false evidence, who feel just as much impugned by the terms of reference of this <Col N="104" /> tribunal. I cannot go down the road of selecting, on an entirely arbitrary basis, some people to be given access to the Exchequer's resources to participate in the tribunal.</P>

His point about the average citizen includes the great majority of the people whose costs may or may not fall to be decided by the tribunal. His very point that the average citizen is at issue here underlines the point I am making, which is that I cannot select one average citizen, as opposed to another average citizen, and tell him he is to get his costs in advance because the Labour Party moved a motion on his behalf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth, after all, is what this tribunal is about. I refer the Deputies to the opening statement of the tribunal, particularly <Col N="105" /> where it referred of the question of truth and lies: &ldquo;One would be closing one's mind to the obvious, or one would be very naive, if after having read these papers one were capable of coming to any other conclusion than that people have lied in relation to virtually every paragraph of the terms of reference.&rdquo; I referred to the fact that the tribunal is facing a mammoth task. In that instance I was referring to the broad and extensive nature of the terms of reference. It is for the tribunal to decide where the truth lies in relation to each of the issues.</P>
      <P>Even if it were open to me to intervene in the matter of costs under the legislation, I would not do so. Let me say clearly and unequivocally that I will not make any determination in advance in relation to guaranteeing individual or party costs, nor will I make any statement to the effect that any individual witness or group of witnesses should get preferential treatment, the consequence of which might be to hamstring the tribunal and lessen the possibility of the truth emerging. While I have every sympathy for the McBrearty family &ndash; I have met Mr. McBrearty privately &ndash; and the financial burden they face, I can only reiterate once more what the tribunal has said in the matter, namely that &ldquo;[a] similar burden will also fall on many other persons who have already been granted legal representation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Finally, on the question of representation generally, it is important to remember that a tribunal is inquisitorial in nature, not adversarial. The onus is on the tribunal, its legal team and its investigators to find out the truth. Legal representation for witnesses is to protect their personal interests, not the public interest. I remain open to the question of using the provisions of the Acts to amend the terms of reference of the tribunal, provided it can be shown that the terms of reference as they stand are deficient or restrictive in some way and cogent arguments are made for any amendment, or if the tribunal considers that an amendment of its terms of reference is necessary or desirable. I am not closing the door on anything. I am indicating that I am not adopting a final or decisive attitude to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my perspective, there is nothing in the existing terms of reference to prevent the Morris tribunal's inquiring, as it sees fit, into the responses of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Office of the Attorney General, the then Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions or any other relevant State agency in relation to the matters of urgent public importance listed in the terms of reference. Somebody wondered here why, if that was the case, a different approach was adopted in relation to the Lindsay tribunal. In that case we were dealing with a registered charity, the Irish Haemophilia Society, which was also an incorporated body. As distinct from what one might gather from today's papers, it was a body whose directors wrote to the Government of the time indicating that they might have to wind up the <Col N="106" /> charity because they were faced with legal liabilities that threatened its viability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a serious matter but I have had nothing but constant barracking. I remain open to consideration of a variation of the terms of this tribunal. I cannot, however, accede to the <Col N="108" /> suggestion about costs. I am motivated in all these matters by the public interest and the Deputies should reflect long and hard on those matters before they suggest otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the core of this discussion is the scrutiny of the interests of those accused and the extent to which their interests might not receive due deference in the absence of costs. What will the public think? The Minister knows that every criminal appearing before the Criminal Court automatically gets legal aid. He can say this is not a similar situation but that is a fact. When the public comes to a conclusion, it will look at that situation.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Labour Party for introducing this motion and giving us an opportunity to discuss these issues, particularly in view of the fact that they have been aired repeatedly in the past six months outside this House, culminating in the establishment of the tribunal. I compliment Senator Jim Higgins and Deputy Howlin for bringing the matter to the attention of the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is a matter of concern, however, that immediately afterwards the Minister, or a person to whom the information had been made known, divulged information given in confidence. That sets a serious precedent for both Government and Opposition. The situation had always prevailed where if the Opposition went to a Minister with a matter of concern and brought it to his or her attention privately, the Minister would investigate. It would not follow that someone known to the Minister would make the information available to those against whom charges were made.</P>
      <P>I see the Minister shaking his head but this will have serious consequences for the behaviour of Government and Opposition. That precedent cannot be changed. If we go to the Government with a complaint internal to a Department and as a result it becomes public knowledge immediately, there is something wrong. The Government can hold all the consultations it wishes about the subject but that is how it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not. Deputies at the time were told that the only way it could be investigated would be if the Minister went to the gardaí with it. The Deputy knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;because this is getting more serious as time goes on. If that is the case, the presumption is that nothing will ever be investigated again because it might offend someone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer briefly to legal representation for the McBrearty family and the need for fair play. The Minister pointed out that he would set a precedent by providing for the legal costs and it <Col N="109" /> could mean he might have to provide for the legal costs of everyone else.</P>

      <P>That is right, he might have to do that eventually. Who will determine if that is the right thing to do? When will it be determined that it is the opportune time to intervene and provide for costs in this case? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The tribunal will do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The chairman of the tribunal has already indicated, and the Minister has told the House, that if the Oireachtas so wished, the terms of reference could be broadened. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have said that if the chairman of the tribunal requests it, the terms of reference may be broadened. We all agree on that. I am concerned, however, about the sequence of events. What will trigger the necessity to introduce payment of the costs? As a certain football commentator says, &ldquo;We will freeze it there&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is a suggestion that when this issue was raised, it implied widespread criticism of the Garda Síochána, but nothing could be further from the truth. It is imperative that the public has absolute and total confidence in the Garda Síochána at all times. In all the actions in which it is involved, the protection of the public and property, it is imperative that the public has full confidence in it. It is equally important that the Garda has full confidence in the public and its representatives in the Oireachtas. It does not follow that when questions are raised, it is automatically treacherous or unchivalrous to raise them in these Houses. That is our job.</P>
      <P>If it transpires there is a need for an inquiry such as the one we are now discussing, then the Minister should not apologise or tend to be defensive in discussing the subject. All that tends to do is to create a further situation whereby a new culture could emerge and the cue could be taken up by people on all sides, including those who are accusing and the accused. These people can simply take their cue from the Minister and say, &ldquo;We have come to the conclusion that the Minister is on our side&rdquo;. We should not go down that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone in the country recognises the huge debt we all owe the gardaí who have put their lives at risk on countless occasions throughout the country over the past 80 years. However, we should never allow ourselves to get into a position where we are afraid to question something that might go wrong. The Minister is raising his eyes to Heaven as if he were bored. This is not a boredom matter, it is a serious matter. It has been aired repeatedly in the public press over the past six to nine months. It is not sufficient to say a tribunal has been set up, therefore the matter is resolved. That is not the case. We should never arrive at a position in the future in regard to any <Col N="110" /> Department, statutory agency or body whereby there is a tendency not to discuss the issue in case someone is offended.</P>
    <P>The Garda Complaints Board has examined in the past incidents such as this. It does not always work because the public does not seem to have full confidence in that process. The gardaí will ask, understandably, why they should give this responsibility to an outside body which does not understand how they operate. It is important, however, to recognise that we live in changing times and we are all under scrutiny. Every aspect of public administration is currently under scrutiny. If we do not allow ourselves to be examined and scrutinised, we will fall into the trap into which many have fallen in the past and further exacerbate the problem. That is not the answer. If we go down that road and become defensive, we will have much more serious problems. The question to which I am referring is whether it is valid to have the gardaí, or any other body for that matter, investigating themselves. The degree to which public confidence supports such a process is highly debatable, particularly as time goes on.</P>
    <P>We need at this time to try to bring the tribunal of inquiry to a conclusion as quickly and effectively as possible. I have concerns about the whole system whereby in the course of an inquiry opening charges are made which are left to hang without rebuttal for a considerable time. This can cause huge difficulties for people, whether the gardaí or anyone else. The occasion for an early rebuttal is not there to the same extent. We all read the opening charges and know what is entailed. It is wrong to allow charges hang in the air for up to two years before the accused person has an opportunity to rebut them. This is not the Minister's fault, but it prevails in most similar tribunals of inquiry.</P>
    <P>The pivotal role the gardaí have played in the past and will undoubtedly play in the future is something we all recognise. However, we should never forget that no one is above reproach or beyond investigation and no one should feel offended or aggrieved in the event of a tribunal such as this taking place. I am quite certain from talking with gardaí that a huge number of them are anxious to have the matter fully investigated and brought to a final conclusion to ensure that not only is justice done but is seen to be done. I hope that will happen. It is imperative that this happens because when a private citizen, whether wealthy or otherwise, has a query or is aggrieved, he or she is as entitled to have his or her case heard as anyone else. It does not matter what the context or coincidences are, the fact remains that a private citizen is entitled to have his or her case fully examined and his or her position vindicated or otherwise during the course of an inquiry of this nature.</P>
    <P>Some of what we read happened in Donegal &ndash; I understand fully these are merely allegations at this stage &ndash; is frightening. I do not know whether the Minister accepts this. If some of what we <Col N="111" /> recently read about actually happened, then there exists quite a serious problem in a particular area. That will remain to be seen but it is imperative that during the course of this inquiry justice is done and is seen to be done and that there is not a situation whereby similar allegations can be made with any justification in the future. There is an opportunity during the course of this tribunal to lay out the ground work whereby there will be no need for Members to come into the House and raise queries with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or any other Minister and it will not be necessary to go down this road again.</P>
    <P>Initially when setting out the terms of reference for the tribunal, there could have been more consultation with the Opposition. It would not have done any harm. The fact that we are the Opposition does not mean we do not have a valid view to put forward. It would not have done any harm to have had a greater degree of consultation with the Opposition on this very sensitive subject. It would be beneficial to whatever Government happens to be in power at a particular time if that were done. I hope in future it might be possible out of the goodness of their hearts if the Government were less defensive and perhaps a little more embracing of the views of the Opposition. It is in the interests of all in this House and those under investigation and scrutiny to ensure everything is done fairly, openly and in the best interests of those directly involved and, above all, that the interests of the general public and the common good is upheld at all times.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to reaching the truth, which is important. At this stage one does not want to pre-empt the outcome or what might happen afterwards. While I recognise the restraints upon us when speaking on the issue at this time, when the conclusions are reached, whatever they may be, I presume everyone will accept the outcome. I presume someone will not go to court to challenge the outcome and that the Minister will ensure the conclusions are then implemented, whatever they may be or in whatever form. I presume also that procedures will be put in place to ensure we do not suffer a repetition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I last addressed the House, I referred to the work of the North-South bodies, in particular, InterTrade Ireland. I was privileged to work alongside the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and her Northern Ireland counterparts in the context of the work of that body and note that cross-Border <Col N="112" /> trade has been growing substantially recently. InterTrade Ireland aims to tap into this potential and to improve the efficiency of the island economy to the benefit of businesses and consumers North and South.</P>
      <P>The supplementary agreement between the Government and the British Government will ensure that the vital work of these and other North-South bodies will continue by ensuring that the bodies have a mechanism which will allow them to receive the necessary approval for their budgets, operating plans and other arrangements. This will allow them to continue to operate successfully and will avoid a situation where they would be prevented from carrying out their important functions to the full as a result of the current temporary political difficulties.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach has pointed out, this Bill is only intended as an interim measure. The focus of effort must be on ensuring that the institutions are restored in full as speedily as possible. In that regard, the work which began last week in Belfast at the round table talks which I attended, which were co-chaired by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Paul Murphy, is of vital importance.</P>
      <P>These talks provided an opportunity for the parties to air their concerns on a wide range of issues. This was my first such meeting and I was encouraged by the commitment of the parties to re-engage and by the widespread agreement that the Good Friday Agreement remained the template for political progress in Northern Ireland. While some parties naturally identified a number of specific issues that need to be tackled, the full implementation of all the remaining areas of the Agreement was discussed. Both positions can be addressed as we continue to work for the overall context in which trust can be restored. It was also agreed to keep up the pace in terms of making progress in all the outstanding areas. I do not underestimate the challenges ahead in terms of restoring trust and confidence among the parties but a good beginning was made last week.</P>
      <P>Following last week's talks, the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke of the need to create an enabling context in which the necessary breakthrough can take place. This began last week and will continue on Thursday when we meet the parties for a second time in Belfast. On the basis of last week's meeting and papers submitted by some parties, the two Governments have prepared a detailed agenda for Thursday's talks and I look forward to the next round of constructive engagement with all those committed to the Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessary political will and the commitment to intensify engagement which have already been displayed, support the view that it will be possible to resolve the current difficulties. In the meantime, to protect and maintain the achievements of the North-South bodies, this Bill is urgently required. Although it has only been possible for me and my colleagues on this <Col N="113" /> occasion to give a brief summary of some of the work of the North-South bodies, I am confident of the support of the House in ranking them as one of the key achievements of the Good Friday Agreement to date. They are worthy of our support for their valuable work and for the important part they play in the development of a new era of trust and co-operation on this island to the benefit of all its people. We must ensure that they are able to continue this work pending the restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly. I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rare debate for a country that sees the national issue as a priority. It is unusual to have a full debate in this House on Northern Ireland and that is a pity. I suggest to the Government, particularly in the months leading up the re-establishment of the institutions in Northern Ireland, that the opportunity is taken to have more full-scale debates on this issue.</P>
      <P>Leaders' questions are taken weekly in the House and my party leader, Deputy Kenny, raises this issue with the Taoiseach when there is an interchange of ideas. However, within the Oireachtas generally, there is a strong body of opinion which is supportive of the need to find a resolution to the problems in Northern Ireland and which is very supportive of the Good Friday Agreement. An opportunity should be given to the Houses of the Oireachtas to give expression to that support.</P>
      <P>My position is best summed up by the motion which I proposed to the British-Irish Interparliamentary body yesterday at its meeting in Manchester. I asked that the body reaffirm its support for the Good Friday Agreement; referred to the fact that it was saddened at the suspension of the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland; welcomed the determination of the two Governments to press ahead with all aspects of the Agreement; called on all political parties to redouble their efforts towards the restoration of the institutions which have benefited the people of these islands; and urged all involved parties to continue their efforts to secure an early resumption of the Northern Ireland institutions.</P>
      <P>That motion could have been characterised as anodyne or equivalent to apple pie or mothers' milk, but it was not. In many ways, the motion encapsulates the only reasonable, logical reaction to the present situation. I say to those who question the Good Friday Agreement without providing an alternative that they are undemocratic in that approach. The Agreement is utterly rooted in its mandate from the Irish people. It is the only show in town, as has been mentioned. The referenda, North and South, produced a large majority in favour and the democratic will of the Irish people is that the Agreement must be implemented. There is no other route to the resolution of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is over four years since the Good Friday Agreement was signed and one has to ask why it has not been fully implemented since then. It <Col N="114" /> must be implemented in full. There is no mandate from the Irish people for any other alternative. There is an overwhelming onus on those who think or talk to the contrary to explain exactly where they stand within the democratic system.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the Agreement was not utterly specific in two areas, policing and decommissioning. Policing was referred to the Patten Commission and decommissioning to the independent International Commission on Decommissioning. Those matters were not referred to those bodies on principle but with regard to implementing the will of the people and the broad principles established in the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>In many ways policing is the key to resolving the current impasse in Northern Ireland. At one stage in this House it was fashionable to criticise the police in Northern Ireland, the RUC was sneered at by some and it was a pity. Even though the RUC was not a perfect body &ndash; what police force is &ndash; it made what efforts it could in virtually impossible circumstances over the past 30 years. That is not the issue now, the issue now is how we look at the revised police force in Northern Ireland. It is important that we appreciate the changes that have been made and the efforts being made by the members of the PSNI to establish normal policing structures. It is important we acknowledge the contribution made by the policing board in making some difficult decisions regarding badges, flags and other symbols. We should start a trend in this State of appreciating the efforts being made on policing.</P>
    <P>If there is to be peace on the streets and neighbourhoods in Northern Ireland the police force will underpin that peace. The police must be accepted by all groups, the community as well as political organisations, if there is to be peace. I point to the issue of Sinn Féin staying off the police board. How can we expect full support for the police from the communities in republican areas when Sinn Féin, that has electoral strength in those areas, does not join the policing board? It is an imperative that Sinn Féin joins the policing board and I urge that it does so. It is a major step that must be taken.</P>
    <P>I commend General de Chastelain on his efforts with the decommissioning body but he can only accept what he is given. His job is to supervise decommissioning and, thankfully, there have been a couple of acts of decommissioning. To be blunt, more than decommissioning is now needed. Those who hold arms must go further than that. Why do they keep these arms? I refer to the IRA in particular but more than it is involved. Whether it is Official, Provisional, Continuity or Real IRA, there are a raft of organisations involved on the republican side. The UDA, LVF, Red Hand Commando and whatever is left of those are on the other side. The Provisional IRA is the key. A commitment was given on decommissioning and while I accept a commission was put in place to deal with the modalities and logistics, it has been four and a half years <Col N="115" /> since that arrangement was made in the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>A two-stage report is now required and it is, to a degree, related to policing. Some of the changes in policing announced at Westminster will cause concern for Unionists. Those concerns would be allayed if the issues of decommissioning and disbandment were dealt with by the IRA. I commend Paul Murphy for his efforts so far, he was constructive in our discussions at the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body in Manchester. The headline over his article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> says it all: &ldquo;North policing issues can be solved if paramilitaries take final step to peace&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is time for paramilitaries in general, and the IRA in particular, to say goodbye. They are redundant. More importantly, arms that remain in their possession are redundant. Why are they keeping them? Are they keeping them as toys or to use them? If we are to believe what they say they have no intention of using them. If that is the case, why hold on to them? The message from the Oireachtas must be to get rid of those arms, but the paramilitary organisations must declare that they will take no further action.</P>
    <P>One could not talk about Northern Ireland without speaking of the punishment attacks that are being carried out. Many attacks are carried out by paramilitaries and over two-thirds have been carried out by loyalist paramilitaries. Many of us were horrified at the barbarity of recent attacks such as the crucifixion of Mr. Harry McCartan. However, it was not the only attack although it may have been the most outrageous. The earlier attack on Mr. Raymond Kelly was appalling and unrelated to any semblance of reason &ndash; there was not even an excuse for it. We must express our revulsion at such barbarity. The IRA has been involved in incidents too, such as the attack on Derry bus driver, Mr. Danny McBrearty. Expressing condemnation and revulsion is not enough, we must point the way forward. The way forward is through policing. Such madmen cannot be stopped without proper policing support. Proper policing support will not happen until communities fully support their action. That is how the issues of policing and punishment attacks are interlinked.</P>
    <P>I recall the discussions leading up to the Anglo-Irish Agreement. One had to work to remove the Unionist veto. The problem with Northern Ireland was that when people were pushed to a reasonable resolution, their answer was to revert to their tribal position and say &ldquo;Ulster says no&rdquo; or &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo;. If we are seeking a resolution in Northern Ireland, we must ensure there is an end to vetoes, embargoes and boycotts.</P>
    <P>We discussed this issue at a recent meeting of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body in Manchester. We feel proud when we think of Captain Boycott, who was a noted resident in Deputy Kenny's constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We availed of a system which became known as the boycott system. A weak and defenceless tenantry which could not cope with the overwhelming power of the landlords was able, through that system, to bring the individual for whom it was named and others to heel. The problem with Northern Ireland is that there have been too many vetoes and boycotts.</P>
      <P>The benefit of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the 1980s was that it removed the veto which brought down Sunningdale. However, there are still a number of boycotts. I mentioned Sinn Féin's boycott of the policing board. Whatever about the effect of the original boycott on Captain Boycott in Mayo in the 19th century, we can do without such boycotts at present in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Unionists have boycotted the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body. It is not that the members of the body have horns. Deputy Kenny and I attended our first meeting of that body in the House of Commons in 1990. Despite the fact that we reserved places on the body for Unionists, they have boycotted it. Why? If they have a case to make, we want to listen. Sometimes we hear their case by proxy. We might hear extreme Tory views which may or may not coincide with those of the Unionists. I want to listen to the Unionists. We do not ignore what they say. I want to debate and engage in dialogue with them. If they have a problem I want to hear about it face to face, not by proxy. That is another boycott we can do without.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach will probably agree that despite the development of North-South relations and of the implementation bodies since the Good Friday Agreement, we could have done without the boycott of the DUP. What was it designed to achieve? We should carry on without vetoes and boycotts. We should be prepared to enter into dialogue and to debate the issues. We should also be prepared to listen and to take on board the concerns of others.</P>
      <P>We are entering a crucial period. Northern Ireland has taken two steps forward and one step back in the 15 years since the Anglo-Irish Agreement came into being. Unfortunately we have now taken another step back, which puts us in a period of uncertainty. How can we move two steps forward again? I am aware of the goodwill of the Governments. I am glad the two Governments can achieve so much working together. However, the parties in Northern Ireland must come up with the end product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there is pressure on the parties in the North with an election due next May. I want the election to be held at that stage. It would be a terrible signal to send if the election was acceler<Col N="117" /> ated or postponed. The election should be held in May if that is the time to hold it. However, the parties must act in good faith in the meantime. Sinn Féin will try to win a few seats from the SDLP and the DUP will try to win seats from the UUP. I want the competition for seats to be contained within a framework of good faith and in the overall interest of Northern Ireland. Let them engage in politicking as they see fit. If all the parties are prepared to act in good faith and do their best to ensure a reasonable solution to the situation in Northern Ireland, then we can move two steps forward. I support the Bill, which is needed as a temporary measure pending the restoration of the institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Roche)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and I strongly commend it to the House. The legislation will amend the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999, and will give domestic effect to the agreements between the British and Irish Governments to establish the North-South bodies as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement. The amendment has been made necessary as a result of the recent and, I hope, temporary suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly. As the Taoiseach explained earlier, this is largely a technical Bill, the purpose of which is to ensure the proper corporate governance and democratic accountability of the North-South bodies and to ensure the bodies have the necessary approval for administrative matters, such as budgets and operating plans for next year.</P>
      <P>The North-South bodies usually operate under the overall direction of the North-South Ministerial Council. The council is one of the most remarkable institutions which bridges all sides of the divide on the island. It is remarkable in that less than a generation ago this institution and the arrangements around it could not have been envisaged. The council brings together Ministers from both parts of the island to develop formal North-South co-operation across an agreed range of sectors. At meetings of the council Ministers from the North and the South take joint decisions on the work of the North-South bodies. It is remarkable, given our history, that this normalisation of relationships should take place. Together these Ministers direct and mandate the work of the bodies and provide necessary approval for their administrative affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly, Northern Ministers have been unable to attend such meetings. As a result, the council has been unable to meet. If that situation was allowed to continue, it would be a tragedy. A remarkable institutional innovation would wither and ultimately die. The Bill provides for the functions of the council in relation to the North-South bodies to be performed by the two Governments <Col N="118" /> on a temporary basis, pending the full restoration of the Northern institutions. This arrangement is formalised by means of a supplementary agreement between the Government and the British Government, which is attached to the Schedule to the Bill. That Schedule allows the bodies to continue their work and avoids the unnecessary situation where they could be left unaccountable to any outside authority.</P>
    <P>The North-South bodies represent a major and remarkable innovation in public administration on this island. As someone who has studied public administration for the best part of three decades, it strikes me that there is not a parallel anywhere to this administrative innovation. Each of the bodies is mandated to carry out its functions throughout the island of Ireland. As such, they are a vital element in the overall settlement reached in the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the arrangement represented a package of measures in which a balance had to be struck between the different goals and desires of all the parties. The Taoiseach referred to that as the silent success of the bodies. It is also a tribute to how well that balance has been struck in the case of the North-South bodies. If one stops and reflects for a mere moment, it is remarkable to consider that these bodies have moved on efficiently with their work, albeit in strict functional, sectoral areas. They have done so in a quiet way that has not attracted any of the rancour one could have expected a few short years ago and they have been very effective in their operations. We should be anxious to protect them because they represent an example of how things can be done as we go forward. The bodies have not, as some might have expected, been the focus of political wrangling and there has been almost no conflict. Instead, they have been a means of delivering practical benefits to the people of Ireland, North and South. The Ministers meeting in the North-South Ministerial Council have learned to work together to provide policy directions to the bodies and the bodies, in turn, have got on with the work they were established to do without histrionics or alarm. They have worked quietly, effectively and efficiently.</P>
    <P>The operation of the bodies on an all-island basis makes sound administrative sense. For example, the recent television advertising campaign to promote food safety is being run by the food safety promotion body on stations North and South. Given the numbers of people on both sides of the Border who live in multi-channel areas, this makes sense and creates a level of synergy which increases the penetration and the effectiveness of the campaign. It may be a slight example of what can be done and of what <Col N="119" /> has been done, but it is with such small and basic steps that you move forward to build progress. This is the pragmatic approach to all-Ireland work which the bodies are carrying out on a daily basis and it is the beneficial effects of such work that this Bill is designed to protect. Considerable resources and effort have been invested in the establishment of these bodies and they have almost 700 employees located in offices throughout the island from Colraine to Cork. That in itself is an example of the remarkable progress that has been made. These staff members have played a crucial role in ensuring the success of the bodies during the establishment phase and they will be vital to the ongoing success of the innovations. This legislation is important to provide support to the staff in terms of motivation and to allay concerns about the future beyond merely allowing them to continue for the present.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to assure the people that the Government is fully committed to the future of these organisations. The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that they are protected and can continue to work. The joint statement issued by the two Governments after the suspension made it clear that though the Assembly is suspended, the Good Friday Agreement is not. It was interesting to listen to the previous contribution in which the point was made again and again that whatever the hiccoughs along the way, the Good Friday Agreement is the path and the map that has the endorsement of the overwhelming majority of the people on this island. It is appropriate therefore that the two Governments jointly expressed their total commitment to the full implementation of the Agreement and to protecting and developing its achievements. It is sad to reflect that not everybody has the same level of commitment to the Agreement, but it is the document that has been endorsed by the people North and South and everybody in political and public life and in the broader community should do everything possible to support it and ensure its full implementation.</P>
    <P>I share the Taoiseach's hope that the Assembly will be restored sooner rather than later which would be in accord with the wishes of the overwhelming majority of thinking and civilised people on the island, North and South. I welcome the progress made at the round table talks last week and the intention of parties to hold further talks later this week. Talking is infinitely better than the alternative. In the interim the North-South bodies must be allowed to continue their important work, which is what this Bill has been introduced to ensure. I join most of the speakers who have contributed in urging full acceptance by the House of the legislation.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this very important legislation. I welcome the fact it is being put in place while regretting that it is necessary due to the temporary suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The great progress we have achieved in recent years is evident from a reading of the Taoiseach's speech of this morning in which he outlined the number of activities and range of work covered by the all-Ireland bodies established as a result of the Good Friday Agreement. Those bodies were given particular remits and they have worked extremely well. In Ulster we are particularly aware of the importance of the special EU programme bodies, Waterways Ireland and the other four all-Ireland bodies. I welcome the determination of the two Governments to ensure that those bodies are given the necessary protection in legislation to enable them to continue with their work. The lack of controversy about them is evidence of their success. Years ago one particular community in the North of Ireland would object in the strongest possible terms to the idea of all-Ireland bodies, but today, thankfully, those bodies go about their work with a 32-county remit, performing on behalf of all Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, said in his closing remarks, the one political parameter we work within in this country is the Good Friday Agreement which was overwhelmingly endorsed in referenda North and South by the people of the whole island. There can be no renegotiation of the Agreement and the bottom line is that it serves as the template for political progress. Deputy O'Keeffe referred earlier to the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body and last night we heard the Secretary of State, Paul Murphy, <Col N="121" /> endorse the remarks of the Taoiseach who stated clearly that there could not be a renegotiation of the Agreement. That is a view to which we all subscribe. I welcome the Taoiseach's assertion that progress was made at the opening of the multi-party talks in Belfast last week and I wish the two Governments and the co-chairmen, Deputy Cowen and Secretary of State Murphy, every success in their endeavours to bring an early and successful conclusion to those talks. The talks are necessary and we hope that all parties to them will approach them in a constructive manner to ensure the obstacles that caused the suspension of the institutions will be removed. They should also ensure that the devolved institutions in the North of Ireland are operational soon. Last week, the Taoiseach stated that he is hopeful that will be achieved by February, which is absolutely essential. Assembly elections are due to take place on 1 May 2003 and politics does not happen in a vacuum. Strife and conflict thrive in a vacuum and we do not need one in our politics, particularly in the North of Ireland. We hope it will be possible to make the institutions operable again and to schedule the Assembly elections on 1 May.</P>
    <P>I am particularly familiar, as is the Ceann Comhairle, with the workings of Waterways Ireland. In the late 1980s due to the foresight and courage of the Fianna Fáil Government of the day, the restoration of the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal was undertaken. Many people throughout this island were totally negative about that proposal, but it was given effect by politicians and it has been an outstanding success.</P>
    <P>It was the first cross-Border project of a substantial nature on this island. I am familiar with it, particularly as it covers my own home area. That project brought a new tourism dimension to the south Fermanagh, west Cavan and south Leitrim area. Waterways Ireland, with its headquarters in Enniskillen, is continuing that work with the making navigable of a further stretch of Lough Allen to Dowra, County Cavan, and it has carried out some further works in County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>One project that will be of great benefit to both North and South is the restoration of the Ulster Canal. All shades of political opinion in the North and South in the counties affected are supportive of that project. At 2000 prices it was a project estimated to cost Stg£89 million. Some economists would tell us that on a cost benefit analysis it would not be a sensible proposition to go ahead with that project. Those same economists told us it was not feasible to proceed with the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal restoration project. I would say to the Taoiseach, the Government and, I hope, to a restored Executive in the North of Ireland, it is one project that should be considered as a priority. It would cover a large area <Col N="122" /> north of the Border and a substantial area south of the Border and it has the potential to create large scale tourism revenue. I hope it can be analysed and supported in the way the Erne-Shannon waterway was supported in the late 1980s in a far less favourable economic climate.</P>
    <P>The restoration of the institutions in the North is essential. There is no place in this country for paramilitarism.</P>

      <P>There is no reason children in east or north Belfast cannot go to their national school without fear each morning. There is no place for that type of thuggery and violence in society. If, as politicians North and South, we wish to implement the will of the people, we have to implement the mandate given to us in May 1998 when the people North and South voted in favour of the Good Friday Agreement. By not implementing that Agreement we are defying the sovereignty of the people. As a State we have always prided ourselves on the fact that the people are sovereign. Our Constitution puts sovereignty in the hands of each individual elector. We have to respect that sovereignty. We have to ensure that will is implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to support this legislation. I regret it has been necessary to bring it forward due to the temporary, I hope, political difficulties that have arisen in recent months. I hope the policing issue can be resolved in the North. I commend the SDLP for its positive attitude and for what was, undoubtedly, a difficult decision to take its place on the policing board. Many of the Patten recommendations on policing have been implemented. We all know there is more to be done and that there are more issues to be addressed. However, with the recent announcement by the Secretary of State and the establishment of the district policing partnership boards, participation on the boards by the Nationalist community in particular can bring about the changes and the progress needed. It is by participating that an organisation or a community can make changes. We all know that policing over the years did not command the support of the Nationalist community in particular. There have been improvements. The appointment of the Chief Constable has been a positive move. The workings of the police board to date have been positive and I would hope with the enactment of the legislation announced by the Secretary of State, Paul Murphy, it will be possible to again make those steps forward to ensure both <Col N="123" /> communities in the North will have confidence in a policing structure. Policing will not be successful in any country if it does not command the confidence of the entire community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF" hpid="Mr. Crowe Mr. Crowe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Boyle and Cowley.</P>
      <P>Sinn Féin welcomes this Bill as a means of ensuring that the important work being carried out by the all-Ireland implementation bodies continues during the current temporary suspension of the institutions in the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>We also welcome the intent signalled in the wording of the letters exchanged by the two Governments that the suspension is of a temporary nature. Combined with the resolve to ensure the continuation of the work of the implementation bodies, this must be seen as evidence of a positive commitment to making sure that the progress made since 1998 is not lost.</P>
      <P>The excellent work being done by the implementation bodies set up under the Good Friday Agreement speaks for itself. Their success and ongoing work shows that the all-Ireland argument has been won and that they are only being held back by the limited scope of the bodies allowed under the original British Irish Agreement.</P>
      <P>The loughs and lights agency, the food authority, language bodies and InterTradelreland have all shown the benefits of all-Ireland structures. Ideally we should be debating how to extend the remit of these bodies and create other new structures such as an all-Ireland energy grid, real co-operation and planning for cross-Border public transport projects, as well as taking practical steps to merge economic development agencies on the island and even preparing for the creation of a single tier health service for all the people on the island. We should be evaluating the work done by these bodies and planning how more can be achieved. We are not doing so because of Unionist back-tracking which was enabled and supported by the British Government.</P>
      <P>That there has been progress is clear. On such issues as animal health precautions against the spread of disease, the situation has certainly advanced. There has also been some useful work in relation to other areas of co-operation where common sense if nothing else dictates that matters be addressed on an all-island basis and not under the ridiculous pretence that Monaghan and Fermanagh are parts of two different countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must, however, qualify the support which we are giving to the Bill. While the British Government is making clear its formal commitment to ensuring that the positive aspects of the Good Friday Agreement are continued, the actions of <Col N="124" /> its armed agents on the ground paint a different picture.</P>
    <P>Recently I hosted a visit by a group of children from the Short Strand to Tallaght. Following a visit I made to the area where I was appalled by the conditions under which Nationalist residents of that part of Belfast are forced to live, I was delighted to help to give some of these children a day out where they could relax and enjoy themselves. I am sad to report that following their return to Belfast they were under siege for the next week.</P>
    <P>The reason communities like the Short Strand and others are under assault is because Unionist paramilitaries see this as a means to destabilise the Agreement. In doing so they are following a similar agenda to those Unionist politicians who have consistently frustrated the implementation of the Agreement. It is the stated aim and the clear responsibility of the British Government to ensure that Unionist violence does not go unchecked and yet we have seen little evidence of its commitment to bringing it to an end. One resident of the Short Strand told me she was driven to phoning a US congressman to ask him to try and ensure a security presence in the area following a week of particularly heavy attacks.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the manner in which the British forces themselves are behaving in Nationalist areas one might also begin to question whether there might be some more sinister motive behind their apparent inability to deal with the UDA and other Unionist armed groups. I know from frequent visits to the Six Counties that the level of the so-called security force presence has not declined. Evidence suggests that the level of military activity is increasing in many areas.</P>
    <P>At least one of the positive aspects of cross-Border co-operation is placed in daily jeopardy by the actions of the British forces. I refer to the manner in which soldiers routinely trample across Border farms which are under restriction as a precaution against the spread of animal disease. That has been brought to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, by my colleague Deputy Ferris. I hope he will make strong representations to the British Government to ensure that this practise comes to an end.</P>
    <P>It is clear that if the intent signalled by the British Government in the exchange of letters is genuine, it must be matched by real action on the ground to demilitarise the Six Counties. The observation towers and army installations must be removed and the soldiers taken out of contact with the population. Perhaps their attentions might be more welcome in Newcastle-on-Tyne than in Newtownbutler, although I somehow doubt it. It must also be the responsibility of this Government to ensure that the British Government lives up to its obligations in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="125" />I would like to put on record my party's intention to support the Bill and to continue to play its part to ensure the institutions set up under the Good Friday Agreement are re-established. It is our hope that the work of the implementation bodies moves on and that their remit is strengthened and extended when those institutions are re-established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The twin themes of this evening's debate have been general approval of the Bill and disappointment at the need to introduce it. There is all-party support in the House for the Good Friday Agreement to be implemented as quickly as possible and in the most satisfactory way. We are disappointed that the suspension was necessary. It is important that this Bill oversees the continued existence of the all-island bodies which have been agreed by all to have been successful in their practice and intent. They have even been successful in influencing other aspects of behaviour. That was achieved partly by bodies that have succeeded the establishment of the all-island bodies, for example, organisations such as Co-operation Ireland, and partly as a result of it.</P>
      <P>I had the privilege of attending the peace and reconciliation conference in Rosscarbery, County Cork the other week and it was very satisfying to see a top table peopled by a DUP councillor, an SDLP MLA, and an executive member of the Apprentice Boys of Derry. The absence of a Sinn Féin member was not because of unwillingness to attend but rather inability to attend. The contributions of all present at that conference was at least a starting point in getting where we need to go from here and where I hope the all-party talks that began in the past week are heading, towards an understanding of where the areas of agreement are and where the process can be progressed.</P>
      <P>As someone who has been involved voluntarily in youth work I can see the benefits of co-operation between voluntary organisations in the Republic and in Northern Ireland. I would like to think that the continued existence of the all-Ireland bodies will help this process.</P>
      <P>In trying to advance the process, we need to be quite clear &ndash; I hear it in many contributions to this debate &ndash; that the use of violence to further political aims if ever acceptable is not acceptable now and should never be acceptable in the future. That is a principle that should be advanced even further when violence is seen as community policing or some form of community justice. I hope the House will be clear and unequivocal on that. I hope the Taoiseach and the Government, in progressing this process, can put that forward as the clear and unequivocal view of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Taoiseach for paying particular attention to this debate and for his success in this policy area. There are many areas on which we <Col N="126" /> disagree, such as the degree of economic mismanagement, the quality of social justice and the degree of propriety and ethics in public life. However, in relation to policy on the relationships of all peoples of this island and between the two islands, the Taoiseach has been exemplary and has achieved very real political successes for which he deserves the continued support of the House.</P>
    <P>On those grounds, the Green Party is happy to support this Bill, though it is disappointed at the need for it, looks forward to the recommencement of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation tomorrow and hopes that it also will be a helpful contribution towards furthering this process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND" hpid="Dr. Cowley Dr. Cowley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I too am happy to speak on this Bill and I also share the feeling of disappointment that it is necessary. I congratulate the Taoiseach on the work he is doing on our behalf to try to resolve this situation which has continued for so long and has divided us so much.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999 and to enable the decisions of the North-South Ministerial Council in relation to the six all-island implementation bodies to be taken by the Irish and British Governments together during the temporary suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly. This remedial legislation is required to keep those important North-South bodies in operation pending the restoration of the Assembly.</P>
      <P>We are all disappointed with the sequence of events which resulted in the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly. This body caused a sea change in Northern Ireland and by all accounts seemed to be working and getting results. The palpable disappointment felt by everyone on its suspension was only balanced by a desire by all down here that it should be reactivated. That is our sincere wish.</P>
      <P>It is very easy for us in the South to say these things. How must a population feel after 30 years of war? How must the relatives of the 3,000 people who were killed feel? Good Friday, 1998, was a momentous occasion which brought such hope to many people and which resulted in a new dawn in the troubled history of Northern Ireland. Life had begun to return somewhat to normality after 30 years of conflict. Business confidence had also begun to return. I remember visiting Northern Ireland during the Troubles and being struck by the complete lack of facilities compared to the South. I visited again after the Good Friday Agreement and felt a great sense of freedom being able to drive in and out of the troubled province, noting the apparently deserted army look-out towers and Border police stations. If I felt like that, what freedom must the people of Northern Ireland have felt?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" />I travelled to Stormont to meet the Northern Ireland Minister for Health, Bairbre de Brún. It was a great feeling to walk up the long driveway at Stormont and speak Irish with Minister de Brún. I was there on a mission to seek support from Minister de Brún for a North-South helicopter emergency medical service. I had earlier met the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and had been anxious that the dubious distinction we share with Northern Ireland as the only two areas of Europe that do not have this very essential helicopter emergency service should be recognised. Minister Bairbre de Brún was very sympathetic and referred me on to the North-South Emergency Care Body, a body comprising civil servants from both North and South which was set up under the Good Friday Agreement. I met the body and made my pitch on helicopter emergency medical services and, as a result, a North-South study was commissioned having first been sanctioned by the Council of Ministers. That study was done by the Departments of Health North and South and the report will be released soon. That is my experience of the many good things that happened because of the Good Friday Agreement. This Bill will enable such things to continue to happen during the period of temporary suspension. I also share the good wishes for this Bill and hope it will be short-lived. Other good work has also been done, including progress on the provision of infrastructure. Many new Bills were enacted or were in the process of being enacted. It is only right that this good work should continue.</P>
    <P>The outbreak of foot and mouth disease and how it was handled North and South in a spirit of co-operation between Ministers Bríd Rogers and Joe Walsh showed how working together was logical and desirable. So many people, North and South, wanted the Good Friday Agreement to work that the overwhelming majority voted in favour of it. It required great courage on the part of all the parties involved to come to an agreement. Nationalists and Unionists decided there was a better future in sitting down together and getting on with it than remaining at loggerheads with each other.</P>
    <P>Terrible deeds done in the past have left gaping scars and entrenched positions. It will require even more courage to reactivate the Agreement. That courage and determination is sorely needed now. There is an onus on all parties, North and South, to ensure that the suspension of the Good Friday Agreement is as short-lived as possible. The past in Northern Ireland has been painful and the injustice and discrimination against the minority has sown terrible seeds of hate and violence. Examples abound of heavy-handedness and foul murder on both sides.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="128" />As a human being and as a general practitioner who tries to save life, I abhor the termination of life before its natural end. I abhor the thuggery and the gangsterism that go with parliamentary activity, which are still going on. It is past time that the gun was firmly and permanently taken out of Northern Ireland politics. Those who voted overwhelmingly for the Good Friday Agreement do not want the gun. Those who flout this strong message are in conflict with the wishes of the people. Let us all hope that the suspension of the Agreement is short-lived and that this will be one of the most short-lived Bills of all time. My wish is that it terminates shortly following the restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly and I hope that will be sooner rather than later. I wish the Taoiseach and the Government every success in their endeavours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this necessary, useful and constructive Bill. I spoke here during the time of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and on every review that took place since. It is important to pursue the operation of the North-South bodies. These put the emphasis on what we have in common and on the necessity to use commercial and infrastructural areas to co-operate with each other with a view to providing an example, not just to people here but outside the country, of what can be done.</P>
      <P>I attended a Euromed debate in the European Parliament a few years ago and was asked by various people, particularly from Israel and Palestine, what was the secret of the Good Friday Agreement. I felt it was simple yet difficult in terms of the degree of commitment required by all concerned. I compliment the Taoiseach and the various other leaders of Fine Gael and Labour, now and previously, who made a major commitment to bring about the situation we now enjoy. While we may not yet have achieved the ultimate in regard to a resolution of the problems in Northern Ireland and may not have crossed all the bridges and barriers, we have gone a long way towards meeting each others requirements. Now at least we have noted that we each exist and have a point of view.</P>
      <P>In any conflict, no matter how long it has gone on, it is necessary to recognise the other person's position before determining where to go, and the Anglo-Irish Agreement did that. Major concessions had to be made in both parts of the island which then brought recognition which was given an imprimatur by a huge majority of the people North and South. Although the Northern Ireland Assembly is now in suspense we should never forget the support the Irish people gave the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever the Agreement is in jeopardy we should refer to the fact that the people North and <Col N="129" /> South gave a huge vote of approval to what it contained. That was in dramatic contrast to what had taken place beforehand. Notwithstanding the legitimate reasons people may have to pursue a particular objective at a particular time there comes a time when enough is enough. The people have said that. It is critical now to recognise that we cannot have a bit of each. We must proceed on the basis of the path that has been charted in the Agreement. Whatever else it entails, it envisaged all eventualities. The suspension of the Assembly at this time is, we hope, a temporary matter. When reassembled it will have renewed confidence in itself and will operate with renewed vigour.</P>
    <P>Some things have happened recently which appear to raise questions as to the commitment of some of the contributing bodies. We can understand that these things happen. They happened at the foundation of our State and they will always happen in cases where there is a combination of circumstances such as has been the case in this country. Whatever happens afterwards, we should recognise that the path now being chosen is seen by the Irish people as the only path. There can be no half commitment to it. It must be total or it cannot work.</P>
    <P>While I understand the concern expressed by some people about the police raid of the Sinn Féin offices in Stormont, I have equal concern about some of the information which was allegedly found. This cannot be part of the trust that must exist between both communities in the North and between the North and South if the concept of the Good Friday Agreement is to survive. It can only survive when there is recognition by all, without preconditions, that they will take this road. It may not be the road we set out on originally and it may not contain all our objectives but it is immeasurably better than costing the lives of 3,000 or 4,000 people over another 30 years or of costing huge economic loss to the country. Whether we recognise it, part of the economic revival of this country has been as a result of international recognition that we had come to some agreement to live with each other. This is important and it sets an example for areas of conflict in other countries.</P>
    <P>We have a choice, we can decide to live together or die together. It is as simple and stark as that. I pay tribute to the SDLP which for many years conveyed a message and raised a voice that was isolated and that did not seem to have the ability to achieve its objectives. In more recent times other parties joined the chorus and gave legitimacy to what the SDLP and parties in this part of the island were attempting to do. That legitimacy has been given the imprimatur of the people in a way that is unique in modern politics.</P>
    <P>In this country there has been a history of the democratic process versus the alternative and <Col N="130" /> both have been pursued with some measure of doubt. In this situation it appears that at long last we have recognised, despite our history where suspicion, religion, politics, tradition and prejudice reigned supreme, that both sides can get together, recognise their differences and yet decide to put national and international interests first. When that happens everybody benefits.</P>
    <P>It has been an honour to speak on this Bill. It is necessary and is good for the country. It is good that politics works on this island, particularly with the North-South bodies, in the vacuum that exists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Fine Gael, Labour and the Green Party, Sinn Féin and the Independent Deputies for supporting the Government on this issue. We have had a long and interesting debate with contributions from a large number of Deputies and I will refer to some of those in my reply. I acknowledge and thank the leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Kenny, for staying throughout the debate, conscious of the fact that he and I have been here for seven and a half hours. I renew my appreciation to the House for facilitating this urgent debate, particularly the party leaders and the Whips for accepting the need for all Stages be taken this evening so that the North-South bodies can continue to operate successfully.</P>
      <P>We have been through many issues regarding Northern Ireland this week. We had the start of round table talks last Thursday, over the weekend our colleagues were involved in the British-Irish debate, we are discussing the Bill today, tomorrow the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation will sit and on Thursday the Seanad will take this Bill and the next round of round table talks will resume. It is an intensive period and in addition to these activities, officials and parties are communicating with each other on an ongoing basis as they have done for several weeks.</P>
      <P>I know that Deputies have a keen interest in the developments in Northern Ireland as is clear from this debate and their general interest at Question Time. I hope they found this debate as useful as I did in dealing with the wider political situation in the context of this Bill and I am grateful for the understanding which has been expressed for the need for the Bill. Regret was expressed by most Deputies that we have to have this debate at all and I assure the House we will continue to work towards resolving matters. I feel similar regret, but one must keep working to move things along. In the long-term it will prove the right thing, regardless of how long it takes and how many setbacks we have. As has been said, at least we are not in the position where we had horrific death tolls such as Deputy Rabbitte referred to relating to one particular year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="131" />As I have repeatedly said in the House and outside it, while the Northern Ireland Assembly has been suspended, the Agreement has not. The Governments will press ahead with their responsibilities under the Agreement. Last Friday, I was pleased to attend the fourth summit meeting of the British-Irish Council in New Lanark, Scotland. The meeting discussed the experience of the administrations in the area of social inclusion and examined how we might co-operate in addressing the issues behind this real and pressing dilemma. Regrettably on this occasion, the Northern Ireland Ministers were not among the delegations to the council but I look forward to renewed engagement with both the east-west and North-South fora following restoration. On a serious level, while it was regrettable they were not there, as was stated by the Ministers from Westminster who took their positions, we were able to get on with the work. We are prepared to make the Agreement work. Support for it is such that in the event of suspension and the absence of Northern Ireland Ministers, we were able to do much useful and positive work affecting social inclusion, drugs and other issues.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for the key issues raised and will address some of them. Several Deputies, including Deputy Kenny, leader of the Fine Gael Party, raised the question of suspension of the Assembly. I share their concern that the Bill before the House is necessary. However, we must deal with realities. As Deputy Kenny said, the continuing functioning of the North-South bodies is something which we all feel is important and for which we must now make provision. That is the purpose of the supplementary agreement between the two Governments and the current Bill.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of this Bill ceasing to have effect, I can confirm to Deputy Rabbitte that it is the intention of the Government that the Bill shall expire upon restoration of the Assembly. The Bill provides that an expiry order is to be made as soon as practicable following restoration of the Assembly. At the same time the Government will notify the British Government of the completion of the requirements for termination of the supplementary agreement in so far as we are concerned. I assure the Deputy that it is intended that the expiry order provided for in the Bill and the termination notification under the supplementary agreement will be made as close together in time as possible &ndash; separate provision for each is a matter purely of mechanics.</P>
    <P>I endorse Deputy Kenny's comments on the handling of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. The one positive outcome from this difficult period was the enhancement of cross-Border co-operation in the area of animal health. As a result, we are now well advanced in the develop<Col N="132" /> ment of an all-island animal health strategy. Even in the past few weeks, senior officials at Secretary General level and veterinarians have continued discussions on the issue and I am adamant we do not lose the benefits of that. This will be taken forward by the agriculture sector of the North-South Ministerial Council. I recall the widespread praise for the very effective role played by Agriculture Minister Bríd Rodgers during this episode. As Deputy Keaveney said, there are clear benefits to be had from local Ministers taking local decisions.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their expressions of support for the North-South bodies and for the range of practical achievements which they mentioned in their remarks. These included the important roles of Tourism Ireland, InterTrade Ireland and Waterways Ireland, all of which are major contributors to the economic well-being of this island. I note Deputy Mitchell's remarks on the SDLP and I fully agree with his views on the crucial role that party has played in the peace process. As I said before, I have worked closely within the North-South Ministerial Council on matters relating to the North-South bodies with Seamus Mallon and Mark Durkan. I look forward to working closely with Mark Durkan in the months ahead both in relation to the NSMC and in the wider work of securing the restoration of the Northern Ireland institutions and the full implementation of the Agreement in all its aspects.</P>
    <P>I note Deputy Ó Caoláin's remarks on the figures in the Estimates for Foras na Gaeilge. However, these should be read in the context of an almost doubling of the budget for the body over the past two years, from &euro;7.5 million in 2000 to &euro;14 million. The Government is fully supportive of the work of Foras na Gaeilge throughout the island of Ireland, for which my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, has responsibility. As the House will be aware, the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, has a long-standing personal commitment to Irish language issues and will continue in co-operation with his Northern counterpart to oversee the development of this body to its full potential. There is nobody who participates in these issues more than the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, in Northern Ireland as well as the Republic.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Sargent's remarks regarding consultation on keeping the bodies in operation, North-South co-operation has always operated on the basis of mutual respect, transparency and making progress only by agreement. I am confident that this remedial action to preserve the important work of the North-South bodies enjoys widespread support across the political spectrum. Deputy Keaveney raised a number of issues, specifically in relation to Lough Foyle. On the question of the sea bed, I will <Col N="133" /> arrange for the information the Deputy requested to be sent to her in writing. With regard to the issues relating to the proposed wind farm development and the aquaculture licensing, which are of obvious concern to the Deputy's constituents, these are matters in the first instance for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, and I am sure he will take account of the concerns she expressed.</P>
    <P>There has been some discussion of deadlines for the process in which we are currently engaged and I will come to those matters shortly. Among other matters raised, Deputy Crowe referred to expanding the North-South bodies to include energy, transport, economic development and health. It is my hope that, in time, as was the original intention of the Good Friday Agreement, the initial range of Implementation Bodies will increase. I share the Deputy's desire that these should develop on a more formal basis. On the Good Friday when the Agreement emerged, people felt that to list any Implementation Bodies would be an enormous move forward and that the world would never be the same again. However, the arrangements have worked very well and North-South development is already well developed in the key areas to which Deputy Crowe referred, both within and outside the remit of the North-South bodies. That high level of co-operation will be maintained.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Dr. Cowley's comments in relation to the health area, in which there is enormous scope for co-operation. Deputy Crowe's colleagues, Martin McGuinness and Báirbre de Brún, as Northern Ireland Ministers for Education and Health, respectively, made great strides on those issues and the areas where there is co-operation are very evident. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and Báirbre de Brún have worked together to achieve substantial progress in the health area. That process brings down barriers. As Deputy Dr. Cowley has pointed out from his experience of medical issues, that co-operation can be enhanced. I fully agree with his comments.</P>
    <P>The Implementation Bodies have statutory functions, as set out in the legislation under which they were established. However, the possibility of expanding the areas of co-operation within the council is provided for in the Good Friday Agreement and preliminary consideration of this issue had already commenced before suspension. We should continue to address those issues and I hope that will happen once we are up and running again.</P>
    <P>To return to the matter of discussing deadlines for the current process, the critical issue is that everyone now accepts the need for a sense of urgency regarding the way we should tackle current impasse. There can be no complacency, no <Col N="134" /> foot-dragging and no digging in. All sides are being challenged to move forward in addressing the outstanding issues in a comprehensive and collective manner. Deputy Durkan referred to the importance of moving on and I agree with him. If we do not move forward we could spend many years arguing that the problems in interface areas &ndash; including those at Holy Cross and other primary schools &ndash; are caused by one side or the other. That could go on <i>ad nauseam.</i>It is no harm to state the reasons for those outstanding issues. We must take account of the concerns of various groups &ndash; which other Deputies and I have met on many occasions &ndash; arguing for justice for the forgotten people whose loved ones were killed by one side or the other and who have not succeeded in getting to the truth of what happened in various tragic fatalities over the years. We can consider those issues. A few years ago we had a debate on the possibility of looking at the system used in South Africa to air such issues, but I did not detect great support for that process. We have to move on. It is eight years since the first historic ceasefires and five and a half years since the second ceasefires, which were equally historic. From what has been said in this debate, it is clear people wish to move on from the days of paramilitarism. They know who has been engaged and that it is not all one-sided. They want to move on to the next phase when it is time to do so.</P>
    <P>Moving on is not new to this State, which has been obliged to do so at previous stages in its history. The party I am honoured to lead made that move in 1926, less than four years after a turbulent period and a divisive civil war. Six years later the party made another enormous move forward. As I said, there comes a time when it is necessary to move forward. While it may be difficult to equate the past with the present, there was probably a similar degree of bitterness and divisiveness in 1926 as there is now.</P>
    <P>I accept that there has to be a period of suspension and I acknowledge that people in the House have been very tolerant in this regard. We must remember that the alternative to society moving forward is that it will drift backward. In that context, we must recognise that this summer was more difficult than last summer which, in turn, was probably more difficult than the summer of 2000. Maintaining the <i>status quo </i>is not really an option because there is a tendency to drift back. The general message from the debate is that we can avoid the need for this Bill and be in a position to rescind it very quickly if everybody concerned moves forward. It is not my job to lecture one side or the other. We have acted as honest brokers with a view to moving ahead in the interests of all the people &ndash; Nationalists, republicans, Unionists and loyalists &ndash; of Northern Ireland. The people of this island are all directly <Col N="135" /> affected by those issues in terms of image, status, how they think and the mood of society here. I feel sure everybody wishes to move on.</P>
    <P>I look forward to attending the first meeting of the re-convened Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in Dublin tomorrow, at which there will hopefully be a constructive exchange of views. I hope it can make a strong and positive contribution towards addressing the issues of confidence and trust which lie at the heart of the current difficulties. I also hope the event is well attended and that the proceedings are well covered by the media and brought out into the public domain. Our objective through the forum is to reach a wider audience.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the House for its support in ensuring that the important work and functions of the North-South bodies can, by virtue of this remedial legislation, be protected and maintained during what we hope is a temporary suspension period. I thank Deputies for their co-operation, especially those, including Deputy Kenny, who remained in the Chamber throughout the debate on the Bill. I appreciate their commitment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of raising this important issue. It is not just important in my constituency of South Kerry, but is of national importance. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, and hope he will give me the answers that are required. I want to put on the record of the Dáil for a second time a quotation from the former Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, speaking on 18 May 1999: &ldquo;Any decisions in relation to the future of the hotel group will only be taken after the fullest consultation, in particular with the staff of the hotels and with the overriding objective of maintaining and maximising employment&rdquo;. When Deputy O'Rourke made these remarks in the House during a debate on the future of the Great Southern Hotel Group, was she being genuine and honest or was she attempting to lead the workers in the hotels up the garden path? I suspect that the latter is the answer. How is it that, little more than two years after that solemn promise was made in the House, the Torc Great Southern Hotel in Killarney has been closed and is to be sold without consultation with either the unions or the employees at the hotel? I hope the Minister will answer that simple question.</P>
      <P>Last Friday morning the workers in the Torc Great Southern Hotel in Killarney were summoned to a meeting at very short notice in the hotel and informed by the chief executive of the Great Southern Hotels that the hotel would not open next year and would be sold by the group. The staff had no idea that the meeting was about to take place and the news hit them like a bolt out of the blue. The trade unions received no notification that the meeting was taking place. In fact some local and national SIPTU officials were not aware that the meeting was taking place until it had concluded. This is a disgraceful way in which to treat workers. They were dragged into a meeting and literally fired at a moment's notice without as little as a representative of their trade union present. Not even the Government Minister from south Kerry was aware that the meeting was taking place and claimed to have been shocked at the announcement that the hotel is to close. This is quite extraordinary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This episode flies in the face of former Deputy Mary O'Rourke's commitment to the House in 1999 that no changes in the status of the hotel group would take place without consultation. It proves too that relations between the Government and Aer Rianta are at such a low ebb that this announcement was made without the knowledge of some Ministers. Aer Rianta and the Government are currently at loggerheads over sleazy scandals like brandy, cigars and Christmas <Col N="138" /> presents, but are relationships really so bad that employees in one of the most valuable hotels in my constituency have to be treated in such a shoddy manner?</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to state clearly that this is not the beginning of the end of State ownership of the Great Southern Hotel Group, which is the standard bearer for the hotel and tourist industry. Is it the case that, despite all of the promises of my two constituency colleagues in south Kerry in the run up to the last election that the hotels would be retained in public ownership, that the Government is now intent on flogging the family silver without even meeting the unions and employees to discuss it?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister for Transport meet the unions immediately, as they have requested, to discuss the future of the hotel and its employees? Will the Government also confirm or deny in the House tonight that a valuer has been to Parknasilla Great Southern Hotel and other hotels in the group? Will the Government apologise to the staff for the appalling way in which the workers at the hotel were treated last Friday and indicate that he will seek a reversal of the decision to sell the Torc Great Southern. If the Minister and Aer Rianta management are in such conflict with each other at present then either he should go or they should go. It is a disgraceful way to treat workers who have been in the hotel over 30 years.</P>
    <P>Will the Government stop pussyfooting around the issue of putting hundreds of jobs of hotel workers on the line and state once and for all that the passion of the Progressive Democrats for privatisation has not completely consumed Fianna Fáil and that the Great Southern Hotel Group will remain in public ownership?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Dr. McDaid)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to put the facts before the House. The Great Southern Hotels Group is a wholly owned subsidiary of Aer Rianta. It currently employs the equivalent of 750 full-time staff and owns nine hotels, five of which are located in prime tourist destinations. A new GSH hotel adjacent to Cork Airport opened last year, which fulfils the group's objective of having a GSH hotel at each of the main tourist gateways. The company also has a minority interest and a management contract in the four star City Hotel, Derry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The slowdown in the world economy, the foot and mouth disease crisis in the UK last year and the impact of the events of 11 September combined to make last year an arduous one in the hotel sector. Great Southern Hotels Group too was affected, recording a 34% drop in profits from &euro;4.8 million in 2000 to &euro;3.2 million in 2001. Retention of market share and cost containment were the group's main focus this year in order to <Col N="139" /> position it for the expected recovery next year. The Killarney Great Southern Hotel will celebrate its 150th birthday in 2004. I understand from Aer Rianta that an examination in 2000 of the two Great Southern Hotels in Killarney concluded that extensive renovations and refurbishment were required if they were to continue in business, particularly with regard to meeting new fire regulations and safety requirements. The board of Great Southern Hotels decided in early 2000 to carry out a full restoration of the old Killarney hotel at a cost of &euro;15 million. It was also agreed to keep the other hotel, the Torc, open while this restoration was being carried out and to review its position when the restoration project had been completed.</P>

      <P>The restoration of the old Killarney hotel was to be financed by the sale of surplus assets in the group. The objective of re-establishing the old hotel as Killarney's leading hotel has been achieved. It was reopened in the middle of this year to resume its year round operation. I understand that expenditure in the region of &euro;8 million to &euro;9 million would be needed to keep the Torc Hotel operational. Such expenditure could not be justified in the opinion of the board of the Great Southern Hotels, particularly as the hotel operates for only six months each year.</P>

      <P>The Torc Hotel has closed and the board does not intend to reopen it. The board decided last week to offer the Torc for sale by public tender in the near future. The Great Southern Hotels group is committed to accommodating the staff of the Torc either at the old hotel in Killarney or with an agreed voluntary redundancy package. The sale of the Torc will complete the group's strategy for its Kerry portfolio and ensures that borrowing for capital investment purposes remains at an acceptable level. The board of Aer Rianta accepted the proposals of the board of Great Southern Hotels and fully endorsed the strategy. There are no proposals at this time for the sale of any other hotel in the Great Southern Hotels chain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planned investment by the Great Southern Hotels group over the next five years will amount to approximately &euro;33 million. In a strategic review undertaken for the Minister's predecessor in 1999, the board of Aer Rianta considered that the Great Southern Hotels group, while operating successfully, is not central to Aer Rianta's airport management operations. The board recommended that it should exit the hotel sector and use the proceeds of the sale to <Col N="140" /> finance capital expenditure programmes at the State airports. A report prepared by Warburg Dillon Read and AIB Capital Markets for the former Minister agreed with the view of the Aer Rianta board on this matter. The Minister for Transport has indicated that he will revisit the question of the future of the Great Southern Hotels group in due course. He stated, however, that he intends to concentrate for the time being on the priority issues for aviation, and transport in general, as set out in An Agreed Programme for Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND" hpid="Dr. Cowley Dr. Cowley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment. I doubt that I will raise many matters in this House that are more important to County Mayo than this serious situation. An area of County Mayo, which is twice as large as County Dublin but which has a population smaller than that of County Leitrim, is dying. The area to which I refer constitutes 40% of County Mayo, but contains less than 20% of the county's population. The depopulation trend is set to continue and it is inevitable that it will do so if something drastic is not done. If the current level of decline continues, north and west Mayo, from Killala to Newport, will be entirely deserted by the end of the century. I thank Dr. Seamus Caulfield, a well respected and much admired community activist, archaeologist and instigator and promoter of the visitor centre and research unit at the Céide Fields in Ballycastle for his work in this area. His analysis of the preliminary results of the 2002 census are most revealing, but they are also troubling.</P>
      <P>In light of the positive results of the census at national, provincial, regional and county level, it was shattering for me to discover that the part of the country facing the biggest crisis is in County Mayo. It is true that many rural electoral divisions show a decline, but they are interspersed with electoral divisions showing growth. Parts of north-west Cork, north Kerry, north Roscommon, south-west Clare and south-west Donegal fall into this category, but nothing compares to the almost total decline recorded in north and west Mayo. Some 39 of 42 electoral districts north of a line from south of Killala to south of Newport show a decline. Increases in population are recorded in only three districts in this area: Glencastle, which increased by eight, Newport West, which includes St. Brendan's village in Mulranny, which increased by 67, and Corraun Achill, which increased by 25. The other 39 districts record a total loss of 1,209 people and the net loss between 1996 to 2002, therefore, is 1,109 people. The population of this part of County Mayo has decreased from 22,765 to 21,656.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" />Two distinct County Mayos are emerging &ndash; a south and east Mayo, which recorded an increase in population of over 7,000 since 1996 and a north and west Mayo, the population of which has declined by over 1,100 in the same time. Action is urgently needed. Balanced regional development has been promised as part of the national development plan, but the figures emerging give the lie to any such notion. The development of the south and east of Ireland is being copper-fastened, but the west is suffering.</P>
    <P>After generations of party politics in County Mayo, we do not have the road, rail, telecommunications and broadband infrastructure we need. If broken promises were infrastructure, County Mayo would have all the infrastructure it needs. It would be a competitive area, rather than having third class roads and no broadband technology. There is no mobile telephone reception and a lack of ISDN lines in parts of my county. The western investment fund has been cut by an incredible 68%. The CLÁR programme, administered by the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, which caters for 16 counties, has been cut by 25% from an inadequate &euro;12 million. Funding for the REP scheme has decreased by 19%. There has been an increase in rural destocking and thousands of sheep farmers have been driven off the land. Young people do not have the chance to build a house; they have no future.</P>
    <P>Politicians from certain parties are still shouting about what they will do for County Mayo. A typical example of this was found last week when the Dáil debated the abolition of the first-time house buyer's grant. A Fianna Fáil Deputy, who said that he felt the decision was unfair, voted with the Government when the acid test came. For generations public representatives have been saying they will do one thing but doing another. The centralised form of government favoured by party politicians means that the west will suffer.</P>
    <P>Regardless of whether the country has money or not, the west of Ireland receives very little, but I am appealing for change. I am asking for north-west Mayo to benefit from special designation for tax purposes, in a similar scheme to that in the Shannon region. As Dr. Caulfield has said, no other part of the State comes as close to having a case for development aid as the north and west of County Mayo. I ask the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, to extend the town renewal scheme to Killala, Crossmolina and other towns in my county. The Government has a public service obligation to give County Mayo a gas pipeline and high capacity broadband telecommunications. How can the people of my constituency continue to live there if these needs are not met? County Mayo should be a competitive area and, to that end, the Government should consider a Shannon-type scheme for the north and west of the county. <Col N="142" /> If such a move is not made, the people of the region have no future.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Teachta as ucht na deise a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an ábhar seo. Dar ndóigh, táimíd ag caint mar gheall ar cheantair i gContae Maigh Eo thiar thuaidh, Gaeltacht Iorras agus Acla san áireamh. Is ceantair iad seo a bhfuil eolas agam orthu go pearsanta agus, go deimhin, tá mé ag dul síos ann Dé hAoine seo chugainn. Tá áthas orm go bhfuil figiúirí Mhaigh Eo thuas, 5,904 san iomlán. Is meadú suntasach é sin i gcomhthéacs stair na himirce sa gcondae. Is cúis imní dom, áfach, an difir atá le feiceáil idir an cheantar thoir-theas, atá ag fás, agus an ceantar thiar-thuaidh, atá ag dul siar agus a thit 1,109. Tá impleachtaí móra i gceist do thodhchaí an cheantair sin má leanann an patrún seo ar aghaidh.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that on setting up CLÁR, I highlighted rural depopulation as the main challenge facing rural Ireland. At the time many people wanted me to use other indices which were totally inappropriate for rural Ireland. I am delighted that depopulation is now seen as a national yardstick for rural development. However, population trends will take time to turn around. It will not happen overnight. Even in counties such as Leitrim, where Carrick-on-Shannon is growing, we still face major challenges in the rural areas. Population trends will not change dramatically over a short period of years. I am aware of the preliminary results from the 2002 census which reports a population decline of 1,109 in the north-west Mayo area, including the Gaeltacht areas of Erris and Achill. Last week I was working on these figures in connection with the CLÁR programme and depopulation in the CLÁR areas is static. North Mayo is worse &ndash; its population is declining.</P>
      <P>This is not an isolated phenomenon and many rural areas, particularly in the west of Ireland, are trying to come to grips with similar problems. There is a need for clearly focused policies and actions in order to sustain viable and vibrant rural communities. Opportunity of employment and the provision of high quality infrastructure, both physical and social, are the critical factors for maintaining sustainable communities. The employment difficulties experienced in recent years in Erris, especially the closure of the Warner factory, are common knowledge and this was the reason I established the Belmullet task force in 2000. It reported to me in February 2001 and a plan of action was put in place on the basis of its 37 recommendations. An ongoing review of developments in the area since then is almost complete and indicates that good progress has been made, particularly in regard to infrastructural improvements and employment creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" />A sum of more than &euro;4 million has been provided for road improvements in north-west Mayo through a variety of funding sources including Mayo County Council, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, CLÁR and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Significant road improvements have also been carried out to roads in the Achill area under my Department's scéim na mbóithre stráitéiseacha. It is a key objective of my Department to continue to invest in roads and other improvements over the coming years. Plans for a major extension to Blacksod pier are well advanced and will be dealt with as quickly as possible. The CLÁR programme I introduced two years ago has had a very positive impact in County Mayo generally. To date, a total of &euro;3.76 million has been approved for various schemes in north-west Mayo, including roads, water, village enhancement, islands and telecommunications.</P>
    <P>Comhar lorrais Teoranta has implemented the Leader programme in the north-west Mayo Gaeltacht for a number of years and has recently been allocated &euro;1.88 million under the current programme. In addition, the Meitheal Mhaigh Eo partnership has been allocated &euro;3.3 million to assist in the implementation of a number of actions across the three sub-measures of the local development social inclusion programme. This programme, together with CLÁR and Leader, is now part of the remit of my Department and this will result in more integrated delivery mechanisms.</P>
    <P>In terms of employment creation, Údarás na Gaeltachta has had considerable success. Following a major refurbishment of the former Warner premises, a new venture in the ICT sector with the potential to create 200 jobs has been established, with 29 people already employed in phase one of the project. Overall, in the Erris and Achill area, Údarás na Gaeltachta achieved a modest increase in employment in Údarás-assisted industries between 1999 and 2001, from 554 to 561 people. The interagency working group on employment creation in the Gaeltacht was established by my predecessor, Deputy Coughlan, last May to make recommendations on the policy initiatives required to provide employment opportunities in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Many things are happening. The Deputy referred specifically to the gas pipeline. As the Deputy knows, we are putting in the ring in Belmullet and this is the key to broadband. The provision of gas is crucial. There have been hold-ups in relation to planning. People, including locals, had objections they felt were valid and we had to allow the democratic process to take its course. The Government is committed to providing gas to north Mayo, but we can only do that when the planning problems are cleared out of <Col N="144" /> the way. They are not in the hands of the Government.</P>

      <P>Trí seachtaine ó shin bhí mé anseo nuair a bhí an tAire ina shuí san áit ina bhfuil sé anocht agus muid ag plé fá 50 post a cailleadh ar an eastát tionscail i nGaoth Dobhair. Trí seachtaine ina dhiaidh sin, fógraíodh inniu go bhfuil tionscal eile ar an eastát ag cailleadh 35 post ón Aoine seo chugainn. Is dócha go ndéarfaidh an tAire gur postanna sealadacha a bhí iontu agus tá sin fíor. Ar an lámh eile, tá 35 ag obair ar eastát inniu agus ní bheidh siad ag obair i gceann seachtaine agus cíallaíonn sin go mbeidh 85 ar fad amach as obair i dtrí seachtaine agus an Nollaig ag bualadh linn. Caidé an sórt Nollag a bheas ag na teaghlaigh sin agus na haithreacha agus máthracha dífhostaithe agus an brú ar bhíonn ar thuismitheoirí ag an am seo den bhliain? Ní fhéadfadh sé tarlú ag am níos measa.</P>
      <P>Cuirfidh an 35 seo agus an 50 trí seachtaine ó shin go mór leis an bhrú dífhostaíochta atá i gceantair Ghaoth Dobhair, Cloch Cheann Fhaola agus na Rossan mar tagann na daoine seo atá ag obair san eastát as na trí pharóiste sin. Ní amháin i nGaoth Dobhair atá seo ag tarlú. I bparóiste Chloch Cheann Fhaola, áit ina bhfuil an difhostaíocht imithe i méad go mór, tá monarchan folamh ann. Bhí mé ag éisteacht le ball Údaráis na Gaeltachta inné ar an raidió ag insint go bhfuil na comhraití a bhí ag dul ar aghaidh idir an údarás agus dream éigin maidir le tionscal a chur isteach ar an Chaiseal i nGort a' Choirce ag cur isteach go mór air agus go bhfuil an tóin i ndiaidh titim as na cainteanna sin. Monarchan atá ansin le 20 bliain agus níor éirigh leis an údarás, ná dream ar bith eile, tionscal buan a chur isteach ann.</P>
      <P>Tá an rud céanna sna Rossan agus gach páirt eile de Ghaeltacht Thír Chonaill. Nuair a thiocfas tuairisc chinn bhliana an údaráis amach, beidh níos lú ag obair i dtionscal an údaráis i dTír Chonaill ná a bhí anuraidh agus arú anuraidh. Tá na figiúirí ansin. Dúirt an tAire féin é trí seachtaine ó shin go bhfuil 400 níos lú ag obair an eastát i nGaoth Dobhair anois ná mar a bhí arú anuraidh. Insíonn sin scéal.</P>
      <P>An eagla mhór atá orm ná gur beag dóchais atá againn go dtiocfaidh feabhas ar an scéal sa bhliain úr. Foilsíodh na Meastacháin seachtain ó shin agus ceann de na rudaí a chuir isteach orainn agus ar éifeacht an údaráis ná go bhfuil titim de 22% ar shólathar airgidis chaipitil Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhí titim ó &euro;32 milliún sa bhliain le monarchain nua agus fostaíocht a mhealleadh isteach do no Gaeltachta go dtí &euro;25 milliún. Bhí díospóireacht ag Údaras na Gaeltachta i nGaillimh, i ndáilcheantar an Aire é féin, ag an deireadh seachtaine seo caite agus tuigeann na baill uilig go mbeidh <Col N="145" /> seo mar chúis mhór deacrachtaí don údarás sa bhliain amach romhainn. Chuir an t-iarAire Stáit grúpa ar bun agus tá sé ag scrúdú cúrsaí ar láthair na huaire. Tá muid ag súil le scéal uaidh ach mí i ndiaidh míosa tá postanna á gcailleadh agus gan aon cheann le cur ina n-áit. Caide a déarfaimid leis an 35 a scaoileadh as a bpost iad inniu? Cá bhfuil siad chun fostaíochta a fhail? An mbeidh sé le fáil sa Ghaeltacht nó an gcaithfidh siad an Ghaeltacht a fhágáil? Níl na postanna ansin.</P>
    <P>Tá géarchéim ann. Níl fonn ormsa theacht isteach anseo achan mhí agus a bheith ag tabhairt amach fá tuilleadh postanna a cailleadh. Ba bhreá liom seans a bheith agam theacht isteach anseo agus moladh a thabhairt as postanna úra a cruthaíodh ach is fada ó bhí deis agam sin a dhéanamh. Tá súil agam go rachaidh an tAire, agus an t-údarás agus na háisinteachta go léir isteach chun leighis a fháil ar na deacrachtaí móra dífhostaíochta ata ar fud na Gaeltachta i dTír Chonaill, go mór mhór ar an eastát tionscail i nGaoth Dobhair.</P>

      <P>Tá soláthar dóthain curtha ar fáil don údarás don bhliain seo chugainn. Tá an ceart ag an Teachta nach bhfuil an oiread céanna airgid bheith curtha ar fáil sa bhliain seo chugainn agus a cuireadh ar fáil i mbliana. Tá cúis an-simplí leis sin, tugadh &euro;5 milliun sa bhreis ar an airgead a bhí ann anuraidh cheana fein i mbliana don údarás. Leis an gclár a chuir mé i láthair an údaráis le húsáid níos fearr a bhaint as na sócmhainní, tá dóthain airgid ar fáil don bhliain seo chugainn ach caithfear nuálach a chur i mbun oibre ag an údarás. Níl aon amhras orm ach go bhfuil formhór mhaith den údarás ar an tuiscint gur féidir oibriú go héifeachtach ar an mbealach sin.</P>
      <P>Is comhlacht é BMR Teoranta a bhfuil aonad táirgíochta aige ar an eastát tionscail i nGaoth Dobhair i gContae Dhún na nGall agus aonad riaracháin eile ar Eastát na Páirce Móire i nGaeltacht na hAchréidh i nGaillimh.</P>
      <P>D'fhógair an comhlacht inniu go bhfil sé le 35 phost sealadach i nGaoth Dobhair agus 16 phost sealadach eile i nGaillimh a scaoileadh chun bealaigh ag deireadh na seachtaine seo. Fágann sé seo go bhfuil 241 san iomlán fostaithe ag an chomlacht anois, 133 i nGaoth Dobhair agus 108 i nGaillimh. Is fostaíocht bhuan lánaimseartha is mó atá i gceist, seachas líon beag atá fostaithe ar bhonn páirtaimseartha agus sealadach. Is comhlacht an-tábhtachtach é i nGaoth Dobhair ó bunaíodh é i 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir leis na fostaithe atá ag cailleadh a bpost, is daoine iad seo a fhostaítear go sealadach chuile bhliain nuair a bhíonn éileamh trom ar thairgí an chomhlachta chun freastal, ach go háirithe, ar sheasúr na Nollag. Nuair a bhíonn stoc curtha le chéile don seasúr sin scaoiltear leis na fostaithe sealadacha sin agus titeann leibhéal fostaíochta <Col N="146" /> an chomhlachta ar ais go dtí leibhéal na bhfostaithe buana.</P>
    <P>Níl aon amhras ach gur cúis imní dom féin agus d'Údarás na Gaeltachta aon phostanna a bheith á gcailliúnt in aon tionscal Gaeltachta ach, sa chás áirithe seo, caithfear a aithint gur fostaíocht sheasúrach atá i gceist. Is minic fostaithe bheith á gceapadh ag comhlachtaí ar bhonn sealadach chun tabhairt faoi chonarthaí gearrthéarmacha agus is amhlaidh go mbaineann go leor de thairgíocht comhlachtaí áirithe le hullmhúchán do sheasúr na Nollag.</P>
    <P>I gcás Ghaoth Dobhair, tuigim go maith an imní atá ar an Teachta mar gheall ar an líon postanna atá caillte ar an eastát tionscail le tamall anuas. Mar a mhínigh mé i ndíospóireacht eile faoin ábhar céanna sa Teach seo le gairid, tá beagán le cois 1,000 duine ag obair idir Eastát Tionscail Ghaoth Dobhair agus Nuvotem Teo i gCroithlí. Is glan-laghdú é seo de thuairim is 300 le cúpla bliain anuas in ainneoin breis agus 100 post nua a bheith cruthaithe sa tréimhse chéanna. Chomh malth leis sin, tá breis is 300 de na fostaithe ar an eastát ar sheachtain oibre ghearr. Is údar imní agus buartha é seo don údarás agus pléadh na fadhbanna seo ag a chruinniú i nGaoth Dobhair le gairid. Deimhníodh go ndéanfar gach dícheall an fhostaíocht eile atá fós ann a chaomhnú agus tuilleadh fostaíochta a chruthú.</P>
    <P>Bhunaigh an t-iarAire Stáit ag an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán, an Teachta Coughlan, grúpa oibre idiráisínteacht roinnt míonna ó shin. Is d'fhonn na polasaithe atá riachtanach chun deiseanna fostaíochta sa Ghaeltacht a scrúdú a bunaíodh an grúpa oibre seo. Tá mé ag súil go gcuirfear an tuarascáil seo faoi mo bhráid go luath agus go mbeidh beartais aimsithe a thabharfaidh aghaidh ar an ghéarchéim fhostaíochta atá ag bagairt ar an Ghaeltacht faoi láthair, agus beartais a rachaidh chun tairbhe do chruthú postanna buanna, inmharthana sa Ghaeltacht sa todhchaí.</P>
    <P>Ag eirí as moltaí an ghrúpa oibre seo, agus ag cur leis na tosaíochtaí atá glactha ag an údarás cheana féin, tá mé dóchasach go mbeifear in ann deiseanna fiúntacha fostaíochta a chur ar fáil. Beifear ag diriú ar réimsí nua-aimseartha fostaíochta le béim níos mó ar ardscileanna agus acmhainní dúchasacha na Gaeltachta, an Ghaeilge san áireamh.</P>
    <P>Tá dul chun cinn maith déanta le tamall maidir le tograí nua a aimsiú do cheantar Ghaoth Dobhair. Cé go bhfuil se ró-luath sonraí a thabhairt, tá súil agam go mbeidh cúpla gnó nua á mbunú ann go luath, bunaithe ar chúnamh atá ceadaithe ag an údarás dóibh le roinnt míonna anuas. Beidh deis ag an Teachta moladh a thabhairt dom ansin nuair a bheas sé tuillte.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé cheana, is údar mór imní dúinn ar fad an lagtrá seó atá le sonrú i gcúrsaí fostaíochta, i dTír ChonaiIl ach go háirithe agus <Col N="147" /> go deimhin féin sa Ghaeltacht i gcoitinne. Ní féidir liom tada a dhéanamh ach airgead a chur ar fáil agus féachaint go gcaithfear an t-airgead sin ar bhealach chun leasa na Gaeltachta. Is féidir bheith cinnte go n-oibreoidh mé féin agus an t-údarás chun na críocha sin a bhaint amach.</P>
    <P>Tá sé i gceist agamsa le linn mo thréimhse mar Aire athruithe suntasacha a dhéanamh ar struch<Col N="148" /> túr eagras éagsúla atá faoi scáth ma Roinne,Údarás na Gaeltachta ina measc, le cinntiú go bhfuil luach ceart á fháil ag an bpobal as an infheistíocht Stáit atá á cur ar fáil. Bhí cruinniú agam cheana le bord an údaráis leis an gceist seo a phlé agus beidh sé ar chlár oibre an Choiste Comhairligh atá bunaithe agam chomh maith.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58, 67 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>The programme for Government provides that, as part of the process of continuing to transform Aer Rianta, we will ensure that Shannon and Cork airports have greater autonomy and independence. On 21 October 2002, I had separate meetings with both the group of unions representing workers in Aer Rianta and the board of the company to hear their views on this proposal and related matters. A debate has now been stimulated by me both within the Shannon and Cork regions and at a national level on the best ownership structure for these two airports going forward. I have visited both Shannon and Cork airports to stimulate this debate further. I have already made it clear publicly that the issue of greater autonomy for Shannon and Cork is being considered solely in the context of continued State ownership of those airports and I emphasised this point when I met the union representatives last month. There is a genuine sense of goodwill towards the airports in the two regions on the part of local tourism and business interests and the current debate surrounding this issue has got people thinking about the best way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current position is that Aer Rianta funds developments at both Cork and Shannon from its own resources and borrowings without recourse to the Exchequer. Obviously, if the ownership structure of these airports were to be revised in a fundamental way, the issue of the level and <Col N="150" /> sources of funding for the airports going forward is a major area that would have to be carefully assessed.</P>
    <P>Based on submissions which I have received to date, there is clearly a wide diversity of views on the best way forward for Cork and Shannon airports which range from maintaining the current Aer Rianta structure to completely new, separate State companies to own and operate the two airports. Obviously, I will listen carefully to all parties who have views to offer on this issue including those of Aer Rianta and the unions. Neither I nor the Government has any ideological preconceptions with regard to this matter. There would be no point in changing the current ownership arrangements unless it can be shown that there are clear, positive benefits for Cork and Shannon and their surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>Whatever the outcome of the current examination of options for greater autonomy for these two airports, I have already made it clear that Aer Rianta's development plans for Cork Airport will proceed. There is a general consensus that Cork Airport needs significant investment as a result of the growth in traffic through the airport in recent years and Aer Rianta is well advanced with its plans for a major new capital investment programme in infrastructure and facilities. The main feature of this programme, estimated to cost &euro;130 million, is a 25,000 sq. m. terminal building. Planning permission for this project was secured earlier this year and Aer Rianta is evaluating tenders for the works. The company expects that the work will take two years to complete and the aim would be to have the new terminal ready for Cork's year as European City of Culture in 2005.</P>
    <P>This major plan for Cork will bring the capacity of the airport up to 2.5 million passengers per annum and will facilitate further expansion thereafter to handle growth up to five million passengers per annum in the medium to long-term. These capacities compare with a passenger throughput at Cork Airport of almost 1.8 million last year.</P>
    <P>The new passenger terminal at Shannon which opened in 2000 has effectively doubled the airport's capacity providing it with the capability to handle 4.5 million passengers per annum. Traffic throughput in 2001 at Shannon was 2.4 million passengers. Shannon Airport is well positioned to cater for future growth in air services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60, 80, 81, 83, 94, 110, 113, 118, 119, 124, 127, 134, 137, 138, 147, 148, 154, 395, 396, 405 and 420 together.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to close any part of the rail system and neither have I received any proposals from Iarnród Éireann to do so. Furthermore, the company has informed me that it has made no decision to reduce its workforce by 600.</P>
      <P>It is my stated position that future investment in the railways will be guided by the outcome of the strategic rail review which is nearing completion. The consultants undertaking the study have liaised closely with Iarnród Éireann in considering the options for the future development of the rail network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of meetings with chairman of CIE on 9 September and 22 October 2002, the agenda for which was the overall deterioration in the finances of the group and the reform of public transport generally, he raised specific concerns about the losses being incurred by the rail freight business and he informed me the matter would be considered by the board at a forthcoming meeting. On 6 November the matter was considered by the board and I conveyed my view that no decisions should be taken on the withdrawal <Col N="153" /> of freight services until the completion of the strategic rail review.</P>
    <P>The board of CIE at its meeting on that day agreed to postpone any decisions in this regard. For my part, I will take full account of the findings and recommendations of the review before taking any decisions on the future of Iarnród Éireann and any of its services.</P>
    <P>The strategic rail review was commissioned by my Department earlier this year. The primary purpose of the review is to provide the Government with a basis for establishing a strategic policy framework for the future development of the rail sector in Ireland. More specifically, the consultants carrying out the review are required to prepare a strategic framework for future rail development in Ireland over the next 20 years, quantify the broad financial requirements necessary to implement the recommended strategy and assess the costs and benefits of the recommended strategy.</P>
    <P>Following an extensive nationwide consultation exercise on the terms of reference for the study, my Department received more than 150 written submissions with regard to rail issues in Ireland. I understand that the submissions received include proposals relating to developing a western rail corridor, which would link Sligo with Cork via Claremorris, Athenry and Limerick and would create potential for the future development of rail services to Letterkenny and Derry. Proposals with regard to the development of the Limerick to Rosslare line were also received.</P>
    <P>While the provision of a commuter rail service to Galway city has also been proposed, I have had no meetings with Iarnród Éireann on the matter. I am informed that other submissions relate to proposed improvements in the speed and reliability of inter-city rail services, proposals for the re-opening of old rail lines and for the construction of new lines and spurs to the current rail network,</P>
    <P>These and all other rail proposals received are being assessed as part of the strategic rail review which will make recommendations in this regard. The strategic rail review, which is being carried out by a consortium led by Booz Allen Hamilton, is examining the long-term rail requirements for the country as a whole in the light of the emerging spatial planning and regional development policies and local land use and transportation studies. The review will embrace both rail freight and rail passenger services and will cover both urban, commuter and inter-regional rail services and how to improve journey times on the network. The review is due to be completed by the end of this year and has involved expenditure of some &euro;330,000 to date.</P>
    <P>Central to the review is an examination of the potential for rail freight services, including an assessment of the scope to transfer a greater amount of road freight to the rail network. In this regard, I understand that cost-benefit analysis work is being undertaken and that the question of <Col N="154" /> support mechanisms comparable to those in other countries is also being considered.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann has informed me that the recent removal of the crossover at Athenry is an intrinsic part of a project designed to modernise the signalling system on the Galway to Dublin line. When the project is completed, I understand that it will lead to improvements in terms of comfort, safety and speed on the route. To have altered the design would have seriously delayed the completion of the work, thereby further delaying improvements which will be to the benefit of all users of the line. As the work is part funded by the European Commission, any delay could have also jeopardised that funding.</P>

      <Quest>the specific proposals the Government has for the upgrading of the bus fleets and the provision of bus priorities in Dublin and other cities in regard to the commitment given in An Agreed Programme for Government; if money has been allocated for this purpose in his Department's Estimates for 2003; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a major programme of upgrading of the bus fleets in Dublin and the provincial cities which has helped to enhance the quality of such services. In the case of Dublin, 484 buses have been purchased in recent years, of which 241 are replacement and 243 are additional. In the provincial cities, the entire regular urban bus fleet of Bus Éireann in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford is now low floor. In respect of 2003, I am awaiting proposals from Dublin Bus for additional fleet capacity.</P>
      <P>One of my priorities for the public transport sector is to continue to improve the position of buses as regards traffic priority. For Dublin, the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, receives a grant from my Department for traffic management and bus priority measures throughout the greater Dublin area, GDA. It is now the responsibility of the Office of the Director of Traffic in Dublin City Council to implement bus priority measures based on a programme of work and project specification agreed with the DTO.</P>
      <P>To date, nine QBCs have been implemented in the Dublin area, amounting to approximately 100 km of bus priority. Extensions to existing QBCs and additional QBCs and bus priority measures are planned for the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has also been supporting the development of bus priority in the main cities outside of Dublin through its representation on the steering committees for land use and transportation studies which are at various stages of completion in Galway, Limerick and Waterford. All these studies deal with the issue of providing bus priority measures. Preliminary studies of two green routes in Cork have already been com<Col N="155" /> missioned by the city council, and my Department will provide funding for the carrying out of this work in 2003.</P>
    <P>The construction of QBCs in Dublin is primarily funded by my Department through traffic management grants administered by the DTO. There is a &euro;40 million provision in the Estimates for 2003 for the funding for traffic management measures.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals at present to introduce road pricing as a means of managing demand for transport and reducing traffic congestion in urban areas, including Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office's transport strategy for 2000 to 2016 for the greater Dublin area, A Platform for Change, is based on two interdependent elements: demand management and public transport infrastructure-service improvements, and will be reinforced by complementary land use policies. The strategy aims to reduce growth in the demand for transport, especially private transport, and to reduce the need for car commuting by improving the reliability, availability and quality of public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, the DTO has commissioned a detailed demand management strategy for the greater Dublin area which will consider, <i>inter alia,</i> the potential and practicability of road pricing. Road pricing or congestion charging is, however, only one of range of measures which will be considered in the course of this work. Others include land use policies, fiscal/taxation measures, parking control and charging, mobility management, traffic management measures, use of information technology and re-organisation of work practices. <Col N="156" /> The key aim is to identify an appropriate mix of measures which will change behaviour and reduce growth in travel. Any decisions about demand management mechanisms that may be suitable for Dublin must await the findings of this comprehensive demand management strategy.</P>

      <P>The Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, has been given statutory responsibility for the implementation of an integrated ticketing system for initial deployment in the greater Dublin area. The RPA has set a target date of 2005 for completion of this project. I have, however, requested that the RPA examine all options to expedite the delivery of integrated ticketing with a view to bringing forward the proposed launch date. I have also asked it to bring forward interim proposals for next year and the RPA is considering this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development costs of the full integrated ticketing project are estimated to amount to &euro;26.9 million. In the 2003 Estimates for my Department, &euro;3.6 million have been earmarked for integrated ticketing to enable the RPA to proceed to the next phase which will deal with the design and procurement of the system, including <Col N="157" /> consideration of the potential for procuring the system on a public private partnership basis. The procurement strategy decided upon will determine the appropriate involvement of the private sector and estimated Exchequer financial support for the whole project.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66, 68, 79, 116, 123 and 131 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has recently received the outline business case for phase one of the Dublin metro from the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA. The Government agreed in January 2002 that a phased approach should be taken to the development of the metro and approved proposals for the RPA to commence the procurement process for phase one which involves a line from Dublin Airport and Blanchardstown through the city centre to Shanganagh. The outline business case includes a cost-benefit analysis, a financing model, system options, the estimated cost over the lifetime of the project, and the timescales involved. The outline business case and <Col N="158" /> cost-benefit aspects of the project are being evaluated in my Department and I intend to bring proposals to Government early in the new year.</P>
    <P>The Government decided that the metro would be procured by means of public private partnership, PPP, with the RPA acting as the public sector client. As such, the cost of the metro will only become clear when the market bids are received.</P>
    <P>The precise route of the line to the airport, and of the location of stations, will be decided only following a public consultation exercise which the RPA will carry out.</P>
    <P>Following the Government decision in January, the RPA initiated the procurement process for the metro by conducting a pre-qualification exercise which attracted a considerable number of responses from interested parties. The RPA also engaged technical, legal and financial advisers to assist with the outline business case and prepare documentation in readiness for the invitation to tender stage.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transportation Office's strategy, A Platform for Change, addressed the issue of the preferred method of serving the airport with a rail-based public transport link. It considered that metro represented the best option. I have received no proposals from the board of CIE for a heavy rail link to the airport.</P>
    <P>A provision of &euro;9 million euro is included in the 2003 Estimates to allow the RPA to continue the development of the metro proposals.</P>

      <P>A total of 13 submissions were received by the due closing date of 31 October from the following Irish and overseas companies and consortia in response to the call in early August by my Department for &ldquo;expressions of interest&rdquo; in the concept of a second independent terminal at Dublin Airport: HBG Ascon Limited, Grupo Dragados, Metropark Limited (Consortium); Hochtief Airport GMBH, Shelbourne Development Limited (Consortium); Fichtner Airports GMBH, URS Ireland (Consortium); Ambac Assurance UK Limited; Irish Association of International Express Carriers; Vinci Park Ser<Col N="159" /> vices Ireland Limited; Laing O'Rourke, Metropark Limited. (Consortium); Ryanair Limited; CityJet Limited; HRL Morrison and Company Limited; Dublin Airport Terminal 2 Limited; Alterra Partners Limited; Peel Airports Limited.</P>
      <P>I announced yesterday the establishment of a small panel of experts to conduct a professional and independent assessment of these submissions. Mr. Paddy Mullarkey, former Secretary General of the Department of Finance, is the chairman of the panel and he is assisted by experts in the aviation-airports sector from the United Kingdom and the United States.</P>
      <P>The work of the panel, which I expect to be completed before the end of January, will assist me in framing a report to Government on this issue. The panel will examine and assess the &ldquo;expressions of interest&rdquo; in the first instance.</P>
      <P>The current exercise is not a tender process but rather an informal canvass of the market for ideas which will assist me in determining if the concept of a second independent or competing terminal would deliver significant benefits. The responses received will also enable me to determine what further actions I may need to take to allow this concept to be further progressed, including the possible initiation in due course of a formal public tendering process for the provision of such a facility.</P>
      <P>The published notice which called for &ldquo; expressions of interest&rdquo; set out a number of areas which interested parties were required to address in their submissions. These included a clear specification of the precise nature of their proposed concept, the preferred location for a second terminal, the benefits for airlines and other airport users, etc. The Department was not prescriptive regarding these issues. It was entirely a matter for interested parties to address as they saw fit each of the areas covered in the notice, including the financing and economic dimensions of their proposals.</P>

      <P>A provisional licence may be granted to a person who wishes to learn how to drive a vehicle to pass a driving test. This licence provisionally allows a person to drive that vehicle in a public place. Over the years various changes have been made to the regulatory conditions under which provisional licences have effect. I am considering whether further changes are desirable in this regard. I am reviewing the provision whereby holders of second provisional licences for cars are not required to be accompanied by a person who holds a driving licence for that category of vehicle. All other provisional licence holders other than drivers of motorcycles and work vehicles must be accompanied by a qualified driver at all times when driving in a public place.</P>
      <P>However, I am considering renaming provisional licences to reflect their reformed status.</P>

      <P>The Government is strongly pursuing the implementation of its Strategy for Road Safety, 1998-2002, the first ever national road safety strategy to be adopted by the Government. The strategy has prioritised a systematic and co-ordinated set of measures for preventing and reducing road accidents. It established quantified targets for achieving its objectives, the principal of which was to reduce road deaths and serious injuries by at least 20% each by 2002 relative to 1997. Priority is accorded by the strategy to actions targeted at speeding, alcohol, seat belt wearing and vulnerable road users. A timetable for key actions in these and other areas is also set out.</P>
      <P>The Government strategy is monitored by the high level group on road safety. The group has produced a series of annual progress reports. The fourth progress report was published recently. Copies of all four reports have been circulated to all Deputies and are also available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>All actions outlined in the strategy have been progressed and most have been completed. The fourth progress report outlines those actions which have been already completed, those which are due for completion by the end of this year, and those which are ongoing. Those which are due for completion include the making of regulations to introduce a requirement to carry a driving licence, the carrying out of a further speed and seatbelt survey, and the carrying out of research into drugs and driving. Work is at an advanced stage in all these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirement to carry a driving licence is being introduced on 1 January 2003. A further speed and seatbelt survey has been carried out by <Col N="161" /> the National Roads Authority and will be published shortly. The extensive survey into drugs and driving conducted during 2000 and 2001 by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety will identify true trends in the types of drugs being taken, their combination with alcohol and the extent of polydrug use. The confirmation analysis of specimens will continue into 2002 and the data collection and report is also scheduled for publication shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74, 97, 107, 121, 389 and 393 together.</P>
      <P>As provided for in the national development plan, a number of major road improvement projects will be undertaken by the National Roads Authority as public private partnerships, based on user tolls. User tolls are now in widespread use throughout the developed and developing world and are especially favoured where rapid expansion in major road networks is required. They are a considerably more widely used instrument of roads financing than shadow tolls and more readily permit the transfer of economic risk, which is desirable in PPP projects. While the use of shadow tolls has not been ruled out, road user tolling is, on the basis of the above considerations, more likely to be relied upon in the earlier stages of national roads PPP development.</P>
      <P>The NRA's current PPP programme comprises 11 high quality projects spread throughout the country. The position at present in relation to these projects is that one, the second Westlink bridge on the M50, is under construction and is expected to be completed next year; one is at final negotiation stage, (Kilcock-Kinnegad), and a preferred bidder has been selected; initial tendering has been completed and bidders shortlisted in respect of two of the projects, N25 Waterford bypass and Dundalk western bypass; one is at tender stage with tenders due to be submitted during December 2002, N8 Rathcormac-Fermoy bypass; one, M3 Clonee to Kells, is at oral hearing stage; the remaining five schemes are at an advanced design stage which includes the preparation of statutory documentation for publication.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that these projects will involve a total private sector investment of approximately &euro;1.27 billion, which is in line with the monetary target set in the NDP. The exact figure will depend on the outcome of negotiations on the individual projects. The total cost of the 11 projects is estimated at &euro;3.2 billion.</P>
      <P>This level of private sector finance is of critical importance for the funding of the national roads development programme. It will ensure the earlier provision of much needed higher quality roads than would otherwise be the case. Through PPPs, private sector innovation will be harnessed in the areas of scheme design, construction and long-term operation and maintenance.</P>
      <P>The roads involved will remain in public ownership. The private sector will design, build, part-finance and operate the schemes for a 30 year concession period after which they will return for operation and maintenance to the public sector.</P>
      <P>Each PPP project is subject, in accordance with Department of Finance guidelines, to rigorous assessment and evaluation by the NRA and engineering, financial and legal consultants which it has engaged to advise on the PPP programme. The NRA is also considering the scope for additional user-tolled PPP schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" />The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll by-laws, and to enter into toll agreements with private investors is vested in the National Roads Authority under Part V of the Roads Act, 1993, as amended by the Planning and Development Act, 2000. Toll charges are determined in accordance with procedures contained in the Roads Act, 1993, as amended, which provide for public display-consultation of proposals to apply tolls and the holding of public oral hearings in the event of objections being made on toll scheme proposals.</P>
    <P>As regards the system of tolling to be used, I have already publicly stated that my policy is one of using a method that utilises the most up-to-date electronic technology to ensure that there is a rapid movement of traffic and traffic tailbacks are eliminated. I have discussed the need to incorporate the electronic tolling system on all proposed toll roads with the National Roads Authority and I intend to continue these discussions over the coming months.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the modest level of the tolls to be charged, combined with the high quality of the new roads and the greatly improved transport service they will provide, will ensure that the routes are attractive to the vast bulk of inter-urban traffic.</P>

      <P>The evaluation of the public transport priority of the national development plan economic and social infrastructure operational programme was prepared for the NDP-CSF evaluation unit, which is under the aegis of the Department of Finance. Copies of the report have been laid before the Oireachtas and are available to the public at www.ndp.ie or by contacting the NDP-CSF evaluation unit.</P>
      <P>The report recognised the significant progress made in recent years in the expansion of public transport capacity, especially in the greater Dublin area. However, it noted that the modal shares of public transport and the private car have remained reasonably static between 1997 and 2001. Further capacity has been added to the public transport system in 2002 and further increases are planned in 2003 and beyond. The report recognises that in the absence of recent public transport investment, congestion would have been worse.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77, 106, 109 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, the State body responsible for the development of Luas, that the infrastructure contractors have indicated a delay of four months on the original contractual completion dates of October 2003 for the Tallaght to Abbey Street line, December 2003 for the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green line and March 2004 for the Abbey Street to Connolly Station line. It is anticipated that construction will be completed in early 2004 and passenger services will commence after the necessary commissioning and safety checking of the system have been completed.</P>
      <P>The RPA is monitoring closely developments in the construction schedule and is in regular contact with the contractors to review developments to ensure the earliest possible completion dates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant progress has been made to date on the construction of the system. Enabling and utilities diversion works are almost completed, the property acquisition programme is well advanced, construction and fitting out of the Red Cow depot <Col N="165" /> has been completed and the Sandyford depot is on target for completion in early 2003. In addition, all 26 trams for the Tallaght to Connolly Station lines have been delivered and are undergoing testing at present, while the 14 trams for the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green line will begin arriving in February 2003. Track laying is proceeding and overhead cabling installation is due to start shortly. A test track of 3.5 kilometres has been constructed at Red Cow and testing and commissioning is taking place there on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>The RPA awarded the operating franchise for all three lines to Connex Transport Limited. The required budget for the capital and current costs of the project, sourced from EU funds, Exchequer funds and borrowing, are in place. </P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 96 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="166" />On 7 November 2002 I made a statement to the public transport partnership forum in which I outlined in detail my proposals for the restructuring of the CIE group. I have no plans to privatise any of the three CIE operating companies. Instead, I propose to dissolve CIE and establish Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann as independent commercial State companies with strong commercially focused boards. Arrangements will be made to redeploy staff who work in the holding company.</P>
    <P>In my statement I also indicated that I am anxious to deal with these issues on a partnership basis but that it was also important that we made speedy progress. The restructuring proposals will be the subject of detailed discussions with the trade unions.</P>
    <P>A technical report on the financial and other implications of restructuring CIE has been prepared by consultants for my Department. I will be briefing the CIE board and the trade unions shortly on the content of that report. Following this briefing I intend to publish the report.</P>
    <P>I also intend to establish a restructuring implementation group, reporting to me and including representatives of the Departments of Transport and Finance, CIE and its three operating subsidiaries to drive forward the restructuring process, based on policy decisions taken by Government.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the CIE restructuring proposals will take account of the provisions of Section 14 of the Transport (Re-organisation of CIE) Act, 1986, which provides for the transfer back to CIE of the employees of a subsidiary company where that subsidiary is wound up. It is not proposed to wind up any of the subsidiary companies.</P>
    <P>The financial implications of the restructuring of CIE will be addressed in the course of the detailed preparatory work which is being undertaken by my Department and CIE. However, given the constraints on the Exchequer, it would be my objective to complete the restructuring without imposing any significant additional cost burden on either the Exchequer or the CIE group.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
      <Quest>the number of commercial or private flights and military flights that passed through Irish airspace during 2001 and 2002 to date; the total revenue raised by the Irish Aviation Authority in respect of fees charged to private or commercial flights; the reason no fees are charged in respect of military aircraft; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Aviation Authority provides air traffic control and communications services to aircraft <Col N="167" /> which pass through Irish controlled airspace &ndash;<i>en route &ndash;</i>and aircraft landing and taking off from Irish airports &ndash; terminal. The Irish Aviation Authority controls some 100,000 sq. m., of international airspace in addition to domestic airspace.</P>
      <P>According to the Irish Aviation Authority, a total of 465,204 <i>en route </i>civil and 6,895 <i>en route</i> military aircraft flights flew through total Irish-controlled airspace in 2001. The figures for 2002 to end September were 339,707 civil flights and 6,881 military flights. A much smaller proportion of military <i>en route</i> flights fly through domestic airspace with the permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, while a smaller proportion again land at Irish airports. The total revenue raised by the IAA in respect of <i>en route,</i> terminal and communications charges to civil flights in total Irish-controlled airspace was &euro;77.3 million in 2001 and &euro;60.9 million to end-September 2002.</P>
      <P>Under a Eurocontrol &ndash; European organisation for the safety of air navigation &ndash; multilateral agreement to which Ireland is a party, various categories of flights &ndash; flights under visual flight rules, flights performed by small aircraft, flights performed for the transport of Heads of State and search and rescue flights &ndash; are exempt from paying <i>en route</i> charges. In the case of other categories &ndash; military flights, training flights, flights performed to test air navigation equipment and circular flights &ndash; states have the option to exempt such flights from payment of the <i>en route</i> charge. In common with most Eurocontrol member states, Ireland exempts all such flights, including military, from payment of the <i>en route</i> charge. As a result of this arrangement, the IAA costs for military flights are met from my Department's Vote.</P>
      <P>Ireland also exempts military aircraft flights from payment of the communications charge and the IAA costs for those charges are also met from my Department's Vote. Efforts to collect this charge in the early 1990s were unsuccessful and, following advice from the Attorney General, debts then outstanding were written off with the agreement of the Department of Finance and a decision taken to cease charging the communications fee to military aircraft.</P>
      <P>Regarding the terminal charge for air traffic control services for military aircraft, this is a matter for the Irish Aviation Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87, 128 and 151 together.</P>
      <P>The provision in the Estimates of just over &euro;1 billion for national roads in 2003 will maintain investment in the national roads programme at a high level. Investment in the programme has grown rapidly in recent years. The 2003 provision of &euro;1 billion is approximately three times the level of investment in 1997 and twice the 1999 level.</P>
      <P>The 2003 provision will fund construction on major projects throughout the country, such as the Dublin Port tunnel, the south-eastern motorway, major schemes on the M1 and N11, the Kildare bypass, major schemes in Cork and Limerick, and planning and design on other projects.</P>
      <P>This level of funding will maintain good progress in the implementation of the national roads programme set out in the national development plan, which provides for investment of &euro;6.75 billion in national roads over the plan period. Investment in national road improvements in 2000 to 2002 will be approximately &euro;2.62 billion, which is more than 12% in excess of that provided for in the NDP.</P>
      <P>This has funded the completion of 23 major schemes, including such major projects as the Dunleer/Dundalk route, M1, the southern cross route, M50, the Croom bypass, N20, the Kilmacthomas bypass, N25, the Blackpool bypass, N20, and completion or ongoing work this year on some 26 major projects with a combined length of over 200 km.</P>
      <P>Good progress has also been made in the roll-out of the NRA's PPP programme. The current position on PPP projects is as follows: the second Westlink bridge on the M50 is under construction and is expected to be completed next year; the Kilcock/Kinegad project is at the final negotiation stage and a preferred bidder has been selected; initial tendering has been completed and bidders shortlisted in respect of two of the projects &ndash; the N25 Waterford bypass and Dundalk western bypass; the N8 Rathcormac/Fermoy bypass is at tender stage, with tenders due to be submitted during December 2002; the M3 Clonee to Kells project is at oral hearing stage; and the remaining five schemes are at an advanced design stage which includes the preparation of statutory documentation for publication. The NRA is also considering the scope for the extension of its PPP programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="170" />Increases in the cost of the roads programme and the changed economic and budgetary circumstances mean that some projects will take longer to implement than originally planned. However, it is hoped that with many projects reaching completion in 2003 and with the advance of PPP projects, a number of schemes will be able to commence next year.</P>
    <P>The detailed programming of the work involved in the implementation of the NDP national roads programme, including the allocation of funding for individual projects, is a matter for the NRA within the overall funding available.</P>
    <P>The position on the overall capital funding levels for the national roads programme beyond 2003 is that my Department and the Department of Finance are considering the adoption of a multi-annual funding framework for the programme. Funding levels for 2004 and beyond will be determined in that context. On the basis of a continuation of the current high level of Exchequer funding and private finance of more than &euro;1 billion, substantial funding would be available over the period 2004 to 2006 for new project starts. Possible sources of additional funding, including through the National Development Finance Agency, are also being considered.</P>
    <P>As will be evident from the provision of &euro;1 billion for 2003, the Government is committed to maintaining investment in the national roads programme at a high level and to upgrading the national roads network as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Significant Exchequer and EU funds have been invested in recent years to upgrade the rolling stock available to Iarnród Éireann and increase the capacity of the network. CIE has or will shortly have on order rolling stock to the value of approximately &euro;340 million. This new rolling stock will provide a higher quality and capacity of service on DART, suburban and inter-city services. I recently approved an Exchequer contribution of &euro;33 million in the current year towards the largest ever carriage investment in the history of Irish railways. This will assist in the purchase of 67 new mainline rail carriages by Iarnród Éireann. I also recently approved the provision of approximately &euro;21 million in Exchequer funds in the current year towards the acquisition of a further 36 new <Col N="171" /> DART cars. Further funding will be available to Iarnród Éireann at various stages as the construction of these carriages progresses.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department is in discussions with Iarnród Éireann regarding further rolling stock acquisition. Decisions with regard to further Exchequer investment in rolling stock will be taken in the context of the strategic priorities identified in the strategic rail review and the financial resources available to my Department and Iarnród Éireann.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>As provided in the programme for Government, we will seek to secure a viable long-term future for all our State companies without any ideological preconceptions. The issue of the most appropriate form of ownership or structure for State companies will be dealt with on a case by case basis. We are also committed to ensuring that public enterprise is managed in the spirit of social partnership with a view to achieving optimum service delivery and value for the public.</P>
      <P>In the case of Aer Rianta, the programme for Government also sets out two initiatives regarding the State airports which are relevant to the structure of the company going forward. These are the commitments to ensure that Shannon and Cork airports have greater autonomy and independence and to examine proposals for a new independent terminal at Dublin airport and to progress them if the evidence suggests that such a terminal will deliver significant benefits.</P>
      <P>In the case of Shannon and Cork airports, I have already made it clear that the issue of greater autonomy is being considered solely in the context of continued State ownership of those airports. I have given detailed replies to other questions today on these matters.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the contents of the recent Fitzpatrick Associates report of the NDP roads investment cost escalations; if the cost escalation of the 1999 NDP roads investment programme is, in monetary terms, the single difference between the estimate for roads investment started in the national development plan in 1999 and the total estimates for the current NDP roads programme as calculated in the Fitzpatrick report; and the amount in monetary terms which is related to construction inflation, to land compulsory purchase order inflation, to initial underestimation, and to scope changes or the addition of new projects to the NDP, with reference to this cost.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 390 together.</P>
      <P>The report by Fitzpatrick Associates on behalf of the NDP-CSF evaluation unit of the Department of Finance reviews the implementation to date of the national roads programme provided for in the NDP. The report highlights the increased cost, &euro;15.8 billion, of completing the programme based on NRA data and makes a number of recommendations in relation to the management of the programme, including in relation to cost estimation and control.</P>
      <P>The increased cost of the programme is due to some underestimation in 1999 costs which were based on updating national road needs study data; construction cost inflation in the period 1999 to 2001 estimated at 15% per annum in 1999 and 2000 and 9.5% in 2001; exceptional items such as the upgrade of the N9, higher land costs on the south eastern motorway and additional costs on the Dublin Port tunnel; higher land acquisition costs, particularly in Dublin and adjacent to urban areas; the availability of more accurate and detailed estimates as projects progressed from preliminary to more detailed planning. As the updated estimated cost is based on individual project estimates, it is not possible to provide accurate estimates of the extent to which each of the factors outlined above contributed to the overall increased cost of the programme.</P>
      <P>In relation to the difference between the estimated cost of projects at outline design stage and tender stage, the report noted that a range of increase from 5% to 95% was observed in the case of five projects which the consultants reviewed. The main factors identified were construction cost inflation and significant scope changes in some projects. The 95% figure referred to relates to one project and does not represent an average for the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report also noted that it is understandable that the initial indicative estimate of cost may differ from the cost at tender stage as a project moves through the various planning stages and more accurate information becomes available. It should also be noted that the report acknowledges that cost control procedures at the level of individual projects appear adequate. Recom<Col N="173" /> mendations in the report to strengthen cost control at programme level will be pursued by my Department and the NRA.</P>
    <P>The increased cost of the programme &ndash; combined with the changed economic and budgetary conditions &ndash; will impact on the pace of its implementation. Some projects will, of necessity, take longer to implement than originally planned and some reprogramming by the NRA will therefore be required. As a result, the ambitious upgrade programme provided for in the NDP may take somewhat longer to implement but the Government is committed to doing so.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the strategic framework set out in the NDP for the upgrading of the national road network is generally recognised as urgently necessary to ensure that we have a road network that is capable of providing for the safe and efficient movement of persons and goods by road. The poor state of the national road network is generally recognised, including most recently in a report by the competitiveness council, as a potential constraint on future economic and social development and the achievement of more balanced regional development.</P>
    <P>I do not propose, therefore, to carry out an audit or review of the programme as suggested by the Deputy. However, I will be seeking, with the NRA, to ensure that we get maximum value for money for the high level of investment in the road network. In this context, all major road projects will continue to be subject to cost/benefit analysis and to assessment and evaluation in accordance with the Department of Finance guidelines on the appraisal and management of capital projects.</P>

      <P>The 2003 Estimates for my Department show the significant investment that is being made in the provision of transport infrastructure and in the support for services. The Estimate provides for expenditure of over &euro;1.8 billion in the coming year. It is a clear confirmation of the Government's ongoing commitment to delivering infrastructure projects that will be the foundation for future expansion and economic growth. Despite the present difficult economic climate it represents an increase of almost 3% over the comparable 2002 abridged Estimate figure. This enables me to progress the development of key projects in the roads, public transport and aviation sectors. The Deputy will be aware that I outlined details of these projects in my speech on the Estimates last week.</P>

      <P>At my meeting with the board of Aer Lingus on 31 October I commended the directors, management and staff of the airline for the turnaround in the company's finances which is a reflection of the clear and committed efforts of all in addressing the serious situation which faced the airline in 2001.</P>
      <P>I acknowledged the continued focus on efficiency improvements and cost control and I endorsed the strong focus of management and staff on putting in place a new culture in the airline which has led to the creation of a flexible, viable and competitive airline capable of meeting the challenges of the volatile and changing aviation market. I also welcomed the new route operations and new fares initiatives, which are significant both to the company in maintaining its position in the various markets and also to the overall economy. I indicated that all this progress was essential to restore profitability as the airline needs a strong balance sheet given it's vulnerability to external shocks which cannot be easily predicted.</P>
      <P>With regard to the future of Aer Lingus, I recalled to the board the previous Government's decision in October 2001 to facilitate private sector and staff investment in the company to support its future development provided the survival plan was fully implemented. I stated that as the company moves into a new phase and as agreement has been reached with the unions on the summary terms of a proposed new employee share option plan, ESOP, I consider that the time is fast approaching to assess the future options for the airline taking account of the previous Government's decision. The chairman and I undertook to address and discuss all the issues relevant to this matter quickly.</P>
      <P>My officials will be consulting with the company on this matter over the coming weeks and I expect to be in a position to bring a proposal to Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the framework of the national development plan a wide range of initiatives has been taken to upgrade transport infrastructure and services and reduce congestion. The plan sets out a strategic framework for the development of transport infrastructure and services and provides for investment of almost &euro;10 billion between 2000 and 2006.</P>
      <P>In the greater Dublin area, the NDP provides for investment of approximately &euro;2 billion in public transport and traffic management. Since 1997, demonstrable improvements in public transport arrangements and services have been implemented. Dublin Bus has purchased more than 600 new buses, Bus Éireann has increased its capacity on GDA commuter routes by 40%, there are now nine QBCs in place in Dublin and work is continuing on further routes, some 160 km of dedicated cycleways have been provided, traffic management/control systems have been upgraded, taxi numbers have increased significantly, major capacity improvements have been made to rail services, and progress has been made on developing the Luas system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 76 new diesel rail cars will further expand capacity on the outer suburban network around Dublin from next year. Capacity improvements will flow from the improved signalling and track work on the approaches to Heuston Station, the provision of additional platforms, the allocation of additional rail cars and increasing train lengths during rush hour periods. Further DART capacity improvements are also planned, as is the <Col N="176" /> purchase of another 36 DART cars. Funds are also being provided for the development of an integrated ticketing system for Dublin by 2005 as well as a real-time passenger information system.</P>
    <P>Major road projects to a total value of approx. &euro;1.4 billion are under construction in the Dublin city and county area, including the Dublin port tunnel, the south-eastern motorway, and the second bridge at the West Link.</P>
    <P>These measures in public transport, traffic management and road infrastructure will have a major beneficial impact on traffic flows in Dublin in the short to medium term. They are also part of the long-term strategy to address the city's transport needs. The Dublin Transportation Office policy document, A Platform for Change, sets out a comprehensive integrated strategy to respond to the transportation needs of the greater Dublin area, GDA, in the period to 2016. It is providing the framework for the development of Dublin's transport network. The Government has already formally approved the procurement process for a metro in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority has made good progress with the roll-out of the national roads programme, including the development of bypasses, which have helped to alleviate congestion in many towns throughout the country. In 2000, the Department of Environment and Local Government also introduced regional traffic management grants for the first time to the city councils of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. Under the regional traffic management schemes, improvements are undertaken on a variety of measures, including pedestrian and cycle facilities, traffic signalling, bus lanes and traffic calming in residential areas. Studies on land use and transportation have also been completed or are under way in Limerick, Cork, Galway and Waterford. Urban bus services in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford have also been updated and improved.</P>
    <P>The Government has been proactive in responding to the challenge of traffic congestion and has demonstrated its commitment to transforming our transport infrastructure by providing unprecedented levels of investment since 1997. The establishment of an integrated Department of Transport will bring a renewed focus to our efforts to upgrade transport infrastructure and services in urban areas throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>The rural transport initiative, RTI, was introduced by my predecessor in 2001 to provide funding for voluntary and community organisations and community partnerships to address the particular transport needs of their rural area by actively engaging in the provision of transport services. The initiative is being managed by Area Development Management Limited, ADM, on behalf of my Department.</P>
      <P>Eight of the applicant community transport groups under the initiative were considered by ADM to be sufficiently well developed in their business plans at the time of their initial appraisal to be selected for operational funding in 2001. Most of these groups are providing or soon will be providing rural transport services in counties Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Kerry, Kildare, Kilkenny, Leitrim, Meath, Offaly and Tipperary. I understand that some 80 new transport services have been established to date under the RTI.</P>
      <P>Rural transport proposals from a further 24 community groups went through an initial pre-development funding phase and they have recently been approved for operational funding. The groups selected represent counties Cavan, Cork, Donegal, Dublin &ndash; Fingal &ndash; Galway, Laois, Limerick, Longford, Mayo, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary, Waterford, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow. I am advised that the assessment process in respect of two other projects remains to be completed.</P>
      <P>The operational phase of the rural transport initiative was formally launched last Friday, 22 November, during a two day training event organised by ADM for the successful community transport groups. Some &euro;3 million will be spent on the RTI this year and a similar amount is earmarked for 2003, when the pilot initiative is due to end.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental committee under the chairmanship of my Department was established in 2001 with the remit of bringing forward options for the development of rural public transport policy. The committee commissioned a study on this subject which I understand is nearing completion, and I expect to be presented with the findings of the study before the end of the year. This study, together with the experience gained from the RTI, will enable me to formulate appropriate policies for rural transport for the period beyond 2003.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 406 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has undertaken substantial investment in public transport, roads infrastructure and traffic management programmes in order to meet the transport needs of the greater Dublin area. One of the objectives of this investment is to ensure the vitality of the city centre. The Dublin Transportation Office's policy document, A Platform for Change, sets out a comprehensive integrated strategy to respond to the transportation needs of the greater Dublin area, GDA, in the period to 2016.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specific traffic management measures such as those intended to deal with seasonal congestion problems are a matter for the relevant local authorities, the CIE companies and the Dublin Transportation Office, as well as the Garda Síochána. As is now usual, these authorities are working together on the seventh annual Operation Free<Col N="179" /> flow. Operation Freeflow 2002 will start on 1 December 2002 and run until 6 January 2003 in the greater Dublin area. It is aimed at managing and controlling traffic congestion in the Dublin region and at improving public transport services during that period.</P>
    <P>The initiative has been planned under the auspices of the Dublin Transportation Office in close co-operation with the Garda Síochána, the office of the director of traffic in Dublin City Council, the other Dublin local authorities, and transport service providers over the past two months. This process has been geared towards December when the increase in car volume and shoppers is traditionally at its peak.</P>
    <P>The majority of disruptive Luas works in the greater Dublin area will cease for the duration of the operation. No new road works will commence after 25 November 2002 and, where feasible, existing road works on the main arterial and orbital routes will cease for the duration of the operation. The initiative also involves the provision of late night DART services and Christmas Nitelink services.</P>
    <P>An additional 110 Garda probationers will be re-deployed to the Dublin region to boost existing traffic resources and the Garda pedal cycle unit will also be deployed in the city centre to assist with traffic congestion.</P>

      <P>Irish Rail is about to start taking delivery of a fleet of 80 new diesel railcars, the first of which are due to arrive in the first week in December. Of these, 76 units will be allocated to Dublin and 32 will be used to service the route from Dundalk and Drogheda to Dublin. Their introduction into ser<Col N="180" /> vice in the summer of 2003 will see capacity on the route increase by 43%.</P>
      <P>The DTO strategy, A Platform for Change, identifies the need to increase track capacity between Connolly and Howth Junction on the northern suburban line. The strategy envisages implementation of this project in the period to 2010.</P>
      <P>The strategic rail review commissioned by my Department and expected to be published early next year will provide a framework for the implementation of this and other rail projects in the coming years.</P>

      <P>Significant investment has been made to date in public transport in the Cork area and further investment is planned in the future. Some 54 new buses have been purchased for the Cork bus fleet under the national development plan. This has resulted in the expansion of existing routes and the introduction of new routes. Delivery of a further ten new buses is expected over the coming weeks. Some 80% of the city and suburban fleet is now low-floor fully accessible to ease access for mobility impaired persons. The average age of the fleet has been reduced from 11 years in the 1990s to four years.</P>
      <P>A significant upgrade of the trackwork and stations is taking place on the Cork to Cobh route. Four new diesel railcars to upgrade the capacity on the Cork to Cobh line will be introduced on this line in 2003. In addition, Irish Rail is about to place an order for 67 new mainline rail carriages for delivery in 2005. A number of these carriages are earmarked for use on the Dublin to Cork route.</P>
      <P>I also intend to make funding available in 2003 for the introduction of quality bus corridors &ndash;&ldquo;green routes&rdquo;&ndash; in Cork, the first such bus priority initiative to be funded by my Department outside Dublin.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of the problem of crowding on inter-city routes at peak periods, and am conscious of the discomfort and inconvenience this causes to passengers.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has a statutory responsibility for ensuring the safety of its passengers. It is, therefore, a matter for the company to satisfy itself that the number of passengers being carried in any particular train or carriage does not compromise overall passenger safety.</P>
      <P>Data provided by Iarnród Éireann shows that over the period from 1994 to 2001, passenger numbers on inter-city services increased from 7.8 million to an estimated 11.3 million. In order to address this growth in traffic, significant funding has been, and continues to be, made available to Iarnród Éireann for investment to improve the safety of the network, increase the passenger capacity of the system and improve the quality, reliability and speed of services.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann expects to place a contract in the coming weeks for the supply of 67 new carriages for use on inter-city routes. The total cost is &euro;117 million and funding is being provided under the NDP. The vehicles are scheduled for delivery in late 2005 and following normal testing and commissioning procedures will enter service.</P>
      <P>In addition, the 80 diesel railcars for use on suburban services, which will begin to be delivered from December, will allow a number of mark 3 push/pull trains, currently in use on Dublin outer suburban routes, to be transferred to inter-city routes. These two purchases will significantly reduce the age profile of the inter-city stock, increase available capacity and help to alleviate the present crowding difficulties.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the railway inspectorate of my Department continues to monitor developments in regard to crowding on trains. The inspectorate has been in contact with Iarnród Éireann on a number of occasions drawing its attention to the importance of keeping the issue of crowding under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann has commissioned an independent review of its strategy for managing crowding <Col N="182" /> on inter-city services and this is nearing finalisation. Pending completion of that review, crowding issues continue to be managed in a proactive manner by Iarnród Éireann. For instance, Iarnród Éireann has adopted a pre-booking system for tickets at bank holiday weekends and other particularly busy periods. The company is at present developing a modern ticket reservation system, which it plans to have in place on all inter-city services by the end of 2003.</P>
    <P>The Railway Safety Bill, 2001, which is at Second Stage in this House, will require all railway undertakings, including Iarnród Éireann, to implement a formal safety management system and to describe that system in a document called a &ldquo;safety case&rdquo;. The Bill will require a railway undertaking to identify in its safety case all issues impacting on the safety of its operations. Such issues would include its strategy for managing crowding of trains. The railway safety commission, to be established under the Bill, will need to be satisfied that the overall safety management system is adequate to ensure the safety of passengers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 402 together.</P>
      <P>Within the framework of the national development plan a wide range of initiatives have been taken to upgrade Dublin's transport infrastructure and services and reduce congestion and associated costs. The national development plan provides for investment of approximately &euro;2 billion in public transport and traffic management in the greater Dublin area in the period to 2006.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, demonstrable improvements in public transport arrangements and services have been implemented. Dublin Bus has purchased over 600 new buses. Bus Éireann has increased its capacity on GDA commuter routes by 40%. There are now nine QBCs in place in Dublin and work is continuing on further routes. Some 160 km of dedicated cycle ways have been provided. Traffic management and control systems have been upgraded. Major capacity improvements have been made to rail services. Progress has been made on developing the Luas system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By the end of 2003, all construction work on the Luas lines will be completed. This will allow commencement of passenger services in early 2004. Capacity on the outer suburban network <Col N="183" /> around Dublin will be expanded from next year by the addition of 76 new diesel rail cars. Capacity improvements will flow from the improved signalling and track work on the approaches to Heuston Station, the provision of additional platforms, the allocation of additional rail cars and increasing train lengths during rush hour periods. Further DART capacity improvements are also planned, as is the purchase of another 36 DART cars.</P>
    <P>Major road projects to a total value of approximately &euro;1.4 billion are currently under construction in the Dublin city and county area, including the Dublin Port tunnel, the south-eastern motorway, and the second bridge at the West Link.</P>
    <P>These measures in public transport, traffic management and road infrastructure will have a major beneficial impact on traffic flows and transport costs in Dublin in the short to medium term. They are also part of the long-term strategy to address the city's transport needs. The DTO policy document A Platform for Change sets out a comprehensive integrated strategy to respond to the transportation needs of the greater Dublin area, GDA, in the period to 2016. It is providing the framework for the development of Dublin's transport network.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122, 150 and 152 together.</P>
      <P>The penalty points system was introduced on 31 October 2002. Penalty points will be applied to those convicted of speeding offences in the courts, and to those who pay a fixed charge to the Garda in order to prevent the instigation of court proceedings. I expect that the full application of the penalty points system will be achieved by the end of 2003. The question of reviewing the system will be considered against the background of its full operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recording of convictions for offences is a matter for the Courts Service. In addition, the <Col N="184" /> compilation of data relating to payments of fixed charges where the relevant notices are issued by the Garda Síochána is a matter for the Garda authorities. Information concerning penalty points recorded for drivers will be held on the national driver file which is the responsibility of the Department of Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>Where a person is convicted of the commission of a penalty point offence, the Courts Service will advise the Department of the Environment and Local Government so that the appropriate entry can be made in the national driver file. The Garda Síochána engages in a similar process where a person pays a fixed charge in respect of a penalty point offence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is Government policy to encourage as wide a range as possible of reliable, regular and competitive air services to and from Ireland. Efficient and competitive networks of air links are vitally important for developing our trade and tourism sectors, particularly having regard to our island status and peripheral location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has taken a proactive stance over the years in the deregulation of the intra-European Union air transport market. Under the current regime, all Community air carriers are free to operate on any European Economic Area, EEA, route, based on their own commercial <Col N="186" /> judgment, subject to overall safety considerations and availability of slots. Outside the EEA, my Department encourages the development of new air services through the implementation of liberal regulatory arrangements with other states.</P>
    <P>Regarding the airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork, the policy is to focus on the planning and funding of adequate and cost effective airport infrastructure in line with the projected traffic demands. Each of these airports is a major driver of economic growth and development for their respective catchment areas, and indeed, for the country as a whole. At Dublin Airport, Aer Rianta is well advanced with a comprehensive master planning exercise which will enable the company to plan the development of the airport systematically over the medium to long term for both passenger and cargo handling.</P>
    <P>A number of initiatives are currently being pursued under the Programme for Government with the aim of further boosting tourism and expansion on international air routes.</P>
    <P>In the short term, and subject to planning permission, a new temporary pier to facilitate the rapid turnaround of aircraft will be provided by Aer Rianta by May 2003. The company recently secured planning permission from Fingal County Council for a new, permanent, two storey pier at Dublin Airport in due course. This permission is currently the subject of an appeal to An Bord Pleanála. I have indicated to Aer Rianta that no contractual or other irrevocable commitments should be made in relation to this permanent facility pending the outcome of the independent terminal issue which I am currently pursuing.</P>
    <P>On this latter issue, my Department advertised in August of this year for expressions of interest from parties who would be interested in the concept of providing an independent or competing terminal at Dublin Airport. Submissions were received from 13 companies or consortia and yesterday I announced the composition of a small panel of experts chaired by Mr. Paddy Mullarkey, former Secretary General of the Department of Finance, to conduct a professional and independent assessment of these submissions.</P>
    <P>The work of the panel, which I expect to be completed on 17 January, will assist me in progressing the commitment in the Programme for Government to examine proposals for a new independent terminal at the airport and to progress them if the evidence suggests that such a terminal will deliver significant benefits.</P>
    <P>Significant investment has been made by Aer Rianta at Shannon Airport in recent years in developing facilities for passengers and cargo. With the completion of the terminal extension two years ago, Shannon now has capacity to handle up to 4.5 million passengers per annum. This compares with an expected throughput of about 2.3 million passengers at Shannon for this year.</P>
    <P>It is recognised by Aer Rianta that Cork Airport needs significant investment as a result of <Col N="187" /> the growth in traffic through the airport in recent years and the company is well advanced with its plans for a major new capital investment programme in infrastructure and facilities. The main feature of this programme, estimated to cost &euro;130 million, is a 25,000 sq. m. terminal building. Planning permission for this project was secured earlier this year and Aer Rianta is currently evaluating tenders for the works. The company expects that the work will take two years to complete and the aim would be to have the new terminal ready for Cork's year as European City of Culture in 2005. I have made it clear that this project will proceed, whatever the outcome of my current examination of options for greater autonomy for Cork Airport.</P>
    <P>This latter initiative is also contained in the Programme for Government which provides that, as part of the process of continuing to transform Aer Rianta, the Government will ensure that Shannon and Cork Airports have greater autonomy and independence.</P>
    <P>A debate has now been stimulated by me within the Shannon and Cork regions and at a national level on the best ownership structure for these two airports going forward. Indeed I have visited both Shannon and Cork to further stimulate this debate and to seek out the views of local interests. The issue of greater autonomy for Shannon and Cork is being considered solely in the context of continued State ownership of those airports.</P>
    <P>There is a genuine sense of goodwill towards the airports in the two regions on the part of local tourism and business interests, and views may differ on the best way forward. However, I will listen carefully to the views of all interested parties before framing proposals to bring to Government.</P>
    <P>The six regional airports also operate as important access gateways to the regions. My Department will continue the support which it provides for marketing, safety and security measures at the six regional airports. A sum of &euro;1.8 million has been provided for this purpose in my Department's Vote for 2003. This provision is in addition to &euro;20.6 million for next year to support the PSO regional air services and over &euro;6 million for the implementation of the first round of projects at the regional airports under the NDP.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 392 together.</P>
      <P>The DTO strategy, A Platform for Change, identifies the need to upgrade the DART as a critical project in addressing the public transport requirement of the greater Dublin area. I am informed by Iarnród Éireann that it plans to undertake the DART upgrade project in two phases: the extension of platforms, upgrade of the power supply and the acquisition of new rolling stock to allow the operation of eight-car trains; and upgrading the signalling system to increase the number of train paths between Connolly and Pearse Stations from 12 to 16 per direction per hour.</P>
      <P>I recently approved the allocation of approximately &euro;145 million in Exchequer funding to allow the commencement of works to provide for eight-car DART operation. This phase of the project is planned for completion in 2005 and will result in a 100% increase in capacity on the DART between 2000 and 2005.</P>
      <P>I am informed by Iarnród Éireann that because of its internal resource constraints, the scale of the work to be undertaken on the line during the first phase and the need to minimise disruption to service, the signalling project is planned to commence in 2005 for completion in 2007.</P>

      <P>I am committed to improved transparency and accountability in the provision of State support for the provision of public transport services. In this context, my Department has worked with the CIE companies to develop service level agreements for each of the subsidiaries, including Iarnród Éireann. These agreements will set down the subvention to be paid and in return the levels of service to be provided including targets on reliability, quality and performance. These agreements will be monitored on a quarterly basis. I understand that agreement has now been reached to introduce service level agreements in 2003. This builds on progress by the Department in introducing performance indicators for the operating companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my statement to the public transport partnership forum on 7 November 2002, I set out my proposals for institutional and structural reform of public transport. I indicated, <i>inter alia,</i> that within an overall regulatory and investment framework set by me as Minister for Transport, an independent regulator will be established to procure public transport services, regulate public transport and allocate current and capital funding from an overall budget provided by the Exchequer. While consideration of the precise institutional form that body will take is not yet complete, I indicated that DART and suburban rail services serving the greater Dublin area will be provided subject to a multiannual public ser<Col N="190" /> vice contract to be negotiated by the regulator with Iarnród Éireann.</P>
    <P>The first Luas services will be operated by Connex Transport Ireland Limited, under the terms of a service level contract signed with the Railway Procurement Agency. Future Luas and Metro services in the greater Dublin area will be procured on a public private partnership basis by the Railway Procurement Agency, with the relevant service contracts requiring the approval of the independent regulator.</P>
    <P>Finally, I also indicated in my statement that I propose all public transport outside the greater Dublin area should also be the subject of independent economic regulation. The proposals I intend to publish in early 2003 on regulatory reform outside the greater Dublin area will, in so far as rail services are concerned, follow the same policy approach as I have taken in respect of the greater Dublin area, and will include public service contracts.</P>

      <P>It is my policy that Irish Rail should provide the highest possible degree of accessibility for the mobility impaired within the overall resources available to the company. The DART and Arrow suburban rail services are wheelchair accessible over most of the network. The enterprise service on the Dublin-Belfast line and all inter-city services using Mark II and Mark III carriages are accessible.</P>
      <P>There are a number of other rail carriages which are not fully accessible and most of these will be phased out over the next three years or so as new wheelchair accessible rolling stock comes on line. The new rolling stock, which will be designed to meet the most up to date accessibility standards, will begin to enter into service from early next summer. The Exchequer cost of these vehicles for 2003 is provided for in the Estimates for my Department. It is anticipated that more than 180 rail carriages for DART, Arrow suburban and intercity will be brought into service over the next few years at which point practically all CIE services will be accessible.</P>
      <P>All station upgrades and new station developments take into account the needs of the mobility impaired. There is an ongoing programme in place to provide either ramps or lifts at stations to make platforms accessible and other accessibility improvements are also undertaken when stations are being refurbished.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 and 169 together.</P>
      <P>It would appear that there is considerable misunderstanding on the part of the IFI workers concerning the nature and extent of the waiver which they are being asked to sign in order to obtain payments from the <i>ex gratia</i> fund which is being provided by the two shareholders in the company. In light of this confusion and the concerns which the workers have as a result, the shareholders have agreed to a request from the unions that the workers should be allowed to collect interim payments on the basis of signing a letter which acknowledges receipt of the payments and accepts that a waiver in a form to be agreed will have to be signed in order to get any final payment from the fund. The shareholders have provided the trustee with funds which are sufficient to allow payments of up to &euro;5000 per worker or three months pay if lower. It has also been agreed that there will be further discussions on the wording of the waiver following consultations by unions with their legal advisers.</P>
      <P>Any workers for whom the current payment is expected to constitute their full entitlements from the fund may be asked to sign the current form of the waiver but will be entitled to substitute any revised version that may be agreed in due course. I hope all workers will now be in a position to accept the interim payments which have been available from the trustee since Monday, 18 November.</P>

Accordingly, widowed persons with dependant children in receipt of OPFP may qualify for participation on JI.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In deciding on the 2003 allocations for FÁS the Government was conscious of the need to maximise, within the current constraints on public expenditure, investment in measures that have a primary focus on employability. These include the provision of training and employment supports for the disabled and for those experiencing difficulty in entering the labour market.</P>
      <P>FÁS training schemes are funded both by direct Exchequer funding and by contributions from the national training fund. The overall investment next year is being maintained close to 2002 levels. The 2003 Exchequer contribution of &euro;73.518 million is complemented by a &euro;222.055 million contribution from the national training fund, bringing the overall investment in FÁS training initiatives to &euro;295.573 million. This compares to &euro;301.018 million in 2002 and will mean some reduction in training places in 2003. FÁS will prioritise, in so far as possible, the training and employment supports for the disabled within their overall allocations.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment to the central role training plays in underpinning competitiveness is further demonstrated by the recently launched in-company training scheme which will provide &euro;45 million between now and the end of 2006 for training and upskilling the labour force. This ESF funded initiative will be co-financed by the private sector.</P>
      <P>The allocation for 2003 to FÁS employment programmes, which includes the community employment scheme, CE, is set at almost &euro;365 million. This allocation will support an average CE participation level of around 22,000 throughout next year with a closing participation rate of about 20,000. This reduction of approximately 5,000 on the end 2002 participation level is in line with Government policy to reduce CE numbers in recognition of the significant reduction in the numbers of the long-term unemployed.</P>
      <P>Over &euro;30 million is being made available for the social economy programme, an increase from &euro;20.55 million in 2002. This will be sufficient to fund commitments on the projects approved to date but will not allow for the approval of new projects in 2003. The job initiative programme will have an average participation level of around 2,500 throughout next year, with an end of year participation level of about 2,200. The end 2002 participation level is expected to be in the order of 2,800.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board of FÁS, taking account of Government policy guidelines, will decide on the detailed <Col N="197" /> priorities and breakdown of funding between schemes and activities from within these overall allocations.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, CE, participation levels are gradually being reduced, reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of the long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment.</P>
      <P>FÁS prioritises projects according to the types of services provided and levels of unemployment in the locality and co-ordinates reductions so as to minimise any negative effects on groups and services most in need of CE. Drugs task force activity and child care service provision are ring-fenced and projects in RAPID areas are given top priority. CE places in the health sector are being maintained at the start of the year level to ensure continuity of the delivery of these services.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children in conjunction with the health boards executive, or HeBE, are currently examining the position regarding the mainstreaming of health related services and a decision on mainstreaming will be made in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the workers' disappointment that, despite the efforts of all those involved, it was not possible to find a solution to the severe financial difficulties at IFI. Regretfully, IFI made significant losses in the past year and in the absence of a plan to establish that the company could be viable, both shareholders agreed that the provision of further funding could not be justified. This decision was not taken lightly but against a background where the Government, through NET, and ICI as joint shareholders have been very supportive of the company, including by means of the provision of &euro;34 million to the company in the past two years. Substantial efforts on the part of IFI's board of directors and shareholders to find a buyer for the whole or part of the company had proved similarly disappointing. Regrettably, this left the IFI board with no alternative but to liquidate the company.</P>
      <P>The shareholders, while there is no legal obligation to do so, have established a special <i>ex gratia</i> severance fund with almost &euro;24.5 million for the workers. This <i>ex gratia</i> fund is in addition to an estimated &euro;11 million in statutory entitlements such as redundancy and minimum notice which employees will receive either as preferred creditors in the liquidation of IFI or directly from the relevant Government agency. Given that there will be a total of more than &euro;35 million available, payments will amount to an average of about &euro;57,000 per worker. Both the Irish Government and ICI believe that in setting up the <i>ex gratia</i> fund they are providing severance arrangements which are fair in the circumstances. It will be for the <i>ex gratia</i> fund's trustee to decide, after consultations with employee representatives, how payments from the <i>ex gratia</i> fund will be made.</P>
      <P>As part of these arrangements, the shareholders have also provided funds to the trustee which enable him to make interim payments of &euro;5,000 or three months pay if lower to each worker who has lost their job as a result of the liquidation, with <i>pro rata</i> payments for former part-time employees. This is to help them manage their financial situation through the short-term pending agreement with the trustee on the shape of the final scheme. These interim payments have been available since Monday, 18 November and a number of workers have now received such interim payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it would appear that there is considerable misunderstanding on the part of the IFI workers concerning the nature and extent of the waiver which they are being asked to sign in order to obtain payments from the <i>ex gratia</i> fund. In light of this confusion and the concerns which the workers have as a result, the shareholders have agreed to a request from the unions that the workers should be allowed to collect interim payments on the basis of signing a letter which <Col N="199" /> acknowledges receipt of the payments and accepts that a waiver in a form to be agreed will have to be signed in order to get any final payment from the fund. It has also been agreed that there will be further discussions on the wording of the waiver following consultations by unions with their legal advisers. Any workers for whom the current payment is expected to constitute their full entitlements from the fund may be asked to sign the current form of the waiver but will be entitled to substitute any revised version that may be agreed in due course. I hope that all workers will now be in a position to accept the interim payments. In addition to these interim payments which are available immediately, I can also confirm that my Department is aiming to issue payments before Christmas in respect of valid statutory redundancy claims from IFI workers.</P>
    <P>Pensions issues are very complicated and I am concerned that there appears to be a lot of incomplete and, sometimes, conflicting information circulating at present in relation to the position of the various schemes. I understand that IFI has been meeting its obligations to the various schemes. The estimated statement of affairs presented by the IFI board to the creditors meeting recently showed that the company owes the pensions schemes just &euro;178,000, which, as a preferential debt, should be paid in full. The shareholders are not aware of any obligations in relation to the pensions funds.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this position, it is understood that the pensions funds face potential difficulties mainly from the impact of adverse stock market movements on the investments made by the fund. These issues have been indicated to be particularly serious with respect to the scheme for Belfast workers. The position of the schemes covering the other workers is less clear but the indications are that these schemes may have somewhat less of a problem. Clearly, the uncertainty involved is giving rise to serious concerns on the part of employees and it is critical that the trustees of each scheme should establish the full facts as quickly as is feasible and consider the full range of options available to them to mitigate the impact on members or to minimise any shortfalls involved. Unfortunately, it is likely to take some time for all the various issues involved to be clarified fully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the then owner of the Marino Point site, Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta, NET, furnished a bond to Cork County Council dated 7 February 1977 in connection with the planning permission given for the site &ndash; reference No. 1523/74. I am also advised that in accordance with the asset purchase agreement between NET and IFI dated 2 October 1987, IFI assumed full responsibility for the performance, payment or discharge of certain liabilities of NET, including any liabilities of NET in relation to the property at Marino Point. Furthermore, while IFI held its interest in the Marino Point site under a lease from NET until 2000, IFI exercised an option at that time to acquire NET's interest in the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances, it would appear that responsibility for the compliance with the planning permission granted, including the bond <Col N="201" /> required under condition 34, rests with IFI. Thus, as I advised the House in response to an earlier question from the Deputy on 5 November 2002, ref. 20329/02, responsibility for the site, including any obligations in relation to its clean up, will continue to rest with the company, even when it is in liquidation. In this regard, the fact that the site has a significant value should ensure that any remedial works required will be carried out by the liquidator or by any new owner of the site.</P>

      <P>The person named has had his ewe quota reduced from 352 to 219, a reduction of 133. This figure has been calculated correctly, taking into account the total area of his holding, his total stocking levels including cattle and the percentage destocking recommended in the framework plan for the commonage in question, which was 45.05%. The person named is a participant in REPS and qualifies for an annual payment of &euro;11,360, which includes a substantial element of compensation for destocking on his commonage land.</P>
      <P>All farmers with commonage who have received notification of the preliminary calculation of their ewe quota for 2003 have three options. They can accept the recalculation, have it reviewed by an agricultural consultant or opt out of using the commonage altogether. If they take the third option, their ewe quota will not be reduced.</P>

      <P>The animal based headage schemes were replaced in 2001 by the area based compensatory allowance scheme. This scheme, which was approved by the European Commission, provides that applicants must meet a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare of the holding in the year preceding application. However, farmers who are unable to meet that minimum stocking density but who traditionally qualified for headage grants in respect of cattle and/or sheep may continue to qualify for payment, provided their land is being utilised and is not in danger of undergrazing.</P>
      <P>The person named was not a headage recipient in 2000 and, according to my Department's records, the stocking density of the holding does not meet the minimum requirement. My Department will be in contact with the person named shortly with a view to establishing the type of farming activity being pursued. A decision on entitlement to 2002 area based compensatory allowance will be made on receipt of reply.</P>

The scheme is designed to provide humanitarian assistance to those who suffered hardship in localised flooding in several areas of the country, including Dublin. The Irish Red Cross Society, IRCS, will administer the scheme which is currently being advertised in the national newspapers and on national and local radio.</P>
      <P>Application forms will be available by ringing the free phone number provided or can be obtained from the Irish Red Cross Society's website. The closing date for receipt of applications is Friday, 6 December 2002. The scheme will be administered on a confidential basis by the IRCS and it should be emphasised that the scheme is designed to provide humanitarian assistance to relieve hardship arising from damage to people's homes and not compensation for losses.</P>
      <P>The Tolka River catchment falls within the functional area of three local authorities, Meath and Fingal County Councils and Dublin City Council. In June 2001, Dublin City Council commissioned the greater Dublin strategic drainage study or GDSDS which is a multi-million euro engineering study of the strategic drainage requirements of the greater Dublin area. Given the history of flooding in the Tolka and on the initiative of Office of Public Works, the city council agreed to include a study of the Tolka in the GDSDS. The flooding element of the study is funded by Office of Public Works at a cost of &euro;870,000 and is expected to be completed in May 2003.</P>
      <P>The aim of the study is that a comprehensive report will be produced that will include the development of a robust model representing the relevant characteristics of the River Tolka catchment. Such a model will have the ability to map flood risk. Using model output, the technical and economic merit of various options for flood management, taking account of current and future land developments, will be presented within the report. It is not possible, at this stage, to indicate what the findings of the study will be or what flood alleviation measures can be recommended. However, the consultants have been requested to produce an interim report setting out what immediate steps can be taken to alleviate flooding in the areas worst affected. This report will be available within the next few days.</P>

      <P>It is a fundamental requirement for relief under the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' tax concessions scheme that an applicant must meet the specified medical criteria and be in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the relevant health board. Where the issue of such a certificate is refused, the person concerned may appeal that decision to the disabled drivers' medical board of appeal, an independent board whose decision is final. Neither my Department nor the Revenue Commissioners has any role in the medical assessment of persons for the purposes of the relief.</P>
      <P>The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concession under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers' and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concession) Scheme Regulations 1994, S.I. No. 353 of 1994. Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The six different types of disablement are as follows: persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; persons who are wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to movement of their lower limbs; persons without both hands or without both arms; persons without one or both legs; persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; and persons having the medical condition of dwarfisms and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the person concerned was refused a primary medical certificate by the board of appeal on 18 November 2002 as he did not satisfy the medical conditions outlined above.

Any recommendations contained in this report, whether to change the medical criteria or otherwise, will receive full consideration.</P>

      <Quest>his plans to introduce a tax allowance for cohabiting couples, similar to the married allowance, which would allow one person who is work ing to claim the tax credit of their partner who is not working.</Quest>

      <P>I have no plans at the present time to introduce a tax credit along the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The position is that there are no special tax credits or methods of assessment for unmarried couples living together. In this context, tax law follows the general law relating to marriage. Generally speaking, the basis for the current taxation of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy v the Attorney General, 1980, which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together. The tax treatment of unmarried couples who cohabit was unaffected by the Murphy judgment. Each partner is taxed as a single person and each is entitled to the tax credits and standard rate band appropriate to single persons.</P>
      <P>The issue of the tax treatment of cohabiting couples was examined most recently in the report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one parent families under the tax and social welfare codes. The group, which was established by the Minister for Social Welfare in May 1997, reported in August 1999. The report is available from the Government Publications sale office. The group was sympathetic, in principle, to changes in the tax legislation to address the issues raised relating to cohabiting couples and reported that the options it set out should be considered further.</P>
      <P>In budget 2000, I initiated the process of band widening with a view to establishing progressively a single standard rate income tax band for all individual taxpayers. When this process is complete the position of all couples will be the same with respect to the standard rate tax band. The position of married couples in relation to income tax is accorded recognition through the married person's tax credit and the home carer's tax credit. I have no plans to change the arrangements in that regard.</P>
      <P>The working group mentioned above acknowledged that a key issue in relation to the tax treatment of cohabiting couples is whether tax law should proceed ahead of changes in the general law on the matter. For that reason, and while I am cognisant of the issues faced by cohabiting couples, I have no plans to extend the married person's tax credit to such couples at the present time.</P>

      <P>Contact with the representatives of the hotel has been ongoing since the commencement of the construction works. Replies have been issued, or discussions have taken place, in response to all correspondence from the representatives of the hotel in relation to the flood scheme. The resident engineer for the scheme, whose site office is only yards from the hotel, has been available at all times for consultation in relation to any aspect of the scheme affecting the hotel and he continues to be engaged in ongoing contact with representatives of the hotel.</P>
      <P>It was not possible to issue a definitive works programme to the hotel as technical issues required finalisation before the works in the vicinity of the hotel could proceed. The works have now commenced and the hotel will be issued with a programme of works. Until now, the hotel has been briefed fortnightly in advance on what works are taking place along the river. The date of completion of the programme of works will be subject to the satisfactory resolution of safety issues relating to a structure, owned by the hotel, adjacent to the works.</P>
      <P>Any claim for compensation in respect of any interference, restriction, etc. caused to the hotel in pursuance of the drainage scheme will be considered by the Commissioners of Public Works in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Arterial Drainage Acts. When assessing compensation, regard will be had to any benefit to the affected property which is occasioned by or may reasonably be expected to arise from the carrying out of the drainage scheme. The Office of Public Works valuer visited the hotel in July of this year and made preliminary contact with the hotel manager with a view to monitoring the ongoing impacts on the hotel.</P>

      <P>The tax relief referred to by the Deputy is a support measure additional to the primary instrument, the alternative energy requirement or AER programme, to support the building of new qualifying renewable energy based electricity generating stations or RES stations. The AER programme consists of a series of competitive tendering rounds. The programme is administered by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources who also deals with the detailed notification of all support measures for RES stations to the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>I understand projects successful in AER competitive rounds completed after commencement of the initial tax relief measure had ample time to secure certification under the previous tax relief scheme before it ceased. In relation to the most recent competition, AER V, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will shortly sign the necessary order under section 39 of the Electricity Regulation Act, as amended, to complete the necessary national administrative processes. Once the order is in place, officials of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will be in a position to submit a notification to the EU Commission of the proposed extension of the tax relief under the extant AER State aid. Once EU State aid approval has been received, I will be in a position to sign a commencement order for the relevant section.</P>

      <P>In June 2001, Dublin City Council commissioned the greater Dublin strategic drainage study or GDSDS, which will examine and report on the strategic drainage requirements of the greater Dublin area. At the request of the Office of Public Works, a study of flooding in the Tolka River catchment was included as part of the GDSDS. This element of the study is being funded by Office of Public Works at a cost of &euro;870,000. The study is expected to be completed in May 2003. Meath and Fingal County Councils are also participating in the study. Surveying is now completed and the consultants are commencing work on the hydraulic model of the catchment.</P>
      <P>The aim of the study is that a comprehensive report will be produced that will include the development of a model representing the hydrological and hydraulic characteristics of the River Tolka catchment. Such a model will have the ability to map flood risk. Using model output, the technical and economic merit of various options for flood management, taking account of current and future land development, will be presented within the report. It is not possible, at this stage, to indicate what the findings of the study will be or what flood alleviation measures can be recommended. However, in the meantime, the consultants have been requested to produce an interim report on what immediate measures can be taken to alleviate flooding in the worst affected areas. This interim report will be available in the next few days.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to give a precise answer on the basis of the question put by the Deputy as the tax paid would depend on the actual split of income between the spouses and their entitlement to tax credits including the personal and employee, PAYE, tax credits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="215" />The married two-earner standard rate band is &euro;56,000 and comprises a band of &euro;37,000 which is transferable between spouses and a non-transferable band of &euro;19,000. The net tax liability is determined by reference to these bands and to the relevant tax credits. If the Deputy can say what specific examples he wants explored, this will be done by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The exemption the Deputy is referring to is a relief known as young trained farmers relief. This relief was introduced by section 112 of the Finance Act, 1994, which provided for a two-thirds reduction in stamp duty on the transfer of land to a young trained farmer. This relief was introduced on foot of commitments in the Programme for Competitiveness and Work for a three year period until 31 December 1996.</P>
      <P>In the context of structural reform identified in the Partnership 2000 programme, section 126 of the Finance Act, 1997, extended the relief for a further three years, up to 31 December 1999. Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the two-thirds relief was increased to full stamp duty relief in section 126 of the Finance Act, 2000, for a further three years until 31 December 2002. It is estimated that the cost of this relief in 2002 will amount to &euro;9.4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of the relief a &ldquo;young trained farmer&rdquo; is one who: (i) is under 35 years of age at the date of execution of the transfer; and, (ii) is the holder of one of the specified qualifications, for example, the Teagasc certificate in farming; or (iii) if born before 1 January 1968, has three years experience in farming together with satisfactory completion of Teagasc training courses in <Col N="221" /> agriculture and horticulture of 180 hours' duration.</P>
    <P>The date of 1 January 1968 in point (iii) was devised in consultation with Teagasc and the Department of Agriculture and Food. The rationale behind this concession for those born before 1 January 1968 is that before that date comprehensive training in agriculture was not readily available on a national basis. Since then, all aspiring farmers had access to such training.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, given the forthcoming budget and the ongoing discussions with the social partners regarding a potential successor to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it is not appropriate for me to comment at this stage on the possibility of extending this relief for a further period, or of changing the conditions attached to it.</P>

      <P>The participants to the Good Friday Agreement formally recognised the value of the work being done by many organisations to develop reconciliation and mutual understanding between and <Col N="222" /> within communities in Northern Ireland and between North and South. Moreover, they saw this work as playing a vital role in consolidating peace and political agreement.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the parties to the Agreement pledged their continuing support for such organisations and agreed to positively examine the scope for enhanced financial assistance for the work of reconciliation. In line with this commitment, in 1999 the Government increased the funding available to this Department's reconciliation fund to £2 million, an eight fold increase on the previous year.</P>
      <P>Over the past four years the increased funding &ndash; on aggregate, over &euro;10 million &ndash; has enabled my Department to make over 300 grants to organisations involved in a wide range of cross-community and cross-border reconciliation and outreach activities. The larger allocations from the reconciliation fund are provided to organisations that operate on an all-island basis &ndash; for instance, Co-operation Ireland and the Glencree Centre for Reconciliation. However, many smaller organisations, working on a localised basis across the community interface, or in co-operation with partner bodies in the other part of the island, have also benefited from the fund.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that, notwithstanding the more difficult budgetary constraints that now apply, the Government was, as part of the recent Estimates process, broadly able to maintain its financial commitment to the reconciliation fund. The allocation to the appropriate subhead for 2003 is &euro;2.59 million.</P>
      <P>Finally, it is worth noting that the crosscommunity and cross-border endeavours assisted by my Department's reconciliation fund complement the good work being assisted in these areas by the larger interventions of the EU Peace 2 Programme and the International Fund for Ireland.                </P>

      <P>Students with a disability, including <Col N="225" /> those with a visual impairment, attending courses in approved third level institutions and post leaving certificate centres may apply for grant assistance directly to the fund for students with disabilities, which is administered by my Department.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the fund, which is assisted through the European Social Fund, is to provide students with serious sensory, physical and-or communicative disabilities with grant assistance towards the cost of equipment and the provision of services. Applications for assistance are made in October of each year by the individual students through their third level institution or post leaving certificate centre. The allocations are paid to the relevant institutions in respect of the particular students </P>
      <P>The number of approved applications has been increasing, from 511 in 2000 to 809 in 2001. Expenditure also increased significantly from &euro;1.565 million in 2000 to &euro;2.619 million in 2001. Allocations in respect of the 2002-03 academic year are now being finalised. This year the number of applications has increased to approximately 1,100.</P>
      <P>In addition to the fund for students with disabilities, most third level colleges have developed initiatives to promote equality of opportunity, including access for students with disabilities, through targeted funding provided to the universities by the Higher Education Authority and funding from within the overall financial allocations to the institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>There is a provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling &euro;120 million over the period 2000 to 2006 to tackle disadvantage at third level. In line with a commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, my predecessor, Deputy Michael Woods, established the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education to advise on the development of a co-ordinated strategy to increase participation of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability at third level. The action group's report was published in July 2001.</P>
      <P>Some of the action group's recommendations relate to the achieving of targets for access to third level education over the period of the national development plan on the part of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability.</P>
      <P>My Department is committed to assisting students with a disability through progressing these and other recommendations in the report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education. Accordingly, there are no plans to provide separate funding to organisations such as the National League of the Blind of Ireland to assist people attending third level education.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 224 and 225 together.</P>
      <P>While there is no specific provision in the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000, regarding a deceased person in relation to allegations of abuse, section 14(7) of the Act states that:</P>
      <P>If a person gives false evidence before the committee or to a person examining him or her pursuant to subsection (5) in such circumstances that, if the person had given evidence before a court, the person would be guilty of perjury, the person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction on indictment thereof to the penalties applying to perjury.</P>
      <P>Therefore, if a person giving evidence to the commission knowingly makes a false statement about a person living or dead, they commit perjury and may be subject to the sanction that applies to that crime.</P>
      <P>In addition to this the commission can hear evidence which contradicts accusations made against a deceased person and make a finding as to which version represents the truth.</P>

    <P>The new disadvantage programme, Giving Children an Even Break, which was launched last year to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level, replaced the previous process of the designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage. My Department's approach is now refined to ensure that the individual &lsquo;at risk' pupils are targeted. Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, my Department now provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in <Col N="237" /> schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving.</P>
    <P>Schools participating in Giving Children an Even Break are in receipt of a range of additional supports including teacher posts and other non-teaching supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. These levels of disadvantage were established as a result of a comprehensive survey of all primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, in March-April 2000 at the request of my Department.</P>
    <P>All of the schools identified as having pupils enrolled with characteristics of disadvantage have been invited to participate in Giving Children an Even Break. In the urban dimension, schools identified as having the highest concentration of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage, have been considered for additional staffing to implement a maximum class size of 20:1 in junior classes &ndash; infants through second class &ndash; and 27:1 in senior classes, third through sixth class. The school in question was selected in 2001 for inclusion in this category. In addition, the school was allocated additional funding based on the level of disadvantaged pupils enrolled as identified by the Educational Research Centre survey carried out in 2000.</P>
    <P>However, it has been brought to my Department's attention by the ERC that a small number of schools, including the school in question, had completed a question on the survey form inaccurately. The ERC re-examined the data supplied in the survey form submitted by the school in 2000 and awarded correct points. The level of staffing and funding allocations granted to the school in question under Giving Children an Even Break are deemed to be in excess of the revised entitlement. The school does not fall into the category of schools considered for additional teaching staff and the level of funding allocated to the school is no longer warranted based on the revised points awarded under Giving Children an Even Break.</P>
    <P>On this basis, the Giving Children an Even Break post allocated to the school will be suppressed at the end of the 2002-03 school year and the teacher in question will be placed on the diocesan teaching panel. The amended funding entitlement under Giving Children an Even Break in respect of the 2002-03 school year will be offset against the amount overpaid for the 2000-01 and 2001-02 school years. Arrangements are being made to issue the revised grant allocation due to the school shortly.</P>

      <P>At present there are 309 primary schools and 211 second level schools included in the home-school-community liaison scheme. The scheme was last expanded in September 1999. This expansion included any remaining schools designated as disadvantaged that did not have a home-school-community liaison service. There are no immediate plans to expand the home-school-community liaison scheme. However, in the event of any future expansion of the home-school-community liaison scheme, the needs of the school in question will be fully considered.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware of the new programme &ndash; Giving Children An Even Break which was launched last year to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf.</P>
      <P>Giving Children an Even Break subsumes the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage. My Department's approach is now refined to ensure that the individual &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; pupils are targeted. Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, my Department now provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving.</P>
      <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. Schools participating in Giving Children An Even Break are eligible to receive a range of additional supports including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. Under the programme, the school is benefiting from supplementary funding to provide additional educational supports for the children concerned.</P>
      <P>Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils are being supported, where necessary, over the three-year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes &ndash; infants through second class &ndash; and a pupil teacher ratio of 27:1 in senior classes, third through sixth classes. The school in question is benefiting from the allocation of four additional teaching posts under Giving Children an Even Break to adhere to the maximum class size guidelines for the current school year.</P>

    <P>The enrolment of Cratloe national school was 225 pupils on 30 September 2001.

The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staff<Col N="245" /> ing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of this particular school is a principal and two mainstream class teachers based on the enrolment of 68 on 30 September 2001. This is the authorised staffing for the school. The school also has the services of a shared learning support teacher.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of the school as at 30 September 2002 determines the staffing for the school year 2003-04 school year. The boards of management will be advised of their staffing allocations for the 2003-04 school year in early 2003.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that I recently established an independent appeals board to adjudicate on appeals from boards of management on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. The appeals board will operate independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision will be final. A circular outlining these new procedures has recently been issued to all primary schools and is also available on my Department's website.</P>

      <P>Regarding the role that the seal plays in the conservation of fish stocks, seals eat a wide array of fish and invertebrates, although their diet appears to vary considerably depending on location, time of year and the abundance of available prey. Studies undertaken by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, off north Mayo indicate that commercially exploited whitefish species such as whiting can form 50% to 80% of seal diet. I stress however that the interaction between seals and fish stocks is a complex one.</P>
      <P>The proposals for reform of the Common Fisheries Policy do not specifically refer to the role of seals in the conservation of fish stocks. In so far as national management of the seal population is concerned, this falls to be considered under the wildlife acts, which are administered by the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <P>Under the Fisheries Acts, responsibility for the overall administration of human resources issues, including terms and conditions of employment of fisheries board contract staff, is a matter for the Central Fisheries Board and, in this instance, the South-Western Regional Fisheries Board. I have been advised by the chief executive officer of that board that no temporary contracts were terminated in November, 2002.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 305 and 306 together.</P>
      <P>The purpose of an environmental impact statement is, <i>inter alia,</i> to anticipate the likely impacts of a proposed development on the environment and, where these impacts are expected to be adverse, to propose mitigation or compensatory measures. Any EIS which fails to address all such issues would not meet statutory requirements.</P>
      <P>I am advised that, while undersea emissions of electric fields from wind farms are negligible, even relatively small electromagnetic emissions can have impacts upon some species such as tope and shark. However, salmonoids and anguillid eels navigate by geomagnetic fields and the localisation and low level of magnetic fields emitted from electric cables, properly buried or covered with rock armour, would be below naturally occurring levels. Furthermore, sense of smell is the main sense used in migration once salmonoids reach coastal waters. No adverse effects on migration would, therefore, be expected to occur. Again this is an issue which should be addressed in any EIS to be carried out.</P>

      <Quest>the amount of investment to date which has come from Government and the private sector, in view of the importance of broadband technology to jobs potential; and the proposals his Department has to develop this technology here.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23426/02]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision <Col N="254" /> of communications infrastructure and services is a matter for the private sector companies that operate in the fully liberalised telecommunications market.</P>
      <P>However, recognising that there are areas of the country that are not as economically attractive for firms to invest in infrastructure and services due to lower population densities and lower concentrations of industries, my Department has undertaken a number of initiatives to facilitate the roll-out of advanced communications infrastructure which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in regional Ireland and lower the cost differentials between the regions.</P>
      <P>In 1999, under the National Development Plan, 1994-1999, and INTERREG II, &euro;26.5 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Thirteen projects which rolled-out broadband nationwide to a value &ndash; both public and private funding &ndash; of &euro;70 million were supported and are now completed. These projects entailed the roll-out of broadband services in the Border, midlands and west region and the south and east region.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, the figure allocated to telecommunications initiatives was approximately &euro;200 million. Funding under this communications and e-commerce measure of the NDP will be utilised to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced information and communications infrastructure and services which will enhance the potential for the development of electronic commerce facilities and enable the electronic provision of public services, including education services, virtual libraries, welfare and health services.</P>
      <P>A first call for proposals was run in 2000 and on foot of submissions received, nine contracts were signed at the beginning of last year which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure and increased availability of broadband services for business and residential users. The projects involved are scheduled to be completed by the end of next year and will entail an overall investment of &euro;160 million in broadband leveraged from grant assistance of approximately &euro;55 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among these projects ESB is building a new national fibre backbone, Nevadatele is developing regional e-commerce centres and Esat is extending its national network and accelerating its roll-out of DSL in 40 locations. The broadband programme announced in March will involve 20 projects which will lead to the construction of metropolitan area fibre optic networks in towns, to link up with the existing backbone network in the country. The town links will facilitate consumers, educational establishments, industry and business and provide &ldquo;always on&rdquo; low cost and high speed Internet access which will drive the Government's e-commerce agenda. By reducing the cost of access to fibre rings, it will facilitate the provision of broadband services by a greater a number of operators and the ensuing competition <Col N="255" /> should benefit the end users in these towns. The relevant local authorities have been asked to enter procurement to establish firm prices for their proposals. Once procurement is completed, and subject to satisfactory pricing, contracts will be offered for these projects in the order that the local authorities complete the procurement processes to the satisfaction of my Department. It is anticipated that this will take place over the coming months. It is expected that these projects will be completed progressively over the next two years.</P>
    <P>The amount of Exchequer funding spent since 1999 on the roll-out of broadband to the regions is as follows: 1999 &ndash;&euro;600,530; 2000 &ndash;&euro;3,462,095; 2001 &ndash;&euro;26,566,000; and 2002 &ndash;&euro;5,593,000.</P>

      <P>No subsidy was paid in respect of Bellacorrick power station in County Mayo in 2001 under a public service obligations &ndash; PSO &ndash; scheme. The PSO scheme referred to by the Deputy was introduced by ministerial order in May 2002.</P>
      <P>The Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, (Public Service Obligations) Order 2002, S.I. No. 217 of 2002 (PSO Order). directs the Commission for Energy Regulation to impose public service obligations on ESB which will require ESB to purchase, up until 31 December 2019, at the latest, the output of certain peat and renewable-alternative electricity generating stations in the interests of security of supply and environmental protection respectively.</P>
      <P>The PSO order will lead, <i>inter alia,</i> to the construction and commissioning no later than 2005 of two new peat stations by ESB, at Shannonbridge and Lanesboro, in line with the orderly closure of existing peat stations. The new peat stations will be in addition to the peat station at Edenderry built by the Finnish energy company Fortum, which came into commercial operation in December 2000.</P>
      <P>The PSO order provides for the introduction of a PSO levy on final electricity customers, with effect from 1 January 2003, to compensate ESB for the additional costs incurred in complying with these public service obligations. It is important to note that the cost of these sources of electricity is already embedded in ESB's franchise tariff and therefore, on introduction of the PSO levy, an appropriate adjustment will be made to separately identify the PSO levy on electricity bills, on a basis approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation.</P>

My Department's technical adviser, the Office of Public Works (OPW), evaluates each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>
      <P>In the case of Askeaton swimming pool, the preliminary report was submitted by Limerick County Council on 1 November 2002. This documentation is currently with the Office of Public Works for examination. This proposal will be considered further, once this assessment is complete.</P>

      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme 2000-2002, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study.

Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>
      <P>Under the programme, grants of up to a maximum of &euro;3,809,214 are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room.</P>
      <P>In the case of the pool in question, Drogheda Borough Council has re-examined the design of the swimming pool and its funding proposals. The council submitted an addendum to the original preliminary report in respect of the Drogheda pool in early November. This documentation is currently being examined by the Office of Public Works. Once this assessment is complete, the proposal will be considered further.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Adoption Board that it wrote to the Vietnamese Minister for Justice, who has responsibility for adoption matters, in November 2001, January 2002 and again in September 2002 inquiring if it would be possible to enter into a working arrangement on adoption with Ireland and asking for confirmation on whether adoptions from Vietnam to Ireland will be suspended. The board has not received a response to date but I understand that it is likely that Vietnam will suspend all adoptions to countries that do not have a bilateral agreement in place on adoption from 1 January 2003. The board has also written to the Department of Foreign Affairs asking for the Irish ambassador to make representations with the Vietnamese authorities on behalf of the board concerning these issues.</P>
      <P>I have recently asked the Irish Ambassador to Vietnam to raise Ireland's interest in negotiating a bilateral agreement on adoption with the Vietnamese authorities and to take the necessary steps to facilitate this process. I have also asked my Department and the Adoption Board to assist the ambassador in the negotiation process if that proves helpful. I intend monitoring progress in this regard and have asked my officials to keep me informed of developments.</P>
      <P>In considering working arrangements with other countries it is essential that we are satisfied that these arrangements uphold the spirit of the Hague Convention on intercountry adoption and that all adoptions take place in the best interests of the children concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The delivery of orthodontic services is a matter for the chief executive officers of the health boards in the first instance. I understand that the chief executive officers have established a review group on the public orthodontic service which is considering the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Health and Children in the context both of the historical development of the service and of the national health strategy. I understand that the review group is made up of senior administrative and clinical personnel within the health boards. The work of this group will inform the development of an orthodontic action plan, which was one of the recommendations of the joint committee.</P>
      <P>My Department is continuing to support the development of the public orthodontic services. In line with at least five of the recommendations of the joint committee, my Department expects to fund eleven dentists this year for internationally recognised specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and the UK. These eleven trainees are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year at the Dublin Dental School and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion in Northern Ireland. This is an aggregate of eighteen public service dentists currently in training for internationally recognised specialist in orthodontics qualifications.</P>
      <P>These training programmes are made possible by co-operation between the health boards, the majority of consultant orthodontists and the dental teaching institutions. Recently, two dentists that had been sponsored for such specialist training have qualified and taken up duty in the Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>My Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork university dental school to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the board has informed me that Cork university dental school is in discussion with an interested candidate for the post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other recommendations of the joint Oireachtas committee are also being acted upon. In particu<Col N="262" /> lar: the grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service; the number of specialist in orthodontics posts for the health boards is being finalised, using the estimated number of children eligible for orthodontic treatment under the 1985 guidelines; these national manpower requirements will feed into an orthodontic action plan; health boards are initiating reviews of their assessment waiting lists as recommended; and the committee also stated that it would support a public/private mix of staff and facilities that would lead to a continuous reduction in the number awaiting treatment. Last June, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The Mid-Western Health Board received &euro;0.451million from the fund for the treatment of cases in this way; the committee referred to the need to employ orthodontic auxiliaries in the public orthodontic service in order to increase case loads. A scheme for the creation of this grade &ndash; to be known as orthodontic therapist &ndash; is being finalised by the Dental Council in conjunction with officials from my Department.</P>
    <P>The number of patients in orthodontic treatment has begun to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services begin to take effect. The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that at the end of the September 2002 quarter, there were 18,511 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 1,216 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in December 2001.</P>
    <P>Finally, the joint committee has &ndash; in my view quite rightly &ndash; drawn attention to the fact that the co-operation of all regional consultants is required for an efficient service to be delivered in all health boards. I strongly agree with the committee's view that the interests of children are paramount and must take precedence over all other interests and my Department stands ready to support increased co-operation among the relevant stakeholders.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created to address the issues of recruitment and retention of qualified clinical personnel in the orthodontic service. In addition, my Department expects to fund eleven dentists this year from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics <Col N="264" /> qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. This is an aggregate of eighteen public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. The creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist is another structural measure being introduced in order to increase the number of orthodontic treatments.</P>
    <P>In the short-term, additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. Furthermore, my Department has provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me of the following information on their orthodontic waiting lists as at the end of the September 2002 quarter:</P>

    <P>*There are no category A patients awaiting assessment, category B have an average waiting time of 48 months for assessment.</P>

    <P>

    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Patients in category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. Patients in category B have less severe problems than category A patients and are placed on the orthodontic treatment waiting list. The number of cases treated is dependent on the level of resources available, in terms of qualified staff, in the area and this is reflected in the treatment waiting list. In fact, the provision of orthodontic services is currently severely restricted due to the limited availability of trained specialist clinical staff to assess and treat patients and accordingly boards do not normally maintain category C waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards have further informed me that at the end of the September 2002 quarter, there were 18,511 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 1,216 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in December 2001. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of orthodontic treatment to the person concerned rests with the Southern Health Board. My Department has asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and to reply to him directly.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board (SHB) has informed me that at the end of the September 2002 quarter, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 6,165 cases awaiting orthodontic assessment in the board's area. The chief executive officer has further informed me that at the end of the same quarter, there were 3,067 cases receiving orthodontic treatment in the SHB. This is an increase of 767 patients when compared with the end of the December 2001 quarter.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have taken a range of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis that will impact positively in the SHB area. A grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created to address the issues of recruitment and retention of qualified clinical personnel in the orthodontic service. In addition, my Department expects to fund eleven dentists this year from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. This is an aggregate of eighteen public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. The creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist is another structural measure being introduced in order to increase the number of orthodontic treatments.</P>
      <P>In the short-term, additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. For its initiative the SHB received an additional &euro;1.032 million and this is enabling the board to, <i>inter alia</i>, recruit additional staff. Furthermore, my Department has provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. The SHB received &euro;0.720 million from this fund for the treatment of cases in this way.</P>
      <P>My Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork university dental school to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. Finally, I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 339 to 344, inclusive and 373, together.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been made in addressing the human resource requirements of the health service in the area of clinical psychology. In the year to end 2001 there has been an increase of over 100% (from 30 posts to about 60) in the number of trainee clinical psychologists employed. The Deputies may also wish to note the significant increase, in excess of 30% (+91 to 380), over the past two years in the numbers of fully qualified psychologists working in the health service.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently supporting the provision for the second year of in excess of 30 training places in clinical psychology through the Psychological Society of Ireland's post-graduate diploma. The report of the joint review group on psychological services, published in March 2002, refers to the swift response of my Department to the requirement for the provision of additional training places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Primary responsibility for the provision of training places to meet recruitment needs in clinical psychology, consistent with the recommendations of the joint review group rests with the health boards, especially in the context of the requirement to better integrate human resource planning with the service planning process. This is <Col N="269" /> reflected, for example, in the provision of funding directly by health boards in support of training places in clinical psychology at UCD. As far as the doctoral programme in clinical psychology at TCD is concerned, I understand that the course has not been cancelled, rather the start date has been postponed in order for funding arrangements to be finalised by the Northern Area Health Board and the other area boards, along with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and other interested parties. This is being undertaken with a view to the course commencing early in 2003.</P>
    <P>The funding for post-graduate training in clinical psychology at PSI provided by my Department at a cost of &euro;1.2 million in 2002 has been distributed to the following agencies:</P>
    <P>Beaumont Hospital</P>
    <P>Central Remedial Clinic</P>
    <P>Cheeverstown House</P>
    <P>Mater Hospital</P>
    <P>Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary, Kildare</P>
    <P>Stewart's Hospital</P>
    <P>South-Eastern Health Board</P>
    <P>Brothers of Charity, South-Eastern Region</P>
    <P>Southern Health Board</P>
    <P>COPE Foundation, Cork</P>
    <P>Brothers of Charity, Southern Region</P>
    <P>Brothers of Charity, Mid-Western Region</P>
    <P>Western Health Board</P>
    <P>Brothers of Charity, Western Region</P>
    <P>Western Care Association, Mayo</P>
    <P>North-Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the recruitment of staff and for monitoring the level of vacancies in the health service lies with the employing health agency. As my Department does not routinely collect data on vacancy levels in individual grades, it has therefore asked the chief executive officer of each health board to provide the information requested on vacancy levels. This information will be provided to the Deputies, as soon as possible, along with the information requested on the total numbers of training places in clinical psychology currently being provided, which is being obtained from the Department of Education and Science. I understand that, following a request received from my Department, the director of the health boards executive has undertaken to work with the directors of human resources in the health boards to develop an approach to facilitate the implementation of the recommendations of the joint review group. This will be undertaken in light of service imperatives, funding priorities and relevant developments such as the recommendations on investment in education and training included in the action plan for people management published earlier this month.</P>

      <P>I have been informed that the patient has been assigned to an orthopaedic surgeon who is on leave until 29 November 2002. On his return, an appointment will be made for the patient and an admission date for surgery will then be agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to clarify the position in relation to Beaumont Hospital and to refute the implication that there has been any neglect of the hospital by this Government in terms of its development or refurbishment.</P>
      <P>In February 2000 the Department of Health and Children approved major equipment replacement and refurbishing works at Beaumont Hospital. As the Deputy will appreciate, major works such as these must, of necessity, be introduced on a phased basis to minimise disruption to patient services. The replacement equipment programme, costing approximately &euro;11 million, is almost completed. A new range of windows is currently being tested as part of a &euro;5.3 million replacement programme. Work is also due to begin in the near future on a &euro;365,000 roof waterproofing programme. New air conditioning units have recently been installed in the X-ray department and surgical theatres, at a cost of &euro;355,000. The Department, the hospital and the ERHA are finalising proposals for the refurbishment phase of the project. This work is being progressed as a priority.</P>
      <P>In terms of acute hospital bed capacity the Deputy will be aware that the Government decided, in the context of the health strategy, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. I announced the first phase of these additional beds with the commissioning of an extra 709 beds in acute hospitals at a cost of &euro;65 million. The latest advice to the Department from the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards indicates that in excess of 600 beds will be in place by year end and that the remainder will be commissioned early in the new year. The increase in bed capacity will allow the hospital system to significantly increase activity levels for public patients. An additional 35 beds are being provided at Beaumont Hospital under this initiative. The Department is informed by the ERHA that these beds will be commissioned early in 2003.</P>
      <P>The health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, outlines a programme of investment and reform of the health services. The underlying principle is to ensure that care is delivered in the most appropriate setting. Strategies are being developed in the areas of primary and community care, services for older people and physical and sensory disability services to increase the capacity of such services to provide the necessary care in the appropriate setting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that funding has been provided in recent years for the contracting of additional places in private nursing homes to help reduce the effect of inappropriately placed patients on the acute hospital system. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that an additional &euro;1 million has recently been provided to the ERHA to cover the cost of providing additional contract beds in the current year. This additional funding will further assist in alleviating the pressure of inappropriate bed occupancy in the acute <Col N="273" /> hospitals over the winter months. I understand that Beaumont will have access to an additional ten places under this initiative.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures taken, including the capital investment, by my Department, the authority and the hospital concerned, will provide a greatly enhanced environment and service at Beaumont Hospital for patients, staff and visitors.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970 determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>The health strategy includes a number of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board chief executive officers under the PPF which include streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency; providing clearer information to people about how and where to apply for medical cards; and proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available.</P>
      <P>As the determination of eligibility is a matter for the chief executive officers of each health board, my Department has written to the chief executive officers of the health boards requesting that they look into this matter and reply directly to you.</P>

      <P>There are 12 designated beds in Waterford Regional Hospital for haematology-oncology patients. The South-Eastern Health Board has informed my Department that the oncology beds are fully serviced. The board is satisfied that the current level of nursing cover is adequate to support these beds. However, the board expects that there will be increasing demand for oncology services particularly in the light of the development, of the symptomatic breast cancer services in the region. The board has established a project team to examine how best to address these demands, including the need for additional oncology-haematology beds in Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>

      <P>The board currently treats eight oncology-haematology patients on a day care basis. The board expects to transfer its day care services to a new facility within the Hospital early in the new year and increase the number of day care patients treated at the hospital to approximately ten to 12 depending on the type of treatment required. With regard to palliative care beds, the board, at present, is carrying out a needs assessment in accordance with the recommendations of the report of the national advisory committee on palliative care. The objective is to prepare a revised plan for palliative care in the light of the conclusions and recommendations of this report.</P>

      <P>The drug payment scheme, DPS, replaced the drug cost subsidisation, DCSS, and drugs refund, DRS, schemes, and provided that families only have to meet the first &euro;53.33 per month of spending on approved prescribed medicines. The DCSS threshold was &euro;40.63 per month per individual, and for the DRS it was &euro;114.28 a quarter for each eligible person and dependants. Under the DRS, the person paid for medicines at the pharmacy, and claimed a refund from the health board at the end of each quarter.</P>
      <P>The aggregate financial benefits for patients under the DPS are clearly significantly greater than the old schemes. The total patient benefit under the DRS and the DCSS in 1998 was &euro;95 million, the last full year of operation. In contrast, the DPS subvention to patients was &euro;140 million in 2000, the first full year of operation, and rose to &euro;178 million in 2001, an increase of 87% in three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The DPS was initially introduced on an administrative basis, with the intention that regulations to underpin its operation would be introduced. Regulations fixing the threshold for the new scheme at &euro;53.33 per month could have been made in July 1999 under section 59 of the Health Act, 1970, but, as Government approval had been obtained to amend that section, it was decided to defer making the regulations until the Act was actually amended. At the time it was envisaged that the amending provision would be enacted very quickly. Subsequently, however, difficulties and delays arose in securing drafting time and parliamentary time for the new legislation. Fol<Col N="283" /> lowing further consideration and legal advice obtained from the Attorney General's office in October 2000, regulations to fix the threshold at &euro;53.33 per month were put in place under the existing section 59 of the 1970 Act in February 2001, with the required consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>As claimants derived greater overall benefits, reflected in the significant increase in spending, the issue of possible refunds was not addressed at that time. My Department has reviewed the position in relation to this question in the meantime, including consideration of legal advice received from the Attorney General's office.</P>
    <P>Total estimated refunds are &euro;17.3 million for a potential 175,000 claimants, with a total cost, including administration, of just under &euro;20 million. The value of individual refunds would be between &euro;1 and &euro;250, with most refunds at the lower end of the range. Many claimants would have also received tax relief on these expenses.</P>
    <P>The fact that overall the new scheme has delivered a considerable aggregate improvement in supporting individuals and families with drug costs, and the administrative complexity and costs that would arise, my Department does not propose taking any further action on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996, health boards are required within 42 days of receipt of their allocation to adopt and submit an annual service plan to my Department outlining the planned activity which they will deliver for the funding received. This legislation was put in place to improve accountability in the health services and the resultant service planning framework has led to significant benefits in the management of health service delivery.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the service planning framework has provided an opportunity not just to improve financial accountability in the narrow sense, but to enhance the way in which the health services are planned in terms of addressing changing needs and ensuring that the best possible quality of care is provided for the resources available. This has brought an enhanced framework and discipline to the management of the health services. Service plans offer a context for ensuring that policy is being implemented as required, as well as assisting in the consideration of policy and service developments. The need to clearly plan upfront activity for each year and have the plan approved by health boards means that there is a better understanding and joint ownership of the strategic management process throughout the health board system.</P>
      <P>An important feature of the service planning process is the ability to enable us to assess how we are progressing towards our goals. Formal review meetings take place at senior level over the course of the year to review the delivery of service plan objectives. By its nature, service planning is an evolving and developmental process that is subject to continuous refinement and improvement. Last year saw a set of performance indicators conjointly agreed between the health boards and the Department being put in place to enable better performance and accountability in the delivery of health board service plans. This is to enable both the Department and the boards reach a better shared understanding of the position in monitoring and evaluating the attainment of service plan objectives by the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The performance indicators reports are used as an indicative picture of the health board's position in relation to the delivery of the service plans' goals. A programme of work is continuing by joint Department and health board teams to further enhance these performance indicators. In <Col N="285" /> addition, the national health strategy, Quality and Fairness, sets down the development of three to five year strategic plans in health boards, which will further enhance the linkages between service plans and strategic objectives generally.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that the Health Boards Executive, HeBE, established on 1 March 2002 enables the health boards to work together on a range of activities which will produce considerable efficiencies and value for money throughout the system. There is no doubt that the structure of decision making, roles and responsibilities within the health system is complex, with many layers and very many intersecting roles. The present structures in the health system evolved from a model developed over 30 years ago. During that time the size, range of functions and the complexity of managing the system have all grown dramatically. The strengths and weaknesses of the system were discussed during the health strategy consultation process. The main conclusion was that while the system has served well in many respects, some significant concerns remain. These include the need for stronger co-ordination and integration of functions and services, greater consistency in access to services and delivery of services throughout the country and greater clarity around levels of decision-making in the full range of organisations and the requirement for &ldquo;whole system&rdquo; effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The strategy identified an independent audit of organisational structures and functions in the health system as one of a number of actions aimed at achieving the required improved co-ordination, integration and consistency of service delivery. My Department awarded a contract to perform an audit of the structures and functions in the health system to Prospectus Strategy Consultants on 19 June 2002. The audit is due for completion early in 2003. It is now well under way and has just entered its consultative phase. Its primary focus is to establish the organisational improvements needed to strengthen the capacity of the health system to meet the challenges of implementing the programme of development and growth, modernisation and reform set out in the Quality and Fairness strategy document.</P>

      <P>Speed limits are applied at specific locations identified by the road authorities in by-laws made under the Road Traffic Acts. The speed limits that road authorities may apply are set out in either the Acts or in regulations made under them. The road traffic signs regulations provide for a system of regulatory speed limits signs that must be provided at the locations where speed limits are applied. Speed limits reflect the maximum speed that can be driven in the optimum conditions. There is, in addition, a statutory obligation on every driver to adjust their driving, including speed, to the prevailing conditions. Electronic information panels of the kind suggested by the Deputy can provide valuable information and timely warnings to motorists, for example, about hazardous road conditions and are used by the NRA and local authorities for this purpose.</P>

      <P>Penalty points apply to speeding offences since 31 October 2002. Where a driver is convicted of an offence of exceeding the speed limit or pays a fixed charge, the appropriate number of penalty points will be endorsed on the driver's licence record.</P>
      <P>Regulations made under the Road Traffic Acts relating to speed limits, provide that vehicles being used by members of the Garda Síochána in the performance of their duties as such members, ambulances and fire brigades are exempt from the built up area speed limit, special speed limits, ordinary speed limits and the general speed limit. There are no exemptions applied in respect of the motorway speed limit.</P>
      <P>Section 38 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, also provides that the prohibition on driving a vehicle without a driving licence does not apply to a member of the Garda Síochána driving a vehicle in the course of his or her duty. That offence is listed in the Road Traffic Act, 2002, as a penalty point offence.</P>
      <P>That Act also provides that penalty points will apply to certain offences which have been specifically created under regulations relating to the control of traffic. Those regulations provide that drivers of a fire brigade vehicle or an ambulance or a member of the Garda Síochána driving a vehicle in the course of his or her duty are exempted from the prohibitions and restrictions imposed in the regulations where the use of the vehicle does not endanger the safety of road users.</P>

      <P>I fully support bike and ride initiatives in the public transport arena, which makes it easier for a prospective user of such services.</P>
      <P>A range of initiatives have been taken by Iarnród Éireann in recent years to support the development of bike and ride. These include: the development of cycle parks &ndash; these are lock-up storerooms for bicycles where the cyclist pays a deposit for a key to the lock-up &ndash; there are seven stations to date which can offer this facility in the Dublin area; and the provision of cycle racks which cyclists can use to store bicycles while they commute the rest of their journey by rail. I have been advised that this service is available at 15 stations in the Dublin area. In addition, as part of the financial support provided for the redevelopment programme at Heuston Station, there will be a facility for 250 bicycles utilising stanley racks in a secure location within the car park, monitored by CCTV. The company further informs me that, as refurbishment of stations takes place throughout the country, it is its policy that provision will be made for the parking of bicycles as a matter of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Irish Rail do not have figures for the precise cost of providing bicycle facilities as part of their general development programmes, I am advised that the Dublin Transportation Office has provided grants to Local Authorities on the DART route for cycling facilities from time to time. In this connection, &euro;516,000 and &euro;38,200 has been provided to Fingal County Council and Dún Laoghaire County Council respectively for cycle links to the DART and &euro;35,000 and &euro;9,500 to Fin<Col N="290" /> gal County Council and Bray Urban District Council respectively for cycle parking facilities. There has also been investment made by the DTO into a bus and cycle initiative at Howth Junction to the value of &euro;200,000 this year. There are also hopes to extend the park and ride cycle facility like the one currently in operation in Bray to the rest of the line.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> On the Derry-Dublin PSO route which is operated by Loganair, the average Exchequer subvention for the first full year of operation was approximately &euro;118 per passenger, per one-way trip.</P>
    <P>The overall Exchequer cost of the PSO programme over the past three years, 1999-2001 inclusive, was approximately &euro;23.55 million. In 1999 and 2000 there were four PSO routes, three of which were operated by Aer Lingus and one by Aer Arann Express. In 2001 there were six PSO routes, five of which were operated by Aer Arann Express and one by Loganair Limited. The amounts paid to these three carriers over the period in question were approximately &euro;15.36 million to Aer Arann Express, &euro;6.39 million to Aer Lingus and &euro;1.8 million to Loganair.</P>
    <P>These PSO air services provide very important links between the regional airports and the Dublin hub. Having regard, however, to the significant subvention per passenger, my Department will be undertaking over the coming months an Exchequer expenditure review of the PSO air services regime.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 398 and 400 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very much aware of the problem of crowding on our railway network, including services in north Kildare and I am conscious of the <Col N="292" /> discomfort and inconvenience this causes to passengers.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann has a statutory responsibility for ensuring the safety of its passengers. It is, therefore, a matter for the company to satisfy itself that the number of passengers being carried in any particular train or carriage does not compromise overall passenger safety.</P>
    <P>Data provided by Iarnród Éireann shows that over the period from 1994 to 2001, passenger numbers on all suburban services increased from 18.8 million to 22.7 million. In order to address this growth in traffic, significant funding has been, and continues to be, made available to Iarnród Éireann for investment to improve the safety of the network, increase the passenger capacity of the system and improve the quality, reliability and speed of services.</P>
    <P>However, the railway inspectorate of my Department continues to monitor developments in regard to crowding on trains. The inspectorate has been in contact with Iarnród Éireann on a number of occasions drawing its attention to the importance of keeping the issue of crowding under review.</P>
    <P>The Railway Safety Bill, 2001, which is at Second Stage in this House, will require all railway undertakings, including Iarnród Éireann, to implement a formal safety management system and to describe that system in a document called a safety case. The Bill will require a railway undertaking to identify in its safety case all issues impacting on the safety of its operations. Such issues would include its strategy for managing crowding of trains. The railway safety commission, to be established under the Bill, will need to be satisfied that the overall safety management system is adequate to ensure the safety of passengers.</P>
    <P>As regard increasing capacity on services, Iarnród Éireann have ordered 80 diesel railcars for use on suburban services. These will begin to be delivered from December next and should be in service by mid-2003. The ongoing delivery of this new rolling stock will increase the available capacity to deal with peak periods and should help to alleviate the present crowding difficulties.</P>
    <P>With specific regard to the capacity of the Maynooth line, Iarnród Éireann have informed me that they intend to allocate a number of the new diesel railcars to the route thereby increasing capacity by 24% and removing the older Craven carriages which are unsuitable for commuter services.</P>

      <P>Iarnród Éireann has a statutory responsibility to manage its railway safely. The company has assured me that all railway services on its network operate to strict standards, which are in place to ensure the highest level of safety for its customers and staff.</P>
      <P>This Government places the highest priority on the safety of our railways and is carrying forward two very important railway safety initiatives started by the previous administration. These initiatives, when complete, will greatly enhance the safety of our railways.</P>
      <P>The first of these initiatives is the railway safety programme which was approved by Government in March 1999. This safety investment programme involves investment of &euro;546 million over the five years 1999-2003. Already this programme has seen over &euro;400 million invested to date and has transformed many parts of the railway. By end 2001 Iarnród Éireann had replaced 246 miles of track with continuous welded rail, permanently closed or made safer 371 level crossings and renewed 228 bridges. Significant funding has also been made available under the programme for works to cuttings and embankments, fencing and to the improvement of safety management systems. Further significant funding is being made available to Iarnród Éireann under the programme in 2002 and 2003 for continuation of this initiative.</P>
      <P>I also intend in the near future to re-convene the railway safety task force to make recommendations for a new five year railway safety investment programme to commence in 2004. The second of these initiatives is the Railway Safety Bill, 2001, which is continuing its Second Stage debate in this House tomorrow. This Bill, when enacted, will modernise the railway safety regulatory framework by establishing a railway safety commission to regulate and enforce railway safety and investigate railway accidents. The Bill also places duties on railway undertakings, their staff and third parties and requires railway undertakings to put in place formal safety management systems.</P>

      <P>Dublin Bus serves the Kildare towns of Maynooth, Kilcock, Leixlip and Celbridge. Over the past few years, additional resources have been allocated to the routes 66, 66A, 66B, 66X, 67, 67A and 67X, which serve these towns, to take advantage of the <Col N="294" /> bus priority measures on the Lucan quality bus corridor, QBC.</P>
      <P>Dublin Bus plans to further increase the service to all four towns to exploit the advantages of the proposed Lucan QBC extension to the Spa Hotel with both all day and peak time Xpress schedules adding capacity and frequency to these routes.</P>
      <P>Commuters from the north Kildare area are also benefiting from the enhanced services provided by Bus Éireann, with an increase in scheduled departures. For example, on the Edenderry-Clane-Dublin route, the number of departures has increased from six in 1999 to 20 today. There is also a 200% increase in departures on the Mullingar-Kilcock-Dublin route. High capacity commuter coaches are serving all these routes together with the Naas-Newbridge route.</P>

      <P>A local authority-DTO regional traffic management steering group has been established to provide a strong regional focus for traffic management in the greater Dublin area and to provide a forum to lead policy development and implementation of the traffic management elements of A Platform for Change, for which local authorities have primary responsibility. The steering group is chaired by the director of traffic. I fully support the establishment of this group and my Department is represented on it.</P>
      <P>The DTO policy document, A Platform for Change, sets out a comprehensive integrated strategy to respond to the transportation needs of the greater Dublin area in the period to 2016. In this context, the DTO has commissioned a regional freight study to determine the origin and destination patterns of goods distribution and to forecast future demand. It will identify restrictions for general goods distribution and for freight trips to and from Dublin Port, Dún Laoghaire Port and Dublin Airport. It will also review the scope for improved goods distribution strategies, including consolidation centres, night-time deliveries, as well as considering pricing strategies, loading, layover and general distribution management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application of traffic management measures at any location is a matter for local authorities in consultation with the Garda Commissioner. I understand that Dublin City Council is in ongoing consultation with business interests <Col N="295" /> with a view to restricting the hours within which deliveries can be made on certain critical routes in the city centre.</P>

      <P>The provision of traffic signs in any area is the responsibility of the local authority. In carrying out that responsibility local authorities must have regard to the traffic signs manual or directions issued by me and, in relation to regulatory traffic signs, the traffic signs regulations made under the Road Traffic Acts.</P>
      <P>Dublin City Council recently devised signage proposals for the purpose of the determination of orbital routes in the city. The initial proposals were not in compliance with the provisions of the traffic signs manual and were not proceeded with. Revised proposals for orbital signage have now been submitted to my Department by Dublin City Council. My Department is now consulting with the city council, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the National Roads Authority, on the new proposals. When that consultation process is completed I will authorise the use of the resulting new signage system.</P>
      <P>Subject to compliance with the general parameters that will be set in such directions, the content of the signs provided by any local authority will be a matter for their determination.</P>

The consultancy was completed and a report was submitted in April 1999. The report concluded, <i>inter alia</i>, that given the then progress on Luas lines A, B and C, they should continue to be procured on a conventional basis; a PPP approach could and should be adopted for further phases of the Dublin light rail project; and private sector operators should be invited to bid for the franchise to operate the system.

      <P>The role of Currie &amp; Brown in association with Ernst &amp; Young consultancy was to review existing arrangements within the Department for monitoring and reviewing investment in public transport projects under the National Development Plan 2000-2006; and to specify in a written report the requirements for, and facilitate the successful implementation of, a system which was to: ensure effective and timely financial reporting to the Department of capital expenditure under the NDP by the CIE group of companies; enable ongoing monitoring by the Department of the implementation of the NDP by the CIE group; ensure consistency of approach and reporting by all companies in the CIE groups across the investment programme; provide an early warning of any emerging difficulties to allow time for corrective action; and ensure that modifications to the investment programme are managed, reported and recorded in an effective manner. The project was completed, and the final report submitted, in 2001, at a total cost of &euro;136,192.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key recommendations of the report were: the establishment of a dedicated investment monitoring unit, IMU; the creation of a project <Col N="297" /> monitoring process; and the establishment of a formal reporting system.

      <P>Dr. Reynolds-Feighan carried out a study entitled &ldquo;Comparison of Subvention Levels for Public Transport Systems in European Cities&rdquo; for the then Department of Public Enterprise in 2000. The final report was submitted in April 2000, at cost of £8,000, or &euro;10,160. Her study identified the need for greater clarity in specifying required service levels and quality in the context of the subvention, and the need for the Department to obtain more detailed information on costs and revenue in Dublin Bus. My Department has since developed a cost-revenue model for Dublin Bus. A performance indicator system has also been put in place to ensure greater clarity in regard to the efficiency and effectiveness of Dublin Bus, and I understand that agreement has been reached with all of the CIE operating companies to introduce service level agreements during 2003.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 414 and 418 together.</P>
      <P>Following a series of worrying incidents on the Iarnród Éireann railway, culminating in the Knockcroghery derailment in 1997, the Minister commissioned an independent review of all aspects of railway safety in 1998. The study was carried out by a team of independent consultants led by International Risk Management Services, IRMS, and was published in November 1998.</P>
      <P>In 1999, IRMS was commissioned to carry out an implementation review of progress being made by Iarnród Éireann against the recommendations made in the 1998 report. The report of the review was published in March 2000. A second implementation review was commissioned in November 2000 and was carried out by IRMS. Its report was published in August 2001. The cost of the review was &euro;304,319. The report of the second implementation review concluded that Iarnród Éireann had made substantial progress in improving the safety of its railway infrastructure since the first study in 1998 and that the speed of improvement had increased since the first implementation review. However, the consultants did raise concerns about the delay, at that time, in the provision of the mini-CTC signalling system and noted that the delay was continuing to cause major problems in maintaining worn out equipment on the affected routes.</P>
      <P>The Minister was concerned that the delay could lead to further deterioration of these routes and commissioned the consultants to prepare a short supplementary report on this issue. The supplementary report cost &euro;3,071 and was also published in August 2001. In the supplementary report, IRMS recommended that Iarnród Éireann prepare a comprehensive plan to ensure that adequate safety levels are maintained on the mini-CTC lines. The consultants also recommended the carrying out of a sample audit exercise to ensure that the plan was being implemented in a satisfactory fashion. IRMS was subsequently commissioned to carry out the sample audit. The audit was finalised in April 2002 at a cost of &euro;25,316. The audit was conducted by means of a review of Iarnród Éireann's management systems for the mini-CTC lines and by carrying out site visits to a representative sample of the affected railway lines to assess the safety of the physical infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultants concluded that overall the results of the sample audit gave confidence that <Col N="300" /> Iarnród Éireann is adequately controlling risks on the mini-CTC lines through the infrastructure refurbishment works and operational controls that have been put in place. Arising from the audit, IRMS made ten recommendations. The main recommendation was that Iarnród Éireann should ensure that the decision to proceed with the revised mini-CTC scheme using in-house resources did not divert limited essential resources from elsewhere in the company. In response to this recommendation, Iarnród Éireann has confirmed to my Department that adequate resources are available to carry out the mini-CTC project and for ongoing non mini-CTC work. Work on addressing the other recommendations is largely complete. I have asked that a copy of the sample audit report be sent to the Deputy for his information and that arrangements be made for this report to be made available on my Department's website as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Department of Transport, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment and Local Government, has commissioned consultants to make recommendations for public safety zones in the vicinity of Cork, Dublin and Shannon airports. The recommendations of the consultants, ERM, will specifically deal with the risk to people on the ground. ERM's study is nearly complete. Before its report is finalised, ERM will engage in public consultation on its report, including public meetings in Dublin, Cork and Shannon. The public consultation is expected to take place early in the new year.</P>
      <P>ERM were engaged at the beginning of 2001, and the costs of the consultancy to date is &euro;203,000. When the report is completed following the public consultation, it will be considered by the Government with a view to the Department of the Environment and Local Government issuing planning guidelines in accordance with the Planning Acts to the local authorities to assist them in their consideration of the public safety aspects of planning applications in the vicinity of airports.</P>

      <P>In July 2001 consultants were appointed by my Department to examine the financial and other technical issues which would arise in the context of a restructuring of the CIE group of companies. This study was commissioned as a result of proposals contained in the document A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport, which was published in August 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was a technical study to advise on the options for dealing with issues such as assets, debt, pensions and the range of services provided centrally by CIE to its three operating companies in the context of a possible restructuring which would see each of the three CIE operating sub<Col N="302" /> sidiaries established as independent companies. This study has now been completed and my Department received the final report in August this year.</P>
    <P>I recently put forward proposals for a restructuring of CIE in my statement to the public transport forum on 7 November 2002. I propose to dissolve CIE and establish Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann as independent commercial State companies. I will be arranging in the near future to brief the CIE board and the trade unions on the content of the consultancy report, after which I plan to publish it. The total cost for the consultancy including VAT and expenses is &euro;256,166.99.</P>

      <P>Ireland and the United Kingdom have operated an arrangement for many years known as the &ldquo;common travel area&rdquo;. Both States co-operate to ensure that their respective immigration procedures prevent persons from being allowed to land at first port of entry if they would not be allowed to enter the other State and if it is suspected that they are likely to exploit the common travel area in order to do so illegally. As a result citizens of both jurisdiction enjoy passport free travel within the common travel area.</P>
      <P>Under Irish immigration law the benefit of passport free travel does not apply to persons who are not Irish or British citizens. Consequently, immigration officers are empowered to carry out immigration checks on aliens (persons who are not Irish or British citizens) upon their arrival in the State, even from Great Britain or Northern Ireland. As a matter of practicality therefore in certain cases, an immigration officer may ask a passenger for evidence in support of a claim that he or she is an Irish citizen and is thus exempt from immigration control. While there are a number of practical ways in which this may be achieved, possession of an Irish passport is a very effective means of doing so. However, hundreds of Irish citizens regularly avail of the benefits of free movement with the common travel area without being in possession of a passport.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 424, 427, 435 and 441 together.</P>
      <P>A proposal for a research project on racism in Irish prisons has been the subject of correspondence and contact between my Department and both the Irish Penal Reform Trust (IPRT) and Amnesty International for some time. The initial application in the matter was contained in a letter of 21 September 2001 from the IPRT to the director general of the Irish Prisons Service.</P>
      <P>The director general replied on the same day expressing regret that it was not possible to facilitate the trust on that occasion because a very similar research project was just under way and it would not be fair to people in custody to have two sets of researchers engage with them on similar research at the same time. It has since become apparent that the project proposed by the IPRT would be a joint venture with Amnesty International.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" />I recognise the valuable work undertaken by Amnesty International in protecting human rights throughout the world and the important contribution of the non-governmental sector in regard to research in prisons. However, in this particular instance I did not consider it appropriate to facilitate overlapping research projects on racism in Irish prisons and I explained my views fully to Amnesty International in correspondence in July and September of this year.</P>
    <P>That correspondence indicated that the Irish prison system is already the subject of continuous scrutiny by independent national and international bodies and that the Irish prison service has facilitated several recent independent research projects, including studies undertaken by the IPRT on the use of segregation cells and on the incidence of HIV/hepatitis in the prisoner population. The non-governmental sector will continue to be afforded access to prisoners for the purpose of research in appropriate cases. It is simply the case that, in this particular instance, I did not see merit in duplicating, to a significant degree, research already under way.</P>
    <P>As regards the racism research project already in progress, I should say that it, too, is an independent project which is being conducted by the National Training and Development Institute (NTDI) who were selected following a publicly advertised tender competition. The purpose of the research is to provide a basis for a racism awareness programme for prison staff and prisoners. I have given an undertaking that my Department will provide Amnesty International with a copy of the completed NTDI research report as well as information, in due course, on the implementation and evaluation of the subsequent programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 425 and 432 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national voluntary age card scheme, provided for in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, is designed to assist licensees in complying with the law. In any proceedings against a licensee for the sale of alcohol to an under-age person, it is a defence to prove that an age card was looked for and was produced by the person concerned. <Col N="305" /> Serious penalties, including temporary closure of a licensed premises, can result where a licensee is convicted of the offence of selling intoxicating liquor to an under-age person.</P>
    <P>The legislation does not preclude the use of other forms of personal identification for proof of age purposes, but I would encourage use of the age card wherever possible. I remain unconvinced that a mandatory age card would be more effective, and I believe that the current age card scheme, coupled with the substantial changes provided for in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, is proving an effective deterrent against under-age drinking. In this regard, the latest figures available to me indicate that over 80,000 age cards have been issued by the Garda to date.</P>
    <P>In order to further promote the use of age cards, my Department recently placed a contract valued at approximately &euro;150,000 with an advertising agency to conduct an awareness campaign for the national age card scheme. The campaign will focus both on encouraging all licensed premises, including on and off-licences to demand production of the age card and on encouraging 18 to 23 year olds who wish to purchase alcohol to apply for it. A variety of media will be used, including radio, the Internet, posters, direct mail packs and trade publications.</P>

      <Col N="307" /> As Minister, I have no official responsibility to the Dáil in relation to operational matters with regard to the courts service which is, of course, independent in the performance of its functions. I have, however, in this instance, for the sake of completeness, sought relevant information from the service. In this regard, I am advised that the service has a total of 213 car parking spaces in the area referred to. It is also understood that there are a number of spaces in the Four Courts complex allocated to the Land Registry and the Law Library.</P>

Some limited accrual information is also provided in the accounts. This format for the annual accounts is adopted in order to comply fully with the relevant statutory requirements, Government accounting procedures and other directions issued by the Department of Finance. The accounts are published each year in the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Any proposals to change from the current format to full accrual accounting would be a matter for the Government on the advice of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>It is a fundamental requirement for relief under the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' (tax concessions) scheme that an applicant must meet the specified medical criteria and be in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the relevant health board. Where the issue of such a certificate is refused, the person concerned may appeal that decision to the disabled drivers' medical board of appeal, an independent board whose decision is final. Neither my Department nor the revenue commissioners have any role in the medical assessment of persons for the purposes of the relief.</P>
      <P>The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concession under this scheme are set out in the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers (tax concession) scheme regulations 1994 (S.I. No. 353 of 1994). Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The six different types of disablement are as follows: persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; persons who are wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to movement of their lower limbs; persons without both hands or without both arms; persons without one or both legs; persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; and persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the revenue commissioners that the person concerned was refused a primary medical certificate by the board of appeal on the 18 November 2002, as he did not satisfy the medical conditions outlined above. I have received the report of the interdepartmental review group on this scheme. Any recommendations contained in this report, whether to change the medical criteria or otherwise, will receive full consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, a court may make a community service order as an alternative to a sentence of imprisonment or detention in respect of any individual over the age of 16 years who has been convicted of a criminal offence and who consents to the order being made. The order requires an offender to perform unpaid work for between 40 and 240 hours, usually to be completed within 12 months.</P>
      <P>The aim of a community service order is to rehabilitate the offender through the discipline of having to work in the community and the making of meaningful reparation to that community for his or her crime. The making of a community service order is a matter entirely for the judiciary and one in which I have no function. I do, however, believe that a court should have a wide range of effective options, including community service orders, available to it when considering sentences for certain types of offenders.</P>

      <P>Penalties under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, range from the imposition of monetary fines to life imprisonment depending on the particular offence and the circumstances of the case. I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, that possession of any controlled drug, without due authorisation, is an offence under section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977. Penalties for unlawful possession for the purpose of sale or supply range from imprisonment for up to one year and-or a fine on summary conviction, or up to imprisonment for life and/or an unlimited fine on conviction on indictment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Possession of cannabis or cannabis resin for personal use is punishable by a fine on first or second conviction. From a third offence onwards, possession for personal use of cannabis or cannabis resin incurs a fine and-or a term of imprisonment up to one year, on summary conviction <Col N="310" /> and imprisonment for up to three years and-or a fine on conviction on indictment. Possession in any other case incurs a penalty of imprisonment for up to one year and-or a fine on summary conviction and up to seven years imprisonment on conviction on indictment. I am satisfied that the existing penalties are adequate and appropriate to deal with possession of drugs in small quantities. However, although there are no plans for legislative change, the operation of the law in these areas will continue to be kept under review by my Department.</P>
    <P>One of the key recommendations of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, which was launched in May 2001, is that regional drugs task forces &ndash; RDTFs &ndash; be established throughout the country to develop appropriate policies for their regions. The RDTFs will have a key role to play in the whole area of prevention and will also be responsible for identifying and addressing any gaps in service provision to tackle the drug problem in their areas. In terms of their establishment, I understand that nominations have been sought from the various sectors to be represented on the RDTFs. I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have submitted nominees for each of the RDTFs to the national drugs strategy team.</P>
    <P>In addition, the national drugs strategy team has prepared guidelines for the operation of the RDTFs which have been circulated to the various sectors and agencies. It is expected that the work of the RDTFs will get under way early next year. I am also informed by the Garda authorities that they have established dedicated drug units in areas outside the boundaries of the current local drugs task forces and that the allocation of Garda resources is constantly monitored to ensure that it reflects policing priorities regarding illegal drug distribution.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department has been given overall responsibility for the development and co-ordination of child care services over the course of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. In this regard, the equal opportunities child care programme, established in April 2000, has been developed with the objective of significantly increasing the number of <Col N="312" /> child care places and improving the quality of child care services to enable parents to avail of work, education and training opportunities. Some &euro;437 million has been made available for this purpose from the Exchequer and the European Union.</P>
      <P>On 2 August 2001 an application for a capital grant, under the programme, was received in my Department from the group in question. The application was immediately passed to ADM Limited who administer the programme on my behalf, to carry out a technical appraisal of the project proposals. As part of the appraisal process, all large-scale projects are referred, by ADM Limited for evaluation by an external building specialist. I have made inquiries and have been informed that the development officer, assigned to this application, is currently awaiting the report from the external building specialist.</P>
      <P>On completion of this process, the assessment will be referred to the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, for a recommendation before I make a decision on the application. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on this capital grant application.</P>

      <P>Applications for Garda CCTV systems are assessed by the advisory committee, established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate CCTV applications, on the basis of Garda operational needs and include the following criteria: crime-public order statistics in the area; population and level of activity there; the recommendation of local Garda management; any special circumstances &ndash; needs that exist; and the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system to the area.</P>
      <P>Co-funding is also a feature of Garda CCTV systems and this is usually addressed when it has been decided to install a Garda CCTV system in an area.</P>
      <P>Finglas is one of 17 locations set to receive new Garda CCTV systems over the next two years &ndash; subject to the availability of funds. The other locations &ndash; in alphabetical order &ndash; are Athlone, Ballyfermot, Bray, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Ennis, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Sligo, Tallaght and Waterford.</P>
      <P>In relation to Finglas, it was intended that the system would consist of nine cameras to be monitored from Finglas Garda station. An offer has, however, been made from statutory and other bodies to fund additional cameras for incorporation in the Finglas scheme. This offer has been referred to the advisory committee where it is currently under consideration. Upon receipt of the committee's recommendation, I expect to be in a position to decide on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Government's commitments in relation to homelessness are <Col N="314" /> contained in An Agreed Programme for Government which issued in June 2002. These are: to ensure that the comprehensive homelessness strategies now in place are implemented; that homelessness, and rough sleeping in particular, is tackled in a co-ordinated manner in all parts of the country; and, in the context of the implementation of the revised national anti-poverty strategy, that by the end of 2004 sufficient and appropriate emergency accommodation is available to rough sleepers in conjunction with appropriate outreach services to enable them to access it.</P>
      <P>The issue of setting realistic targets in relation to homelessness is important in order to ensure that our efforts in providing resources and services yield positive results. A comprehensive data collection system is essential to set realistic targets and to monitor results. To this end the Homeless Agency is, with the support of my Department, currently piloting the LINK system with a number of service providers including those in the voluntary sector. This system tracks each individual person presenting as homeless to any of these service providers and this will allow a profile of people using homeless services to be built up. It is intended that the system will be extended to all homeless services in the Dublin area. Similar improvements to data collection and analysis on homelessness are being considered in other local authority areas where there are a significant number of homeless persons. The issue of improved data collection will also be addressed as part of the development of an integrated IT package for housing for all local authorities.</P>
      <P>The cross-departmental team on homelessness is examining how best to evaluate the homeless strategies and the local action plans and I intend that the issue of targets will also be addressed in the context of this evaluation.</P>

      <P>My Department has been actively engaged with the Society for the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, the Irish Motor Vehicle Recyclers Association, IMVRA, the Metal Recyclers Association of Ireland, MRAI, and other concerned parties with a view to developing a producer responsibility initiative to implement the main provisions of European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles, ELVs. A particular objective of the directive is to ensure that all ELVs are collected, dismantled and recovered by industry in an environmentally sound manner at no cost to the final holder. The directive further requires that a system for the issue of certificates of destruction in respect of scrapped vehicles be introduced.</P>

      <P>Rule 15(2) of the Second Schedule to the Electoral Act, 1992, provides that a registration authority shall, as soon as practicable, consider and rule on an application to be entered in the supplement to the register of electors and shall notify the applicant of the ruling. The time between the making of a polling day order and polling day is short having regard to the many administrative and organisational matters to be arranged by returning officers and registration authorities. In these circumstances it is not proposed to change the period for the receipt of applications for entry in the supplement before polling day.</P>

      <P>An Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to ensure that homelessness is tackled in a co-ordinated manner in all parts of the country and that the comprehensive homeless strategies now in place are implemented. While our objective is to reduce the level of homelessness as far as possible the programme does not include the specific target level of reduction referred to in the question.</P>
      <P>One of the key requirements of the Government's integrated strategy on homelessness was that local three year action plans would be drawn up by homeless fora, with representatives of the local authority, health board and voluntary sector, to detail how accommodation, health, settlement and welfare services will be provided to homeless persons by all of the agencies involved. Most of these action plans and associated local targets have now been completed and they provide a clear framework for the planning and delivery of support and services to the homeless. The remaining few plans are in the process of being finalised by local authorities and health boards and should be adopted shortly.</P>
      <P>A wide range of additional accommodation, ranging from emergency night shelter accommodation to long-term sheltered accommodation to enable homeless persons move out of emergency accommodation into long-term accommodation that is more suited to their needs, has been provided in recent years and more will be provided as part of the full implementation of the action plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial additional funding has been made available as part of the homeless strategy. Capital funding for the direct provision by local authorities of accommodation for homeless persons is <Col N="319" /> being doubled from &euro;25.4 million to &euro;50.8 million over the period 2001-05. Current funding for homeless services by local authorities has increased substantially from &euro;12.6 million in 1999 to an expected &euro;43 million this year. In addition, funding is available to the voluntary sector under my Department's capital assistance scheme towards the provision of accommodation for homeless persons.</P>
    <P>The prevention of homelessness is also being addressed. The main aim of the homeless preventative strategy, which was launched in February 2002, is to ensure that no one is released from any type of State care without the appropriate measures in place to ensure that they have a suitable place to live with the necessary supports, if needed. This strategy was prepared by my Department in conjunction with the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science, and Health and Children under the auspices of the Cross Department Team on Homelessness and contains measures to prevent homelessness among adult offenders, young offenders, those leaving mental health facilities and acute hospitals, and young people leaving care.</P>
    <P>The implementation of both the integrated and preventative strategies is being monitored by the cross-Department team on homelessness with a view to identifying and addressing any obstacles to progress.</P>

      <P>The most recent assessment of housing needs, which included a count of the number of homeless persons, was carried out by local authorities at the end of March this year. The data in relation to local authority housing waiting lists, which has been finalised and published, shows that a total of 2,468 homeless households were considered to be in need of local authority housing. This figure does not include persons who have been assessed as homeless by local authorities but who are not included on local authority housing lists because, for example, their need is not for local authority housing but rather for long-term supported accommodation.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently finalising figures in relation to the total number of persons who have been assessed as homeless in each local authority area and this information will be published shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 455, 457 and 461 together.</P>
      <P>The termination of the new house grant scheme, which was announced on 14 November 2002, arose from the necessity, in the context of the 2003 Estimates, for the Government to ensure a sustainable match between expenditure and resources, and to concentrate housing programmes on areas of greatest impact and social need. It is not proposed to reintroduce the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of terminating the new house grant, the Government has sought to ensure fair treatment first by ensuring that all applications approved or pending in my Department will, subject to the normal conditions of the scheme, qualify for grant payment. In addition, people who had already made commitments in the form of <Col N="322" /> signed contracts or by the pouring of foundations on or before 14 November 2002 have been given an opportunity to apply for the grant. The position of persons approved for a new house under the affordable housing or shared ownership schemes is also being recognised. In providing a grace period up to 4 December for cases such as these, first-time buyers who are at the most advanced stage of purchase or building are being facilitated as far as possible.</P>
    <P>The payment of a booking deposit which is &ldquo;subject to contract&rdquo; does not constitute a contract and is, therefore, excluded from the above arrangements.</P>

      <P>The value for money report on planning appeals by the Comptroller and Auditor General examined the management of the appeals system, the factors impacting on its effectiveness and measures to improve the quality control of the system. The Comptroller and Auditor General's report notes that since the mid-1990s there has been a growing backlog of cases, resulting from the major increase in the number of planning appeals in recent years.</P>
      <P>Section 126 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, which came into force on 11 March 2002, provides that it shall be the objective of the board to determine appeals within a period of 18 weeks. Prior to the 2000 Act, this objective was 4 months. The percentage of cases dealt with by the board within the relevant statutory period in the years 2000 to 2002 was 47% in 2000, 29% in 2001 and 35% to end October 2002. The Comptroller and Auditor General's report indicates that the number of reports produced by the board's planning staff was an average of 86 reports in 2000. I have not received any further such information for 2001 or 2002.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by An Bord Pleanála that the situation in relation to the backlog has been reversed substantially during 2002, falling from a peak of 2,700 at the end of year 2000 to 1,440 cases at end October 2002. This has resulted from a 21% increase in the board's output this year along with a 14% decline in the intake of cases. The board has indicated that for the first time in five years its workload is at a level consistent with the board's strategic target of giving decisions within 18 weeks in 90% of cases. It is expected that the great majority of recent and future appeals will be dealt with within that timeframe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Government has taken, and will continue to take, a pro-active role in campaigning against reprocessing operations at Sellafield. An Agreed Programme for Government has stated clearly that we regard the continued existence of Sellafield as an unacceptable threat to Ireland; that it should be closed, and that we will use every diplomatic and legal route available to us to work towards the removal of this threat.</P>
      <P>The Government has taken an unprecedented initiative in pursuit of this policy objective through its separate legal actions under the OSPAR and UNCLOS Conventions in relation to the Sellafield MOX plant. These actions are proceeding on schedule and are challenging operations at the Sellafield MOX plant on economic, legal, environmental and safety grounds. In relation to the OSPAR case, oral hearings took place before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague in October last but a determination in the case is not expected until early in the new year. Oral hearings in respect of the UNCLOS case are expected to take place in the summer of 2003. The Government has not ruled out taking further legal action as appropriate.</P>
      <P>In addition, this Government has developed a strong and constructive campaign against nuclear energy in general, and against activities at Sellafield in particular, that focuses clearly on the threat to Ireland from these activities based on genuine concerns regarding safety, security and sustainability.</P>
      <P>It is for this reason that in international institutions and other multilateral fora, Ireland is actively advocating for the highest possible standards of safety as well as health and environmental protection.</P>
      <P>Ireland has also responded critically to various UK public consultation processes concerning the regulation of the UK nuclear industry covering such matters as the management of radioactive waste in the UK, a review of UK energy policy and the UK strategy for discharges from nuclear installations.</P>
      <P>The Government has repeatedly pointed out that the risks and unresolved problems associated with the nuclear energy industry, when added to the high research and capital costs, including decommissioning costs, as well as continued additional safety and security costs, mean that nuclear energy is not sustainable.</P>
      <P>The significant recorded financial losses of British Nuclear Fuels and the financial situation at British Energy further underscore our position that nuclear energy is not economically viable.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the approach outlined will be pursued vigorously and that any further opportunities to press our case will be exercised in full.</P>

      <P>My Department currently sponsors three tax incentive based schemes: the urban and town renewal schemes and a living over the shop scheme. Designations under the schemes were notified to relevant local authorities and information on the various sites designated for tax incentives are available from them.</P>
      <P>The urban renewal scheme commenced in March 1999 in the five major cities and in 38 large towns. The termination date for the scheme has been extended to end 2004. Significant progress has been made since the scheme commenced and the total investment figure over the life of the scheme is estimated at &euro;3 billion.</P>
      <P>The town renewal scheme commenced in July 2000 in 100 smaller towns and is due to expire at the end of 2003. The living over the shop (LOTS) scheme commenced in April 2001 and is operating in designated streets in the five major cities and is due to expire in 2004. Progress under both schemes has been slower than anticipated. My Department has requested local authorities to intensify their efforts in promoting the benefits of the schemes at local level. I am confident that with a pro-active approach by local authorities to implementing and promoting the schemes, significant progress can be achieved within the time period available.</P>
      <P>While monitoring data on the schemes is submitted to my Department periodically, information in relation to any specific area may more appropriately be sought from the local authorities concerned who have statutory responsibility for monitoring the schemes.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the administration of the group water scheme capital grants has been devolved to county councils since 1997. The grants are funded, as part of the wider rural water programme, through annual block grant allocations by my Department to individual county councils. It is a matter for councils themselves to prioritise and approve specific schemes for grant purposes.</P>
      <P>Since 1998, expenditure by my Department on grants towards the provision and improvement of group water schemes has amounted to over &euro;145 million (including the 2002 block allocations). The following table sets out this expenditure, which would have been augmented by group schemes' own resources, on an annual basis by county. Information in relation to the proportion of the expenditure that relates solely to water treatment equipment is not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>Since March 2000, group schemes dependent on quality deficient private sources are eligible for a 100% grant for the installation of water treatment and disinfection equipment. In order to ensure the most cost effective delivery and operation of such equipment, and to secure long-term protection of the related capital investment, procurement policy in the group scheme sector is, in common with public schemes, based on design/build/operate contracts, coupled with the bundling of numbers of projects under a single contract. My Department has recently produced a comprehensive procurement guidance document to assist local authorities and group schemes in the implementation of this policy and I am arranging to have a copy of the document sent to the Deputy.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the dry dock in Richmond Harbour, Clondra, County Roscommon, has been out of use since the early 1990s; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that this requires boaters on the River Shannon to travel great distances to get to a dry dock; if he will investigate the matter thoroughly and ensure the dry dock is re-opened; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Waterways Ireland is one of the six North-South implementation bodies established on 2 December 1999 by the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999, and the North-South Co-operation Order 1999. Waterways Ireland's remit is the management, maintenance, development and restoration of the inland navigable waterway system, principally for recreational purposes. The matter raised by the <Col N="332" /> Deputy is a day-to-day operational matter for Waterways Ireland.</P>
      <P>Waterways Ireland informs me that the dry dock at Richmond Harbour was closed on health and safety grounds. The re-opening of the dry dock is being considered at present and investigations into the feasibility of this have commenced. However, Waterways Ireland is not in a position at this stage to say whether it will re-open and the timescale involved in doing any works which might be necessary to achieve this.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="333" /> The administrative budget for my Department is also lower than the REV 2002 administrative budget, although direct comparisons with the 2002 administrative budget allocations are misleading. Administration costs for 2002 also refer to the former Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands which had far more staff and locations, and thus higher administrative costs, than my new Department.</P>
    <P>A number of key areas of my Department have also secured increased allocations in 2003. These include Ciste na Gaeilge &ndash; +8%, Tithe Gaeltachta &ndash; +5%, Oileáin &ndash; +9%, and the Drugs Initiative &ndash; +16%. The increase in funding for the drugs initiative shows the Government's continued commitment to tackling the drugs problem, and our willingness, even in times of financial pressure, to prioritise resources for this very important task.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that with responsibility for both community and local development now in the one Department, streamlining can take place to ensure more efficient delivery of services and better value for money. To this end, I will be undertaking a review of the programmes and activities under my Department's remit during 2003 to ensure better co-ordination and benefit from the various community initiatives.</P>
    <P>In the longer term this will ensure enhanced and more efficiently delivered services to those most in need of assistance.  My Department will spend approximately &euro;265 million next year on community, rural and Gaeltacht programmes. This shows the Government's continued commitment, even in these times of financial pressure, to the priority work undertaken by my Department.</P>

      <P>There are 18 measures in the CLÁR programme ranging from local road improvements to village enhancement and sports capital grants. It is not practical here to provide all the information sought by the Deputy under each of the measures. I will arrange to have all of the information that is available to me sent to him immediately.</P>
      <P>In general the measures are implemented by local authorities or other official agencies and not by my Department. Accordingly, in the case of some measures, such as village enhancement and bilingual signage, the beneficiaries only become known to my Department when the claims for payment of the CLÁR contribution are submitted by the appropriate agency.</P>

      <P>The allocation under the heading Íocaíocht leis An Foras Teanga in my Department's Vote represents the annual grant paid to An Foras Teanga, which, as the Deputy is aware, is one of the cross-Border implementation bodies established under the British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999. The language body comprises two separate agencies, Foras na Gaeilge and the Boord o Ulstèr-Scotch, the Ulstèr-Scots Agency. Foras na Gaeilge is charged with increasing the use of Irish in everyday life throughout the island of Ireland. The Boord o Ulstèr-Scotch is responsible for the promotion of greater awareness and use of Ullans and of Ulstèr Scots cultural issues, both with Northern Ireland and throughout the island.</P>
      <P>The annual allocation from my Department's Vote to An Foras Teanga in any year is delivered by way of periodic payments to the agencies, the amounts of which are agreed with the other sponsoring Department, the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland, which makes matching payments in accordance with agreed relativities. Decisions as to the ways in which the annual allocations are spent are a matter for the boards of the agencies, acting in accordance with their approved corporate and business plans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Dormant Accounts Act, 2001, is to reunite account holders with their dormant funds in credit institutions, that is banks, building societies and An Post. If the owners of accounts which have been dormant for 15 years or more do not come forward by the end of March 2003 to reclaim their moneys the balances in the accounts will be transferred to a dormant accounts fund. This fund will be established and managed by the National Management Treasury Agency. The transfer of moneys will take place on the basis that the beneficial owners of them will have a guaranteed right of reclaim to their property at any time in the future. The Act also provides for a scheme to disburse surplus dormant funds for community and societal benefit by an independent board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the legislation was enacted in July 2001 significant progress has been made in relation to implementing the Act. The Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, which comes under the aegis of my Department, was established in June. The board's functions are to prepare a disbursement plan and to direct the NTMA to make disbursements. It is currently drawing up its dis<Col N="336" /> bursement plan which is expected to be completed in the spring of 2003.</P>
    <P>The first transfer of funds from credit institutions to the dormant accounts fund is due to take place at the end of April 2003. It is only then that the amount of money available to the fund will become known. The fund will be divided into a reserve account and an investment and disbursements account. The purpose of the reserve account is to provide for reclaims by original owners or their beneficiaries and to meet the costs incurred by the NTMA and the board in performing their functions under the Act. The level of the reserve account will be set by the NTMA with my approval, given with the consent of my colleague the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The purposes for which disbursements can be made are set out in the Act. These include programmes or projects to assist persons who are economically, educationally or socially disadvantaged, persons with a disability and in particular programmes or projects to assist primary school students with learning difficulties. Disbursements from the fund can only be made following the first transfer of moneys into the fund which will take place at the end of April 2003.</P>
    <P>The Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Bill, 2002, which is currently before the Oireachtas is intended to provide another source of funding for the dormant accounts fund.</P>

      <P>Asylum seekers who arrived since 10 April 2000 are provided with full board accommodation, including meals and other services under the direct provision system operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>The income maintenance needs of asylum seekers are met for the most part by the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department. This scheme is subject to a means test. A weekly allowance of &euro;19.10 per adult and &euro;9.60 per child is paid to asylum seekers in the direct provision system to provide for personal requisites. Where there are other reasonable expenses exceptional needs payments are made by the health boards.</P>
      <P>All asylum seekers who arrived before 10 April 2000 and some who arrived since then live outside the direct provision system. In these cases they may receive the full standard rate of supplementary welfare allowance including rent supplement and diet and heating supplement, subject to the same conditions as any other recipients.</P>
      <P>Asylum seekers who applied for asylum before 26 July 1999 and who had completed 12 months in the asylum process but whose cases had not been decided are able to seek employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Refugees, that is people whose claim for asylum is successful, are entitled to assistance under the social welfare system on the same basis as Irish citizens. For example, they can seek employment but if they are unable to secure employment they will qualify for unemployment assistance if they fulfil the standard conditions of being available for, capable of and genuinely seeking work and if their means are below the qualifying limit. <Col N="340" /> Similarly they may qualify for other supports such as one-parent family payment or old age pension subject to the same conditions that apply to all other applicants for these payments.</P>
    <P>Details of social welfare recipients' immigration status are not held on my Department's computer systems. It is not possible to state how many payments are made to asylum seekers or to refugees. The Department's records show that weekly basic supplementary welfare allowance payments were made to 10,481 households in the week ending 15 November in cases where the head of household was a non-national. In addition, 6,082 rent supplements were paid to non-nationals in the same week.</P>
    <P>There are 625 claims for unemployment payments currently in payment to asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>A small number of asylum seekers and refugees are in receipt of other social welfare payments such as one-parent family payments, pensions, disability allowance and child benefit. Details of the numbers involved in these categories are not available.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that expenditure under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in 2002 on non-nationals, including asylum seekers and refugees, will be in the region of &euro;111 million.</P>

      <Quest>the reason her Department so badly under estimated the take-up of FIS payments arising from changes in budget 2002; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Family income supplement is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families and thereby preserve the incentive to remain in employment. Following the increase of &euro;34 in FIS income limits from January there are 11,975 people availing of the supplement, compared with 11,570 in December 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 2002 Estimates for FIS overstated actual spending on the scheme this year because the number of recipients and the average value of payments is lower than had been expected. It is difficult to estimate take-up with any precision as it is influenced by a number of factors such as <Col N="341" /> employment growth, earnings growth, taxation changes, the income distribution of lower earners with families and the extent to which people are aware of the scheme. The lower than expected spending in 2002 is probably the result of a combination of these factors.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to estimate accurately the take-up of FIS. The improvements made to the scheme over the years, together with measures taken to increase awareness of it, resulted in a steady increase in the level of take-up during the 1990s &ndash; peaking at 14,686 families at the end of 1999. Since then, although income limits have been increased annually to take account of improvements in the rates of other social welfare payments, the numbers in receipt of FIS have declined somewhat, probably reflecting the fact that fewer people now require the supplement. This should be viewed as a positive trend which highlights the success of a range of Government measures which have improved net take home pay for the low paid.</P>

      <P>The aim of the fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of &euro;9 per week is normally paid to eligible households. An additional &euro;3.90 per week is paid in smokeless zones, bringing the total amount in those areas to &euro;12.90 per week. In the case of a relatively small number of people living in smokeless zones only the &euro;3.90 per week smokeless fuel supplement is payable.</P>
      <P>It is not intended that the fuel allowance alone would meet a person's heating needs in full. The objective is to ensure that the combined total of the weekly primary payment and fuel allowance provides sufficient resources for people to meet their heating and other needs. To this end the emphasis over the years has been on improving the primary payment rates, such as the old age pension payment rates, rather than the fuel allowance rates. This is of more value to recipients as increases in primary payment rates are payable for the full 52 weeks of the year while increases in fuel allowances are payable for only 29 weeks of the year. It also gives recipients more flexibility in meeting their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fuel allowance schemes have been improved in recent budgets in a number of respects. The payment rate was increased from &euro;6.35 to &euro;9 per week, the means test was eased and the duration of payment was increased from 26 weeks to 29 weeks. Any further changes would <Col N="342" /> have to be considered in the context of the budget and in light of alternative proposals for delivering improvements in social welfare supports to pensioners and others.</P>

He was notified of this decision on 19 July and was advised then of his right of appeal within 21 days to the chief appeals officer if dissatisfied.</P>
      <P>In view of the length of time that has elapsed since the person was notified of the decision it is not considered appropriate to open an appeal at this stage.
