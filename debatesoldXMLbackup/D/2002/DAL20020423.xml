      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive, and No. 57 together.</P>
      <P>As is the usual practice, the agenda for the European Council meeting in Seville will not be confirmed by the Presidency in office until shortly before the meeting takes place. While the agenda for the Council meeting has not been confirmed, it is expected the issues addressed will include enlargement, an initial discussion on the Convention on the Future of Europe and consideration of measures to improve the efficiency and transparency of the European Council and the Council of Ministers. In addition, a range of current foreign and security policy issues can be expected to be on the agenda.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, at the Barcelona European Council in March, I informed my EU colleagues that the Government would seek a declaration at the upcoming Seville European Council in June that Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality is not affected by the treaties. The European Council agreed to come back to the issue in Seville. Subject to a suitable declaration being agreed by the European Council, a second referendum on the Treaty of Nice will be held here in the autumn. I have no plans at this stage to meet any EU leaders, or the President of the European Commission, in advance of the Seville meeting.</P>
      <P>The document, Ireland and the European Union: Identifying Priorities and Pursuing Goals, which has been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, sets out in clear terms the depth and breadth of Ireland's current engagement in the European Union. Following the outcome of the referendum on the Nice treaty last year, it was clear there was a need to effectively engage the public on European Union issues generally. This publication is offered as one step in the Government's efforts to better inform and engage the public on the European Union and Ireland's role in it.</P>
      <P>Membership of the European Union has been, and continues to be of enormous importance and benefit to Ireland. As this publication sets out, Ireland's overall objective in the EU, in a nutshell, is to help achieve Ireland's and the EU's aims of: Protecting the rights and interests of our citizens; maintaining freedom, security and justice; promoting prosperity, jobs and sustainable development, and acting more effectively internationally to promote peace, security and development. These are aims to which every right thinking person in Ireland can subscribe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" />The forthcoming referendum on the Treaty of Nice will pose a critical question to the Irish people. It is essential, before people make up their minds, that they are aware of the depth of our current engagement in the EU and are aware of what the European Union is, and what it is not. It is also essential that we are all aware that the answer to the question posed next autumn will have significant implications for our ability to best protect and promote the rights and interests of all the people of Ireland in the future.</P>
    <P>The publication, Ireland and the European Union: Identifying Priorities and Pursuing Goals has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. A copy has been made available to every member of the Oireachtas. It will be distributed widely in Ireland and is available on my Department's web site.</P>
    <P>A total of &euro;2 million has been allocated in my Department's Vote for the running costs of the National Forum on Europe in 2002. To date this year, the total cost of the forum has been &euro;663,140. The future expenditure of the forum will be dependent to a very considerable degree on its activities for the remainder of the year and the continuation of its mandate. A breakdown of the expenditure to date is available in a table, which I will circulate with the official report.</P>
    <P>I phoned Mr. Arafat on 29 March, during the holiday weekend, as a consequence of the sudden escalation of the problems in Israel and the Palestinian autonomous area. The deteriorating situation in the region had been a cause of concern for some weeks, but the events in progress on the day, including the latest suicide bombing, seemed to have brought the parties to the brink of open warfare. Naturally, I was also concerned for the personal well-being of Mr. Arafat and for the continuance of the Palestinian Authority. Both seemed at that time to be very much in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>In my conversation with Mr. Arafat, we discussed the events unfolding in the West Bank and specifically in his own compound. I emphasised the need for the utmost restraint on both sides and for the parties to respect the resolutions of the Security Council. I assured him of the commitment of Ireland to a peaceful resolution of the Palestinian issue and of our ongoing efforts to achieve progress both in the context of our membership of the Security Council and of the EU.</P>
    <P>The loss of life on both sides continues to mount and cannot be accepted. There is an ongoing and developing humanitarian crisis. The devastation of infrastructure in the Palestinian areas is enormous and will take years to reconstruct. The cost of the ongoing struggle in human life and general damage, largely borne by the civilian population on each side, can neither be justified nor tolerated. A reasonable and just settlement negotiated between the parties remains the only way to a secure and peaceful future for the region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a number of questions I wish to put to the Taoiseach but I will confine my first round of questions to the issue of the Seville meeting, which will take place immediately after the formation of the next Government, assuming the Taoiseach finally decides to go to the park on Thursday morning. We trust the Taoiseach will have a good guide and will know his way there.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider it useful to put into the public domain a draft of the declaration that is being contemplated, or invite people to provide suggestions for a draft so that dialogue can take place between now and 21 and 22 June among the various parties interested in, and concerned about, this issue? This could prove to be of help in light of the transitionary period in which we will find ourselves and among other matters, with a view to having a successful outcome to the second referendum on the Nice treaty some time in the autumn. That would allow the Taoiseach, or whoever goes to Seville, to tell the heads of state that there has been a debate in Ireland and that the declaration he presents is a declaration which addresses some, not all, of the concerns people have. We cannot address some of the concerns of those who are implacably opposed to the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that in the context of the statements being put forward by various national interests and in light of the outcome of the first round of the French presidential elections, it is critically important that the Government indicates what constitutional settlement it would like to see emerge from the convention? Although the document presented is a useful one, the Government's goals should be outlined in a more substantial form. That should be done, before or after the general election, in the run-up to Seville, otherwise there will be a sense, as there was in the run-up to the debate on the Nice <Col N="805" /> treaty, that people outside this country are deciding things on our behalf.</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach anticipate that Seville will recommend that meetings of the Council of Ministers, in its legislative capacity, are open to the media in the interests of transparency? Is that what the Taoiseach means by transparency? Will Seville address this issue with any degree of finality?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows from previous replies, the terms of the declaration are being worked on within the Department of Foreign Affairs with the object of making it absolutely clear that the Nice treaty, among others, in no way affects, damages or undermines our traditional position of military neutrality. The Department will also consult with the legal office of the Commission to gain assistance on that issue. I will be open to suggestion and debate about that at the appropriate time. From what I have heard, I am somewhat concerned about putting out publicly the draft convention because it is absolutely clear what will happen. If people wish to put forward views and to build them into it, I will allow that. There will have to be consultation prior to Seville anyway on the other side of the general election.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his comments regarding the paper we put forward. Some positions have also been put forward by Government representatives at the convention. At this stage, all countries are putting forward initial positions and some are putting forward several. There has been an agreement within the convention that in the months between now and September or October, when elections will take place in many countries, we will not get into any drafting. Views will certainly be expressed, people will think aloud and put forward their positions and I will not have any difficulty putting before Seville the views emanating from the Department of Foreign Affairs. In fairness, they should be considered drafts because everybody is involved in kite flying. I hear different countries putting forward views which I know are a long way from what their final positions will be and everybody is doing that to a certain extent. In so far as things of substance are being said, I do not have a difficulty with providing those papers on the substantive issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was discussion at Barcelona and there will be more discussion at Seville about how transparency and the arrangements for the Council and the administration will work. Based on Barcelona, I do not think it will be finalised in Seville. It will go on for at least another six months before a conclusion on these issues is reached. There is a strong view on the part of most countries, with which I agree, that the European Council leaves a lot to be desired in regard to its size, scale and how matters are handled. The document which is being drawn up by Mr. Solana indicates reforms and how matters can be improved. This is an interim document and I do <Col N="806" /> not think the Spanish Presidency will resolve these issues before the Seville meeting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Department of Foreign Affairs prepared a draft of the declaration on neutrality and has the draft been circulated to other European capitals? Will the Taoiseach indicate what measure of agreement to the text exists and will the text be published in advance of Seville?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a draft but it has not been circulated to other countries. However, discussions are being held with the Council's legal secretariat, which is being helpful and constructive in regard to the draft. Before Seville I would welcome discussions with the legal secretariat on the political system in this country so that most of us can agree on the text.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Taoiseach lump in questions on the Middle East with questions on Europe? Is the Middle East not a serious enough issue to merit separate attention? I note from his reply that he rang Chairman Arafat. Why was there no call to Prime Minister Sharon urging him to call off his troops and tanks in the West Bank and Gaza? Why is no lead being given at EU level by Ireland where representatives of the European Union have been treated with utter contempt by the Israeli Government? Will the Taoiseach accept that what has been coming from the Irish Government in the face of death and destruction as a result of the Israeli invasion has been a &ldquo;softly softly&rdquo; approach and that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been a total wimp on the issue? Will he agree that tough action is needed on the part of Ireland bilaterally and within the European Union, if necessary focusing on trade sanctions, until such time as there is some indication from the Israeli Government and Prime Minister Sharon of an intention to accept UN resolutions in regard to, first, its aggression, and, second, its settlement policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first question, international questions and questions on Europe are taken together during Taoiseach's Question Time. They are treated differently when they are questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. That has always been the practice.</P>
      <P>On the question of Chairman Arafat, their own contacts and officials in Dublin asked me on the day after the hotel bombing, which led to the Israeli assault, to ring him on the line that was available for a few hours that day. With some effort and difficulty we finally got through on that line. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has continued to talk to Foreign Minister Peres. We have spoken on numerous occasions with both Palestinian and Israeli officials here. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has been engaged in all meetings at EU level. There have been a number of special meetings, including ordinary General Affairs Council meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" />In regard to the EU position, the General Affairs Council, on 15 April, considered the situation in the Middle East. There was no consensus on possible measures against Israel and it was felt that a meeting of the association council might not be productive. That is the answer to the Deputy's question. It would have been nice were it otherwise but it is not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was not a joint position; there was agreement on the need to maintain support for the Powell mission and US engagement generally. It was also considered important that the role of the quartet be maintained. There was general support for the idea of an international conference as outlined by Mr. Powell and we strongly supported that. The importance of expressing support for the Saudi initiative, which we have supported all the way at European level, was also accepted.</P>
      <P>EU foreign ministers are, today in Valencia, meeting their counterparts in the Mediterranean partner countries to discuss a wide range of issues, including, security issues which in practice will focus on the Middle East. The Spanish Presidency is holding bilateral meetings with the Israeli and Palestinian representatives today. Syria and Lebanon have decided to boycott the meetings in protest at Israel's presence. This means the signatory association agreements with Lebanon will not now take place for some months. The EU special envoy to the Middle East, Miguel Maritanos will continue, through his contacts in the region, to liaise with the US, Russia, the UN and the quartet group and that will continue into the future.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe will be aware that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, at a meeting on 12 April, passed a resolution calling on the EU to impose sanctions on the Middle East.</P>

      <P>In response to my proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. We are pursuing that idea but the UK is opposed to the imposition of any sanctions, a position supported by Germany and the Netherlands. France and Italy are hesitant about imposing sanctions. The Presidency also has major reservations. A paper, setting out options for action under the Association Agreement, has been prepared by Commissioner Patten's office. Mr. Solana, the UN representative for Common Affairs and Security Policies opposed reference to sanctions on the grounds that it would undermine EU-quartet co-operation with the Americans, a reason widely cited. The case against the imposition of sanctions is that the unity of quartet, as expressed at Madrid meetings, would be preserved; the emphasis should be on the follow-up to the Powell mission and there <Col N="808" /> would be a complete breach of Israel with negative consequences for the EU in any resumed peace process.</P>
      <P>The United Nations Commission on Human Rights currently holding its annual session in Geneva passed a resolution on 5 April requesting the High Commissioner, Mary Robinson, to undertake a mission to the territories. The High Commissioner subsequently asked the former Spanish Prime Minister, Felipe Gonzalez and the South African politician Sir Ramaphosa to accompany her on that mission. The Israeli Government and Palestinian Authority were asked by the High Commissioner's office, to facilitate her visit. The Palestinians welcomed the idea but the Israeli Government said it would require time to consider the request. Last Friday, the High Commissioner announced she was cancelling her visit due to refusal by the Israeli Government to co-operate with her request. The High Commissioner will now prepare a report on the situation in the occupied territories based on other available data from people in the region. That report is to be presented to the Commission by the end of this week.</P>
      <P>The Israeli Government denies that it failed to co-operate and says it required more time to consider the High Commissioner's request. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has objected formally and in statements which he made last week, he called for direct contact to be made with the officials involved. Other difficulties have also arisen of which I am sure the Deputy is aware. The Israeli leadership has accused other international individuals for their efforts in this regard.</P>
      <P>The new UN investigation team announced in recent days is to be led by the former President of Austria, Martti Ahtisaari. Assistant Deputy Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, Mr. Peter Fitzgerald, has been asked by the United Nations to serve on that committee which means we will have an Irish presence in the group. Mr. Fitzgerald hopes to be in a position to take up his new role in a short period.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the UN position. We have been involved in continuing United Nations discussions on the Middle East problem as one of the 15 members of the Security Council. On the day I spoke to President Arafat and that the Minister, Deputy Cowen, spoke to Shimon Peres, Resolution 1402 was drafted and passed that night. This and Resolution 1403 call for the implementation of the ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Palestinian cities. We remain actively engaged in the continuing discussions in the United Nations, which are going on every day on the Middle East issue. That engagement is not only through a number of significant statements by our ambassador to the United Nations, but through the less conspicuous work of Irish representatives in building links, facilitating contacts and developing positions which are generally appreciated both by the parties in the conflict and by other states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm &ndash; if I understood him correctly &ndash; that the Government's position within the General Affairs Council is to support sanctions against Israel? Presumably those sanctions would take the form of trade sanctions, denying or restricting or in some way reducing Israel's access to the internal market of the European Union. Is it correct that the major nation state within the European Union that was opposed to such a form of sanctions was the United Kingdom? If so, will he outline the arguments advanced by the UK authorities as to why it was opposed to sanctions?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the attitude in this country towards the Middle East conflict is changing? Previously there was considerable support for the isolated position of Israel as a state and the fact that it was surrounded by Arab states which denied it its right to exist. Recently that attitude has shifted considerably and there is now a perception, however misconceived, that a state power with all the apparatus of military hardware and equipment, under the &ldquo;generalship&rdquo; as distinct from the &ldquo;prime ministership&rdquo; of Ariel Sharon, is mercilessly crushing a neighbouring people who do not have a parallel state infrastructure. It is not a contest of equals and great injustices are being done.</P>
      <P>War crimes may have taken place in Jenin. This will become clear if and when the international media get a chance to examine that and see it. If one accepts that and if the Irish Government's position is to the effect that it supports sanctions of some measure against Israel, has the Department of Foreign Affairs sought to call in the Israeli ambassador, Ambassador Sofer, and convey in clear terms the concerns of the Irish people, as expressed both popularly and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the General Affairs Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised two issues. On the issue of sanctions, there has been an amount of discussion about this but, frankly, there is not much support. Our position, as always on these issues, is that we would go with an EU position but we thought some action should have been taken. In reply to Deputy O'Keeffe, I stated the scale of that opposition. The interesting question is why so many countries from the UK to Germany, the Netherlands, France, Italy and the Presidency held divergent positions. It is not as if anybody was pushing. They were trying to get to a position that would have led to a joint position but, obviously, there was no hope of achieving it. It was not a case that we or others were against it. We thought there should have been some action. The reason given was threefold. The unity of the quartet that had been working on this, as expressed at the Madrid meeting, should be preserved. That quartet involved an unusual group of internationals, including Russians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is that the emphasis should be on the follow-up to the Powell mission and the imposition of sanctions would be a major distraction. The argument I read through in the full UN <Col N="810" /> and EU brief on this issue the other day for my own information appeared to be that having got Secretary of State Powell involved, having the Americans and their permanent representative back on the ground and the new Administration having been fully engaged in it for the first time, the view of people was that the most important thing was to keep that in place.</P>
    <P>From reading all the relevant documents, presentations and cases put, it is clear that European member states, while acknowledging they have their own role and position, do not feel they can exert the necessary pressure to achieve progress and deal with the humanitarian issues, in the absence of American pressure on the Israelis. I suppose we can all understand that. We all realise this not as easy to achieve as it seemed in the past. Colin Powell, who I believe, and I am sure most people would agree with me, is a formidable diplomatic person, has not yet been able to achieve that type of progress, but there is talk that he will go back to the region and that would be welcome.</P>
    <P>The third reason is that a complete breach with Israel would have negative consequences for the EU in any resumed peace process. A major position of the Presidency and others is that somewhere along the way &ndash; the sooner the better as this crisis has drifted on and has been really bad for four weeks &ndash; we would get to a stage where the peace process and talking would be resumed and that the EU would be able to play a major role in that. I am not sure if Deputy Quinn would accept that those are great reasons, but they were the ones put.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's second question, I have no doubt he is right. People's views have changed. I am old enough to remember the 1967 war and I took an interest in it even though I was at school at the time. I also remember the 1973 war and Irish views about it and people's views are a long way from those. There is no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>There have been reports of the Jenin refugee camp on the West Bank which has been the scene of the most intense Israeli military activity over the past number of weeks. The situation there remains unclear. It is widely believed there were significant civilian casualties during Israeli operations at the camp. UN reports of the number dead range from 50 to several hundred. The position is still not clear. According to Israeli sources, their troops entered Jenin to track down Palestinian fighters and potential suicide bombers. As many of the narrow roads in the camp were mined by the Palestinian and Israeli forces, they progressed by literally moving through houses using bulldozers and tanks. As independent observers had no access to the camp while operations were in progress, it has not been possible to confirm allegations of serious human rights violations. On the day I spoke to President Arafat and since then when I met Palestinian leaders in Ireland, they gave me reports of what they had heard from their people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="811" />Ireland made a confidential <i>démarche</i> to the Israeli authorities requesting that humanitarian assistance should be given to the camp as far back as 11 April. On 19 April, the UN Security Council endorsed the idea of an investigation into the events in Jenin by the Secretary General &ndash; Resolution 1405. The UN requested the participation of Commissioner Peter Fitzgerald in that group.</P>
    <P>The UN fact-finding mission was named yesterday and is expected in the region later this week. That team will be made up of Martti Ahtisaari, the former Finnish President, and includes a former UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the former president of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Prime Minister Sharon indicated that Mary Robinson would not be acceptable in this role. On 21 April he reported that he was considering declaring the UN special envoy for the Middle East process, Mr. Larson, <i>persona non grata </i>due to his remarks after leaving Jenin. Mr. Larson described the scene in the camp as horrific beyond belief and was strongly critical of Israel's refusal to admit humanitarian agencies and assistance. Prime Minister Sharon has also barred Israeli officials from having any contacts with Mr. Larson. This just happened in the past 24 hours. Any move against the envoy would be badly received by the international community, especially given Mr. Larson's central role in the Oslo accord.</P>
    <P>I should mention for the record that the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, announced a few days ago that there would be a strengthening of the programme of assistance to the Palestinians which covers immediate emergency humanitarian needs and recovery aid. The new assistance will bring the amount allocated to Palestine to more than &euro;5 million this year. The Minister of State also announced an immediate addition of &euro;1 million to be channelled through those agencies which are capable of delivering resources rapidly and effectively.</P>
    <P>The House will remember that it is only a few years since I represented the Irish people in meeting President Arafat and stayed in the area where he is now. At that time I was the first foreign leader to land at the airport and to see the educational facilities which had just opened. I participated in the opening of some of the local government offices there. President Arafat told me that every one of those facilities, including the runways, have been absolutely destroyed. He gave me the entire list, which I cannot now recall. The entire infrastructure&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, as is his wont, has meandered along for the last ten or 15 minutes reading from his files. I ask him to focus on one issue: what role has Ireland taken since the invasion of the occupied territories by Israel? What lead has Ireland given in the EU by way of protesting at what has occurred and by trying to bring home to the Israeli Government that what it is doing is utterly inhumane and unacceptable? What have we seen at European level, helped by the Irish contribution, but a wringing of hands which was ignored by the Israelis? Requests for discussions have been brushed off contemptuously. What lead has Ireland taken in relation to the hundreds that have been killed and the thousands who have been maimed? Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage has been done by the Israeli aggression. What have we done when an Irish citizen and former President has had her request as UN High Commissioner for Refugees to visit the region contemptuously rejected? The same has happened to any independent person who wants to see the place &ndash; they have been kept out because Israel does not want an independent view.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not accept that Ireland, as a small country, should have been prepared to stand up in some way for the Palestinians and not just hang around in the pack, wringing our hands and effectively doing nothing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perhaps another issue but I take offence at what Deputy O'Keeffe said. Perhaps he did not hear anything I said. This country has continued to take a lead role within the United Nations which is much appreciated by Palestinians both here and in the front line. They are well aware of our close co-operation and resolution. It is not a question of participating in photo-calls or running around with resolutions for the sake of it; it is about getting things through. Ireland has played an enormous role in Resolutions Nos. 1397, 1402 and 1403. We played a lead part in those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already stated our position regarding our former President, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. We have worked closely with her and with Martti Ahtisaari on that issue. We now have a very senior Irish person, Thomas Peter Fitzgerald, who is well known in the UN, taking the lead in this position. In all the UN meetings the Minister for Foreign Affairs has taken a strong position. Deputy O'Keeffe will understand that Ireland will not solve the Israeli aggression and we should not try to trivialise these matters. This requires pressure on one side in the United States, which I worked on before St. Patrick's Day, when I put our voice towards getting the President to engage again rather than standing back, which was the position he had held. We have continued to do so with the Americans and to work with our EU colleagues and <Col N="813" /> the quartet so we can maintain pressure on the Israelis. Deputy Cowen spoke to the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr. Peres, who has spoken to this Administration. All of these issues have been put forward and we will continue to put them forward. Every day our UN ambassador is playing an excellent public role, but Irish representatives are also working less conspicuously on building links, facilitating contact and developing positions and will continue to do so. This is a significant contribution which we can make. Deputy O'Keeffe is correct to state that, as a small country, we can do something and we are doing it well.</P>

However, in all its public pronouncements, the Government insists on describing the Middle East holocaust as if both sides were equally to blame. It is clear that the most horrific atrocities have been carried out by the Israeli army in, among other places, the Jenin refugee camp. Helicopter gun ships are raining death on civilians from the sky and Palestinian homes are being bulldozed.</P>
      <P>Anyone who has been in the camps knows how densely populated they are and this residential community has been pulverised by a pitiless attack with overwhelming military power on the side of the Israelis against fighters who only have small guns. A ring of steel has been placed around the camp for a week with the result that people bled to death in the streets and in their homes.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin West</i>)<b>: </b>Why does the Government confine itself to mild rumblings of disapproval in the face of these criminal activities? If, following the Bloody Friday atrocities in Belfast in the 1970s, the British Army, suspecting that some IRA bombers came from a Catholic, working class ghetto in Belfast, did to it what the Israelis did to Jenin, would the Irish Government be satisfied with mild rumblings of discontent from the international community? Did the Taoiseach approach the American Government, for example, on its toleration of Israeli atrocities carried out with US weapons and US aid? If Saddam Hussein's dictatorship did to Kuwait what was done to Jenin, would the B-52 bombers not already be on their way?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach call the nauseating hypocrisy of the US Administration towards the Middle East situation by its real name? Will he agree that his arrival in Washington and his public declaration of support for Mr. Bush's war on terror was ill-judged, to say the least, when Prime Minister Sharon takes his lead from that same war to carry out criminal acts against a virtually defenceless people?</P>

When I spoke to President Arafat I made that point to him and he accepts that. These actions by Hamas and others who, in the name of their people, are creating problems have made life difficult for him for several years now. That is why the Israelis can get away with going in and bulldozing people. However, nobody in his right mind would defend what happened in Jenin when they bulldozed through people and their houses.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Quinn, I had the pleasure and honour to meet President Arafat on a number of occasions. I have discussed Hamas and other groups with him. It is unfair to blame him. Right through the Camp David process and the Oslo accord, he has taken a courageous position to try to move the situation forward. I raised the issue of the suicide bombs and the difficulty countries like Ireland had, to help him in that situation. He is in a difficult position.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that he does not support any of those actions but his difficulty is that after speaking out against them he will probably be marginalised within his own community. When he was here in late October and early November he spoke in strong terms to the media about his abhorrence of tactics such as these. His view was that if he was allowed some room to manoeuvre he would be able to do much more and he has tried to do this on a number of occasions. He has been undermined by such things as the Iran arms issue, which has not been proven, and as a result the USA and other countries have lost confidence in him.</P>
      <P>In my discussion with him he revealed that he is completely marginalised and has not been able to move or go to the Arab League conference. Contact with him has been minimal. His difficulty is that if he were to speak out strongly now, with so many of his people under threat, he would put himself in a weaker position. The Saudi resolution, Martti Ahtisaari's intervention and Mr. Arafat's meeting with Colin Powell may all be of use. Although many delegations have gone to see him he is not in a position to talk to them and this has undermined his position considerably. This is not helpful to anybody. I have heard from people representing the UN and the EU, from Mr. Arafat himself and from the discussions between the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and Mr. Peres, that there is no other person on the Palestinian side who could take over his role. He is being undermined and that is the kernel of the problem.</P>

    <P>Apart from this, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment must also be notified and take decisions on mergers. In practice she consults the Competition Authority. There is an exemption for banking business at present, but most large banks engage in a wide range of other activities, such as insurance, and a merger may be referred to the Competition Authority on such grounds. This exemption will shortly be removed under the recently passed Competition Act. The Minister for Finance must approve mergers which involve more than 20% of banking assets in the State, so a merger between Bank of Ireland and <Col N="818" /> Allied Irish Banks would have to be judged by the Minister on the basis of his view of the common good. It is not legally clear if a Minister could block a merger on competition grounds if it had been approved by the commission.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe was in the House when I set up a strategic review of banking, under which this question was examined. Officials from my Department and the Central Bank who carried out the review were generally sceptical of the advantages of a public policy promoting or facilitating the emergence of a single <Col N="819" /> dominant domestic bank. It is legally required that certain procedures are undertaken. I would be failing in my duties as Minister for Finance if I did not approach the matter with an open mind. It is good that Mr. Soden has raised the possibility of a merger in the public domain. Many issues need to be considered, including the competition implications of such a move. I have said on many occasions that agreement to a merger depends on the circumstances of the time. While the relevant Minister will have to take account of the issues, he is merely a part of a wider process.</P>

The Fine Gael Party is totally opposed to such a merger. Public interest demands that the Minister for Finance should make his position clear. Does the Minister agree that the dominant position of a bank that would emerge from such a merger would leave us, in effect, without competition in the banking sector? One such major bank would be prone to a take-over, with much worse consequences for the consumer than the take-over of one of two competing banks. Does the Minister agree that every town in Ireland would lose bank branches and many thousands of jobs would be lost? Is it not incumbent on the Minister, in the dying days of his reign as Minister for Finance, to make clear his position?</P>

      <P>In the course of preparation of the health strategy, I had detailed discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children and subsequently provided additional funding totalling &euro;249 million for implementing certain priority aspects of the strategy in the 2002 budget. Other resources within the overall health allocation of &euro;8.2 billion in 2002 are devoted to services consistent with the strategy's objectives. The Government is committed to the implementation of the health strategy, which is an ambitious and comprehensive document designed to develop and reform the health services so as to better meet the health needs of society over the years ahead. The pace of implementation will depend on the availability of resources in the future. Thus, the ongoing funding of the health strategy will be determined annually in the context of the preparation of the Estimates and budget. I assure Deputies that I will seek to achieve value for money from whatever future resources are allocated to the health area, and that no borrowing will be incurred on account of health expenditure, even for capital purposes, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the associated revenue implications are sustainable in the long-term.</P>

      <P>I remind the Minister of his comments last November, on the day that the Estimates for the current year were announced by his Department, when he said the health strategy did not amount to much but was a roll-up of existing policies. Does that not summarise his view of the strategy, and does not what he said over the past six months bear out the contention that he has no intention of providing the additional resources that are central to the implementation of the ten year strategy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts do not bear that out. In 2002, we are providing an additional &euro;249 million to implement priority aspects of the strategy. Other facts are that since 1997, health spending has more than doubled; that there were 67,895 people employed in health in 1997 and there will be 93,850 people employed there at the end of this year, which is an increase of 38%; that as a percentage of total Government spending, spending on health has risen from 21% to 26%, and that 55% of income tax in 1997 was spent on health and that at the end of 2001, it was 76%, while at the end of this year, 80% of all income tax will go to fund health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can give chapter and verse on my commitment to health during my time in office. We have now reached over and above the EU level of spending. We have a younger population than the rest of the EU without the same dependency ratios. It is as well that we had such economic <Col N="821" /> success in recent years which has provided the extra resources for health because without that the health situation would be dire. If we had the same strategy as when the Deputy's leader was Minister for Finance, that is, to give no money to health, the situation would be chronic now.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply was interesting but had nothing to do with the question. The health strategy was published 12 weeks ago and is prospective, looking to the next ten years, which is what my question was about. An example is that the strategy promises 3,000 additional acute beds to replace the beds taken out of the system in the late 1980s, but Department of Finance sanction is required now in order to have those beds available in three years time. No such sanction was given and the Minister has no intention of giving it.</P>

      <P>It is a ten year strategy which, like the national development plan, will evolve. Everything, including spending on health, education and social welfare, is conditional on the availability of resources. If the Deputy's proposals for the election, are to minimise economic activity, no one will have the resources for any area because resources come from increased economic activity resulting in greater Exchequer revenues which can be spent on health and other policies. Without economic activity, we will not have that, and over the past five years this Government has been able to provide vast resources to the health area because of the economic activity. If we have the same economic policy over the next five years, much extra resources for health and other areas is guaranteed, which is the message we will send to the people soon.</P>

Some &euro;8.2 billion has been put forward for 2002, which will probably increase as every year we have Supplementary Estimates. It is a considerable amount and most of the plans are rolling forward. In the history of the State, no Government has committed as much to health.

      <Quest>if he has initiated a study or research into the reason there is not apparent buoyancy of revenue arising from the 22% growth in current expenditure in 2001 and the 20.6% additional increase in January-March 2002; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <P>Current expenditure increased by 16.4% in 2001 and by 20.6% in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period in 2001. These increases in public expenditure contributed to overall economic activity and therefore to tax revenues. This is because, for example, additional public expenditure can lead to increased numbers of public service workers and the additional amounts of income tax or indirect tax collected as a result would accrue to the Exchequer. Tax receipts in 2001 were 3.2% above the 2000 outturn and tax receipts in the first quarter of 2002 were 2.8% lower than in the same period in 2001. These figures include the positive <Col N="823" /> impact of additional public expenditure on tax revenues in those periods.</P>
      <P>However, revenue yield is a function <i>inter alia</i> of developments across the economy as a whole. Any assessment of revenue performance, therefore, requires to be made by reference to the broad sweep of economic developments. It is not possible to meaningfully disaggregate the impact of additional public expenditure on tax revenues from all the other factors, domestic and external, which have been contributing to ongoing economic and revenue performance. Accordingly, I have not initiated any specific study or research of the particular nature referred to by the Deputy. My Department monitors economic and revenue trends, and the methodology used to forecast them, on an ongoing basis in the context of the broad range of domestic and international economic developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that there is a normal relationship between increased expenditure and buoyancy of revenue? As Minister for Finance for many budgets, I always discussed this issue with departmental officials and we could have expected at least 33% buoyancy from expenditure. If that is the case, a 22% increase in current expenditure should yield between 7% and 8% growth in income, but, as the Minister admitted, it only went up by 3.2% last year. When we take the first three months of this year, the figures are worse because revenue is down by 2.8% despite expenditure increasing by 20.6% when the central fund is taken into account. Is it a worry that another big, black hole has been created in the economy? Is it also a worry that money the Government is spending is going straight out of the economy on holidays and new properties in Spain, Portugal and France? Will the Minister admit this is a possibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question the Deputy asked refers to the effect of increased Government spending in particular areas and I replied that it is not possible to disaggregate its impact from the general economic mix in terms of what is happening in the economy generally. The amount of extra money invested in the economy by the Exchequer through lower taxes or increased public expenditure has an effect on spending patterns which, for example, should lead to increased excise and other indirect taxes such as VAT. However, that must be borne in mind in terms of what is happening in the economy generally in terms of unemployment and export patterns. The Deputy asked whether we initiated a study to identify that particular item and the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Economic activity was very high from the beginning to the middle of 2001 but for the latter six months of the year it was very flat. The oomph going into 2002 was very small. All commentators are predicting that activity will curve upwards and the second half of 2002 will be very good. In <Col N="824" /> recent years the amount going into the economy through increased Government expenditure and lower taxes has been considerable and that had to have had a beneficial effect on economic activity, but the extent of the public expenditure element in this is impossible to quantify. The Deputy raised questions which perhaps academics can debate and research more thoroughly in years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>These questions are more than academic. It is almost certain that the Government's economic policies are in total disarray and, in the absence of buoyancy, there is evidence that money is pouring out of the country without having a beneficial effect within the country. Does the Minister acknowledge, if one takes any year over the past ten years, there was a correlation between expenditure and buoyancy of revenue, which was absent in 2001 and even more so in the first quarter of this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is trying to marry the effect of increased taxation <i>vis-à-vis</i> increasing expenditure by the Government in other areas and establish what has been the trade off. The figures for 2001 were down on the estimated figures at the start of the year, but that was on account of the slow down in economic activity. It is an open question as to the effect of the extra money in the economy and whether one can relate to that to, for example, Government revenue in terms of income tax, excise duties, etc. There has certainly been a trade off between that and indirect taxation but the extent of it is very hard to quantify.</P>
      <P>In an open economy such as Ireland's, people use their additional moneys to do all sorts of things. The evidence of the 1970s and 1980s suggests that such money was used to import foreign goods and that had an effect on a variety of areas and on the currency but now that Ireland is part of the single currency, we do not have to worry about that.</P>

      <QRef>[12503/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Mr. McCreevy: I am satisfied with the rate of implementation of the national development plan. Good progress has been made in implementing the NDP infrastructure programme with financial outturns well on target and significant physical output being recorded. Progress is also satisfactory in the area of human resource development. Progress is behind profile in areas of productive sector investment due to lower than expected demand and in certain other areas where programme roll out has been delayed by factors such as awaiting state aids approval from the EU and the impact of the foot and mouth crisis. With regard to the key area of infrastructure, NDP investment is mostly provided for in the economic and social infrastructure operational programme &ndash; ESIOP &ndash; of the plan.</P>
    <P>Over the first three years of the plan, total investment under the ESIOP will amount to &euro;10.2 billion, &euro;140 million more than originally planned. More significantly, the Exchequer and EU contribution will amount to &euro;8.5 billion, which is &euro;740 million more than originally planned. This more than offset some shortfalls in projected non-Exchequer sources of funding including CIE's own resource funding of NDP public transport investment and local authority funding of water services investment.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the NDP is fundamental to maintaining national competitiveness. The Government's commitment to the plan is evidenced by the fact that the Exchequer allocation for NDP infrastructure investment over the first three years of the plan was well in excess of the original projection. I assure the Deputy that implementation of the plan will remain a top priority of Government policy.</P>

Four, if not six, essential road plans, some of which are bypasses, were put on hold by him this year and all he has done is provide funds to ensure money that is contractually committed is spent while planning that had been undertaken meticulously over the past 18 months on roads into Enniscorthy, Carrickmacross and the bypasses of Monasterevan and Ennis has been put on hold because money was stopped at the last moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the problems involved do not relate to money. Planning is one of the biggest areas of contention and is slowing down many of these projects. Planning is litigious and one must go through extraordinary inquiries to balance individual rights against the national interest. On the specific question, the amount that was programmed to be spent from Exchequer funds is over and above what had been planned. More than &euro;740 million extra will be spent by the Exchequer by the end of the year than had been planned when we set our targets. Everything in the NDP is predicated on the availability of resources. Not all projects can be undertaken today but the plan is flexible enough to be rolled out over a period of time and everything will be achieved when it is concluded. Everything cannot be done today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem in this area is the stop-go nature of implementation. I accept for many years there was a problem with planning in terms of roads and the process is lengthy, tortuous and sometimes takes longer than it should, but the NRA has got its act together partly because of additional staff sanctioned by the Minister's Department and partly because it was given the green light for the projects it had to deliver. However, when everything was in place the funds suddenly dried up and projects for which tenders had almost been accepted were put on hold again. They are not being delivered on the ground, irrespective of whether money is being spent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Extraordinary panicky comments have been made by people in this area. At the start of the plan the Construction Industry Federation pleaded with the Government to slow things down because its members could not do all the work and they did not want foreign competitors to come in to do the work, yet they could not get around to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only point on which I agree is that we were not receiving proper value for money. This is because inflation in the construction industry was of the order of 15% to 20%. This meant we were receiving less of a return on the money we were spending. It was amusing then to hear the feder<Col N="827" /> ation say the opposite at the beginning of this year and that we should roll out more money.</P>
    <P>I did not design the national development plan for the benefit of the construction industry. This may come as a surprise to some members of the Construction Industry Federation. The plan exists for the benefit of the people and its roll-out has been progressive. Extraordinary amounts of money are being spent in the most effective way possible to obtain the best value for money over the time. The Deputy mentioned some of the contracts which will proceed soon. As Minister for Finance, I sanctioned additional resources and staffing for the National Roads Authority to speed up its plans. All this was done with the aim of delivering on the commitments in the national development plan over its period. I will not take action which will give less value for money. No Government can say that all these matters will be done today, no matter what pressure is exerted by individual constituencies throughout the country, pressure to which we have all been subjected. The plan is to be rolled out up to 2006 and it will be fulfilled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The main costs associated with the DIRT inquiry were borne by the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. The extensive investigation undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General into the administration of deposit interest retention tax and related matters for the years 1986 to 1998 cost &euro;1.39 million or £1.096 million. I have been informed by the Houses of the Oireachtas that costs borne by it relating to the work of the sub-committee came to &euro;1.67 million or £1.314 million. The total direct cost of the DIRT inquiry was a little more than &euro;3 million.</P>
      <P>In the Finance Act, 1999, powers were introduced to enable the Revenue Commissioners to conduct on-site audits of the DIRT returns of banks and building societies, with full powers to investigate the bona fides of accounts claimed to be in the beneficial ownership of non-resident persons. Using these powers, Revenue commenced a programme of DIRT look-back audits in April 1999 and these yielded a total of &euro;219 million or £173 million in tax, interest and penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These look-back audits of financial institutions <Col N="828" /> were not focused on the underlying tax liabilities of the depositors themselves and, as a follow-up operation, Revenue began the investigation of the tax compliance position of the depositors in accordance with a statement of practice issued in May 2001. The voluntary disclosure phase of this investigation ended on 15 November last and yielded tax, interest and penalties of &euro;227 million or £179 million in total. The investigation phase of the operation is continuing into persons who did not make voluntary disclosures, and the yield from it will not be known for some time. The total yield to date is &euro;446 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The question has been edited from that originally tabled. The Minister has gone on record as praising the DIRT inquiry and its members for their expeditious achievement. Why then did he see fit at a private function marking the retirement of the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners to criticise the members of the inquiry in a manner which was the reverse of what he had said in public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not criticise members of the DIRT inquiry at the function referred to, which was public in the sense that 400 to 500 people must have been present, including the Deputy and the Garda Commissioner. A wide cross-section of the public service was present. I have often praised the DIRT inquiry and the results it achieved and have no hesitation in doing so again. The inquiry was conducted expeditiously and achieved good value for money as evidenced by its cost compared with the cost of other inquiries. I am in favour of TDs scrutinising legislation and making inquiries.</P>
      <P>However, I am not in favour of committees conducting their business in a certain manner. I thought some of the questioning and the procedures and processes relating to the treatment of current and former public officials were not correct. It is well known that I am of this view regarding inquiries. People's good reputation is important and that was borne out by a recent decision of the High Court relating to the Abbeylara inquiry.</P>
      <P>When I was in Opposition many years ago, the Deputy and I served on a sub-committee which led to the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997, many years later. Even then I was of the view that the Houses of the Oireachtas should not be turned into a court. While I have been critical of the courts, I do not want a system where people are dragged before the Houses. Some of the procedures and processes for dealing with public servants during the DIRT inquiry were not the correct ones and, as a result, the public service felt at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> its political masters. These are my views and I do not have any difficulty giving vent to them again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree <Col N="829" /> that he gave the impression at the function concerned, at which I was present, during a speech which was not scripted for public consumption, that somehow there was oppressive questioning during the DIRT inquiry when in fact the members of the inquiry were well trained by legal advisers that there should not be any such questioning and when we went to great pains to ensure that there was not? What precisely was the Minister at? The Committee of Public Accounts is well trained in asking the hard questions of senior public servants and doing so in an effective and courteous manner. Was he implying otherwise?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is room for improvement in the processes for dealing with civil servants. This relates not only to this inquiry, but others as well.</P>
      <P>As regards the speech not being scripted, as Deputy McDowell will often testify, some of my best comments have been unscripted. The Deputy looks forward to them all the time. At committee meetings he wants me to read the official note and then to hear what I have to say myself. Is this not what Members want me to do? That way they can make great speeches about what I have said. What else would they do if I did not do that?</P>

      <Quest>the progress made to date by the public service benchmarking body; the people who have resigned from the body; if they have been replaced; when he expects the body will begin to report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply of 19 February 2002 concerning the progress of the public service benchmarking body. The body was established in July 2000 and was asked to report by 30 June 2002. It was agreed by the parties that there would be four phases: phase 1 &ndash; written submission by the parties; phase 2 &ndash; research by the body itself; phase 3 &ndash; oral hearings and any further written submissions based on the research; and phase 4 &ndash; finalisation of the report by the body.</P>
      <P>Written submissions were made by the parties to the body and it has carried out its research of the public service grades being examined and in the private sector. Oral hearings for each group where both sides had the opportunity to put arguments in support of their case were completed in December 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The body is in the final stage and is deliberating on the issues and drafting its report with a view to finalising it by the end of June 2002. There will be one report at the end of the process. <Col N="830" /> This was agreed by both the unions and the employers and is contained in the body's terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Regarding resignations from the body, the Deputy is undoubtedly aware that one member, Mr. Jim O'Leary, tendered his resignation to the chairman of body on 10 April 2002. He was finding it difficult to commit the required amount of time to the work of the body with consequent difficulties for making a meaningful input to its decisions. It is not intended to replace Mr. O'Leary because the body is due to report at the end of June, and in the time available a new appointee would find it difficult to assimilate the extensive data and material generated to date by the body while at the same time contributing effectively to the final stages of the body's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled the question following the resignation of Jim O'Leary from the body. Does the Minister agree that his resignation has caused some concern that the body will confine itself to one element of its brief, namely, what people perceive as the ATM aspect? Does he agree that, if this were to happen, it would be a source of concern and that we would all be anxious to ensure that other issues, such as the process of determining public service pay relativities and performance management, are addressed within the context of the body's brief? Has the Minister spoken to Mr. O'Leary about the reasons for his resignation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have not had the pleasure of speaking to Mr. O'Leary since his resignation from the body on 10 April. He now lectures at a university in my county.</P>
      <P>The benchmarking body was constructed so that the people on it were widely accepted as fair-minded, objective and analytical. Its members are acceptable to both employers and the unions. Mr. O'Leary has brought many qualities to it. I am not privy to the workings of the benchmarking body and have not made any effort, nor should I do so, to find out what is going on, either directly or indirectly. I have not met Mr. O'Leary since he resigned but I am sure I will do so. I met him at some functions during the past year but we did not broach the subject in depth. It is the job of the body to do so and it will produce its report in due course.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Senator Joe O'Toole, is given to the occasional flourish, which marks him out as someone who should be kept in either House of the Oireachtas. That gives some indication of how I will vote in the Seanad elections for NUI graduates. The benchmarking body is independent and will make its report by the end of June. It has a heavy workload and I hope it is able to achieve its aim in the timescale allocated to it, which ends on 30 June.</P>

The same is true of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.

      <P>Is anybody here suggesting that in the next five years we will be exponentially increasing health spending at the level of recent years? Surely we will get some return on the money and capital we have spent. Surely we will get a return on the extra 38% of employees in the health service in 2002 compared to 1997.</P>
      <P>There are now some 90,000 people employed in the health service as opposed 60,000 some years ago. Surely there will be some return on that. They are already in the public service doing their jobs so the cost has been built in. The percentage increase above that will not be the same because it is already there. On behalf of the taxpayers of the country I am entitled to start expecting a good return in the health service. Perhaps Deputy Jim Mitchell can give some idea of the current state of the health service given his recent difficulties. I can see that there is nothing wrong with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had too much call to use the health service in the past three years and I can testify that if one can access it, it is very good. The Minister has doubled expenditure on the health service in real terms, yet we are not getting a return on our money. It could be doubled again and we would not be any further down the road. The real issue is value for money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDowell is correct that the Government gave the impression at the health strategy launch that another £10 billion will be spent on the health service in the next few years. That made the headlines the next day. Will the Minister inform us what extra provision is planned in each of the next five years for the health service <Col N="833" /> and what steps will be taken to get value for money results?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The health strategy consists of 121 separate actions which it is proposed to implement up to 2010 at a great cost over that period. I stated what has been done to date and, as I pointed out in the recent article in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i>, when one gets the benefit of treatment in the health services, it is of a very high standard.</P>
      <P>There has been an 80% increase in acute hospital activity since 1997 and day cases have increased by almost 50% in the same period, which points to a great increase in productivity. There is extra money, extra people and extra procedures are being carried out. The difficulties I perceive, with which I think the Deputies will concur, is that for the amount of money invested in a relatively short time &ndash; an increase of 125% &ndash; there is a corresponding increase in dissatisfaction with the health service. How did it go from being not higher than No. 8 in 1997 to top of the agenda in 2001 to 2002, despite a doubling of the budget? That is an obvious question to pose. In view of the amount of money spent in recent years I believe we will begin to see a benefit from it. We are now above the European average and our dependency ratio is lower than the rest of Europe so we should not have to spend as much as other European countries.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that there is a pattern here? It is very clear that we are not getting value for money in the health service, but that replicates what is happening in the national development plan. Only 33 km. of road have been built when 300 km. should have been built. What has gone wrong? Why is money not being spent wisely and results being achieved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat constrained in what I can say due to upcoming events. One of the major jobs over the coming years will be to get value for money in all areas of public spending. Procedures are in place to ensure that. The job of the Comptroller and Auditor General is to account for the money that is sent out and to make sure that nobody ran off with it. At the same time he conducts value for money audits. The Department of Finance also conducts a review of spending along with other Departments. In all areas of Government expenditure, not just health, we will have to start to cost basic needs because we have to be satisfied that we are getting value for money. Health has been singled out for the obvious reason that a large amount of money is being spent there and people are somewhat dissatisfied. Ensuring value for money is going to be an increasingly large job in the future.</P>

      <P>Inflation, as measured by annual changes in the consumer price index, is projected to average 4.2% this year. Assuming there is no sustained increase in oil prices, the annual rate of increase is expected to moderate over the months ahead from the 4.8% recorded last month. This moderation is expected because weak global demand in the first half of this year should constrain international inflationary pressures. In addition, food prices are unlikely to increase as greatly as they did last year due to foot and mouth restrictions. The CPI is expected to average 2.8% in 2003.</P>
      <P>In making EU comparisons, the appropriate measure is the EU harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP. While inflation here is expected to be about 4% this year, on a HICP basis, indications are that the EU average will be of the order of 2%. Inflation is higher in Ireland than in the rest of the EU partly due to the strength of domestic cost pressures. It is important that these cost pressures are not allowed to lead to deteriorating competitiveness which would reduce growth and result in higher unemployment. That is why wage moderation and moderation of costs generally is so important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I put to the Minister the comments made in the quarterly review of the ESRI which express concern about an inflationary spiral which would result from excessive wage demands. What is the Minister's view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Annual services sector inflation was 8% in March and has been running at over 7% for some time reflecting the strength of domestic demand and underlining the risk to our competitiveness of wage increases. The ESRI rightly points out, as any sensible commentator would, that if one loses competitiveness one will have a spiralling effect which will lead to loss of markets. Consequently, jobs will be lost creating unemployment and less activity which brings one into the spiral of increasing taxation. We have moved away from that and the ESRI is rightly pointing out that we must be very conscious going forward of the dangers to our competitiveness. The review also states that a reality check is needed regarding wage negotiations and if there is to be a successor to the current partnership agreement, it will have to be based on market realities. Deputy McDowell will know from meetings of his colleagues in Europe that our competitors there are talking about very low wage increases. There are some disturbances in Germany because of discrepancies between what the unions want and what is on offer. Everybody is talking about low <Col N="835" /> wage increases. That will be a matter for negotiation when and if the partners get around the table.</P>

      <P>Dealing with inflation is the main task going forward and wage demands are for the partners to agree in the successor talks.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware from driving around that petrol prices quoted at various stations are hugely divergent. That is true in my county and the Deputy's. One reason for that relates to the fluctuating price of oil on the markets.</P>
      <P>Our rate of inflation is in the upper quartile of members of the EU and has been for some time. Ours is not the highest and it has been higher. I stick with our prediction, as does the ESRI, that average inflation in 2002 will be of the order of 4.2%. That is what I said at budget time and the ESRI uses the same figure today.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell asked a question about the ESRI contention that there would be an undershoot of the order of &euro;700 million. I can only refer to my officials' end quarter Exchequer statement which pointed out that changes in taxation are staggered throughout the year going forward. When that was published they were still of the view that the small surplus of &euro;117 million I predicted at budget time would be met.</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach read this Administration's obituary, published yesterday by the ESRI, which says that, already, the Government's budgetary position is &euro;1 billion off target, that we are facing a budgetary deficit of &euro;2 billion and that there is a risk next year of the Government breaching the fiscal guidelines laid down in the Maastricht treaty and the stability and growth pact? It states that our inflation rate is the highest in Europe, that there is a danger to competitiveness and that, in effect, under the present Administration pursuing the present policies, the party is over, the kitty is empty and the next Government is going to be left to pick up the pieces.</P>

      <P>In addition to the questions posed by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, having regard to what has been published by the ESRI and the fact that the Taoiseach's Department had access to preliminary data in the Department of Finance, was his speech to the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis some weeks ago an exercise in total fiction or was he, in effect, trying to say to people that they could have all things without having to pay for them? In that speech he said all the things promised would be achieved without recourse to borrowing or without any increase in taxation. However, in a subsequent interview the Minister for Health and Children admitted that borrowing for capital purposes in respect of health would be required and he thought there was no difficulty in regard to borrowing. As recently as this morning the Minister for Finance finally put the nail in the coffin of his own Ard Fheis speech by stating borrowing would be necessary. Can we take it that the official position of the Fianna Fáil Party as enunciated with regard to economic strategy at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis has now been overtaken by events and can be properly binned?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the ESRI's quarterly economic commentary which accords with the budget figures. I am pleased the country is moving towards a position of just under 4% growth <Col N="838" /> this year and it will probably move to 5% or 6% growth next year when we will clearly be back into a growth cycle. The report indicates that fundamentally the economy is not just performing well but is out-performing most countries in the European Union and in the OECD, which is welcome. It indicates that employment growth continues to grow, that there will be a general Government surplus this year and, if it goes into decline next year, it will not be by a significant amount, that the debt GDP ratio and debt GNP ratio will be at an all time low of 36% from the former high rates we suffered and &euro;1 billion in interest payments have been saved in the past five years. It also indicates that we must continue to manage the economy well and watch carefully wage increases and wage inflation. These are issues to which I have subscribed for the past 15 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that all fiscal management ceased approximately 18 months ago, expenditure has increased over the past two years by 40%, current expenditure continues to increase by in excess of 20% and whatever cutbacks are being made by the Government have been made on the capital side. This is a totally incorrect prioritisation because while one grows current expenditure one is cutting the capital expenditure to be invested in the infrastructure necessary to keep growth rates going forward. The Taoiseach knows, not just as Taoiseach but as a former Minister for Finance, this is totally unsustainable. What are his intentions in the dying days of the Government? What signal will he give the Irish people in respect of public expenditure which is totally out of control?</P>

If we look back over the past few years and what happened last year as a result of the foot and mouth disease outbreak and the slow down in the ICT sector following 11 September, revenue decreased even though economic growth was still healthy enough. All the figures for this year indicate that growth will be close to 4%.</P>

      <P>We have moved to a position <Col N="839" /> where we were able to spend extra on public expenditure. We were able to do so because in the past five years we decreased the general Government debt GDP ratio from 65% to 35%. That 30% decrease meant &euro;1 billion less in interest payments which allowed us to spend the money on health, education and other services and to manage the economy effectively. We have the lowest debt in Europe while still reducing unemployment.

      <P>I suspect this may be the last leader's question in this Dáil, therefore I will ask the Taoiseach the following question as succinctly as I can. Having regard to the importance of electricity to the knowledge-based economy as a primary source of energy, does the Taoiseach agree the ESB should be retained within the strategic ownership of the State? Is he of the view that there should be no proposal to privatise the ESB having regard to the necessity to ensure the sovereignty of this State relates also to the management of the economy? Does he agree the ownership and control of the ESB within that context is of strategic national importance?</P>

Is this the same <Col N="840" /> Tánaiste who 12 months ago upscuttled the ESB's plans to invest in Poland because, as she put it, it needed to get its own house in order before it invested in Poland? Have things changed so radically in the ESB that it is now a candidate for sale, in the middle of deregulation, with less progress made in the deregulation of electricity supply in this country than anywhere else in Europe?

We have gone through that process with a number of State companies and a number of others have been looked at. There is already ESB generation competition, participation of the staff in ESB equity and a desire to continue down that road. These issues can only take place with the agreement of the staff and the strategic use of the company into the future.</P>

Reachtaíocht fíor-thábachtach atá ann a thabharfaidh cabhair agus tacaíocht do pháistí na tíre mar a gheall muid le cúpla bliain anuas.

Le hOmbudsman for Children, beidh gúth neamhspleách, speisialta ag páistí.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to introduce this important legislation in Dáil Éireann. In many ways this Bill is an appropriate conclusion to the work for children done by this Government in recent years. The focus of my tenure as Minister of State with responsibility for children and that of my predecessor has been on improving services for children and on giving them a voice.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of an Ombudsman for Children. The main functions proposed for the ombudsman are to promote the rights and welfare of children and to investigate individual complaints made by or on behalf of children arising in the course of the administration of public bodies, schools or public hospitals.</P>
      <P>In introducing the Bill I am aware of the need to safeguard the rights of children. Put simply, children matter. Their status and well-being speak volumes about the values and quality of life within our society. Attitudes and perceptions to the role and place for children in society have changed in recent years and this has led to many policy developments in relation to child care services. We have seen increased investment, the introduction of new legislation and the publication of strategic policy documents during the past five years, and the introduction of the Ombudsman for Children must be seen in this context. The commitment to the establishment of an Ombudsman for Children is also contained in the Government's key social policy document, An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
      <P>The Government has been committed to extending the range of services for children in recent years and has invested and additional &euro;171 million for child welfare and protection services since 1997. This level of additional funding continues to provide and support a wide range of developments in this area and emphasises the Government's determination to put in place effective strategies and services to promote and protect the welfare of children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to developing <Col N="846" /> all aspects of child welfare and protection services and in recent years significant reforms have taken place in terms of legislation, policies and services to promote the protection and welfare of children. For example, we brought forward the Protection for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act, 1998, which provides protection for any person who acting &ldquo;reasonably and in good faith&rdquo; reports suspicion of abuse of a child. We published Children First &ndash; National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children in 1999 which sets out to improve the identification, reporting, assessment, treatment and management of child abuse. These guidelines are being implemented on a national basis in the health boards and in schools but also in sporting and other voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>It was encouraging to note that in the recently published report on sex abuse and violence, the SAVI report, commissioned by the Rape Crisis Centre, we saw some evidence suggesting that there has been a drop in the level of child sexual abuse since the start of the development of guidelines for those working in the field. I am confident that in ten years' time, the development of the Children First guidelines and the associated investment will be seen to have further impacted on the levels of all forms of child abuse.</P>
    <P>The expansion of family support projects, the launch of the springboard projects and other early intervention schemes will also have long-term results, helping to strengthen more vulnerable families. The report of the working group on foster care, 2001, sets out clear objectives for the development of our foster care service. The Government has already indicated its commitment to implementing this report by increasing the foster care allowance from &euro;90.84 per week to &euro;270.50 for children under 12 years and from &euro;108.62 to &euro;296.50 per week for children over 12 years. I believe in the principle that children deserve the love and protection of a family and where, for whatever reason, they cannot remain in their own family the support of a foster family is crucial. Those families give to our child welfare service a service that can never be underestimated.</P>
    <P>Major developments have also taken place in the provision of residential care for children. The capital investment programme has improved the number and quality of places available for children, and the establishment of the social services inspectorate has ensured that standards are set and adhered to. The places required for particularly troubled children in high support and special care units have increased from 17 to 94, including the facility at Ballydowd, which is being opened on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>The Children Act, 2001, substantially adds to the protection we offer children and involves a total overhaul of the juvenile justice system. It gives a new legal basis for dealing with children who have behavioural difficulties and children who are offenders. The Act replaces the Children Act, 1908, and is based on the principle that <Col N="847" /> detention of children should only be used as a last resort. The key elements of the Act involve: raising the age of criminal responsibility from seven to 12 years; the introduction of family conferences to enable children and their families agree on an action plan for the child; and the use of restorative justice where a child offender can face and apologise to a victim.</P>
    <P>Acknowledging the crucial role played by child care workers in frequently difficult circumstances, new salary scales and structures were agreed and extra support and training places put in place. I acknowledge the difficulties for child care workers and the difficulties for health boards in recruiting new child care and social workers. We remain committed to ensuring more are recruited and trained to meet the needs of the service.</P>
    <P>The Government has also published a detailed strategy document to tackle youth homelessness. The primary goal of the youth homelessness strategy is to reduce and, if possible, eliminate youth homelessness through preventative strategies. Where a child becomes homeless we must ensure that he or she benefits from a comprehensive range of services aimed at reintegrating him or her into the community as quickly as possible. This strategy involves taking on board the needs of the child but also involves the family, the local community and all the services which come into contact with the child.</P>
    <P>The national children's strategy launched in November 2000 has been internationally welcomed as a model of good practice in relation to the provision of supports and services for children. The three goals which are backed by 117 target actions are that children will have a voice, that voice will be understood and that children will receive quality supports and services. The vision outlined in the strategy is one which we all share &ndash;&ldquo;an Ireland where children are respected as young citizens with a valued contribution to make and a voice of their own; where all children are cherished and supported by family and the wider society; where they enjoy a fulfilling childhood and realise their potential&rdquo;. The national children's strategy is a ten year plan and already a number of initiatives and structures have been put in place to ensure it is implemented in full.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman for Children is a key provision of the national children's strategy. The ombudsman will provide an independent mechanism to vindicate the rights of children. The establishment of such an office is in recognition of the need for an independent person to act as a powerful advocate for children and promote the welfare and rights of the child. The introduction of an Ombudsman for Children is a further step along the road to providing our children with quality services and letting their voices be heard. Many countries have an Ombudsman for Children, sometimes called a commissioner for children, therefore, the establishment of the office of the Ombudsman for Children will bring Ireland into line with best practice internationally.  </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="848" />The most important role of the Ombudsman for Children is that of promoting the rights and welfare of children. In this, the function is different from that of the existing Ombudsman whose focus is solely on dealing with complaints. It is, however, a common feature of other ombudsmen for children internationally and it is crucial that the Ombudsman for Children has the ability to advocate independently for children. The Ombudsman for Children has been given a range of roles and functions to achieve this, including the following: highlighting issues of concern to children; encouraging the development of appropriate policies, practices and procedures which affect children; advising the Government on the development and co-ordination of policy relating to children; monitoring and reviewing the operation of legislation; and establishing structures to consult regularly with children.</P>
    <P>Until recently, little thought was given to the views of children, even on issues which affected them directly. The first major consultation with children probably took place during the development of the national children's strategy. The results of that consultation not only fed into the strategy document but determined its outcome. Learning from that process, we have since had the first meeting of Dáil na nÓg and local councils are in the process of being set as Comhairle na nÓg throughout the country. The Ombudsman for Children will find, as I have, that the views of children and young people are valuable and well informed.</P>
    <P>In drafting this legislation, I was anxious to ensure that complaints could be made to the Ombudsman for Children on the actions of a wide range of bodies, public and private. In the event, considerable work with the Attorney General's office was required to frame the legislation in order that schools and voluntary hospitals are included. I am pleased that the proposed jurisdiction of the Ombudsman for Children is wider even than that of the current Ombudsman. In particular, it is important that we have been able to provide that schools can be included in the complaints procedure. For the vast majority of our children, the only State institution which directly affects them is the education system. I was anxious to ensure that schools would be included in the Bill. The Ombudsman for Children will cover all children and tomorrow I will bring forward an amendment to include young people in the Prison Service.</P>
    <P>A concern has been to ensure that the Bill is workable, that it will operate practically over time and that the rights of the child and those of his or her parents are maintained. This legislation should be seen as a first step. Over time, as legal difficulties are addressed, other organisations in the voluntary and private sectors will be brought within the aegis of the Ombudsman for Children.</P>
    <P>In recent times the involvement of the State in the lives of our children has increased and decisions taken within public bodies have a significant bearing on them. Problems can arise in <Col N="849" /> balancing the needs of organisations and the just and fair treatment of a child. It is inevitable that difficulties or mistakes will give rise to wrong or unfair decisions or a child may feel that he or she is being deprived of something to which he or she is entitled. There is no way of guaranteeing that this will never occur but what is being done is to provide a method by which the grievance can be re-examined independently.</P>
    <P>There are arrangements in place at present which allow decisions to be queried. Under the Education Act, 1998, there is provision for appeals to be made in respect of State examinations. However, mechanisms such as this are designed to address specific situations and they do not cover the whole area of the State's interaction with children.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman for Children will affect the operation of a myriad of institutions by providing an opportunity to seek redress by, or for, a child without having recourse to adults or professionals in the first instance. What needs to be ensured is that when a child complains an examination of the situation can be started quickly without becoming entangled in an ever increasing web, which could confuse and alienate our children from public institutions.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman for Children is intended to be an independent and easily reached mediator. One of the roles will be purely to investigate and report. The importance lies in the power to investigate the actions of those affecting children and to report on these to the Oireachtas. To our children, this ombudsman will be an important advocate for them, providing informality and accessibility in resolving the issues they consider important.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of an Ombudsman for Children who can investigate, on his or her initiative or on the basis of a complaint from a child, family member or a professional, actions taken by a body listed in the First Schedule to the Bill. The remit extends to Government Departments, schools and public voluntary hospitals. Certain areas, notably the courts, security matters, military activities and decisions made in relation to asylum will be exempt from scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on some of the noteworthy features of the Bill. It is proposed that the Ombudsman for Children shall be appointed by the President on the resolution of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann. This is in line with the appointment of the current Ombudsman. It is my belief that the acceptability of the Ombudsman for Children will be enhanced by the fact that the holder is acceptable to all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>The terms of the employment of the Ombudsman for Children are set out in section 4. The independence of the office is vital, as our children must see that this is an independent authority. The Bill sets out that the Ombudsman for Children shall be independent in the performance of his or her duties. The six year term of office, in line with the current Ombudsman, underlines the <Col N="850" /> independence of the office from Government. I will bring forward an amendment tomorrow to remove the age restriction on appointment in section 4.</P>
    <P>The ombudsman may undertake an investigation on his or her initiative or arising from a complaint made by a child, a family member or someone who has a professional relationship with the child. However, if a parent is not the complainant, one of the parents must be informed that a complaint has been made. This is to ensure that the constitutional rights of the parent are not diminished in any way.</P>
    <P>In line with the Ombudsman Act, 1980, the Ombudsman for Children may not investigate an action if it is trivial or vexatious, if the complainant has insufficient interest in the matter or has not already used reasonable means to remedy his grievance. However, the ombudsman will give the complainant reason for his or her refusal.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on certain other matters that are excluded from the ombudsman's remit. The ombudsman will not investigate where legal proceedings have been initiated, where there is a statutory right of appeal to a court or where there is right of appeal to independent tribunals or referees drawn from outside the Civil Service. It is not intended that the ombudsman should replace existing appeals procedures or interfere with the judicial process. Defence matters have been excluded on the grounds that they do not directly affect the lives of our children. Public personnel matters are also excluded. It is felt that the Ombudsman for Children is intended to be concerned with grievances arising out of the dealings with public bodies and not with the relationships between employer and employee.</P>
    <P>All investigations will be carried out in private and the body or person against whom the complaint is being made will have an opportunity to comment. The ombudsman may require persons to furnish documents and information for investigation, but has no power to compel the disclosure of any document or information relating to decisions of Government. Any publication or utterance by the ombudsman in the course of his or her investigations is privileged. These provisions are there to provide protection for the privacy of the complainant and those complained about.</P>
    <P>I am happy that this legislation is before the House. It may well be the last significant legislation to be passed by the 28th Dáil. It is a fitting end to the Government that has done more for children than any other Government. Having regard to the amount of investment, structures, strategies and long-term policies that have been put in place by the Government, real progress has been made. We all acknowledge that real progress can yet be made and that there is a good deal more to do. In bringing forward this Bill, we can ensure there is an additional voice for children to add to those other voices who are already strong advocates on behalf of children. Molaim an Bille don Theach.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill. An ombudsman for children is an important part of the infrastructure needed to protect children's rights. I acknowledge the role a Fine Gael-led Government played in initiating this Bill under Deputy Currie initially and the Minister of State's work in bringing it to the House today.</P>
      <P>One must examine the headlines and stories of recent weeks about children and acknowledge that an extraordinary task will face the ombudsman. There is an irony in this Bill coming before the House today when one considers that, on the one hand, we are establishing the office of an ombudsman for children and, on the other, that there was a Government decision this week to provide 25 new places which, if the Child Care Bill put forward by the Government and brought before the House, was fully enacted would be illegal.</P>
      <P>We have seen headlines on the crises in child care such as &ldquo;Violent boy released to make room for joyrider&rdquo;. There was the tragic death of two gardaí and it emerged that two of the young men involved were refused places in detention centres and that secure places were not available to them. Statistics on the extraordinary number of cases in the health boards were publicised again this week. Some 2,272 cases are on the waiting list for social work services and in two areas in the ERHA, 81 out of a total of 232 social work posts are vacant. On the one hand, a structure is being developed comprising a children strategy providing an increased voice for children.</P>
      <P>There are 25 new places being announced this week as a reaction to the sad and dreadful crime involving the death of two gardaí. On the other hand we have a child care system in absolute chaos. Talking to people on the ground &ndash; social workers or those trying to get referrals of child abuse cases &ndash; one finds the resources simply are not there. There was never so much money but never so few resources. That is what people say.</P>
      <P>The difficulty for many people with this Bill is not so much the detail of it, which is obviously welcome, but the gap between the words and the reality for children in difficulty. There is a huge difficulty in getting the expert help that many families need and in many ways there is a credibility gap. If one looks at what a potential ombudsman will face &ndash; the background against which he or she will do his or her work in child care &ndash; it is an area of extraordinary challenge and the system is undoubtedly in chaos. Anyone who knows the system could not disagree with that description. There are extraordinary problems and a huge need exists for more initiatives, such as full enactment of the Child Care Bill, provision of more places and establishment of a better infrastructure throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="852" />An extraordinary staffing crisis also faces the child care sector and I have given some figures on it. There are huge problems with retention of staff, even though there has been some success in recruitment. Clearly not enough attention has been paid to retaining staff. Retaining staff has become almost impossible. We have one of the lowest numbers of qualified child care workers in Europe and a very low percentage of trained staff deal with child care in Ireland. The Minister of State will know this was highlighted in the report on the Kim O'Donovan case and in other reports. In many ways the staff crisis is undermining everything &ndash; it undermines many of the efforts the Minister of State is making, such as the resources she is putting into this area. The staff simply are not there to do the work and the staff being recruited leave very quickly.</P>
    <P>This is the background against which we judge the situation and against which the ombudsman will have to work. If the Child Care Act was fully enacted it would be illegal to create the new places in a prison setting, as the Minister of State is doing. I presume she will deal with that anomaly tomorrow so that the 25 places will be covered by the Child Care Act. Is that correct? Perhaps she will deal with that in her response.</P>
    <P>This is the situation and in that context, the key question people will ask about the ombudsman's office is whether it will really be independent and well resourced. From the description in the legislation the intention is that the office would be independent, which is very important. One cannot emphasise that independence enough. Will it be properly resourced? Will it be able to cope and undertake proper investigations? Will it be able to influence legislation, for example? Many people feel the danger is that the office could be swamped with queries and unable to cope with the amount of work referred to it, given the background I outlined. Will it be able to handle the work? There will be no shortage of work &ndash; how will the office prioritise it? </P>
    <P>It has been proven in other countries, as the Minister of State said, that an independent ombudsman's office such as is envisaged here can play an important role in the future, as I am sure this one will. It is extremely important that the Dáil gives it the resources, independence and support to enable it to undertake what could be a vital part of the infrastructure protecting children's rights. The history of children's rights has been one of very slow progress, given that parts of the 1908 Act are still operational. We have been very slow to bring in new legislation and children's rights have not been centre stage. There will soon be an amendment to the Constitution involving children's rights but it is not there at present.</P>
    <P>The task of putting children's rights centre stage has been an enormously slow process. It is no surprise when one sees the statistics emerging about sexual abuse. A recent survey stated that one in five schoolchildren had suffered sexual abuse and that one in ten women had suffered <Col N="853" /> rape as an adult or child. That study laid bare the reality of sexual abuse and the infringement of children's rights in Irish society in the past. Abuse in residential centres and the lack of care have also illustrated the lack of protection for children's rights in residential care.</P>
    <P>Many reports emerging today suggest we cannot be complacent about our young children in care at present. Sister Stanislaus Kennedy recently issued a report which showed very alarming statistics about the downward spiral of many young people who emerge from care; they quickly become homeless and must deal with addictions and lack of support. They find it hard to cope once they leave the care system so there is no room for complacency about the future prospects of children in care today, either. There is a need for review of the care system overall. We need to re-analyse the numbers in need of care and protection and to examine the services needed but which are not there at present.</P>
    <P>Other statistics in relation to children which one should bear in mind regarding the work of the Ombudsman for Children include the poverty figures which indicate that 25% of Irish households live in relative income poverty, while 8% of children are in consistent poverty. That is a very high number given the boom of recent years and when one takes relative poverty into account one is talking about thousands of children. Another statistic relates to the number of children growing up in bed and breakfasts. Research from Focus Ireland shows that more than 1,200 accompanied children under the age of 18 lived in that kind of accommodation in 1999, so hundreds of children do not have access to accommodation appropriate to their needs. That is the background against which an ombudsman will have to work and it is a big challenge. The Minister of State said the ombudsman would not be responsible for everything and I take that point but obviously there is no shortage of work for the ombudsman. There has been a huge change in the approach to children which is obviously welcome. Children's rights are centre stage and the challenge now is to match the rhetoric with the resources needed to deal with the challenges I outlined.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should consider a number of specific areas of the Bill. A number of amendments in the Seanad were not accepted for a variety of reasons but many people in the child welfare sector are still concerned about a number of sections in the Bill. Perhaps the Minister of State will accept some amendments in this regard. In section 7(1) there is an absence of any reference to the ombudsman's protection responsibility. That was debated in the Seanad and I put it on the record here also. The lack of such a reference weakens the Bill considerably. If it is not the function of the Ombudsman for Children to protect the rights of children, who will do so? In view of recent court decisions it seems that the role of the ombudsman in this regard will be even more critical. I refer in particular to the Supreme Court judgment of 17 December 2001 in the case <Col N="854" /> involving the Minister for Education and Science, Ireland, the Attorney General, the Eastern Health Board and the Minister for Health and Children. There is concern about this area.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State comment on section 11(1)(<i>e</i>)(i) which deals with the exclusion of refugee, asylum seeking and immigrant children? In the Seanad she stated that these children would be included, except for the decision regarding status. Will asylum seeking children who are in direct provision come under the remit of the ombudsman? A recent report was critical of conditions in direct provision. Would such children be able to seek support from the Ombudsman for Children? There is concern that these children are excluded from the protections which this Bill could provide. Large numbers of unaccompanied and separated children are arriving in this country and there is a problem regarding trafficking in children. Will the Minister of State clarify whether these children will have the support of the ombudsman or whether the ombudsman will be able to investigate their cases? There is a belief that such children will not be covered by the legislation.</P>
    <P>The exclusion of children in detention also remains a concern. Such an exclusion goes against the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which provides for the protection of the rights of children and young people in the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>Section 11(3) gives unlimited authority to the Minister to stop investigations. In many respects this is the most worrying element of the Bill as it appears that the Minister will have a veto over investigations into actions which could be taken by public bodies, schools and voluntary hospitals. Will the Minister of State reconsider this provision? If the Minister has unlimited authority to stop or veto investigations, surely the independence of the office of ombudsman is compromised. One of the key issues for the ombudsman will be the degree of independence which the office and the holder will have. This matter needs to be unambiguous. Surely the principle of independence and the work of the ombudsman will be undermined if a Minister can stop or veto an investigation. The ombudsman should be given the right to investigate, or to continue to investigate, an action in the best interest of a child. Such a provision could be inserted in the Bill to strengthen the independence of the office.</P>
    <P>The ombudsman's right of court referral was discussed in the Seanad and arises again. The Minister of State said she could not allow for such a provision as there was a potential for a guardian <i>ad litem</i> and the courts should be allowed to do their work without referrals from the ombudsman. The office of the ombudsman would be strengthened if it had expressed powers to refer cases to domestic or international courts when important principles arise. Such a provision would strengthen the Bill and the powers of the ombudsman to protect children.</P>
    <P>The Bill has considerable potential to protect <Col N="855" /> children's rights. However, unfortunately, it appears that important and vulnerable groups of children will be excluded from its protections because of the manner in which it is drafted and because the Minister of State has not taken on board the amendments proposed in the Seanad. These areas remain of concern to many groups working for the welfare of children. This is the last opportunity the Minister of State will have to consider these amendments and I ask her to review her decision not to accept them. I await with interest her amendment regarding how these provisions will work and whether they will further include the young people who will be so affected by the provision of new places.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, but it could be strengthened. The Ombudsman for Children will have an enormous task. I hope the office is independent, well funded and resourced and, in time, I have no doubt it will develop and become an important element in highlighting inadequacies, suggesting remedies and noting key areas where further action is needed to protect the rights of children. This is the first step, but I have no doubt the office will expand and develop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing the Bill, the Minister of State said: &ldquo;In many ways this legislation is an appropriate conclusion to the work for children done by the Government over recent years&rdquo;. Thanks be to God that statement is not true as, if it was, the outlook for children would be bleak. In the dying hours of this Government, and in view of the horrific events of the past few days and weeks, it is obvious that our child care system is a shambles. It is an indictment of the Government's record that such events are happening five years after it took office. The Government is unique in history in that it had piles of money to spend, but, as is indicated by the Bertie bowl, sometimes it does not know how best to spend it.</P>
      <P>I regret and never cease to be amazed by the pettiness which some Ministers invariably display. I am sorry to say that, despite being relatively young, this Minister of State belongs to that category. She made no mention of the genesis of this Bill &ndash; how or when it originated. History began with the election of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This process was initiated in 1996 when I commissioned the Children's Rights Alliance to publish a report on the issues involved in establishing an ombudsman for children. I pay tribute to the Children's Rights Alliance for the initiative it showed. It produced a report entitled Seen and Heard &ndash; Promoting Children's Rights in Ireland. The report called for the establishment of an office of ombudsman for children on a statutory basis. That marked the initiation of the process being concluded here today in relation to an Ombudsman for Children. There then followed a useful debate on the protection of children including mandatory reporting. In December 1996, I announced I would not introduce mandatory reporting but I put forward a number of <Col N="856" /> alternative proposals for the protection of children. The main proposal related to the establishment of an Ombudsman for Children. In April 1997, I established an interdepartmental working group involving officials from all of the relevant Departments, nine in all, in addition to the Office of the Ombudsman. A number of meetings of this working group were held before the rainbow Government went out of office in June 1997.</P>
    <P>When I left office I was hopeful that sufficient progress had been made to ensure that the succeeding Government would have to proceed with the measure. For a while it looked as if I would be disappointed. The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat programme for Government made no mention of an Ombudsman for Children. Now that the Bill for the Ombudsman for Children has passed through the Seanad and should shortly go through this House, I can reveal that I had to use a particular strategy to ensure the Ombudsman for Children became Government policy.</P>
    <P>I refer to a debate in this House on Wednesday, 17 December 1997 during which I asked the Taoiseach whether in view of the day's news, the obvious continuing necessity for greater protection for children at risk and the fact that the Government reneged on its commitment to introduce mandatory reporting, an announcement would be made in regard to an ombudsman for children. The Taoiseach replied that the commitment in the programme for Government would be met. He said that, despite the fact that there was no commitment in the programme for Government. I asked when that would happen and the Taoiseach replied that it would be met in due course. When I said that the proposal should have been implemented before then, he replied that the well thought out proposal would be implemented in due course. I asked the Taoiseach to confirm that the establishment of an ombudsman for children was a Government commitment and he did so. I said that he should inform the Minister for Health and Children of that because he was not aware of it. That is how a commitment to establish an ombudsman for children became part of the Government programme. It was because the Taoiseach made a mistake on the Order of Business and the Department subsequently found that it had to proceed to honour that commitment.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and regret that, despite my assistance, it has taken so long to come to fruition. It is now in its sixth year since initiation. Why has something so potentially powerful in protecting the rights and promoting the interests of children taken so long to produce in circumstances where almost daily we have examples of the necessity of such protection and promotion? How many children might have escaped abuse if this Bill had been passed four or five years ago? It is beyond doubt that the position of children today would be much better if an ombudsman had been created then.</P>
    <P>The importance of the first holder of this office and the appointment of the right person is crucial. <Col N="857" /> He or she can be a symbol of our concern that the welfare of the child is paramount. We keep using the phrase &ldquo;the interest of the child is of paramount consideration&rdquo;. Here is the opportunity to put that into practice. The passing of this Bill is a step forward which could bring that about but the appointment of the right person is crucial. He or she should be a spokesperson for children and must gain their trust which will not follow automatically. I do not want to see a lawyer or civil servant appointed to the position. It should be a daring and inspiring appointment. Perhaps we will get the chance, after the election, to make such an appointment.</P>
    <P>In Norway the first appointee was a television personality who had made his name on children's television. That is the sort of inspiration and daring that is required. We need to go beyond the traditional people who are appointed to these positions and appoint someone who will inspire our young people, someone in whom they can place their confidence and with whom they can identify. We want an appointment that will bring out the idealism of youth, the idealism which still exists despite the growing cynicism among young people. That sort of appointment should be made as a counterweight to the prevailing cynicism.</P>
    <P>The person appointed to this position must be fully independent, particularly of the Departments of Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. If there is not true independence the appointment will not work and cynicism will increase because of that failure. I share the concern of Deputy Fitzgerald on the matter of the Minister being able to veto investigations. I ask the Minister to underline the independence of the office.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has something for which she can take credit because there is not much else for which she can take it. She certainly cannot take credit for out of control children or for progress in relation to inter-country adoptions. On the latter issue, people have to wait four or five years for assessments. She cannot take credit for welching on the Government commitment in relation to mandatory reporting and she cannot take credit for the adoption contact register. I am sorry Deputy McGennis is not here because when I was Minister she continually raised that issue with me but her bleeding heart was cured by the election of this Government.</P>
    <P>The children of this country are lucky now to have an ombudsman to look after their interests. They are lucky not to have to rely on this Government which has let them down time and time again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the eventual arrival of this Bill and concur with many of the remarks made by Deputy Currie in relation to its genesis. It is disingenuous of the Minister not to refer to the Bill's origins. I am glad that the Children's Rights Alliance, in its press statement, recognised that the groundwork for this legislation was done by the rainbow Government in December 1996, <Col N="858" /> in particular by the then Minister with responsibility for children, Deputy Currie.</P>
      <P>In January 1998, the UN committee on the rights of the child drew attention to the fact that we did not have an office of an ombudsman here to uphold and promote the rights of children and their protection. The Minister announced her intention to set up such an office. That office was promised by her predecessor in 1999 and again in November 2000 with the launch of the children's strategy. It is only now, in the middle of 2002, that we are getting around to debating the Bill.</P>
      <P>Six years have passed since this legislation was first promised and the Minister has not done much to boast about in the intervening period. Today's Ireland is not a particularly good place to be for children or young people. I am not saying this purely as an Opposition spokesperson. Many independent surveys have been done showing comparisons between the life opportunities and life chances of young people in Ireland and those in other countries and we come out badly in all of them. We have the highest rate of alcohol use among 15 and 16 year olds and the highest rate of drug use among 15 year olds. We have an exceptionally high rate of youth suicide, especially among males. We have a high pregnancy rate among single girls. We have serious problems with educational disadvantage. If the Minister of State had attended the meeting held yesterday in the Mansion House with a group made up of principals of disadvantaged schools in the Dublin area, she would have heard first hand how bad things are on the education front for a great number of children here in the Dublin City area.</P>
      <P>In many ways this is a very difficult time for young people. A damning report that came out yesterday showed that we are not making any progress in terms of early school leaving. Children are still dropping out at the same unacceptably high rates. The school system is simply not responding to the needs of children from poorer communities.</P>
      <P>However, it is not only those from poorer communities about whom I am concerned but young people generally. When we consider the rate of under age drinking, for example, we can see that the State, which should have a role in protecting children and protecting childhood, has reneged on its duties completely. Legislation on this issue is inadequately enforced. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made a great deal of the fact that he had introduced a new law in July 2000 to curb under age drinking. There is no doubt that it would have been a strong law if it had been enforced. However, not a single pub in the Dublin area has been closed for selling alcohol to people who are under age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the Members would agree that one of the biggest problems in our constituencies, in urban areas and also in parts of rural Ireland, is the rate of under age drinking. That the Garda are incapable of enforcing the law adequately to deal with the problem sends out a very clear message <Col N="859" /> to young people: that we as adults, legislators and authorities, do not really care about their welfare. We do not care enough to ensure that a clear focus is put on the problem and that they are protected from themselves when it comes to the use and abuse of alcohol. That record of lack of enforcement is a serious indictment of this Government in relation to the needs of children.</P>
    <P>When it comes to under age working a clear message is also being sent to children that nobody is too pushed about their interests. One of the biggest problems in many schools is that students as young as 13 and 14 are working weekends, evenings and late at night. Many schools now have less than 50% attendance on a Monday morning and very often many of the pupils are gone by lunch time on a Friday to their part-time jobs. One of the biggest problems being raised by school principals is the manner in which part-time work interferes with children's schooling and the manner in which having a part-time job, working late at night and being paid, in many cases, substantial amounts of money, gives young people access to a very adult kind of lifestyle, which has a huge impact on their lives and on their education.</P>
    <P>There is no desire on the part of anybody in Government to tackle this problem. It is quite obvious that the needs of employers, in terms of having access to low-paid workers &ndash; people who are prepared to work in circumstances which are often unsafe and against the law &ndash; take precedence over the rights of children to their childhood. Only a handful of inspectors are responsible for enforcing the legislation which pertains to young people working. The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Acts do not operate as a protection for young people. An increasing number of young people are being sacrificed for a booming economy. They are being provided with the opportunity of earning large amounts of money and nobody is stepping in to stop it.</P>
    <P>One of the most pressing concerns among parents is the extraordinary increase in the level of street violence, which is very often completely unprovoked. It is hard to meet a parent nowadays who does not recall some story about their sons or daughter being attacked mindlessly on the street coming home from a football match or a meeting with friends. Children are being beaten up just for the sake of it. Anybody who is remotely different &ndash; a child who is quiet, a young person who may be gay or have dark skin, anyone whose family is in any way different &ndash; becomes the target of young people who have learned how to bully in our society. I spoke to a mother this morning who told me about how her eight year old child had been beaten up on three occasions in the past six months. We are talking about an eight year old &ndash; a very quiet child who was simply a little bit different to the bullies living around him.</P>
    <P>I spoke to a parent last night who told me about his son who was beaten up, along with his friend, when coming home from a football match <Col N="860" /> in Glasnevin at eight o'clock the other night. They were unlucky &ndash; one of their mobile phones rang as they were passing a gang and the gang heard the phone, decided they wanted it and beat up the two young teenagers. That was at eight o'clock at night. In my constituency last Sunday week, when the tragic deaths of the two gardaí occurred, three stolen cars were driven around at speed and eventually burnt out, to the horror of the intimidated residents. The day after the two gardaí were killed I was out in my constituency and came across a fairly horrific scene. A car had been driven up a long road with a bend and had gone out of control knocking down a tree and a telegraph pole, including all the cable providing electricity to the houses. It had jack-knifed, somersaulted and landed on its roof. A child described as being about 12 or 13 crawled out, limped away and escaped. That was at 3.30 p.m. It was pure chance that no children were playing on that footpath at the time. I do not know what condition the driver of the car was in and nobody ever will because he is gone and nobody is following up on it.</P>
    <P>On a regular basis, through questions in the House, I try to get the attention of the Minister of State for particularly difficult child welfare cases. Her replies to those questions and her comments when introducing this Bill and her comments that frequently appear in the media lead me to believe that she is living on a different planet to the rest of us. She is very good at trotting out the figures about how much extra she is spending and how she has issued guidelines and produced reports. That is all very well but it is really only window dressing. I wonder if she has any clue what it is like to live in communities where people live in fear of youths who are out of control. Recent tragic events have drawn media and political attention to these problems, but they have existed for years without being addressed. Public representatives have drawn attention to them, but no great interest has been shown by the Government or the media. By and large, such problems affect the children of the poor and we can be sure that if poor people receive little political attention, their children receive even less.</P>
    <P>One wonders how these social problems have been allowed to get out of control. I am sure Deputies who represent Dublin and other urban areas agree that the main item on the agenda at public meetings is trouble caused in communities by young people. Citizens do not want to have park benches, green areas or telephone boxes located near them as they fear that gangs will begin to congregate in their vicinity.</P>

The community garda service seems to be the <Col N="861" /> lowest priority within the force, even though it is the service most demanded by the public. Community gardaí are the first to be removed from their roles if other work, such as escorting prisoners, needs to be done. Many communities do not have a regular community garda who they can get to know. The idea of a community garda service is based on local gardaí working with local people, getting to know local families, nipping problems in the bud when young people start to get into trouble and ensuring that the cycle of crime is stopped by working with parents and others. This process cannot work, however, as sufficient numbers of gardaí are not available in urban areas.</P>
    <P>What can be done by the Garda Síochána if cases are pursued? I have had a great deal of contact with the Garda in my constituency and I appreciate that many members of the force work long hours to pursue children who cause trouble, such as persistent joyriders or those often on the streets after midnight. Many of these young people do not have a parent at home; they get involved with drink and drugs and cause nuisance in their areas. They may have dropped out of school at a young age. The Garda Síochána processes individual cases and refers those involved to juvenile liaison officers, who may try to encourage involvement in youth clubs or similar activities. When a child has clocked up 20 or 25 offences and it is felt that there is a strong legal case, preparations may begin to put matters in the hands of the courts. A custodial sentence in a secure place may be sought for the safety of the child and the community. More often than not, however, the police force is given a slap in the face from the juvenile criminal justice system, as judges in the Children's Court place offenders on probation rather than delivering a custodial sentence.</P>
    <P>I wonder why judges choose to return young offenders to their communities. Is there a vast gulf between the lives of judges and those they encounter in their courts? Judges sometimes feel sorry for children and decide that they deserve another chance, rather than placing them in custodial care. They are loath to give a custodial sentence in the knowledge that there are no places, as they feel there is no point in going through the charade of giving a 12 month sentence if it cannot be served. Judges are unwilling to ask a garda to accompany a young offender to Oberstown House or Trinity House as they know they will be turned away at the door. It is a bad lesson to send out to young people involved in crime or on the verge of becoming involved in crime. It is wrong that serious offenders who have accumulated 25 or 30 charges and who have attracted publicity should be allowed to return to their communities to give the fingers to all levels of authority. It is quite likely that they will drive recklessly in a stolen car that night. It is quite clear that there is no deterrent in the present system as many young people see themselves as untouchable and invincible. They can quite <Col N="862" /> openly give the fingers to authority by gathering more and more of their peers into their gangs. The State has no way of dealing with these problems.</P>
    <P>These troubled and troublesome children should not have been allowed to get out of control. The Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, and others often make the case for early intervention and argue that extra secure places are therefore not needed, but prevention and early intervention services do not seem to exist. As they observe newborn children and their parents in maternity wards, doctors and nurses can often predict with a fair deal of accuracy those who will end up in the care of the State, one way or another, within ten or 15 years. Teachers can tell which children are likely to get into trouble by looking at them at the age of four or five when they start school. As politicians, we often encounter parents at our clinics with a child in a pram and another getting in the way and we can bet that some of them are likely to end up in the care of the State. Assistance is needed at a very young age.</P>
    <P>No single Department is charged with administering a system of family support. We know that &euro;1 spent on an infant will save &euro;7 later in his or her life, but no Department is willing to take on the responsibility. Many pilot projects and voluntary groups, sometimes run by religious orders, in our constituencies are trying to put in place a system of family support services. It is obvious that such services are needed to deal with the problem of juvenile crime. Families need to be helped when they are struggling at an early stage, as it becomes clear that a parent is dysfunctional, possibly as a result of not having experienced decent care in his or her childhood. Families become seriously dysfunctional when the problems of parents, themselves the product of families which did not operate properly and in which alcohol or drug abuse and domestic violence may have been commonplace, are passed on to a second generation. If parents did not experience satisfactory care as children, it is probable that they will continue the cycle by not knowing how to care for their own children. The State's duty in such instances is to provide support, education and practical assistance so parents can provide basic care for their children, but this duty is not being met.</P>
    <P>The service provided by public health nurses for young children is another part of the safety net. In many parts of Dublin, however, there is no public health service. There are no developmental checks in many working class areas as public service doctors and nurses are in short supply. Nobody is intervening on behalf of the State when children are born into homes where mothers cannot cope and where there are serious concerns about a lack of nourishment and a failure to thrive.</P>
    <P>The next line of defence should be the social work service, but such a service is non-existent in many areas.</P>

      <P>The social work service, as it operates at present, is a disgrace. I have to say that the failure of the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, and senior Ministers to tackle this problem is a similar disgrace. Nothing has been done in the past five years to tackle the dire shortage of social workers. We have approximately 3,000 children on waiting lists for social workers. These are cases of suspicion of sexual and physical abuse, serious neglect, family dysfunction or undernourishment, which all seriously affect children's lives. It is no wonder that those children, who are often left in dangerous circumstances, grow up to believe the State does not care about them, and that if they are in difficulty, or being abused in some way, they must fight their own corner. Many end up fighting just to survive and become the people who bully others on the street, are disruptive in school, and beat up others because they feel so badly about themselves. The Minister of State has left them to their own devices by her failure to address the serious shortage of social workers.</P>
      <P>In my area on the north side of Dublin, there are 12,000 children waiting for a social worker. In area seven, which is important in terms of child welfare, as Deputy Fitzgerald knows, and covers Ballymun and the north inner city, there are supposed to be 120 social workers but there are 51 vacancies. For the past two weeks, there has been no duty social worker in Ballymun. This means that in cases where, as often happens, a child is not collected from primary school because the parents have forgotten, are asleep or high, or for whatever reason, the school principal must take care of the child until late in the afternoon. The normal thing is to ring the duty social worker but there is none in Ballymun. If the Garda pick up a child who is homeless and sleeping rough, who might be strung out on drugs or out of his or her head on drink, they try to contact a social work service that is not there. That is the reality of what this Government has done in the past five years. It has left an increasing number of children to their own devices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incident last week resulting in the deaths of two gardaí is an example of the regular occurrences of joyriding and intimidation, under age drinking and other huge social problems that afflict many working class communities. The Government has allowed them to develop through its inaction and failure to recognise the importance of providing child welfare and protection services in the areas where they are most needed. There is little or no planning to provide proper social work services. A person needs about 540 points to get into Trinity College to do a degree in social work, and every year the places on the course are over-subscribed about tenfold because there is no match between the number of training places and the demand for social workers. The Minister of State is introducing an Act which will require at least 250 additional social workers to implement it, as she stated in a press release last week, but there is no hope of <Col N="864" /> doing that for the next five years as the staff are not there. The Eastern Regional Health Authority is attempting to recruit staff in the United States and Denmark to deal with our serious indigenous child welfare cases.</P>
    <P>Non-attendance at school is one of the first indications of problems at home. Three years after the Dáil passed the Act on education welfare, the Government has not employed one additional school attendance officer. There is only a school attendance service in Dublin, Cork and Waterford, while in the rest of the country, it is the responsibility of the Garda, which cannot do that job.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a single additional school attendance officer has been appointed since that Act.</P>
      <P>There are now fewer places in the five special schools &ndash; the detention centres &ndash; than there were five years ago. There are 30 places unfilled and the Minister uses the excuse that they are being refurbished, but, in some centres, units were refurbished and then smashed up requiring refurbishment again because of the chaotic situation there. The Minister is not examining what approach is being taken by the staff in the centres. There is little managerial responsibility being taken by the Department regarding what actually happens. There are problems recruiting qualified staff and many have left, 80 from Finglas in the past two years, for example, with the result that young offenders, whose lives are chaotic because of their upbringing and the State's failure to intervene, are out on the street. If they are lucky, they get a place in a special school, but they go into another chaotic situation. Those children most of all need order in their lives and a proper ethos in the centres to restore order for them. They need people who realise that this may be the one opportunity to salvage a child from the criminal justice system for life, but that is not the case. Instead, we see the children increasingly running these centres themselves knowing that they only have to threaten to beat up staff or to smash up the place in order to get indulged with whatever they want. There is no ethos of expecting any kind of normal behaviour from these children and no one in the Department of Education and Science accepts responsibility for this state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State often talks about extra places, including today again, and her colleague, Deputy O'Dea, spoke of these at the weekend. We are told that we have 24 new places in Ballydowd, but it took a long time to get Ballydowd off the ground. In theory, there are 24 places, but I would like the Minister of State to confirm that there have not been more than eight children there because there is not enough staff and they are unable to control the children. There are six there at present, while huge numbers of children come before the courts desperately in need of <Col N="865" /> secure places which are not available because no one has taken charge of the situation. The Minister of State prefers the more pleasant aspects of this area such as launching reports and issuing guidelines, but will not dirty her hands to deal with the real issues that affect these places such as how they are run, the ethos that prevails, and ensuring that there are enough staff to run them. We have a large number of temporary, part-time, inexperienced and, in many cases, clueless staff attempting to deal with the most difficult children, and very often failing. Low self-esteem is then reinforced in these children, as is the view that they are invincible and that no one gives a damn about them. They come out tougher, greater bullies, more determined to beat the system.</P>
    <P>I will have more to say about this Bill tomorrow, but will say now that this Government's legacy in terms of children's services and welfare is absolutely disgraceful. We have a crisis right across children's services and I welcome the fact that we will have an ombudsman to deal with these problems as we cannot depend on good will or enthusiasm from this Government to ensure that children's rights are upheld. The Government has failed abysmally in that regard and I hope the person who is appointed to this important office will take the Government seriously to task about the neglect of the past five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The passage of legislation to facilitate the appointment of an Ombudsman for Children is an important milestone as such an office has been needed for a considerable time. It has been on the stocks for an exceptionally long time and I hope that when the position is created there will be benefits but, like previous speakers, I have reservations and doubts.</P>
      <P>I sometimes wonder whether the Government is clued into what is happening outside the House at all. Is the position of children recognised? We throw up our hands and are appalled at an atrocity carried out by youngsters who should have been cared for and should have been elsewhere and we ask why something was not done for them. As Deputy Shortall mentioned, services should be provided and there should be intervention at a crucial time in the life of a child to protect him or her and his or her family to ensure they are given a reasonable chance in life. However, they have no chance in some cases. They have the choice of a life of crime or nothing and I cannot understand why it takes so long for the message to get through to Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have repeatedly raised the issue of detention places for juvenile offenders. It has been raised in the courts on a daily basis for the past 20 years. The Government and the Minister of State are aware the need in this area has increased on an annual basis and will continue to increase. What is being done? Ministers rush around in a frenzy after tragic events and make token announcements that extra places will be provided as if this <Col N="866" /> will solve the problem. What has gone wrong? Why can the message not get through? Why must the issue always fall between stools? It involves the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform but there are too many cooks. Everybody and nobody has responsibility.</P>
    <P>On the streets of an average size town, hordes of young people congregate at street corners at night because they have nothing to do. These young thugs should not be there because they will get involved in drug taking. The Government and Minister of State do nothing to divert them from such activity and social workers are not called in to help these children. Many young fellows partake in illegal skateboarding in paved areas and on roads. They are not provided with custom built facilities to cater for their needs. That is fair enough because skateboarding is a passing fad. However, young people are not provided with alternative facilities nor has anything been learned from the past.</P>
    <P>A function of the ombudsman will be to examine and investigate complaints against public bodies which should be fun. When all the public bodies charged with the responsibility of providing facilities and services are investigated, the ombudsman will have a field day.</P>
    <P>I refer to social deprivation and the quality of housing and the circumstances of a child living in such an environment. What chance does the child have of survival? He or she has little opportunity to attend school and, subsequently, take up employment because everything is stacked against him or her. Conditions in certain estates are absolutely appalling. I am shocked when I walk through housing developments where the conditions are comparable to the worst in the world and the saddest aspect of this is that it is happening when Ireland is supposed to be among the ten wealthiest countries in the world and is supposed to have the best facilities. We sashay around the world showing off about how intelligent we are, how many resources we have and how much better than everybody else we are but we should look around the deprived areas of Dublin and ask ourselves what chance we are giving the next generation when they leave school, if they attend at all.</P>
    <P>This Bill, like a number of others, is a last minute effort and I do not know whether the ombudsman will resolve the problems in this area. Will he or she be able to challenge those with the responsibility of providing necessary services in the modern world?</P>
    <P>Deputy Shortall mentioned the question of social workers. All of us are aware of domestic circumstances where the services of social workers are required almost on a daily basis to at least give the family moral support so that family members will have someone to whom they can refer their problems. However, public representatives are now in the business of providing support where the State has failed to provide it. In years gone by, health boards attempted to identify the <Col N="867" /> children or families that were at risk and provide a support service to advise them on various issues, which would help them and, hopefully, the next generation.</P>
    <P>Oddly, in the 1980s when Ireland had no resources, such a service was provided but it has ceased because no money is being invested in this area. Priorities have changed. It is our priority to boast that we are one of the wealthiest countries in the world with the highest economic growth rate and so on. That is positive, welcome and important but the development of services to support those experiencing social and economic deprivation should have gone hand in hand with that. Failure to do so will affect the quality of life not only of those directly involved but also of society in general. That is why we have experienced the problems that have come to the fore recently although everybody has turned around and pointed the finger at everybody else and said something should be done. There are ways and means to do so and investing time is the most important factor.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the lack of public health nurses. I find it frustrating that the emphasis on the provision of adequate staff in public health nursing appears to have gone by the wayside. It is as if the Government has decided this service is a luxury we cannot afford and that it will not fund it because there are other areas it has identified as priorities. Both public health nursing and social workers can contribute greatly towards stabilising those in society in need of constant support until they can help themselves.</P>
    <P>We have learned in public life that, if a person in difficulty can be provided with a stable environment, a good home in which he or she can feel safe and the prospect of a job, that person can be brought to a position of helping him or herself and participating in the competitive market. However, if we do not do any of these and remove all props, not only will that person pay the price, society will as well. I do not understand why these props are removed.</P>
    <P>The quality of assistance in mainstream education for children with special needs in light of the quality of the contracts and terms of employment of special needs teachers is another huge area where there are vast gaps in the system by any standards, be they European or other international standards or ours, given that we purport to be one of the wealthiest countries in the world which is in the business of providing the best services. Surely in this climate we should be able to provide, if not the best, then very close to it. Why has the Government not done that? After almost five years of working on it, it has not produced anything. Again, it is a question of priorities.</P>
    <P>A former Taoiseach once said about certain aspects of the public service that he did not think it was that bad. I regret having to tell members of the Government parties that it is bad and especially in the area to which the legislation refers. They will discover that in no uncertain <Col N="868" /> terms in the next few weeks. Some critical and urgent effort should be made by the Government in these areas between now and the day of the general election to provide the type of service and back-up required to address the issues encompassed in the legislation.</P>
    <P>All of us have cases to which we can refer which have been brought to our attention by constituents. We tend to avoid publicising them in deference to the people concerned. We have been repeatedly called upon to intercede on behalf of people who suffer from deprivation. No group in society is more affected by such conditions than children. From the time they become conscious of what is happening around them, it takes them time to recognise that they are not the wealthiest or the most affluent, that they do not live in the best conditions and that one or both of their parents or some or all of their family are addicted to drugs. It also takes them a little longer to work out the options open and available to them. I am sure that, given average intelligence, they come to the conclusion that there is not much for them.</P>
    <P>It is high time that there was not only an Ombudsman for Children but also a serious examination of the quality of life of children from playschool or primary school to second level to try to understand the obstacles in their way and the formative activities which take place around them, and to try to intervene on their behalf rather than against them, which is what happens at present. They know society is against them, even though they know in many cases that what they do is wrong. As previous speakers said, they are bullying their way through society. Despite this, they must have thought at some stage of the options available. If they did, they would have worked out that they were not good.</P>
    <P>If I were asked to identify the issues which have a bearing on the welfare of children, their families and society, it would be those to which I and others have referred in the debate, such as housing conditions, job opportunities, the possibility of continuing in school to achieve a job and the possibility of feeling that there was some respect for them or recognition of their plight. That is not just recognition in the form of words but also in the form of intervention on their behalf to do something about their circumstances. This has been discussed in the House on many occasions.</P>
    <P>It saddens me when I do my usual rounds at the weekend to find two parents who must live in separate houses, renting at a high cost with one receiving a subvention from the health board. They cannot live together because, if their circumstances were to change, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs would penalise them heavily on suspicion of co-habiting. In fact the husband and wife may only just be visiting each other. This means the only option these people have is to live apart. It is the only way they can survive. This is the way they are treated by one of the wealthiest countries in Europe. Even the most basic societies encourage <Col N="869" /> the family, yet we in this country discourage the family. Couples are forced apart and then we complain about single mothers. It is extraordinary.</P>
    <P>These are not isolated cases. They happen regularly and we deal with them every week, although we can do very little for them. It takes about five years to get a local authority house, in which case people are delighted because they can be independent and go to work and can tell the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs that it cannot pursue them anymore because they are legitimate, can live together, get married and have a family. What type of crazy situation are we presiding over? One would not have to be an Einstein to work out that this equation does not add up. The system does not meet the requirements of society in so far as children and families are concerned.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to this Second Stage debate. While I do not welcome all their comments, I am pleased that they all welcome this important legislation. I acknowledge that the Bill had its genesis in 1996 and, like every other Member, I wish it could have come before the House at an earlier date. However, had it come forward earlier, it would have been exactly the same as the 1980 Ombudsman Act and would not have been as extensive as it is now. It took much negotiation and work on the part of the Office of the Attorney General to ensure that we could include the voluntary bodies, and it would not have been an effective Bill had it not included schools and voluntary hospitals. By taking the time and working through it, today's Bill is stronger and wider in its remit.</P>
      <P>The focus of the Ombudsman for Children is to promote and investigate. In light of some of the comments made earlier, I wish to stress that there are many issues that will not be included in the job specifications. The ombudsman will not be in every home or every community and will not be with every child inside or outside his or her home. The ombudsman is not an inspector, a counsellor, a teacher nor a parent, but has a specific role and will be an additional voice to those who already work on behalf of children &ndash; Members of this House, people in voluntary organisations and people who work on a daily basis with children constantly advocate their rights. The ombudsman will not solve all of the problems, nor do I accept the view that the ombudsman should have a duty to protect. That is the job of others such as parents. Health boards have a statutory duty and schools and voluntary organisations also have a duty to protect the children in their care and it is not the job of an ombudsman to go down that road as well. Where there are failures in the system or where children have been let down, then the ombudsman can, and will, address those issues and in so doing will be able to provide that extra protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="870" />Deputy Fitzgerald asked a question in regard to what she perceived to be a ministerial veto but in fact is not such. It applies only to actions by Ministers in regard to the functions assigned to them and relates only to Government bodies. We investigated this provision, which arises from a strong recommendation by an all-party committee on administrative justice in the late 1970s and was included in the 1980 Act, very carefully. Bearing in mind that the 1980 Act is now 22 years old, we went back to the Office of the Ombudsman and asked if it was really necessary to keep this provision. It was seen as a very strong and important protection for that office's independence and its retention was strongly recommended, despite the fact that it has never been used.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald asked if the extra places being made available by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would be covered. They will be automatically covered because those places will be designated by the Minister for Education and Science, and included under that designation. As the Deputy knows, I will be bringing forward an amendment to extend the provision to those who are held in detention in the prison services. In regard to asylum seekers, it is only the administration of the law which is excluded and all other elements are covered under this provision. Unaccompanied minors are in the care of the health boards and are, therefore, automatically covered as health boards are public bodies.</P>
    <P>I do not think there were any other specific issues in regard to the actual legislation, but a number of comments were made on the broad area of children. Everybody in this House accepts the importance of early intervention, but we also accept that it is not something that existed for many years. We do not have to look too far back to realise that any child who put a foot out of line was locked up in an institution. We have seen the results and repercussions of that and the long-term devastating effects it has had on people. It is only in recent years that we have come to realise that children and their families need to be protected and that early intervention services must be put in place. That is what we have started to do. There is a commitment to ensure we invest heavily in this area and it is not true to say that is not happening. We have teenage parenting projects, Homestart and Lifestart&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they are not. Homestart is not a pilot project. Homestart, Lifestart, the community mothers' scheme, family support workers, pre-school projects, child care projects and the Springboard projects have all been extended throughout the country. We have learned that early intervention works and that is why we have invested so much in family support projects in which we will continue to invest. The children who are out of control now at 15 and 16 years of <Col N="871" /> age did not have such benefits when they were younger.</P>
      <P>All of the investment is dependent on having the necessary staff. I accept that there are difficulties recruiting staff but, unlike other Members of the House, I acknowledge the work that is currently being done. For Deputy Shortall to say that the people who are working in the residential centres are clueless is an insult to those staff who are working in extremely difficult situations.</P>

      <P>We recognise the shortage of staff and recruitment is taking place all over the world. Due to the expansion of our programmes, there are now greater opportunities for qualified staff to work in the community or in residential care. Resourced by Government, the health boards, which have statutory responsibility for this area, have gone as far as South Africa and Scandinavia to try to recruit people. In addition, we have increased the salary scales and put a new career structure and a changed management system in place.</P>

      <P>Additional places have been made available in colleges to train social workers in the hope that they will stay and work with children, recognising that it is a very challenging area for them but one in which there can be great rewards.</P>
      <P>Another factor in improving staff retention is the improvement in buildings which make them more appropriate to the work. For many years, buildings were unsuitable due to size or lack of security but money has been invested in that area. The social services inspectorate is ensuring that the guidelines and standards are met. It is highlighting problems so that everything is being done openly and we are gradually moving towards providing for the people who need residential care. Having moved from early intervention to residential care, we should not forget the huge support that has been provided in the middle for foster families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the 4,000 children in care, some 3,500 are in foster care. We would like to see every child having the love and care of a family, but foster carers provide a home for children who cannot other<Col N="872" /> wise get it. We have made huge progress in working with the Irish Foster Care Association, whose work I acknowledge, and supporting foster families in order that we can give a proper standard of life to children who cannot get it in their own homes.</P>
    <P>Deputies raised the issue of alcohol abuse and the quality of life for children. The situation in regard to under age drinking is undoubtedly a serious problem in this country but it is linked to wider issues such as the culture of alcohol that exists here where whatever the occasion, alcohol is the answer. The enforcement of the legislation is hugely important, but the legislation and the power is there to ensure that pubs can be closed. Pubs and off-licences have been closed&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform introduced very strong legislation to ensure that action can be taken at that level. It will take a great deal more than that, however. It will take a change of attitude among parents who accept that under age drinking is the lesser of two evils given that their children could be on drugs and who do not acknowledge that it is the serious problem it is. It is leading to much of the aggressive behaviour we are seeing on our streets.</P>
      <P>With regard to children who are out of control, the Garda has been expanded. At the end of the year there will be 1,200 more gardaí on the streets than there were when the lifetime of this Government began and 2,000 more are promised to ensure that the Garda will be in the community to enforce the legislation. I fully accept that there are children who need to be locked up for their own protection and for the protection of society, but detention has to be a last resort, which is the principle set out in the Children Act. The number of diversionary programmes which have been running hand in hand with the juvenile justice system has been increased from 12 to 64 to cater for much greater numbers of young people. Deputy Shortall criticised the report on early school leavers which was published yesterday and which acknowledges the progress that has been made and that there are now 6,500 young people in youthreach projects. The report also acknowledges the problems that exist, but says the vast majority of the recommendations made in 1997 have been introduced.</P>

      <P>In 1997 the Government was committed to implementing the recommendations and it did. They have worked in so far as they were meant to and there were other things which were not included in the recommendations of the 1997 report which have also worked. Deputy Durkan referred to resource teachers and special needs assistants of whom there are now 1,500 of <Col N="873" /> the former in the system and 3,000 of the latter working with young people and small children to ensure that they get a break in education. We all acknowledge that by giving it to them early they will get the break later on. The disadvantage schemes have been extended to ensure that giving children an even break ensures that it is not just schools that get funding, but any child who qualifies under the disadvantage system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that real progress has been made, but that we are coming from very far behind. We are coming from a time and a culture in which children's rights were not recognised and in which children did not have a voice. If a family had problems, nobody would interfere, protect the children or work with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude has now changed and there is a great deal more to do. I am the first to acknowledge that, but others should acknowledge, as most of the voluntary organisations have, that a huge amount of progress has been made. It has been made with regard to family support, legislative protection and foster and residential care and the presentation of this Bill means further progress is made with the introduction of the Ombudsman for Children.</P>
      <P>The rights of children were not considered before, and Deputy Fitzgerald mentioned earlier that she could see a day when we will have a constitutional referendum on the matter. I hope that happens. The thinking of the people would not yet allow such a referendum to pass, but we are getting to that stage. It will take another few years of multi-disciplinary work and of everybody working together. For some time I have been advocating that people at all levels respect the roles of different professions, groups and organisations. Where there is a shortage of social workers, a real contribution can be made by family workers, youth workers, drugs counsellors, teachers and other professionals working together to identify children in need and to work with their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are committed to ensuring that we build on the investment, legislation, progress, standards and strategies set out over the past five years. We are also committed to ensuring that where resources are given to statutory bodies such as the health boards, they are used to most effectively benefit the children whose needs have to be addressed. Deputy Shortall is a very active member of her local health board and as a former chairman knows exactly what the boards can and should do. The Ombudsman for Children is a further step towards giving children a voice. As an independent officer backed by these Houses and appointed by the President, the ombudsman <Col N="874" /> will have a crucial role in ensuring that wrongs are righted and failures are addressed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Currie raised the matter of the type of person who will be appointed to this crucially important position. We have to ensure that the calibre of the Ombudsman for Children is such that he or she will garner respect and authority, as well as being able to implement decisions and demand a response. He or she will have to be able to deal with public and voluntary bodies, to work with Government and against it and, more particularly, be able to deal with children, to listen to them, understand them and work to implement their views. On top of being able to fulfil the role, the Ombudsman for Children will have to be someone who cares and believes that children matter, like every Member of the House &ndash; certainly those who spoke today. Much is done for them, but there is an awful lot more to do to ensure that they get the protection and quality of life we want for them.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us is the Road Traffic (Joyriding) Bill, 2002. It is entitled: &ldquo;An Act to provide for the offences of supplying or offering to supply a vehicle to an under-age driver and of organising, directing or participation in the unlawful taking of a mechanically propelled vehicle for the purposes of dangerous driving in a public place, for that purpose to extend the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 2002, and to provide for related matters.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My great predecessor in this House, former Deputy and Minister Conor Cruise O'Brien, who represented Dublin North East, was an outstanding historian and distinguished political philosopher. A common thread which runs through his books is that of political responsibility. O'Brien believes, as enunciated in his life's writings, that at the end of the day people who exercise Executive power must take responsibility for their words, actions and inaction. That central concept is a very valuable political ideal. When applied to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, it shows the Minister is clearly found wanting. The Labour Party introduced this Bill two and a quarter years ago on a February or March night. We requested the <Col N="875" /> Minister to consider urgently the issues with which the Bill was concerned, including possible remedies and, if necessary, to consider, in whatever way he saw fit, amending the Bill. I raised these issues on a number of occasions with the Minister face to face and by way of letters and Adjournment debates. It seemed he would take responsibility for the incredible grief, carnage and suffering caused by car-related crime and that he would seek to take a major initiative to cope with it. Our Bill, which he may have amended, would have formed the first plank of that initiative. However, the Minister is now leaving office and he has not taken this responsibility. He has failed in a key element of his duty as a political leader.</P>
    <P>This is the 31st occasion in this Chamber on which I have raised the issue of car theft and joyriding crime. I raised it on many occasions on the Order of Business when the Taoiseach either mumbled replies or simply refused to answer. I raised it during many Adjournment debates, including on 11 November 1999 when I pointed out the urgent need to provide substantial resources for youth education, sport and leisure and to support the anti-joyriding task force in Dublin North East, etc. I received a couple of replies from the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern. I wrote to the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Byrne, dating back two and a half or three years ago. As Labour Party spokesperson on social, community and family affairs, I beseeched him to work with the Minister on perhaps bringing forward a programme. I am aware that he and many senior gardaí have been very supportive of the Labour Party's efforts in this regard over the years.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, on 3 February 2000, as follows:</P>
    <P>Dear John,</P>
    <P>You will remember that on about a dozen occasions in this present Dáil I have raised the persistent and very dangerous crime of so-called joyriding with An Taoiseach and yourself in Dáil Éireann. Following these interventions and brief discussions with you, an Anti-Joyriding Task Force was established on the northside of Dublin. The Task Force, ably assisted by Inspector Seamus Kane of Coolock Gardaí and local residents, have suggested a programme of urgently needed actions to end the joyriding menace once and for all.</P>
    <P>The letter stated that in the west and south sides of Dublin, north Cork city and Limerick city there was also this modern urban plague. I outlined a number of measures, including a programme of education, particularly the attempt to retain in school for as long as possible young people in the most disadvantaged areas. I outlined the consideration of a specific car mechanic and driving educational course, of which there were one or two examples in Dublin city and elsewhere, the urgent provision of a comprehensive youth service, particularly in the most disadvan<Col N="876" /> tages parishes, and the urgent provision of local sports facilities. I instanced a number of football clubs and Gaelic clubs which up to then had not received substantial funding.</P>
    <P>I outlined the urgently needed support for existing community and social centres, which do such a brilliant job but are very under-resourced, and additional resources for gardaí in the areas of joyriding crime. I referred specifically to an anti-joyriding specialist Garda task force to deal with the measure along the lines of other serious activities such as drug-related crime and fraud. I mentioned the urgent necessity to pass legislation to cover gaps in the law. I suggested to the Minister where the Labour Party and its advisers felt there were significant gaps which made the work of the Garda more difficult and created more problems and suffering for people living in these communities. I suggested this would be the beginning of a comprehensive attack on the problem. Since this urban plague, as the Labour Party Leader, Deputy Quinn, referred to it, emerged in the late 1970s it has not been a simple problem. It is not a problem which needs knee-jerk solutions but one which must be worked at in a very comprehensive manner such as drug-related crime. We hope to use the legislation to spark a debate and to get the Minister to launch a programme of action which would, perhaps, have avoided the dreadful tragedy which we recently witnessed.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the northside anti-joyriding task force received funding for its first co-ordinator, Ms Breda Collins, the day after the slaughter of two gardaí. Why did it take two and a half years for this simple measure, long requested by northside communities, to take shape? The Labour Party's attempt, which has been ongoing for a long time, to find an answer to this crime culminated in a seminar held at the City Arts Centre on 14 February 2000, the prospectus for which was entitled Joyriding &ndash; Can we find a solution. That seminar was addressed by community leaders from around the country and by my party leader.</P>
    <P>Many communities at that time looked to the Labour Party to provide the spurring into action of the Government. Unfortunately, those efforts have been largely ignored by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, over the past two and a half years. In April 2000, at the culmination of our campaign, I tabled the original version of the Road Traffic (Joyriding) Bill. The Bill proposed the creation of two new offences and would have created a new offence of organising, directing or participating in the taking of a vehicle for the purposes of that vehicle being driven in a public place in a manner which is dangerous to the public. In other words, it made joyriding a specific offence. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has said many times &ndash; he may say it again tomorrow night, if there is a tomorrow for the 28th Dáil &ndash; that a provision in the 1961 Act dealing with &ldquo;unauthorised takings&rdquo;, as the <Col N="877" /> Garda refers to them, covers the area of joyriding. This activity, which has been written about extensively for the past week and a half since the tragic deaths of Garda Tighe and Garda Padden, should be identified as a specific crime and we must deal with it in a very serious manner.</P>
    <P>The Bill also aimed to deal with the problem of company cars, a major feature of the joyriding problem in many disadvantaged areas. This problem relates to youths who drive illegally. They purchase old cars for little or nothing, perhaps &euro;30 or &euro;40, and use them for joyriding. The Bill would have made it an offence to supply a vehicle to an under age person in such circumstances as to give rise to reasonable apprehension that the vehicle would be used by an under age driver in a public place. That Bill and the current Bill provides for new penalties of up to seven years in prison and for periods of disqualification from driving of up to five years.</P>
    <P>I thought on the first night of the debate on this issue two and a half years ago the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and their colleagues would adopt the Bill and make whatever changes they felt necessary in consultation with the Garda Síochána and the Attorney General. I was completely gobsmacked when it became clear on the Wednesday that they were going to oppose it. Is it not astonishing that the second most senior garda in this country has said in the past couple of days that there is no legal provision to deal with company cars. The Labour Party Bill which contained such a provision would have been a valuable addition to the Minister's legal armoury. The criminals who give, transfer or sell cars to children should be severely dealt with. They have a grave responsibility, yet the Minister has been seen, by his behaviour, to treat this problem as though insignificant.</P>
    <P>Joyriding is a complex problem. Glancing over my contribution on the previous Bill, I note I mentioned my party's reservations about calling this a joyriding Bill. I remember having a long discussion on this issue at Dublin City Council where many members from disadvantaged areas suggested we should call it death-riding or grief-riding given the carnage and despair it causes in communities. As joyriding is the name by which this activity has been known over the past couple of decades, we felt it should be identified in the title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am aware there are many aspects to finding a solution to this problem. I am disappointed the Children Bill has taken five years of development from the point at which the rainbow Government left it. We created the central ideas of the Children Bill, with care for the victim, restitution and the engagement of parental responsibility, with the creation of much needed places for children in serious trouble. Five years have passed, yet very little action has taken place. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy <Col N="878" /> O'Donoghue, has, in the dying days of this Dáil, succeeded in having that Bill passed and is now trying to implement it. Last week, I contrasted the generosity of the rainbow Government to that of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, regarding legislation in that on important legislation, such as this Bill, he defiantly refused to take action.</P>
    <P>One of the problems in early 2000 and before has been that many sections of the media do not seem to take this issue seriously. The reason is simple, it depends on where one lives. If one lives in a leafy southside retreat or in a rural idyllic location, the problems of joyriding, drug-related crime, harassment, downright mayhem and incipient civil insurrection do not bother one too much but if one lives in or near clearly disadvantaged areas the problems of youth crime are endemic, appalling and very frustrating for community leaders who, perhaps, have worked hard for 20 years or more trying to make their communities a better place in which to live.</P>
    <P>At 11 p.m. on the Thursday night before the assassination of Garda Tighe and Garda Padden while talking to my chief poster man &ndash; the kind of valuable comrades we all have at times like this &ndash; a car was driven by in an appalling and dangerous manner. It was a busy evening on a busy urban street. The No. 27 bus was travelling in both directions carrying children home from various activities. What was happening was appalling and people were scattering for their lives. This issue, until recently, has not been taken as seriously as it should have been by some sections of the media. In early 2000 a certain individual, an idiot, who wrote in <i>The Irish Times</i> berated me because I dared to ask the Labour Party to spend three hours of parliamentary time discussing this problem, as if an issue that affects urban communities and some rural areas on the edge of the city should not be addressed in this House. That attitude has made it very difficult for us to come to grips with the problem.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Labour Party, since the class of 1991, as I call them, on Dublin City Council and the three county councils have long had a very strong approach to the issue of crime and urban deprivation. Indeed, before the &ldquo;Blairites&rdquo; came up with the term, it is fair to say that my distinguished and late colleague, Pat Upton, Deputy Shortall, former Deputy Costello, Deputies Ryan, Rabbitte and Gilmore and former Deputy Byrne, who will, I hope, be back in this House shortly, and my friend and colleague, Alderman Conaghan developed a very strong programme of measures to try to move resources to our most deprived communities and address some of the residual issues. We focused on matters such as early school leaving, intensive support for youth, including sports facilities, and more localised policing. We tried to obtain that through the anti-crime committee on Dublin City Council. At the end of the day we wanted the identification, punishment and detention of people who continue to terrorise neighbourhoods whether through drugs, harassment or the misuse of vehicles.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="879" />The events of the past week and a half have obviously horrified the nation. The appalling sadness of the families of Garda Tighe and Garda Padden brought home to us the heartache this problem has caused. A couple of years ago I recalled the sorrowful list of deaths and injuries caused by car theft and car related crime. In the mid 1990s I arrived on a scene in north Coolock where two children had been mowed down. There were the frightful deaths in early 1999 of the hackney driver, Derek Hall, from Tallaght and a young DJ, Mark Bryan, a popular man from Dun Laoghaire. Many of those involved in local community development and in the Labour Party were devastated by the deaths of Richie and Christine Green in early 1999. We understand the sorrow experienced by the close relatives and friends of the two valiant gardaí in Mayo and south Dublin. One of my chief mentors when I commenced in politics and community development who encouraged me and others at every turn was Richie Green. There was mention by Fianna Fáil politicians in Dublin North Central of erecting a memorial to Richie Green. The best memorial to Richie would be to devise a multifaceted approach to deal seriously with this problem once and for all. That is the memorial Richie, whom I knew well and who was a mentor to Deputy McDowell and me, would have wanted.</P>
    <P>Under the stewardship of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, car crime has escalated. This is obvious when we consider that the figure of almost 12,000 unauthorised takings when the rainbow Government left office has now risen to almost 16,000. The Minister is refusing to publish the 2001 figures which show a serious deterioration. As I said last week, the Garda report has split crimes into two categories, serious crimes and less serious crimes. All the crimes in those lists were very serious. As I mentioned on the last occasion on which I spoke on this matter, every week our colleagues on Dublin City Council and in the three county councils have to remove dozens of cars from particular areas. In a rural lane adjacent to my constituency &ndash; I represent a tiny part of rural Dublin &ndash; a small community on the northern fringe of the city has been horrendously terrorised in recent weeks. Unfortunately we have not come to grips with it. The Minister has a special responsibility in this area and I hold him equally responsible in the terms in which my predecessor, Conor Cruise O'Brien, would have identified political responsibility.</P>
    <P>In 1996 Deputy Howlin put through the House the Waste Management Act. That clearly indicates that producers are ultimately responsible for the disposal of their products. One of the key problems in recent years has been that of scrappage and what to do with cars at the end of their life. I tried to deal with that under the company car provisions of this Bill. Along with Deputy Gilmore, my colleagues and I have been pressing <Col N="880" /> the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, for several years to introduce regulations for the safe disposal of vehicles to prevent them being used by joyriders to kill or maim. The motor industry should have a major share of the responsibility for the disposal of vehicles. Prior to every budget we are harassed by the Society of the Irish Motor Industry to grant it this and that in relation to tax breaks. SIMI has not dealt with its key responsibility nor have all the famous car companies. The Minister indicated in November that under an EU directive if they did not come forward with a scrappage system he would do something about it by April 2002. Under EU directives, Ireland is required to make these regulations. The Minster, Deputy Dempsey, told me early last year he was in discussions with the SIMI and his objective was to have an acceptable vehicle recovery scheme in place not later than autumn of that year but nothing happened. We continue to pursue the issue and hopefully there will be some significant action.</P>
    <P>I have here the picture of an appallingly damaged vehicle from Cork city's north ring road. The senior garda has indicated that Garda Brian Shanahan miraculously escaped death and was flung 30 feet into the air while trying to do his duty when one of these famous company cars came speeding towards him. We almost had a third tragedy in the space of a week. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, have evaded their political responsibility.</P>
    <P>It is no coincidence that car related crime is a major problem for the most disadvantaged areas. It has often been compared to drug related crime. It is a malign influence and is a symptom of extreme youth alienation and despair, often among kids who dropped out of the education system. In my area I noticed in recent weeks that alleged names of current miscreants are similar to the seven and eight year old tear-aways whom I remember in primary school. It was very difficult to keep them in school and the school valiantly tried to get a sin-bin with intensive teaching to hold these kids. Unfortunately, the successive Governments did not provide the resources. Journalists such as Paul Williams have made the point that some of the most serious criminals who disgraced the country in terms of drug related crime and all kinds of mayhem from the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s started as joyriding thieves. That is an important point.</P>
    <P>The other day Jim Walsh of the Combat Poverty Agency clearly showed in a brilliant analysis that the five budgets of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, were geared to the needs of the rich. The poorest 20% received under 5% of the last five budgets whereas the richest 10% got 25%. The conclusion he came to is that Ireland is among the most unequal countries in the EU with one of the highest rates of relative income poverty. That is the background condition of which <Col N="881" /> we need to be aware. That is the reason it is crucial that major resources are put into those areas.</P>
    <P>One problem behind this serious criminal activity is early school leaving. We had a discussion a few hours ago in the House on the huge cohort of children dropping out not only of secondary school but of primary school. On the same day the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, my constituency colleague, said all children would have to remain in school until they are 16 years of age. Each year there has been a continuing and massive fall-away, a growing gap in skills and growing alienation and despair.</P>
    <P>The Government has paid lip service to putting resources into disadvantaged and deprived areas. I could mention many of them, but one is the RAPID programme which was set up by the Government. It did not go through Dublin City Council, county councils or the partnership boards. It set up a whole new edifice of jobs for various people but not for people on the ground. Now senior officials in national and local government say that RAPID will not and has not been implemented because no funding was provided by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. It is against this background that we have ended up with serious crime, with car related crime being allowed to flourish. That is why the Labour Party has produced the Road Traffic (Joyriding) Bill, 2002. The Bill is the first step in a multifaceted programme. It makes joyriding a specific crime and sets out to ban the supply of company cars to under-age drivers and imposes strict penalties in terms of fines of up to &euro;32,000. As the Minister will recall from the letter from which I quoted extensively, we intended the Bill introduced in 2000 to be one of nine major initiatives that would be taken to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>I hope, on this the last or penultimate day of this Dáil, that the two Ministers to whom I referred and the Taoiseach will at long last decide to establish a multi-agency task force to tackle this problem and that they will be prepared to accept this Labour Party legislation. I commend the Bill to the House. I appeal to the Minister present and to his colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, to accept this legislation and to act on it by adopting a multi-agency approach to tackling this problem.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, did a magnificent job in the rainbow Government in putting together a raft of measures and actions to tackle drug related crime by establishing the local drugs task forces. Over the past five years we gained immensely in that area from the initiatives taken by Deputy Rabbitte when Minister of State. We need a similar initiative to address problems in areas of deprivation in particular. A start could be made in that direction tonight by the Minister accepting this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Broughan, for reintroducing this Bill tonight and I acknowledge the single-minded campaign he has run on this issue on behalf of <Col N="882" /> the Labour Party. This is a worsening violent phenomenon in our society. It is an irony, on the eve of the dissolution of the Dáil, that once again Private Members' business is given over to the phenomenon of anti-social behaviour in our society and the dreadful implications of so-called joyriding.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Broughan remarked that he was derided in some sections of the media for devoting so much Dáil time to this issue, I was very much reminded of a similar phenomenon in relation to wandering horses in the lifetime of the last Government. Some colleagues in the House, sections of the media and sections of the Civil Service thought the notion was hilarious. As Deputy Broughan said, this depends on where one lives. We failed in Government to persuade the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take that issue on board. I yield to nobody in the House in my respect for the Civil Service, but there are sections of it where if they are not the progenitor of an idea, it is automatically deemed to have no merit.</P>
      <P>We failed in Government to cause the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to bring forward legislation to deal with the scourge of wandering horses that had taken life, maimed children and caused various problems in my part of Dublin and elsewhere. Many colleagues came back from the Dublin West by-election, as a result of which Deputy Brian Lenihan was elected to the House, with a different view. It is to the eternal credit of Deputy Deenihan that he took on board the issue in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. I recall collaborating with him and the problem of wandering horses was solved.</P>
      <P>Similarly, this phenomenon could be solved if only we could persuade the people in authority of the menace it is in communities, certainly on the west side of Dublin and, from what Deputy Broughan has been saying for years, on the north side of Dublin. I meant no disrespect to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when I said last week that I genuinely believed he does not appreciate the circumstances in which communities in constituencies like mine are obliged to live with this phenomenon. People lock themselves in and are afraid to come out in the evening. They are woken in the middle of night as these young thugs drive cars at high speed through estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If nothing else comes from the terrible tragedy of the two gardaí, who made the ultimate sacrifice in seeking to protect the public, but they forced the next Government to act to curb this violent anti-social phenomenon, their sacrifice will not have been entirely in vain. It is a miracle there have not been more fatalities. Deputy Broughan adverted to some of the terrible tragedies chalked up by these young hooligans out of control. It is only surprising that more have not happened. The occurrence of this phenomenon depends on where one lives and is symptomatic of a breakdown in our society. Some of the conditions <Col N="883" /> described by householders are almost beyond imagining. People who do not live in these areas cannot imagine how much these communities are tortured by this phenomenon.</P>
    <P>There is a period of peace and then suddenly one ring leader is released from St. Patrick's or wherever and he gets a gang of four or five around him. There is no more peace in that community for the ensuing four to six months until he is put away again. We can have a discussion at a more leisurely time on the parallel diversionary and interventionist measures needed to address the social side of this problem, but in the interim steps must be taken to take the ringleaders of these young marauders out of communities. There is no other solution. It is not fair that people should be beset in their homes and besieged in their communities in that fashion.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Broughan said, early school dropout is a major contributory factor, but we have not had a school attendance regime in my part of the county for as far back as anybody can remember. That task was not appropriate to the gardaí and they did not do it. We have only recently passed legislation which has not yet been put in place to deal with that phenomenon. Many diversionary schemes have been piloted elsewhere that could be usefully implemented, but that is not being done. There are not the necessary facilities or amenities where the Minister and others live that would contribute and help to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan referred to my decision in Government to establish the local drugs task forces and to set up the young person's facilities fund which was designed to do precisely that. I pay tribute to my successor, Deputy Flood, who continued those policies to some good effect. So little has happened over such a long period. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is in the House. He visited my constituency last week to make some announcements that are welcome, but I suppose they were eroded by the fact that they were made on the eve of the general election. In one case, he announced some &euro;630,000 towards an exclusive facility which prompted a large-scale deputation to me from the same area before he got back to his home in County Meath, stating youths in the area would not be able to access the facility. I am sure he will look at this. I commend the work of my successor, Deputy Flood. In the area in which the Minister made his announcement live 25,000 to 30,000 people.</P>
    <P>Finally, after 20 years, they got the promise of a grant for a neighbourhood swimming pool. These 25,000 to 30,000 people have no Garda station, no facilities and nowhere to buy a newspaper or a pint of milk. There are no facilities in this densely populated area which is entirely dependent on corner shops which, in some cases, are under siege from young vandals who are out of control.</P>
    <P>That is the picture in large tracts of Dublin. I cannot speak for elsewhere. It is regrettable that <Col N="884" /> Deputy Broughan has had to come back to the House again on the eve of the general election because the Government failed to come back to him on the Bill when he introduced it before. It is not a big matter; there is no complex criminal law involved. If the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform had been persuaded, it would have prodded the Minister, but apparently it was not so persuaded. While repeating my admiration for its officials, none of them lives in an area tormented by this phenomenon. I plead with them that while the rest of us are out trying to hold our jobs and they are happily secure in theirs, they might devote some time to this issue. If the deaths of the two gardaí do nothing else, they might examine what some of us have been declaring as the truth for a long time: one cannot expect decent citizens housed in the areas concerned to put up with this kind of punishment and misery in their homes because of the activities of small gangs of marauding youths.</P>
    <P>One habitually cannot get a bus to large parts of my constituency because young vandals will not allow bus drivers to access these areas without risk to their personal safety. This situation is out of control in some areas and must be addressed. If nothing else happens as a result of Deputy Broughan's Bill, I hope a considered Bill will come before the House before the summer is out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The consequences of what is termed joyriding or car crime, as it has been described tonight, have been brought home to all in the most terrible fashion with the tragic deaths of two members of the Garda. Given that Garda investigations are under way, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on that incident save to pass on my sincere condolences to the families of Anthony Tighe and Michael Padden.</P>
      <P>In the wake of a tragedy, there is always the temptation to rush off to take steps &ndash; a temptation to be seen to be doing something, anything, even if it is not the right thing. In bringing this Bill before the House again the Labour Party has fallen into this seriously flawed thinking. The Bill was flawed two years ago when it came off the word processor and is even more flawed now because of changes in the law since. Tonight represents the third occasion on which the House has debated the provisions of the Bill. It was originally presented in April 2000&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and its various components, with some relatively minor changes, were also <Col N="885" /> proposed as additions to the recently passed Road Traffic Act, 2002. On both previous occasions the proposals were not agreed to and the Labour Party is well aware of the reasons.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not offer a practical advancement on the current law. Its provisions are based on presumptions that would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to substantiate and even if its enforcement was possible, it could not be used to address the major issue of the use of stolen vehicles in joyriding incidents. As has been stated before in the House, the measures contained in the Bill would not advance the fight against joyriding. Simply put, it would not provide the Garda with any additional enforceable measures to tackle the problem.</P>
      <P>The Bill is essentially the same as that proposed in 2000 and contains three substantive measures. It would provide for the introduction of a prohibition on the supply of vehicles to persons under 16 years in circumstances where there would be a reasonable belief that the vehicle would be used by that person or another in a public place. Second, it would provide that it would be an offence to organise, direct or participate in the taking of a vehicle in a public place in a manner which is dangerous to the public. Finally, it would provide for the application of a range of penalties.</P>
      <P>As has been said in the past in response to these proposals, there is no lack or deficiency in the legal powers available to address joyriding. The Garda has not sought the introduction of any new powers and the various offences that constitute joyriding are already adequately addressed under existing legislation. Charges of manslaughter, larceny, dangerous driving, unauthorised taking of or being carried in a vehicle, uninsured or drink driving may each be appropriate according to the circumstances. In addition, the Garda has power to detain vehicles driven by under age drivers.</P>
      <P>While the Labour Party proposals have essentially remained static since 2000, there has been a significant change in traffic law. The Road Traffic Act, 2002, heralds the introduction of a new approach to traffic law enforcement. While the debate in relation to that legislation has concentrated on the headline provision of the penalty points system, the Act contains a number of significant initiatives to enhance the enforcement capacity of the Garda and will apply a greater range of more focused deterrents; there is more change to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasonable assumption is that the great majority of vehicles used for joyriding are stolen or taken without authority. It has been claimed, however, that the supply and availability of what are termed &ldquo;end of life vehicles&rdquo; to young people also contribute to the phenomenon of joyriding, especially in urban areas. In this regard, as Deputy Broughan stated, my Department has been actively engaged with relevant interests with a view to developing a voluntary industry led producer responsibility initiative to comply with the <Col N="886" /> requirements of the EU directive on end-of-life vehicles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why voluntary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>While the directive is mainly concerned with the safe and environmentally sound disposal of end-of-life vehicles, it will introduce additional controls on final disposal of these cars while easing the burden on the owner.</P>
      <P>The directive provides for certificates of destruction for end-of-life vehicles. More importantly, it will ensure all end-of-life vehicles are collected, dismantled and recovered by industry at no cost to the final holder of the vehicle. This will provide an effective means of addressing the problem of the supply of such vehicles in the short to medium term. However, as indicated, I remain of the view that the question of end-of-life vehicles is but one component &ndash; a relatively small one &ndash; of the problem of car crime.</P>
      <P>Regarding the legal provisions relevant to joyriding, the taking of a mechanically propelled vehicle without the owner's consent is already an offence under section 112 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and carries substantial penalties of fines and imprisonment at the discretion of the court. An offence under the section also leads to the application of a consequential disqualifcation order. The maximum fines will be revised as a result of the Road Traffic Act, 2002, to &euro;2,500 and &euro;10,000 respectively in relation to summary and indictable convictions.</P>
      <P>The offence of dangerous driving is provided for under section 53 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as amended. A member of the Garda Síochána who suspects someone of dangerous driving can arrest that person without warrant. A person convicted of dangerous driving causing death or serious bodily harm can be liable for penal servitude of up to ten years or, at the discretion of the court, a fine of up to &euro;15,000, or both. In any other case a fine of up &euro;2,500 can be imposed or, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment for up to six months, or both. A person convicted under this section is also disqualified from driving. It is also open to the Garda Síochána to detain and impound a vehicle. The circumstances where that power can be applied include where the vehicle is being driven by an under age driver and-or where a driver has no motor insurance cover.</P>
      <P>Young people who participate in joyriding are often in the under 16 age group and are consequently prohibited from holding a driving licence under section 31 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961. Driving without a licence is an offence under section 38 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and conviction carries the penalty of a fine at the discretion of the court, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. The new Road Traffic Act, 2002, will see this fine increase to &euro;2,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person who has taken a vehicle without the owner's consent or has purchased a very old <Col N="887" /> vehicle for a very small sum is unlikely to have the required motor insurance. Under section 56 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, it is an offence to drive a vehicle in a public place without motor insurance. Conviction carries a fine or, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment for up to six months, or both. Again, the Act of 2002 increases the fine to &euro;2,500.</P>
    <P>All these offences impact directly on elements of what constitute joyriding. The Garda, which is responsible for enforcement, has not requested further powers in this area, but if it does, there will be no avoidable delay in considering such a request. The Road Traffic Act, 2002, will provide additional powers to the Garda for the enforcement of road traffic laws generally and it will further enhance the precautionary effect of Garda efforts. It is not just through the very substantial enforcement provisions that I have outlined or indeed the proposals put forward tonight for the third time by the Labour Party that the problem of joyriding can be solved.</P>
    <P>There is a need to tackle the culture that underlies this deadly practice and the social exclusion and disadvantage that seems to fuel it. The Government's record in relation to promoting social inclusion is second to none. It has reduced poverty to historically low levels and has focused programmes in place, such as RAPID, to make the further progress we all desire. Our educational system is laying the groundwork for improved self-esteem among our young people, which is a key to tackling anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>We are also specifically tackling education and there are promotion measures in the Government's road safety strategy. The headlines might point to a reduction of road deaths last year of 13% on the 1997 level and a reduction in serious injuries well in excess of the 20% target. They might also point to enormous increases in the detection and prosecution of road traffic offences. Valuable, forward looking work is being done on improving attitudes among all of us, especially our young people, on safe, responsible behaviour on our roads. In particular, special educational programmes have been launched for both primary and secondary schools, and major publicity campaigns targeting drink driving, seat belt wearing and, critically, speeding have been produced. As was pointed out in this House as long ago as April 2000, the approach this Bill promotes does not offer a feasible advancement to the current laws.</P>
    <P>Measures directed at the sale, hire or loan of vehicles to under age drivers would address only a limited number of cases and present formidable difficulties in terms of proving the supply of the vehicles and their intended use. In addition, they do not fit easily into a code of law which is focused mainly on the use of vehicles in public places. The Bill is not capable of being amended to produce workable and meaningful legislation. I therefore oppose it.</P>
    <Col N="888" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I emphasise that so-called joyriding is a complex issue which, while requiring significant inputs from the criminal justice system, can only be tackled to meaningful and lasting effect through a multifaceted and multi-agency response involving the community and relevant statutory bodies. I fully accept my responsibilities within my remit as Minister to respond to the problem from a criminal justice perspective, but this is only one piece of a much larger jigsaw. In this regard, although road traffic legislation is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I would like to say a few words on the Private Members' Bill before the House as it clearly has criminal justice dimensions.</P>
      <P>In terms of the proposal to make organising, directing or participating in the unlawful taking of a mechanically propelled vehicle for the purposes of dangerous driving in a public place a specific offence, the Garda authorities have clearly indicated that the road traffic legislation currently in place is adequate to deal with the current situation. Whatever about the Opposition, I have no intention of questioning the expertise of those with responsibility for policing on a day-to-day basis. Within the existing statutory structure, the Garda authorities, at both national and local levels, take a very proactive approach in implementing operational strategies in geographical areas that have been identified as potential hotspots for joyriding. In particular, special patrols are concentrated in such areas to deal with public order and unauthorised taking incidents.</P>
      <P>The stinger device continues to be an effective aide in this regard when used by trained personnel in appropriate circumstances. Despite some public suggestions to the contrary, these devices are carried at all times by divisional crime task force mobile patrols and by other selected district mobile units. The Garda air support unit also operates in selected areas and has played a significant role in the detection and apprehension of offenders. Nevertheless, recent tragic events have highlighted once more the terrible risks posed to innocent lives by joyriders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many cases, those responsible are young &ndash; often under 16 years of age &ndash; and there is clearly a perception that they are outside the law. There is an issue in relation to a shortage of remand accommodation for these young offenders and this has a bearing on the way in which the young offenders view the risk of losing their liberty. Last week I obtained Government approval for the provision of additional accommodation under the control of the Prisons Service &ndash; St. Patrick's Institution &ndash; for the reception of offenders under 16 years of age. This, of course, is an interim measure while the Department of Education and Science advances its plans in its area. By so doing, the courts can be guaranteed that a small number of serious young offenders, whose presence in the <Col N="889" /> community constitutes a serious threat to the rights and safety of law-abiding citizens, can, if necessary, be detained.</P>
    <P>I also indicated last week that I intend to consider submissions which may be made in relation to whether the statutory power given to the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply for a review of a sentence imposed on a conviction on indictment and which he regards as unduly lenient should be extended to sentences imposed on summary conviction. Both measures underline my commitment to meaningful and responsive criminal justice policy to the joyriding issue as and when required. Considering the proposal to provide for the offence of supplying or offering to supply a vehicle to an under age driver for the purpose of dangerous driving in a public place, I understand that this not only could impinge upon the constitutional property rights of citizens but would also make assumptions as to the proposed use of the vehicle.</P>
    <P>In other words, such an offence would be based on the assumptions that the person will drive the vehicle, that the person selling the vehicle is aware that the buyer is under age and that the seller is aware that the buyer is purchasing the vehicle with the intent of driving. These assumptions are such as to render extremely difficult practical enforcement by the Garda Síochána, and, as we all know, unenforceable law is bad law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is of the view that the issue of so-called &ldquo;company cars&rdquo; is best dealt with in the context of agreement with the Society for the Irish Motor Industry and other interested agencies on an acceptable vehicle recovery scheme. Such a voluntary, industry-led producer responsibility is not only in keeping with our requirements under the relevant European directive on end-of-life vehicles but appears to provide the most effective means of addressing the problem of the supply of such vehicles in the short to medium term. This approach also highlights, as I mentioned at the outset of my intervention, the need for an inter-agency and multi-disciplinary approach to joyriding.</P>
      <P>Again, speaking from a criminal justice perspective, I know that members of the Garda Síochána maintain close liaison with local authorities, which, of course, have a critical input into the problem in terms of estate design. Speed ramps and other control measures, such as the permanent or temporary barricading of roads, have been introduced with the agreement of local residents in affected areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These kinds of local level partnerships have proven particularly effective in, for example, the South Dublin County Council administrative area, where my Department and the Garda Síochána were involved in an inter-agency initiative on joyriding and anti-social behaviour. In Deputy <Col N="890" /> Broughan's constituency, I personally launched a research report prepared on behalf of the Priorswood task force on joyriding that sets out a proposed anti-joyriding strategy. I have made funding of &euro;127,000 available to that task force for a two-year pilot implementation of the strategy and consideration will be given to the wider applicability of the lessons learned from this pilot programme.</P>
    <P>In a similar vein, the Probation and Welfare Service funds the auto crime diversion project in Cork city, which was established in 1995 against the background of unacceptably high numbers of cars being taken without the owners' consent and invariably being found within 24 hours in an abandoned, crashed or written-off condition. The 26-week course on offer is not a soft option for joyriders but demands a stern commitment and imposes a definite structure on those involved. Broader diversionary schemes also operate in the form of a network of 64 Garda youth diversion projects for young offenders and those &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; of offending in the ten to 18 years age range. Since coming into office in 1997, I approved 52 of the 64 projects and the combined annual budget now amounts to approximately &euro;6 million.</P>
    <P>More fundamentally, the entire juvenile justice system is set to undergo profound enhancement with the introduction of the Children Act, 2001. Among many other provisions, the Act will establish the Garda juvenile diversion programme on a statutory basis as a means of dealing with the young offender who accepts responsibility for his or her criminal behaviour. The programme allows the offender to be cautioned in lieu of formal criminal justice procedures and provides for the informal supervision of the offender in the community. A conference of all relevant participants may also be convened, including the victim of the crime, to examine the young person's problems, the reasons for offending and the family support and community involvement required to divert the young offender from further criminal activity.</P>
    <P>Moreover, where police discretion in the use of cautioning is inappropriate or has failed and the matter proceeds to the children's court, provision is made for an adjournment of proceedings and the convening of a family conference in cases where the young offender accepts responsibility for his or her criminal behaviour. The family conference, organised by the Probation and Welfare Service, aims to formulate an action plan for the person, which may include an apology or reparation to the victim, participation in appropriate sporting or recreational activities, attendance at school or work or participation in other training or educational courses that do not interfere with school or work. The court remains in ultimate control of this process and if the terms of the action plan are not adhered to, charges against the young offender may be reinstated.</P>
    <P>In those cases where prosecution and conviction become unavoidable, in keeping with best international practice, the guiding principle is that detention should be an option of last resort. To <Col N="891" /> effect this, provision is made for a number of forms of community sanction, many of which are entirely new within Irish law. These non-custodial sanctions include a reprimand; a conditional release; an order that the parent or guardian exercise proper care and adequate control over the child; the payment by the child of compensation; supervision of the child's parents where wilful failure to care for or control the child is evidenced; an order that the parent or guardian pay compensation, again where wilful failure to care for or control the child is apparent; probation type community sanctions; supervision in a day centre; an order assigning the child to the care of a suitable adult or mentor, who need not necessarily be a relation; and a restriction on movement order. This new youth justice legislation, together with the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, should result in an enhanced State response to youth offending.</P>
    <P>It is important to say something about the background to this Bill. I am disheartened, to say the least, that Opposition parties who refused to support, both when in the rainbow Government and in Opposition, the practical measures which are necessary to deal with crime have not learned from their mistakes. In saying this, I want to make it clear that I fully accept that, despite the Government's successes in dealing with many aspects of serious crime &ndash; such as the drug godfathers who felt during the reign of the rainbow Government that they were above the law, armed robberies, burglaries and so on &ndash; there is understandable public concern about street violence, particularly involving young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it strange that the people in Government who cancelled the prison building programme, permitted Garda numbers to dwindle and starved the Garda of much-needed resources, who opposed legislation to deal with the problem of serious offences committed on bail, who voted against legislation that would allow persons convicted of serious offences to be subject to curfew and who voted against ten year minimum sentences for substantial drug dealers are now putting themselves forward as the parties who can deal with the crime situation. <Col N="892" /> This culminated in Deputy Noonan's assertion that he supported the philosophy of &ldquo;tough on crime &ndash; tough on the causes of crime&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan said this without any apparent recognition that the policies pursued by the rainbow coalition Government, of which he was a leading member, not only were not tough on the causes of crime, but clearly contributed to the causes of crime. The most obvious example of this was the decision of that Government to cancel the prison building programme and to allow the prisons' &ldquo;revolving doors&rdquo; to spin out of control to the extent that close to 20% of convicted prisoners were let out long before their sentences were finished and continued their lives of crime.</P>
      <P>Over the weekend, Deputy Noonan took the lead role on behalf of his party in raising concerns about crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It may well be that he felt that he should take the lead role to attempt to disown the criticisms made by his party spokesman, Deputy Shatter, of the Garda Síochána. In any event, what were his solutions to the crime problem? Deputy Noonan said there should be more gardaí on the streets late at night. The Government will have increased the number of gardaí to 12,000 this year, the highest number ever in the history of the State. Fianna Fáil, in a new Government, will increase it by a further 2,000. What is Fine Gael's policy in relation to Garda recruitment? Judging by its previous record in Government, there will not be one extra garda. All we have heard so far is the deputy leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Jim Mitchell, discussing the downsizing of the public sector.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan referred to the use of CCTV. Garda CCTV systems are now in place in Dublin, Cork and Tralee. The Government is arranging for similar such systems to be installed in 17 towns the length and breadth of this country including Bray, Dundalk, Dun Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Athlone, Clondalkin, Waterford, Tallaght, Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clonmel, Ennis, Kilkenny and Sligo. In addition, there will be a grant scheme for other communities who would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan said there is a cohort of violent young people who need to be put in custody. Why was this not recognised when the rainbow Government was in office? The reality is that, while a problem remains in relation to under-17 year olds, which the Government is addressing in both the short and medium term, Deputy Noonan's party in Opposition continued to challenge the unprecedented prison building programme that we have undertaken. Is anyone seriously expected to believe that a party which has proved so reckless about the provision of accommodation for criminals who are aged 17 years and over is to be taken seriously when it expresses concerns about secure accommodation <Col N="893" /> for under-17 year olds? It should be manifestly clear that the ideas to tackle crime which are now being put forward by Deputy Noonan as his party's policies are those being successfully pursued by this Government.</P>
    <P>In Government and in Opposition, Deputy Noonan and his party failed to support these same ideas. Deputy Noonan even came up with an idea which he tried to suggest is not being actively pursued by the Government. He is proposing the creation of night courts. An examination is taking place in relation not just to night courts, but also to weekend courts. However, Deputy Noonan did not see fit to mention a number of things. First, in the context of Operation Encounter, the Garda Commissioner has issued a direction to the effect that, to the greatest extent possible, people charged with serious public order offences should be detained and brought before the next sitting of the District Court. This is in contrast with a previous practice of releasing persons and dealing with them by way of summons.</P>
    <P>Extraordinarily, Deputy Noonan particularly failed to mention that up to a number of years ago, courts were held at night and that his colleague in Government, Deputy Owen, when Minister for Justice, introduced legislation to facilitate their abolition in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997. The then Fine Gael Minister of State at the Department of Justice, in advocating this move in the Seanad, referred to the effect of such night courts on policing levels in the community, especially at night. It is extraordinary that Deputy Noonan failed to mention that his party in Government facilitated the abolition of night courts. Neither does he seem to have considered the point that diverting gardaí to deal with night courts would significantly reduce the number of gardaí available to patrol the streets.</P>
    <P>It is clear that any fair-minded person would find it hard to avoid the conclusion that a party which singularly failed to pursue opportunities in Government to tackle crime is instead simply pursuing opportunism in Opposition. I will be glad to invite the electorate to compare the utterances of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party to the utterances and actions of members of the Government on the issue of crime. I will be glad to invite the electorate to submit the new found toughness of Fine Gael and Labour to the simple test of whether their actions over the past eight years have matched their words over the past four days. The electorate will have a clear choice between the political parties who cancelled the prison building programme and the parties who have already built 1,200 additional prison places, thereby increasing the number of prison places by more than 50%, with another 700 spaces on the way.</P>
    <P>They will have a clear choice between the political parties who permitted serious crime to soar above the 100,000 per annum level in 1995 and 1996 and the parties who have since reduced serious crime by more than 27%. They will have <Col N="894" /> a clear choice between political parties who starved the Garda of personnel and resources and parties who brought the membership of the force and its funding to an historic high. They will have a clear choice between parties who said there is nothing to be done and who did nothing and parties who said there is much to be done and did much. The electorate will have a clear choice between parties who stand for policies of ambivalent appeasement and parties who stand for, and have a proven record in, resolute action leading to crime reduction. Much has been achieved in the fight against crime. More remains to be done. I will be glad to invite the electorate to compare the record of the strong, consistent approach by the Government to tackling crime to the record of underachievement, failure and appeasement of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties, both in Government and in Opposition.</P>
    <P>Although the Private Members' Bill is well-intentioned in aspiration, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has made it clear why the Bill is flawed in terms of road traffic legislation. I have outlined why it is redundant in terms of policing and criminal justice measures. If we believed that it would help in tackling the scourge of so-called joyriding, we would support the measure. Regrettably, it will not and it would be a deception on our part to pretend otherwise. However, this does not mean that I do not welcome the fact that the legislation is before the House. I regret Deputy Broughan's misrepresentation of my position. I was particularly amused to hear recently that Deputy Rabbitte is of the view that I come from an area where I could not understand what goes on in another part of this small country. I am reminded of my warnings regarding rising crime levels in 1996, the year of the criminal.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Stanton. I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill. We are again debating the issue of juvenile crime and it is unfortunate that the Minister spent half his time going over the records of previous Governments rather than focusing on the future which is surely his job as Minister.</P>
      <P>The fact that the Labour Party has chosen to debate this small but important Bill in the last Private Members' time of this Dáil is an indication of the importance of the purpose and principle behind it. I welcome the Bill and congratulate Deputy Broughan on his stamina and determination in getting it recognised and passed by the House.</P>
      <P>Joyriding is a serious problem which sometimes has tragic and frightening consequences. The families and friends of two gardaí in Dublin have had their lives shattered by their needless deaths after being rammed by a stolen vehicle last week. A few days ago in Cork Garda Brian Shanahan was thrown 30 yards into the air after being hit by a stolen vehicle. He is still in Cork University Hospital with broken bones and severe injuries, but lucky to be alive.</P>
      <P>Legislators must respond more effectively to issues such as anti-social behaviour and joyriding. Members of the public must be protected on their estates, in their homes and on the streets. Gardaí need better protection to do their job and young people involved in this kind of activity need to be protected from themselves.</P>
      <P>Joyriding is only one symptom of the breakdown, or non-existence in many areas, of social, community or family support which, unfortunately, continues and with which successive Governments have failed to deal in a comprehensive manner. It is no coincidence that the last two motions on Private Members' time have raised the issues of juvenile crime, public disorder and social breakdown. Much of the legislation rushed through by the Government over the past fortnight has also dealt with these issues. This is primarily because of the tragic events surrounding six deaths in Dublin in the past ten days and vicious assaults in other towns and cities.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Criminal Justice (Enforcement of Public Order) Bill has still not come before the House. This may suggest that the matter has not been prioritised, despite the Minister's tough talk and the politically petty content of the second half of his contribution to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Labour Party's slogan of the last election &ndash; Tough on Crime, Tough on the <Col N="896" /> Causes of Crime &ndash; was quoted by Deputy Noonan over the weekend as a phrase which made some sense. In other words, we need a combined approach which is multifaceted. I agree with the Minister's comments in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is a need for adequate punishment for crimes and anti-social behaviour. We need consistency in sentencing and speed in terms of convictions. In the past year I have been contacted by a number of victims of assaults or those who witnessed assaults who spoke of their frustration at the length of time it takes to convict someone of an incident, even though the culprit's identify may be well known. Regardless of the Minister's comments, it is time that we introduced night or weekend courts in order that anti-social behaviour which occurs at weekends can be dealt with quickly and consistently on the following Monday morning.</P>
    <P>We need to take juveniles and non-juveniles who are a danger to the public off the streets. It is unacceptable that only 31 remand places are available for juveniles after five years of a Government which had plenty of resources. I am glad that we are trying to sort this problem out in the short-term by providing places in St. Patrick's Institution, but it is a disgrace that this kind of crisis measure is necessary at the end of a Government's term of office.</P>
    <P>Last week I cited an article which described a young offender who had 76 convictions, but who had not served a sentence. This offender was still at large and is back in court for biting a garda while being apprehended after stealing almost £40,000 from a Securicor van. This kind of situation should not be arising.</P>
    <P>We need to give gardaí the powers, equipment and protection they need to do their job properly. I have called on the Minister to meet their representatives to discuss whether gardaí are happy with their equipment to deal with incidents, particularly street violence at night, and whether there is a need for specific units which would be provided with equipment such as stab-proof vests or extendible batons. I am not an expert in equipping a police force, but there are plenty of people who are. We should, perhaps, examine this issue.</P>
    <P>We should also increase the number of gardaí on the beat. There is a misconception regarding this issue and every time it arises the Minister pounds the table and states he has provided an additional 1,200 gardaí. This may be so, but the perception is that not enough gardaí are visible on the beat at night. Fine Gael has done surveys across the country on this issue and 98% of respondents said they wanted to see more gardaí on the beat on the streets at night. Public representatives need to respond to that demand. People do not feel safe.</P>
    <P>We need to reassess the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform's balancing act between community policing and tough enforcement. I welcome the increase in Garda diversion programmes to 64, a trend which must continue. Juvenile liaison officers are under severe pressure <Col N="897" /> because of the numbers of young people with whom they have to deal and we should bring down the ratio so they have less juveniles per officer. They cannot possibly do effective work where they are dealing with too many. When we talk about equipping the Garda to deal effectively with violent incidents at night we should not use the excuse that if we get tough on juveniles community policing and the development of a positive relationship between a community and the Garda will break down. That is not a valid argument.</P>
    <P>Regarding rehabilitation for juvenile offenders, it costs approximately &euro;120,000 a year to keep a juvenile in custody. We should look at how that money is being spent and try to put more effective programmes in place to rehabilitate young people. There are other options and many of them are dealt with in the Children's Act. Unfortunately, while the Children's Act is excellent in principle it may not be possible to implement it in practice. At midnight last Sunday a social worker I know rang me out of frustration following an interview she heard with the Minister of State with responsibility for this area who said it was hoped to have all the principles of the Children's Act implemented by the end of May. That is an impossibility and if the Minister thinks it is possible she is out of touch with reality. The fact that 3,000 children are on a waiting list to get treatment from social workers sums up the problems we face in this area.</P>
    <P>We have failed to make a serious impact on early school leaving and 17% to 18% of pupils now leave school early. Unfortunately that makes life more difficult for them as regards finding suitable and satisfactory jobs. I wish to give an example from north Cork of the unacceptable way in which the education system is failing young children. At the moment no school will accept a nine year old boy who wants to go to school and his parents have to take action in the courts to try to get education for him. He is difficult to handle, cannot read and has functional problems. What future does that boy have if we cannot get him back to school? We need to answer this question. Otherwise the State will be to blame when that boy is behind the wheel of a stolen car in ten or 15 years time.</P>
    <P>We need to put serious work into supporting families and parents with their job of raising juveniles. Whether some parents realise it, having a child and raising a family brings responsibilities. That may be an unpopular line for a Government to take but it needs to be taken if we are to make progress from a family support point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with some things both Ministers have said I disagree with others. This is a small Bill and is limited in scope. It says that those who supply, or offer to supply, a vehicle to an under age driver for use in a public place should be guilty of an offence. A car is a lethal weapon. Given the damage it can do it is hard to think of anything more lethal in the hands <Col N="898" /> of the wrong person. This Bill suggests that it would be an offence for somebody to make a car available to a child, whether they sell it, lend it, hire it or turn a blind eye to them taking it away.</P>
      <P>We look for evidence of age when we sell alcohol and cigarettes but according to the Minister it is not possible to look for evidence of age when dealing with cars. Therefore the Minister is saying it is all right if someone wants to sell an old car, which is still a lethal weapon, to a child. He is saying we cannot do anything about it and we will not even try to say it is an offence. There is a rule of supply and demand. This Bill is trying, in a limited way, to address the problem. If it could stop one death on our streets would it not be worth it? If the provisions of the Bill frightened somebody who might be thinking of making a few bob by selling a car to a child would it not be worth it?</P>
      <P>Why are the Minister and his colleagues afraid to accept this Bill? They are afraid because it might give the Opposition some credit. They are not big enough to take it on board. This Bill is a matter of life and death. It might make a small difference but the Minister is not big enough to accept it. In the half of his speech that made sense &ndash; the second half was only the political mumbo jumbo that he goes on with most of the time &ndash; the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, maintained that there is a clear perception that people under 16 are outside the law. Of course they are outside the law. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, came in and quoted ten or 15 points of law that he will use to stop these under 16 years from stealing cars and killing people. These young people do not give a fig about the law, the Minister or the Garda. They do not care and there is no point in quoting the law to them. They are gone beyond the law but neither the Minister nor the Government understands that, which is scary.</P>
      <P>The sole boast of the Minister is to build more prison places to lock up more people. The problem is that these people have to be let out again. When let out they are more dangerous. Of course we should take people who are dangerous to society out of circulation but we must also find out how children reach this stage. What has gone wrong with our society that ten, 12, 15 and 16 year olds go out and steal cars and kill themselves and other citizens? This Government has failed miserably to address that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ministers' speeches are full of aspirations about what the Government is going to do. Deputy O'Donoghue went back five years and was shabby and shoddy in his attack on how a Government that was in office for two and a half years tackled a serious crime problem which had been neglected by Fianna Fáil for decades. This issue is too serious to be playing politics with it. The Minister should be ashamed to come in and spend half his speech attacking the Opposition <Col N="899" /> which is raising a serious issue about which our citizens are concerned.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to speak of this matter on the Adjournment. It was with regret that the town of Kells learned that Complex Tooling &amp; Moulding Limited would cease operations at its Kells facility at the end of June. The company, formerly known as Southborough International Limited, has been engaged in the manufacture and assembly of custom-built precision sheet metal enclosures for the information technology and electronics industries in Kells for the past 26 years. Owing to the significant economic downturn and fall in demand within this industrial sector and migration to the more cost-effective regions of the world, the board of directors of Complex Tooling &amp; Moulding Limited has announced that the company will cease its Kells operations on 30 June 2002. This is bad news for the town of Kells. The company made a considerable contribution to the local economy. Employment peaked there in 1998 with more than 270 employees. Currently the factory employs a work force of 50.</P>
      <P>This company operated from a top-class, modern facility and I am confident that other industries will find it attractive. I am appealing to the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and to the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to act immediately to try to find an alternative enterprise for this facility. The loss of 50 jobs in a town the size of Kells is a major blow and every effort must be made to find alternative employment for those losing their jobs. Kells is growing very fast. It is ideally located in the middle of the North-South business corridor. It has an excellent supply of development land and skilled labour. We are fortunate to have the highly successful, progressive and fully-serviced Lloyd business park on the Cavan Road. It was here that Smurfit Press set up its printing operation last year and I am confident that further employment will be found here soon. In the meantime no stone must be left unturned in finding replacement employment for the workers who will be losing their jobs in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, his officials and all the different agencies for meeting with representatives from this company over the last 12 months when it found itself in difficulty. I could not thank him half enough for his courtesy towards those people and the effort he has put in to try to find not only a replacement but a company to go in with this one. Unfortunately, that was not forthcoming. As we come to <Col N="900" /> the end of this Dáil term, I also thank Deputy Treacy personally for meeting all the people in difficulties that I have brought here to the Dáil over the last number of years. He was always available to meet those people. I hope he will be back here in the same capacity or in some other ministerial capacity in the next Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Brady for raising this important matter. I fully share his personal concern and disappointment about the recent decision by CTM Southborough Limited to cease production at its metal fabrication facility in Kells with the loss of 50 jobs. The company has stated that the closure is due to the significant economic downturn and fall in demand within its industrial sector and the migration of production to lower cost regions of the world. The company will cease operations by 30 June 2002. CTM Southborough Limited employs 50 people in a metal fabrication facility in Kells, County Meath. It was purchased in 1998 by Complex Tooling &amp; Moulding Incorporated of Boulder, Colorado, a plastics speciality company to the electronics industry.</P>
      <P>There were major plans for the Kells facility, including the installation of plastic injection moulding equipment, to enable Kells to supply integrated components to the electronics industry in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe. The investment never materialised and CTM was left to fend for itself outside the core business of its parent, which was plastics. It is understood that CTM's parent company is also in a tight financial position and cannot provide any financial or other support to its Irish subsidiary. A number of CTM's largest customers in Ireland previously reassessed their global position and signalled their intention to deal only with suppliers who could supply integrated components on a global basis. CTM was not a global supplier and consequently a significant proportion of its business was lost. IDA Ireland has advised that over the past two years the strategy of the major own-equipment manufacturers such as large computer manufacturers has been to obtain their metal and plastics products from global suppliers at the lowest possible cost. Suppliers in China and the Far East can supply globally at a much lower cost than Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past few years, every effort has been made by both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to introduce new business to this company. Potential investors in related activities were introduced to the company to establish interest in on outright purchase or joint venture basis. Unfortunately, none of these initiatives resulted in new or additional business for this company. In reaction to the closure announcement FÁS representatives met with the company on 2 April 2002 to discuss the support FÁS could offer the employees. Guidance interviews then took place on 17 April for all employees interested in availing of FÁS services such as skills analysis, jobs <Col N="901" /> placement, guidance interviews and suitable training courses. I understand that 30 employees have requested assistance from FÁS.</P>
    <P>FÁS has also advised that another company in the area is seeking to recruit 25 staff and they will be meeting with this company to see if it would be possible to facilitate some of the former employees of CTM. I understand also that the company prepared a profile of the Kells facility and a profile of its staff in July 2001. Subsequently, IDA Ireland forwarded a copy of the profile to all of its overseas offices, who in turn sent the proposal to potential investors on the IDA database. However, the latter months of 2001, particularly since September, have seen a slowdown in business activity, especially within the information and communications technology sector and no new business emerged for the Kells operation. The facility continues to be marketed by IDA Ireland.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of positive developments in County Meath in recent times, for example, the announcement in October 2000 by Europ Assistance of the expansion of its customer assistance centre in Navan. The company currently employs 100 people and the expansion will lead to the employment of an additional 140 people by the end of 2005. Welch Allyn Medical Devices has doubled its work force to 50 people over the past two years and has also broadened its activities in Navan to include higher value customer support and product development work while maintaining the core manufacturing element of the business. The company relocated to a new facility in the IDA business park in Navan in 2001. In addition, IDA Ireland is continuing to develop the Navan business park. The IDA has reached agreement with local property developers to refurbish Athlumney House in the business park and to provide a total of 29,000 sq. ft. of office space.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland recognises the essential need for balanced regional economic development and its regional structure reflects its commitment to deliver a proactive response to regional needs. The mid-east office of Enterprise Ireland ensures that the special needs of businesses are addressed by regionally based development advisers who provide a proactive approach to meeting client needs. In adopting this approach, Enterprise Ireland is putting increased effort into and emphasis on assisting businesses to improve and sustain their competitiveness, utilising the considerable expertise of its development advisers who work directly with the client companies.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is also working with its client companies and other key players in the region to implement its regional development strategy in County Meath. This includes developing the competitiveness and export potential of existing businesses, enhancing the operating environment for business by developing closer links between the third level sector and indigenous industry and by working <Col N="902" /> with key players to address the telecommunications and other infrastructural needs of companies, and supporting an increased level of new high-potential start-up companies. I assure Deputy Johnny Brady and the House that the industrial development agencies will continue to market County Meath for investment and will make every effort to secure alternative employment for the workers affected by this closure as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for the diligent way in which he has addressed this issue over the past year. It is no fault of his that we were unable to save the company, which was seriously affected by the international global downturn, despite our collective efforts.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter tonight. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, for coming to the House to listen to the case I have to make on Monaghan General Hospital. My contribution is a last-ditch effort to persuade the Minister for Health and Children to take emergency measures to save the hospital. I have tried to avoid turning this into a party political issue and I welcome the fact that the Minister, Deputy Martin, made a belated visit to the hospital and spent many hours in discussion with those concerned. His visit can be judged by its results, however, as while he met consultants and Members of this House, he has not met the commitment he made during the visit to meet other groups.</P>
      <P>Services continue to be removed from the people of Monaghan. There are no maternity, gynaecological or children's wards in the hospital and post mortems are no longer carried out there. These closures have serious effects on family life in the county, especially as many of them relate to women. The failure of the Minister for Health and Children to act has facilitated the removal of these services and it is obvious that accident and emergency services, a CAT scanner and major surgery facilities will not be put in place without his intervention. Having heard the concerns of electors, a Government candidate in the general election has demanded a written statement of the Minister's plans for the hospital, which proves that people do not believe the Minister's promises. The Progressive Democrats candidate says that the Minister's word is useless and that plans should be produced in writing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The failure to appoint an accident and emergency consultant at Monaghan General Hospital raises major question marks over the idea that trainee doctors will apply to work in the hospital's treatment rooms. The people of Monaghan have <Col N="903" /> contributed to the proposed provision of an urgently needed CAT scanner, but the machine has not been delivered. Three new consultants have been promised at the hospital: a consultant physician was promised in 1999, but the post has not been filled; a replacement for the late Archie Moore has not been found; and the split appointment of a consultant dermatologist has not taken place.</P>
    <P>Those involved in minor accidents are no longer sent to Monaghan General Hospital. A man who needed an X ray was recently sent to Drogheda, which meant that a member of his family had to collect him there. The hospitals in Drogheda and Navan are clogged up, but the X ray department in Monaghan is virtually idle, the gynaecological unit is closed and the children's ward is scarcely used, at a great cost to the State. Many individuals have told me how their lives were saved by consultants and other personnel in Monaghan.</P>
    <P>When the hospital in Dungannon, just north of the Border, was closed, the people in its vicinity were able to avail of the services of Craigavon Regional Hospital, just 20 miles down the motorway. It is 60 miles on bad roads, however, from Border areas like Moybridge, Clara or Knockatallon to Drogheda and Navan. I ask the Government, particularly the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, and the Minister, Deputy Martin, to accept responsibility for loss of life or long-term damage which may result from the lack of service provision in Monaghan General Hospital. I protest to the Government on behalf of those who have to get off work to travel long distances, rather than availing of the normal services to which they are entitled in Monaghan. It does not give me great pleasure to say that without ministerial intervention, Monaghan General Hospital has a dim future. I have tried to work in a constructive manner within the system in the hope that such an attitude would pay off, but that has not been the case.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue this evening. The supposedly imminent closure of Monaghan General Hospital has been predicted during many election campaigns over the years and we have heard reference to it again tonight. Since the 1970s, successive Fianna Fáil Ministers with responsibility in this area, including myself, have gone to Monaghan to reassure people that the hospital will remain open and will continue to deliver acute services to those in its catchment area. I call on the Minister for Health and Children to spell out how his Department and the North-Eastern Health Board intend to deliver services, to outline future developments and to alleviate the confusion that exists, some of which has been initiated by vested interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Day to day spending on the running of Monaghan General Hospital has increased from &euro;9.9 million in 1997 to &euro;19.5 million in 2002. It is <Col N="904" /> reasonable to accept that a hospital with such an increase in spending is not on the point of closure. The figures I have outlined do not take account of over £4 million which has been spent on refurbishing wards and operating theatres and providing equipment. The Minister for Health and Children recently announced that ten of the 700 extra beds he is providing in the current year will be in Monaghan. The level of activity in the hospital has increased every year, which is not a sign of imminent closure. There were only 17 day cases in 1994, but there were 2,176 last year. There are excellent medical and surgical units in the hospital and its consultants and surgeons compare favourably with the best in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister has announced that he intends to appoint a third consultant surgeon and I ask him to declare when the surgeon will be in place. The appointment of staff to support the surgeon will ensure that there will be an efficient accident and emergency service to cater for the needs of about 80% of the people of Monaghan General Hospital's catchment area. A small number of patients' serious head injuries should be treated in Beaumont Hospital, serious chest and spinal injuries are best handled in the Mater Hospital and bad fractures can be dealt with in Navan.</P>
    <P>I worked as a medical practitioner for many years, but it has been my belief since the first day I qualified that our prime focus must be on the provision of quality service at the appropriate level for those who need it. As a member of the North-Eastern Health Board for 16 years and as Minister for Health my philosophy is the same &ndash; the patient is paramount. While I know that this is the health board's responsibility, I am calling on the Minister to ensure that the board gets on with the implementation of the framework document of 1998 on the provision and development of services in the north east with particular reference to Monaghan. A new midwife led maternity unit has been promised as a matter of urgency because, as Deputy Crawford said, people have long distances to travel. I know that the unit closed because there were only 300 deliveries. The unit in Dundalk, with double the number of deliveries, also closed. Deputy Crawford referred to post mortems. I ask the Minister, if the post mortem room is refurbished, whether the surgeons in Monaghan General Hospital will do post mortems as their predecessors did and not insist that they be done by a pathologist.</P>
    <P>We all have an obligation to ensure a quality service is provided. Those with the interests of the county at heart would not want to rubbish the excellent services in place in the general hospital. By all means, work and fight for new services, but always be sensitive to the danger of undermining public confidence in services that are good. We have an excellent medical and surgical service at the hospital. The appointment of the dermatologist is important because, while dermatology services are not widely needed, those who do require a dermatologist often have a serious condition that needs to be attended to. What is <Col N="905" /> important is that the dermatologist in Monaghan will cater for part of Northern Ireland. This is a significant development since part of the future of the hospital lies in expanding its catchment area to surrounding counties Tyrone and Armagh.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for the personal attention he has given to addressing the concerns of the people of County Monaghan, particularly during his visit when he gave ten hours to meeting all the different groups which wished to see him, the amount of work and personal attention he has given to the needs of the county since, and what he has announced in terms of the provision of new specialties and services. Because of the confusion &ndash; in the run-up to the general election &ndash; I hope he will spell out clearly what the future development of Monaghan General Hospital will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Crawford and O'Hanlon for the opportunity to speak to the House in relation to Monaghan General Hospital. First, I remind them that the North-Eastern Health Board is responsible for the provision of services at the hospital and that it is a matter for the board to determine service provision at the hospital in line with its commitment to the provision of a high quality, efficient and cost effective service. I met the board on numerous occasions in relation to the development of the hospital and the expansion of services there.</P>
      <P>I recently visited the hospital and met hospital management, staff, local representatives and members of the general public. I have since had further discussions with the various delegations and was happy to be in a position to allay any concerns with regard to the future development of the hospital. I took the opportunity to outline to them details of a comprehensive investment package for the hospital.</P>
      <P>Over the last three years in excess of &euro;4.064 million has been allocated to the hospital in respect of various capital projects. The main projects completed included the refurbishment of the female medical ward and a new modular theatre and an extension to a car park. In addition, a major equipment replacement programme costing almost &euro;1.27 million was undertaken throughout the hospital, which included specialist cardiology and patient monitoring equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A significant level of capital investment in the hospital is proposed in the short-term. Plans are being advanced by the North-Eastern Health Board for the development and upgrading of the high dependency unit in addition to substantial upgrading and refurbishment of ward accommodation, the development of the emergency treatment unit and the development of a midwifery led unit. The associated capital cost is of the order of &euro;7 million. I recently agreed to the selection and appointment of a design team to prepare a development control plan for the Monaghan site <Col N="906" /> and advise the board on the future development potential of the site in line with its policies.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies will be aware, on 16 January this year I announced the immediate commissioning process for an additional 709 acute hospital beds in public hospitals nationwide at a cost of &euro;65 million in the current year. We asked all the health boards to come forward with proposals on how many beds they could provide in the short-term. This is the first phase in the provision of the additional 3,000 acute hospital beds by 2011. Of the additional 709 public hospital beds, 38 will be provided in the North-Eastern Health Board region with ten of these being provided in Monaghan General Hospital. All the additional bed capacity at the hospital will be designated for public patients and allow the hospital to significantly increase activity levels for its public patients.</P>
    <P>Revenue funding to the North-Eastern Health Board has increased steadily in recent years as follows: in 2000, £226.806 million; in 2001, £289.122 million, and in the current year this figure increased to &euro;450.053 million or £354.446 million. This has enabled the board to enhance service provision at the hospital through the appointment of additional consultant and non-consultant medical staff. Examples include the development of new consultant led services in dermatology and geriatric medicine. In this regard, the Department has recently issued formal approval to the board for the filling of two consultant posts in order to facilitate these developments. Approval has also recently issued to the board for the recruitment of a permanent replacement consultant surgeon post which had previously been filled in a temporary capacity. Additional medical support staff will also be recruited to support this post. In addition, approval has also issued for a replacement consultant anaesthetist post with a commitment to the hospital, which will support service developments at the hospital. With regard to maternity and gynaecology services, in-patient treatment ceased at the hospital at the end of 2001. Services continue to be available for out-patient and day services at the site. Out-patient and community paediatric services will continue to be provided, while in-patient paediatric services will be provided in Cavan and Drogheda for the region.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the proposed development of additional consultant led services, with the provision of additional bed capacity and the proposed significant level of capital investment, reflects our commitment to the provision and development of acute hospital services to the catchment area population served by Monaghan General Hospital. I again thank the Deputies for allowing me the opportunity to clarify the position in relation to service provision at the hospital and say that some of the statements made about its future were exaggerated. I have no doubt it has a strong future. We are providing and delivering on new services for it. When I met the medical board in recent months, continuation of <Col N="907" /> surgery, emergency medicine and other services were key issues. With the additional consultant appointments and junior doctors, the initial points made by the board have been met. I will continue to work with all concerned to oversee the ongoing expansion and development of the hospital.</P>

      <P>Carlow is an expanding town, one of the five fastest growing towns, according to a recent survey by the Irish engineers' association. It has an institute of technology, five excellent second level schools, the same number of primary schools, top class sports facilities and a railway station. Our Gaelic teams can take their place among the best while the rugby club was promoted to division one this year. While all this is marvellous, we cannot assure visitors to the town that they will have access to top class hospital facilities. Why is it being left behind? This is a major bone of contention. During the general election the people of the town will be demanding the provision of a general hospital. I am realistic enough to know, however, that this will not happen, although private enterprise may provide the badly needed hospital.</P>
      <P>I draw attention to the fact that in 1996, before the Government came to power, a ten bed extension was approved by the health board for the hospital in the town, which has only 22 beds. The Minister has ignored the town and we have no Minister of our own. However, there are Ministers from Cork and Mayo. What is wrong? After six years the building of ten extra beds at Carlow District Hospital has not commenced. The beds were supposed to have been commissioned at the end of 2002, yet building has not even begun. The Minister will probably give me a promise but this is my swansong. This is probably the last time I will grace the House and ní bheidh mo leithéid ann arís. Humility is my second name.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to announce a date so that I can go back to the people of Carlow and say while the Government ignored them for six years and did not think they existed, the ten bed expansion will commence so that my successor will not have to pursue this issue. I ask the Minister for a date for the implementation of this promise made six years ago.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. A total of &euro;2.54 billion, £2 billion, at 2000 prices, has been made available by the Government for investment in the health services under the national development plan. The purpose of the plan will be to create an infrastructure that will bring significant and tangible advances in <Col N="908" /> delivering a more patient-centred and accessible service. There is a commitment from the Government to shift the balance of capital investment towards the non-hospital sector so that NDP funding is evenly divided between the hospital and non-hospital areas by the end of 2006.</P>
      <P>In the case of services for older people it is proposed to provide a greatly improved physical environment to ensure a high quality and client-centred service. Approximately &euro;254 million, £200 million, was indicated in 2000 for the capital development of services for older people over the period of the plan. A broad range of facilities will be provided, replaced or upgraded as a result including assessment and rehabilitation and ambulatory care facilities, community hospitals and nursing units, convalescent and respite beds, day care centres and services for the elderly and mentally infirm.</P>

      <P>The provision of health services in County Carlow is the responsibility of the South-Eastern Health Board. Under the National Development Plan 2001-2006 the health board was advised in early 2000 of indicative funding of &euro;18.79 million, £14.801 million, for the capital development of services for older people. It is a matter for the board to prioritise developments in line with the funding provided under the plan.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the South-Eastern Health Board that the need for a ten bed extension to Carlow District Hospital was identified in the Carlow Plan 1996 and was subsequently included by the board in its proposals for the NDP. Individual projects are subject to the normal approval process in relation to funding, technical and other requirements governing the approval of capital projects. My Department has recently received a number of technical reports relating to this proposed capital development. These reports are under active consideration and my Department will be contacting the board in the near future in regard to progressing the project.</P>
      <P>It was only after the NDP was formulated and funding was made available under it that my Department received significant capital investment moneys. That is one of the major benefits of the plan and it will enable the ten bed unit in Carlow to be built.</P>
      <P>I wish the Deputy an enjoyable retirement. He is a man of great decency and courtesy. I know he does not mean it when he says I have ignored Carlow because I have been there on a number of occasions in my current role and in my previous role in the Department of Education and Science. I will give this issue personal attention. I thank him very much.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their Ansbacher review team has been carrying out detailed investigations since October 1999. The investigation has essentially two elements: there are Ansbacher type arrangements and there are other cases involving offshore funds and deposits.</P>
      <P>Revenue has advised that the review team has inquired into 221 cases to date. This total consists of 121 cases named by the authorised officer and 100 similar cases subsequently discovered by Revenue. A total of 190 cases are under active investigation. Investigations have not yet commenced in the remaining 26 because of insufficient identity information, apparent non-residency or the 1993 amnesty being claimed. The investigation is now concluded in five cases. The investigation includes examining the tax position of disclosed entities and accumulating and assembling information on other connected entities. The number of connected entities in relation to core cases under investigation is now nearly 700.</P>
      <P>Revenue is making extensive use of its legislative powers to seek books, records, documents and information in the cases being investigated. Where appropriate, prosecutions will be considered but these will depend on the level of evidence available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>At budget time, the forecast for the 2002 Exchequer balance was for a surplus of &euro;170 million. This estimate remains unchanged. Forecasts for the public finances are predicated on the level of activity in the economy. On budget day, an increase of 3.9% in gross domestic product in 2002 was forecast. Nothing which has occurred so far would lead me to change this view, which I feel is reasonable given the current economic climate.</P>
      <P>The end-March Exchequer returns showed a surplus of &euro;608 million during the first quarter of 2002. This compares to a surplus of &euro;1,457 million for the same period in 2001 and, as I have already stated, a surplus of &euro;170 million budgeted for 2002 as a whole.</P>
      <P>The increase in tax receipts in 2002 over 2001 was forecast at budget time to be 8.6%. The end-March Exchequer returns showed tax receipts in the first quarter at &euro;6.217 billion which is 20.5% of the budget day target. Year-on-year tax receipts, in the first quarter of this year, were 2.8% lower than the first quarter of 2001. However, it is important that this should be considered in the context of the budget day changes which will boost tax receipts later in the year. The standard rate of VAT will increase from 20% to 21% in March of this year and the impact of this increase should be evident from the May receipts onwards. The change in the corporation tax payment dates, which is estimated to yield almost &euro;800 million this year, will increase receipts from June onwards.</P>
      <P>As with tax receipts, it is difficult to draw conclusions for the year from one quarter's expenditure. Net voted spending in the first quarter was &euro;6.102 billion compared to &euro;5.210 billion in 2001 &ndash; an increase of 17.1%. This compares to a figure of 14.4% in the Revised Estimates Volume published recently. The rate of increase year-on-year dropped from 22.1% at end-January to 17.1% at end-March. Year-on-year spending can, however, vary from month to month influenced by both spending trends in the base year of 2001 as well as in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general expectation is that the economy is recovering and that this should be reflected in tax revenues over the remainder of the year. Spend<Col N="911" /> ing plans by Departments are being closely monitored to ensure that these come in on target. The overall end-year Exchequer position is, therefore, still as forecast on budget day.</P>

To date 319 of these cases have been settled and 111 are still under investigation, 11 of which are for possible prosecution through the courts. The Revenue has collected &euro;35.12 million, £27.66 million, in tax, interest and penalties in respect of these cases up to now. This is made up of &euro;27.47 million, £21.63 million, in settled cases and &euro;7.65 million, £6.02 million, in respect of payments on account in cases still under investigation.</P>

      <P>The question of expanding the range of Ireland's membership of regional development banks has been under consideration by my Department for some time. Such banks are important channels for flows of international aid and finance, and membership of them gives Ireland a voice in decision making on international policies regarding these flows. In the case of the Council of Europe Development Bank, all of our EU partners, with the exception of Austria and the UK, are already members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This move is part of the continued commitment by Ireland to assist in the economic development of countries less fortunate than ourselves, as expressed at the recent United Nations Financing for Development Summit in Monterrey, Mexico. We also want to deepen the ties between Euro<Col N="912" /> pean states. While many European states, including Ireland, are relatively prosperous, not all of them are. There are pronounced financing needs in the less developed European countries and this is where the Council of Europe Development Bank can be of assistance. The bank is particularly valued by the western Balkans as well as central and eastern Europe as an important source of lending for social projects and Ireland's accession will be viewed positively by these states as a reflection of our commitment to wider European solidarity. Our joining of the Council of Europe Development Bank should also be seen as part of the very significant expansion in our overseas development assistance which has recently taken place.</P>

These accounts have been frozen by the financial institutions on the basis of an EU Council Regulation, EC No. 467/2001, dated 6 March 2001, which provides for the freezing of funds and other financial resources of the Taliban of Afghanistan. It is directly applicable in Ireland and, therefore, has the force of law here. This regulation, which has been amended by the EU Commission on eight occasions since September 2001, lists the entities and individuals whose financial resources must be targeted.

Accordingly, I have advised the Spanish Presidency of Ireland's intention to nominate a candidate to the executive board next year when the term of office of the next board member expires. I expect that there will be strong interest among member states in this vacancy and, in order to be a serious contender, Ireland must put forward a person of high calibre whose qualifications and track record are equal to the position.</P>

      <P>Since I announced the Government's intention to proceed with a new programme of decentralisation, considerable progress has been made in putting that programme together. I have, on a number of recent occasions, said that no decisions would be made in advance of the forthcoming general election. From the outset I have made the point that from the time a decision was taken and an announcement made it would be some two to three years before civil servants would begin to relocate given the need to acquire suitable accommodation as well as the time needed to select and train the staff involved. I am satisfied that, given the work done over the past two years, the new administration will be able to move quickly after the election to take a decision in relation to a new programme of decentralisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the HIPC initiative, strengthened with the development of poverty reduction strategies, is the best mechanism currently available to bring the debts of the highly indebted poor countries to a sustainable level. I have stated on several occasions that the HIPC initiative in its current form may not provide many of the eligible countries with a permanent exit from unsustainable debt, and have given my support to calls for further enhancement of the HIPC initiative, including additional funding on the part of donors, if the initiative fails to meet its stated aim. I have also publicly stated that the current concept of debt sustainability may need to be revised to take account of basic social needs, among which I would certainly include primary education.</P>
      <P>While the issue of debt relief is vitally important in the fight against global poverty it also needs to be looked at in the context of the broader international development effort. Mere transfer of resources from other aid programmes, bilateral or multilateral, to fund debt relief would have little, if any, net positive effect on poverty reduction. The challenge now, as I see it, is to mobilise resources globally to meet the UN target of 0.7% of GNP for ODA. Ireland, as the Deputy will be aware, is now making rapid progress toward this goal.</P>
      <P>Ireland has consistently advocated the importance of investing in education to alleviate poverty in a sustainable manner. Education is a priority in both our multilateral work with UN and other multilateral agencies, and in bilateral projects in our priority countries. The House will be aware that Ireland Aid is deeply committed to working with the donor community and developing countries to ensure that the millennium development goals, including &ldquo;Education For All&rdquo;, can be met. I reiterate the Government's commitment to supporting the work of our non-governmental organisations, the religious communities and the international financial institutions in the work of relieving world poverty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Inflation, as measured by annual changes in the consumer price index, CPI, was 4.8% in March. For the first quarter of the year the rate averaged 4.8% also. However, the rate of increase is projected to decelerate over the remainder of the year, partly reflecting favourable base effects associated with food prices developments. For the <Col N="915" /> year as a whole, CPI inflation is forecast to average 4.2%, before falling to the more moderate level of 2.8% next year.</P>
      <P>Higher inflation, if sustained, could be a threat to the competitiveness of our economy. Part of the reason why inflation in Ireland is currently higher than in the rest of the euro area is the strength of domestic cost pressures. It is imperative that these cost pressures are not allowed to lead to deteriorating competitiveness which would inhibit growth and prompt increased unemployment.</P>
      <P>My plans for current and capital spending in 2002 are set out in the budget and the recently published Revised Estimates. My plans are that net total current expenditure in 2002 will grow by 12% and net total capital expenditure will grow by 13%. These figures refer to both voted and non-voted spending and, therefore, include the contribution to the national pensions reserve fund and the cost of servicing the national debt.</P>
      <P>With respect to voted spending, I have provided for an increase of 14.3% in net voted current expenditure or an additional &euro;2.9 billion. This money is funding pension and other benefit increases in social welfare, additional spending on health and education services as well as improving Ireland's contribution to overseas development aid. Net voted capital is up 14.7%, or &euro;720 million, and nearly half of this will be spent by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. A further 17% of the increase is for health capital spending.</P>
      <P>Since I came into office in 1997, I, and my Government colleagues, have provided significant additional funds for key economic and social priorities and for physical infrastructure and I do not believe that my plans for public expenditure levels in 2002 constitute a danger to the economy over the next 12 months. I believe that public capital spending on infrastructure plays a key part in protecting our competitiveness. As regards current spending, I have consistently said that we have to ensure that we get value for money from our spending.</P>

      <P>Authorised Revenue officers are empowered to make an application to a judge of the High Court seeking <Col N="916" /> an order requiring financial institutions to supply names, addresses and other relevant information concerning account holders who may have held bogus non-resident deposit accounts. Such applications are made under section 908 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, as provided for by the Finance Act, 1999. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that information supplied by the financial institutions under section 908 orders is the principal basis of identifying bogus nonresident account holders who did not avail of Revenue's voluntary disclosure scheme in 2001.</P>
      <P>I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that 11 applications for orders under section 908 have been made and have been granted. When one includes institutions which have been taken over or amalgamated with other institutions, these orders seek information in respect of accounts in 15 financial institutions. Six other applications are pending. Work in preparing one other application is currently progressing.</P>
      <P>Information under a number of the court orders has recently been supplied. This information is currently being processed. More such information will become available on a phased basis. In addition, work is in progress as regards those cases which were detected in the course of the DIRT look-back audits of financial institutions in 1999 and 2000 and did not avail of the voluntary disclosure scheme in 2001.</P>
      <P>While it is clear that Revenue is facing a long programme of investigations over a number of years, the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that significant progress is being made in this new phase of the investigations. Deputies will recall that the earlier voluntary disclosure phase resulted in receipts of &euro;227 million, £179 million, for the Exchequer, in addition to the &euro;219 million, £173 million, received under the earlier look-back audits of financial institutions.</P>

      <Quest>the progress made to date in the implementation of the recently launched Civil Service gender equality policy; the steps being taken to implement the objectives of the policy within the Department of Finance and the public service generally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The new gender equality policy for the Civil Service was launched in September 2001. The policy restates the Government's commitment to gender equality in the Civil Service. All Departments are required to set strategic objectives and equality goals for increasing women's representation at all levels in the organisation. The objectives are to be included in their strategy statements. Departments must then go on to plan and implement a programme of action to deal with any obstacles to career progression for women identified in their own organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="917" />The policy also aims to tackle the gender imbalance at management level. Although women are the majority in the clerical and executive grades and in the Civil Service as a whole, there are few women in higher management. Women form 69% of staff in the lower grades, but make up only 23% at management grades.</P>
    <P>To give a definite focus to Departments' planning, the Government has set a target for the key assistant principal grade. Departments must work to ensure that, by 2005, 33% of assistant principal posts are filled by women. At present, women fill 27% of these posts. By increasing the number of women at that grade, there will be a larger number of women who can be promoted to the more senior levels.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of strategic objectives and equality goals for assistant principals and other grades in each Department's statement of strategy is a key to the achievement of gender equality in the Civil Service. Progress with the equality goals must be reported on in the same way as all the other elements in the strategy statements.</P>
    <P>Departments are setting their targets and planning how best to achieve them. For example, the Department of Finance has set targets which, over the next five years and subject to the number of vacancies arising, should see the representation of women increasing from 28% to close to 35% in the assistant principal grade and from 14% to close to 25% at the principal grade. Other Departments are adopting broadly similar strategies.</P>
    <P>To support the implementation of the policy, the equality unit in the Department of Finance is holding a series of meetings. The aim is to exchange ideas and to encourage Departments to take definite steps to push the policy forward. The first round of meetings has been held and a second round to firm up some of the ideas which have come forward will be held shortly. Following these discussions, the equality unit will prepare a short report which will be circulated to Departments. The report will make Departments aware of what the best practice is and will, where necessary, suggest what further progress needs to be made.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that the relocation of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development laboratories and the State Laboratory from Abbotstown to new facilities at Backweston, Celbridge, County Kildare will cost &euro;199.3 million, £157 million, including site works, construction costs, design team fees, VAT and inflation. This comprises &euro;78.7 million, £62 million, for the new State Laboratory and &euro;120.6 million, £95 million, for the new Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development laboratories.</P>
      <P>The Marine Institute is to be relocated to Oranmore, County Galway to a site previously occupied by Bord Iascaigh Mhara. The estimated construction cost of the new facilities in Galway is &euro;50.4 million, £39.7 million, including inflation, fees and VAT. The increase over previously estimated cost arises from the increased spatial requirements of the Marine Institute and more detailed design information being available.</P>
      <P>Following an agreement at departmental council, staff representatives are informed of the outcome of every meeting of the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee which is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, and which is responsible for overseeing the relocation of laboratory facilities from Abbotstown. In line with Government policy, no compensation or removal expenses will be paid to civil servants volunteering to relocate to Backweston and Galway. However, non-Civil Service fixed contract staff working at the Marine Institute who do not wish to move will benefit from a severance package which is being negotiated at present. The precise costs of this package will not be known until final agreement is reached.</P>

      <P>The draft Civil Service code of standards and behaviour includes provisions which are aimed at avoiding a conflict of interest where officials accept an outside appointment or consultancy engagement within 12 months following resignation or retirement from the Civil Service. The draft code was approved by Government on 21 November 2000 and referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and Public Service on 5 December 2000. Officials from my Department made a presentation to the committee on 13 March 2001.</P>
      <P>The Joint Oireachtas Committee has not yet completed its deliberations on the code. They have indicated that they wish to receive a presentation from the civil service unions before finalising their deliberations. In fact the committee is currently awaiting a response from the unions about a possible date for their presentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 20 of the draft code, senior civil servants may not take up an outside appointment or consultancy where they believe a possible conflict of interest could exist, without first getting approval from the &ldquo;appropriate authority&rdquo;. The <Col N="920" /> appropriate authority in the case of officials below assistant secretary level is the head of the Department or office. In the case of staff at or above assistant secretary level, applications must be submitted to the proposed outside appointments board. The outside appointments board, when established by the Minister for Finance, will consist of the Secretary General, public service management and development, in the Department of Finance, the Secretary General to the Government, and three other members, who will not be civil servants or former civil servants, one of whom will act as chairman. The board will set down guidelines for civil servants to assist them in deciding if they need apply for approval and will outline the detailed basis on which applications will be assessed. Applications will be considered on the basis of identifying if a clear conflict of interest exists. Approval to take up an appointment or accept a particular consultancy engagement may either be unqualified or conditions may be attached.</P>

      <P>The informal meeting of the ECOFIN Council took place between 12 and 14 April 2002 in Oviedo, Spain. As the Deputy is aware, informal meetings of the Council provide Ministers with an opportunity to engage in a general discussion on issues which will feature on the agenda of future formal Councils. It is not the practice for such meetings to have a formal agenda and there are no formal conclusions.</P>

      <P>On Saturday morning, ECOFIN Ministers were joined by the governors of the central banks to discuss the world economic situation and economic forecasts. The meeting also agreed the EU Presidency speech to the International Monetary and Financial Committee on 20 April and discussed the role of the IMF in sovereign debt restructuring and the question of EU representation in the IMF and Group of Seven. Policy issues relating to the financial collapse of Enron and supervision of financial institutions in the EU were also raised.

      <Quest>the progress made to date regarding the scheme being operated by the Office of Public Works and the Red Cross to provide humanitarian aid for those whose homes and properties were damaged in flooding on 1 February 2002.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

      <P>The Government acted very quickly to deal with the situation which arose following the severe flooding which took place in various locations around the country over 1 and 2 February 2002. On 5 February the Government <Col N="922" /> decided to put in place a scheme of humanitarian aid, to be administered by the Irish Red Cross Society, to provide assistance to those who had suffered severe hardship as a result of the flooding. Advertisements giving full details of how to apply for assistance under the scheme first appeared in the national newspapers on 7 February and radio and television adverts for the scheme were first broadcast on 8 February. The advertising campaign for the scheme continued in all media at regular intervals until the closing date for completed applications on 1 March 2002.</P>
      <P>The criteria under which people could claim relief were death, serious injury, homelessness, damage to home, loss of income and extreme hardship. It is important to bear in mind that the humanitarian aid scheme provided for relief from hardship and not full compensation for losses. All applications received under the scheme were dealt with on a strictly confidential basis in accordance with the Red Cross fundamental principle of impartiality and its proven experience and expertise in disaster relief nationally and internationally. In each area the Irish Red Cross worked closely with the community welfare officer and the local council representative.</P>
      <P>A total of 715 applications were received, 80% from the Dublin area and 20% from the rest of the country. Approximately 93% of the applications were from households and 7% from small businesses. Of the households, 81% were from the Dublin area and 19% from the rest of the country. All the applications from small businesses were from the Dublin area. All assessments have been completed except for ten which are special cases and are awaiting more information. The Red Cross has estimated the total cost of aid payments under the scheme at &euro;8.5million. Funding for the scheme was provided through the Office of Public Works' Vote 44 &ndash; Flood Relief &ndash; and transferred to the Irish Red Cross special flood relief bank account. Aid cheque payments were mailed out to the Dublin area before Easter and the cheques for the areas outside Dublin were mailed in the last two weeks.</P>
      <P>Some representations about individual amounts paid were received by the Irish Red Cross from local public representatives and residents associations. The Red Cross agreed to accept appeals from anyone who had a complaint. Some 26 appeals have been received and these are currently being reassessed. I take this opportunity to express the Government's appreciation to the Irish Red Cross and to commend them for their professionalism and speed in dealing with a very difficult and demanding situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 105 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have mentioned in replies to previous questions, the primary responsibility for managing a bank and preventing fraud lies with the management of that institution. No regulatory authority can put in place a supervisory regime to ensure that a financial institution can never be a victim of fraudulent activity from within. It is up to the management of the bank, in the first instance, to ensure that their own internal control <Col N="924" /> policies are properly complied with at subsidiary and group level.</P>
    <P>I take it the Deputy's reference to the Committee of Public Accounts relates to the contribution made by the Secretary General of my Department to the Public Accounts Committee on 19 March of this year. On that occasion the Secretary General explained that it was established international practice that host country regulators supervise local subsidiaries of internationally active banks. The home country regulator of such banks look at the group on a consolidated basis.</P>
    <P>Before an Irish bank is allowed to open a subsidiary abroad, the Central Bank requires that it operates in a jurisdiction which has a well established system of financial supervision. It would also establish a relationship with those local supervisors. Co-operation between the home and host country regulators is always a feature of such arrangements. Thus the primary supervision of overseas subsidiaries of Irish banks is carried out by local regulators in the jurisdictions in which they operate, just as the Central Bank supervises Irish subsidiaries of foreign banks. It would, therefore, be misleading to suggest that this means there is a lack of supervision of Irish banks operating abroad.</P>
    <P>The case raised at the Public Accounts Committee related to Irish banks operating in the USA, where they have been active for many years. The USA has a well developed system of financial regulation. However, the risk of unexpected financial loss cannot be eliminated even by the most advanced systems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the annual returns from the qualifying savings managers, which give the number of accounts opened by each institution at 31 December 2001, are still being processed but the indications are that the number of special savings incentive accounts opened as of 31 December 2001 is in the region of 380,000. I understand that there has been considerable activity in the market place in recent weeks in relation to the special savings incentive accounts and the indications are that the number of accounts opened by 30 April will have increased considerably by that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the cost of the scheme does not depend solely on the number of accounts but also on the amount deposited. As I have indicated before in replying to Dáil questions regarding, <i>inter alia</i>, the likely cost of the scheme, it is diffi<Col N="925" /> cult to estimate the Exchequer cost of the special savings incentive scheme because of its very nature. The size of the Exchequer contribution will depend on the eventual take-up by participants in the scheme. The cost to the Exchequer from May 2001 to end March 2002 is &euro;154 million suggesting a potential full year cost of around &euro;300 million. However, it should be noted that the figure for March included in this total is preliminary and the April figure is not yet available. The closing date for participation in the scheme is 30 April and my Department will be assessing the potential cost of the scheme in the light of the information that will be available in the middle of May.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>his proposals to reduce capital acquisition tax to the owners of caravan sites and parks accommodating mobile holiday homes which are used as summer residences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12456/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the issue of an extension of the provision of business property relief in the context of capital acquisitions tax to caravan park operators. The business relief provisions were introduced to alleviate the threat to active trading businesses and the potential threat to employment in those businesses from having to fund heavy CAT liabilities from current resources. A business consisting of the operation of a caravan park, which is passed on by way of a gift or an inheritance, is not excluded from the business relief provisions. A difficulty may, however, exist for certain caravan park operations where the business activity is predominantly one of exploiting an interest in land.</P>
      <P>I understand that Revenue has published its practice statement on the circumstances in which caravan parks qualify for the relief. The approach of the Revenue Commissioners is to look at the type of letting activity which takes place at the caravan site that is, how much of the letting relates to the provision of furnished caravans owned by the business and how much involves the letting of pitch sites. As a general guideline, where an operator's own caravans account for at least half of the total number of lettings, the caravan park is likely to qualify for business relief. Instances where the letting of pitch sites predominates will not qualify for the relief as the business primarily involves an exploitation of an interest in land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No amendment was made in the Finance Act, 2002, to extend business relief to caravan parks due to concerns that an extension would undermine the original intention of the relief. I would be concerned that this would lead to similar claims for inclusion in the relief by other persons engaged in purely passive investment. Indeed, if the type of letting involved here were to qualify <Col N="926" /> for the relief it would be difficult to deny relief to what is pure investment property such as rented land, houses and apartments, quoted shares and securities, money in the bank, etc., with a significant loss in the CAT yield.</P>
    <P>Another factor which should be borne in mind is that the current Group A threshold for transfers of property from a parent to a child is &euro;422,148. This means that a child can take property from a parent which is below this value, free of tax &ndash; provided that there were no prior benefits &ndash; and each child in a family is, individually, entitled to this threshold amount.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Revenue Commissioners are prepared to discuss the issue of caravan parks and business relief generally with caravan park owners. In addition, if there are any specific cases which the Deputy wishes to discuss, these can also be submitted to Revenue for consideration.</P>

      <P>If a merger includes a significant cross-Border element, as would appear to be the case in the event of AIB and Bank of Ireland merging, the European Commission must also be notified by the parties.

      <P>In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, CE, participation levels are gradually being reduced reflecting the falling numbers of the long-term unemployed, and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. The mainstreaming of schools services currently under way and the proposed mainstreaming of other essential services, including the health sector, will further reduce the numbers employed on the programme. Mainstreaming of CE health services will involve the phased transfer of current CE funding for such services to the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A liaison group comprising representatives of the health boards, FÁS, Department of Health and Children, and my Department, is currently giving careful consideration to the practicalities of managing the mainstreaming process and ensuring the smoothest possible transition to the new arrangements. Discussions with sponsor group representatives such as the Disability Federation of Ireland would indicate strong support in principle for mainstreaming these services in view of the potential to achieve greater security <Col N="928" /> of funding and continuity of service to the client groups. I am hopeful that the mainstreaming of CE health services can be commenced over the summer months following the discussions within the liaison group and agreement on those CE health related projects which will be included in this phase of mainstreaming.</P>
    <P>As provided for under the PPF, an overall review of active labour market programmes will be undertaken by my Department in the near future under the aegis of the PPF standing committee on the labour market.

      <P>The allocation of funding for community projects is a day-to-day matter for the relevant State agencies and bodies, and is not one in which I have a direct function. However, with regard to the agencies and bodies operating under the remit of my Department, Enterprise Ireland and FÁS, together with the city and county enterprise boards, provide support to small businesses and local community groups. The city and county enterprise boards provide various services which include financial assistance by way of capital or employment grants, equity and refundable aid. However, such assistance is only available for commercially viable projects. Decisions on eligibility for assistance are made by the boards themselves, and anyone seeking a grant or other assistance should contact their local enterprise board directly.</P>
      <P>FÁS operates a range of schemes designed to provide training or employment experience for persons wishing to enter the labour market. Some of these have a community development impact.

      <P>Under subhead F1 of its budget, my Department operates a reconciliation fund for North-South and Anglo-Irish co-operation. Its purpose is to assist organisations involved in reconciliation work and in efforts at creating better understanding between people in both parts of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain. My Department welcomes applications from all organisations which qualify for consideration under the following criteria: reconciliation through education; courses; dialogue and culture; developing and maintaining meaningful cross-border links; promoting improved Anglo-Irish relations; promoting cross-community and inter-denominational activities; promotion of tolerance and acceptance of cultural diversity; academic research aimed at promoting reconciliation; and contribution to political reconciliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="932" />All applications are considered by an interdepartmental advisory committee, which then makes its recommendations to me. The decisions are reached on the basis of the eligibility criteria outlined above. Other factors taken into account are the level of funding available each year and the number and quality of applications submitted. The overriding aim is to ensure as widespread and equitable distribution of the fund as possible based on the merits of the individual proposals. Organisations may apply to the Fund at the following address: Reconciliation Fund, Anglo-Irish Division, Department of Foreign Affairs, 80 St. Stephen's Green, Dublin 2.</P>

      <Quest>if the UN special court has the power and resources to deal with suspected human rights violations dating back to the legacy of the conflict in Sierra Leone; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12581/02]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my belief that the Sierra Leone special court will have both the power and the necessary financial, staffing and other resources to deal with the most serious violations of international humanitarian law dating back to 30 November 1996, the agreed date of commencement of its temporal jurisdiction. The UN Secretary General, the Sierra Leone Government and interested UN member states, including Ireland, have invested considerable effort and resources ensuring that the Sierra Leone special court will be able to carry out its mandate effectively.</P>
      <P>In a letter to the President of the UN Security Council dated 26 December 2001, the UN Secretary General authorised the commencement of the operation of the special court for Sierra Leone, despite a shortfall in funding. Ireland attaches great importance to the special court, which is intended to ensure that there is no impunity for those most responsible for violations of international humanitarian law in Sierra Leone. We have pledged a total of &euro;635,000 towards the costs of the special court over a three year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A planning mission comprising experts in all areas of the court's operation visited Sierra Leone from 7 to 19 January 2002 to discuss with the Sierra Leonean Government, non-governmental organisations and other bodies the practical arrangements for the establishment and operation of the court, including, <i>inter alia</i>, the question of premises, the provision of local personnel and services, and the launching of the investigative and prosecutorial processes. The planning mission concluded that despite the best efforts of those concerned, the resources required on the ground would either be in short supply or non-existent. It has, therefore, been decided that UNAMSIL, the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone, will provide logistical support and support <Col N="933" /> in the fields of personnel administration, finance, communication, transport and procurement to the operation of the special court on a cost reimbursement basis.</P>
    <P>An agreement between the UN and the Government of Sierra Leone on the establishment of the special court was signed on 16 January during the planning mission visit to Sierra Leone. The agreement states that the special court will focus on &ldquo;persons who bear the greatest responsibility for serious violations of international humanitarian law and Sierra Leonean law committed in the territory of Sierra Leone since 30 November 1996&rdquo;. The process of appointing a prosecutor, a registrar, judges and other personnel for the special court is at an advanced stage and we expect the UN Secretary General to announce the appointment of the prosecutor and registrar today.</P>
    <P>The report of the planning mission was submitted by the Secretary General to the Security Council in early March. This report also examines the complementary but separate roles of the special court and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission provided for under the 1999 Lomé peace accord and established by the Sierra Leone Truth and Reconciliation Act, 2000. The establishment of both a special court and a Truth and Reconciliation Commission is a reflection of the need to ensure a minimum threshold of accountability for the most serious human rights violations committed during the civil war.</P>
    <P>In summary, while the special court has not yet started to prosecute any cases, Ireland considers that it has the necessary mandate to try those most responsible for grave human rights violations in Sierra Leone since November 1996. Ireland has played its part in relation to the funding of the special court and is a member of the group of interested states for the special court. It would be my hope that other UN member states will respond generously to the Secretary General's request for additional funding.</P>

      <P>Details of schemes, operated by my Department, which provide funding for community based projects are outlined below.</P>
      <P>I launched the second programme of the community application of information technology, CAIT, initiative on 28 February 2002. The purpose of the CAIT initiative is to provide access for all citizens to the new information and communications technologies, such as the Internet. The Information Society Commission has identified a number of social groups who are unfamiliar with, or who do not use the new technologies. The CAIT initiative provides funding to primarily community and voluntary organisations to undertake projects that will encourage these groups to use and become familiar with the new technologies in their everyday lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to &euro;3 million is available to fund the CAIT initiative in 2002. Applications for funding will be accepted until all of this funding has been allocated. Project proposals received within a calendar month will be assessed together by an inde<Col N="935" /> pendent assessment team at the end of that month and the results will be communicated to applicants as soon as possible. Projects will be funded over the period of 1 March 2002 to 30 November 2002 and each project can be funded from &euro;1,500 up to a maximum of &euro;127,000. Further information on the application process can be obtained at http://www.cait.ie or by contacting the communications (development) division at 01-604 1018.</P>
    <P>The process of selecting the successful community transport groups for funding under the rural transport initiative, which was the subject of a nationwide call for proposals, has been completed by Area Development Management, ADM, which is administering it on behalf of my Department. Earlier this year I announced the names of the 33 successful applicants from around the country. Subject to completion of the necessary contractual arrangements with ADM, eight of these groups will shortly commence transport operations in their areas while the other 25 funded groups will begin the pre-development phase of the initiative. Those applicants who successfully complete the pre-development phase may subsequently apply for operational funding.</P>

      <P>Under the e-commerce measure of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, 31 submissions were received under the second call for proposals by the deadline of 19 October 2002. These submissions were independently evaluated and the results of evaluation were finalised at the beginning of this year. On foot of the evaluation a number of local authorities have been asked to enter procurement to establish firm prices for their proposals. Once procurement is completed and subject to satisfactory pricing, contracts will be offered for these projects. It is anticipated that this will take place over the next two months. These proposals involve the construction of metro area fibre optic networks in 19 towns around the country.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Government strategy which I announced on 8 March last a second phase of 48 additional towns will be pursued through a public private partnership model. On 22 March 2002 I met with the county managers from counties Cavan, Monaghan and Louth to discuss their inclusion in phase one of the programme. Negotiations are continuing and I am confident that these counties will be included in phase one.</P>

      <P>No area aid application was received in the Department from the person named for 2000. Therefore, no area aid based payments could be made to him in 2000. In <Col N="939" /> regard to the 2001 area aid scheme, his application was fully processed with an area determined for payment purposes of 27.23 hectares.</P>
      <P>The animal based headage schemes were replaced in 2001 by the area based compensatory allowance scheme. A condition of the new scheme is that applicants must meet a minimum stocking level of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare, but according to my Department's records, the stocking density of the holding does not meet the minimum stocking density. My Department will be in contact with the person named shortly with a view to establishing the type of farming activity being pursued. A decision on entitlement to area based compensatory allowance will then be made.</P>

      <P>The 2000 area aid application of the person named was fully processed with an area determined for payment purposes of 112.2 hectares. The father of the person named who was the registered owner of the property in this case died intestate in 1997 and the herd number was transferred to the person named. In May 2000, the person named died without making a will. Contact was made with Castlebar DVO to have the herd number changed and as a result of investigations it came to light that there was a family dispute ongoing. The matter was further investigated by the DLO and it transpired that some payable orders which had issued to the deceased had been cashed. It was ascertained that these had been cashed to cover funeral expenses. Administration has now been granted by the High Court to the mother of the person named.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issuing of the outstanding payable order in respect of the 2000 ewe premium scheme, final instalment, is being arranged. No area aid application was received in the Department for 2001 <Col N="940" /> under the herd number of either the person named or the person to whom his herd number was transferred upon his death. Therefore, no area based payments could be made for 2001.</P>

      <P>All new scheme applications are subject to a series of administrative and technical checks by my Department. A proportion are subject to detailed audit, including a more in-depth examination of the agri-environmental plan. Where new applications are found to be invalid, both the plan and the application are rejected and returned to the applicant. The planner is notified that the application is rejected.</P>
      <P>In addition, the agri-environmental plans of a proportion of existing scheme participants are selected for audit each year. If a plan is found to be invalid or deficient, my Department will take appropriate action depending on the nature of the problem uncovered. Usually this will mean requesting an amended plan to address deficiencies. In a small number of cases, however, participants are found to have been ineligible and it is necessary to terminate their REPS contracts and recover all payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an agri-environmental plan, either of a new applicant or an existing participant, is found <Col N="941" /> to contain serious deficiencies or where major eligibility problems are found to exist, my Department may impose sanctions on the planner and/or planning agency who prepared the plan. Such sanctions may take the form of a formal warning or in certain circumstances may involve the suspension of the planner or planning agency from the Department's approved list. Examples of deficiencies which may lead to the imposition of a warning or suspension have been published by my Department in conjunction with the REPS 2000 documentation. Currently, more than 100 planners have received warning letters and a small number face suspension.</P>
    <P>Due to the manner in which the proceedings of the REPS appeals committee are recorded, it is not possible in the time available to determine the number of instances where the committee has reduced or waived penalties because of planning errors. The committee considers each case on its own merits and takes all relevant facts, including planning errors, into account in reaching its decisions.</P>
    <P>My Department has approved more than 700 planners to prepare REPS plans. The great majority of planners consistently produce work of a high standard. My Department, in consultation with Teagasc and the Agricultural Consultants' Association, which represents private planners, is engaged in an ongoing process of consultation to clarify and explain the requirements of the scheme so as to minimise the number of cases in which difficulties arise.</P>

      <P>Under the capital investment scheme for the marketing and processing of agricultural products, a total of 95 completed applications, of which 25 were from the potato sector, were received by my Department.

      <P>Between them the 25 applications in the potato sector had a grant aid requirement of almost &euro;10 million while the funding available amounted to &euro;2.1 million. The applications were evaluated by reference to viability, target markets, their sectoral and regional impacts, particularly at primary producer level, and the extent to which they would improve the saleability of the primary product. Following the assessment process six projects, involving grant aid of &euro;1.8 million, were recommended to me and I approved them. I expect to receive a further recommendation shortly regarding the unallocated balance of approximately &euro;300,000.

      <P>The Agenda 2000 agreement which covers the period 2000 to 2006 and which was finalised in Berlin in March 1999, represented a highly satisfactory outcome for Irish agriculture and rural areas. My intention is to safeguard, to the greatest extent possible, the benefits to Ireland from the agreement in the context of the forthcoming mid-term review and the negotiation of a new World Trade Organisation round.</P>
      <P>The EU's negotiating mandate on agriculture for the WTO negotiations, which has been agreed by the Council of Ministers, is based primarily on the Agenda 2000 agreement. I am satisfied that the WTO ministerial declaration which launched the new round of WTO negotiations in Doha in November 2001 is in accordance with that mandate. The mandate provides a satisfactory framework for protecting the interests of the Irish agriculture and food industries and it is my intention to ensure that it will be fully respected in the negotiations themselves, which are scheduled to end by 2005.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vitally important that farmers and others involved in the agri-food sector are fully prepared for the future challenges and opportunities that may emerge. For that reason, I established in June 1999 a group to make recommendations on the development of the sector during the present decade. The group's report entitled &ldquo;Agri Food 2010&rdquo; was completed in March 2000 and I pub<Col N="945" /> lished a plan of action in August 2000 setting out the Government's response to the report. Substantial funding for the implementation of the plan of action has been provided in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. I am confident, therefore, that the Irish agri-food sector will be well prepared to face the challenges that may arise in the future.</P>

      <P>When completing the agreement to have his herd depopulated under the brucellosis eradication scheme, the person concerned opted for compensation purposes to have his reactors valued under the on-farm market valuation scheme by an independent valuer from the panel of valuers established under the scheme. The arrangements for this scheme also include provisions for an appeal valuation to be carried out by another member of the valuer panel and for referral to an arbitration panel in circumstances where the appeal valuation is not accepted by either the farmer or the Department. In this case my Department has referred the case for arbitration. The composition of the arbitration panel has now been agreed and it recently met separately with representatives of the farm bodies and the Department to discuss procedural arrangements in relation to valuation cases referred for arbitration.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the procedural arrangements will be finalised very shortly and that the small number of cases awaiting arbitration, including the case of the person indicated, will be dealt with at an early date.

From the outset I have made the point that from the time a decision was taken and an announcement made it would be some two to three years before civil servants would begin to relocate given the need to acquire suitable accommodation as well as the time needed to select and train the staff involved. I am satisfied that, given the work done over the past two years, the new Administration will be able to move quickly after the election to take a decision on a new programme of decentralisation and that the relocation of civil servants, as part of such a major programme, will commence within two years or so of a Government decision.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government has considered the recommendations of the sub-committee's of the Committee of Public Accounts Committee on the governance structure for Revenue and, in line with the recommendation contained in the report, a copy of the report was given to Mr. Justice Moriarty. This was done because it is recognised that, under its terms of reference, the Moriarty tribunal is specifically charged with making recommendations with regard to the independence of Revenue.</P>
      <P>The findings and recommendations of the Moriarty tribunal are, therefore, relevant to the work on the legislation and for that reason it is considered advisable to await Mr. Justice Moriarty's report before proceeding with the publication of draft legislation.</P>
      <P>Decisions dealing with the composition of the board of Revenue will, therefore, fall to be made in the context of the content and timing of the report of the tribunal.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that in An Action Programme for the Millennium the Government gave an undertaking to protect public service pensions. On foot of this undertaking, I announced in November 1997 the Government's decision that the benefit of the restructuring pay deals under the programme for competitiveness and work would apply on the basis of parity to public servants who had retired before the commencement dates of those deals, with a guaranteed minimum increase of 3%.</P>
      <P>I also said that policy in relation to any future restructuring deals would be determined in the light of the recommendations contained in the final report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions. That commission had been established by the previous Government to examine and report on the occupational pension arrangements of public servants. In the meantime, in the period since November 1997 the benefit of all relevant pay increases under Partnership 2000 and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness has been passed on to pensioners.</P>
      <P>The final report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions was published in January 2001. On 28 September 2001 the Government announced that it had decided to accept the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the commission and to establish the working group to advise on implementation provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The operational details of the implementation of the commission recommendations will be agreed by the Government following receipt of a report from the implementation working group.</P>
      <P>The working group was established on 10 January 2002 and its main subgroup has met on a regular basis since then. It is hoped the working group will be in a position to report within the next few months. Parallel structures, subject to the same timeframe and remit, have been established in the case of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The commission recommends, <i>inter alia</i>, continuation of pension increases in line with public service earnings and also that serving public servants make an additional explicit contribution towards the cost involved. In a change from the existing form of pay parity, the commission proposes that a single index of public service earnings be used in the future, with pension increases based on changes in the index to be paid automatically on a twice yearly basis.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the public service union representatives on the commission welcomed, in general terms, the &ldquo;recommendations for the establishment of a public service pensions index and the recommendation, through the use of this mechanism, for the maintenance of the system of pension increases by reference to the pay increases of serving staff&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public service pensioners clearly have a very significant interest in these recommendations. For this reason, the Government has decided to facilitate pensioner group representation in the <Col N="950" /> working group process in relation to the commission's recommendations on pensions increase policy. As a first step, a number of pensioner groups attended a preliminary meeting with my Department on 11 December 2001. The information and consultation process, the arrangements for which are currently being finalised, will include the issue of an information leaflet to pensioners, the holding of information seminars in venues around the country, and the convening of a pensioner representative forum for the purpose of electing pensioner nominees to participate in a pension index sub-committee of the PPF implementation working group referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>What I have said clearly sets out the Government's commitment to public service pensions and the actions which the Government has taken to deliver on that commitment. As I have shown, pensioners and their representative groups will have an opportunity in the months ahead to have the commission recommendations explained and examined in more detail and to participate in the consultation process which I have initiated on future pensions increase policy.</P>
    <P>As regards benchmarking, the Deputy might note that when setting up the Public Service Benchmarking Body in 2000, I announced that the implementation of the benchmarking body's recommendations will be discussed between the parties within the context of any successor to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which might be agreed between the social partners, or whatever other arrangements may be in place on the expiry of the programme. The body is due to report at the end of June and the report will form the basis of discussions between the public service employers and the unions, with decisions being a matter for the next Government. However, it is my view that any agreed increases arising from the report of the benchmarking body should be passed on to pensioners in accordance with existing pensions increase policy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also informed that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has begun work on arrangements to establish the dormant accounts fund disbursements board, provided for under section 30 of the 2001 Act. That Depart<Col N="951" /> ment is currently consulting representative bodies to ascertain interest in membership of the board.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Dormant Accounts Act, 2001, only applies to accounts in banks, building societies and An Post. Since March 31 last, these institutions have been obliged to contact holders of dormant accounts with balances of &euro;100 or above, to inform them of their rights and obligations under the Act. For accounts with balances less than &euro;100 or non-correspondence accounts, section 11 of the 2001 Act obliges these institutions to arrange for publication of a notice, in the form prescribed by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, in two or more daily newspapers and the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, advising the general public of the scheme. My Department has been working closely with the Irish Bankers' Federation to come up with a suitable format for this notice which is scheduled to be placed on 30 April next. The notice will elaborate on the public information initiative which was run earlier this year to highlight awareness of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The general scheme of a Bill to provide for handling and management of funds in matured but unclaimed life assurance policies was sent to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for formal drafting on 12 October last.

      <P>There are no schemes in my Department whereby a community group can apply for funding to upgrade a local community hall or obtain funding for other community projects, as my Department has no function in the administration of grant schemes. It may be the case, however, that certain community groups which satisfy certain conditions may be able to qualify for tax relief under the donations scheme.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, in the Finance Act, 2001, I introduced a new uniform scheme of tax relief on donations made by either individuals or corporate bodies to approved bodies. Approved bodies include certain charities, schools, universities and other eligible bodies. An eligible charity is any charity in the State which has been granted exemption from tax for a period of not less than three years and which is authorised by the Revenue Commissioners for the purpose of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="952" />The minimum qualifying donation for relief purposes to any one eligible charity or approved body is &euro;250 per annum and there is no upper limit on the amount which can be donated. Donations for any one year can be on a cumulative basis so that a weekly donation of &euro;5 can qualify for the relief. The relief on the donation will be at an individual's marginal rate of tax.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for allowing tax relief on donations will depend on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer or an individual on self-assessment or a company. Corporate donors and persons within the self assessment system will be able to claim a deduction for the donation as if it were a trading expense, whereas for a PAYE taxpayer the relief will be refunded by the Revenue Commissioners, at the end of the tax year, on a grossed-up basis directly to the charity or approved body rather than to the donor. This means, for example, that if a person, who pays income tax at the higher rate of 42%, donates &euro;1,000, the approved body can claim &euro;724 from the Revenue Commissioners. Further information on the scheme may be obtained from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Charities Section, Nenagh, County Tipperary.</P>

      <P>The public expenditure guidelines set out in the <Col N="953" /> Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium were (i) net current spending growth would be limited to 4%, calculated on an annual average basis, (ii) capital spending growth would be limited to 5% on average up to 1999, and (iii) overall Government spending would be reduced as a share of national output. An Action Programme for the Millennium as reviewed in November 1999 referred to planned higher increases in capital expenditure without recourse to borrowing and supplemented by public private partnerships.</P>
      <P>In terms of current expenditure, as I indicated in my reply on 20 March, given the allocations for departmental expenditure included in the 2002 Revised Estimates, the average annual increase in total net current expenditure in 2002 over the 1997 outturn is estimated at 8%. Against a background of strong economic growth in recent years, the Government has been in a position to make considerable progress in providing necessary resources to deliver on its commitment to improved public services. The Government is satisfied that the benefits flowing from the increased spending in key areas such as health, education and social welfare more than justify its acceptance of a growth rate in net current expenditure above the target set out in the 1997 programme.</P>
      <P>In terms of capital expenditure, voted capital expenditure grew by an annual average of 20% over the period 1997 to 1999. On the basis of the 2002 Revised Estimates allocations, voted capital spending will grow by an annual average of 33% over the period 1997 to 2002. The higher increase is in line with the provisions of the national development plan, which accounts for nearly 80% of voted capital and is seen as necessary to meet the needs of the economy, particularly in the area of infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The main capital spending area is the Department of Environment and Local Government which accounts for 49% of the total spend across roads, housing, water and waste services. Capital spending by the Department of Education and Science accounts for a further 11% of the total and health capital spending is 9% of the total. These three areas taken together account for 70% of net voted capital spending.</P>
      <P>Progress is ongoing on the development of public private partnerships. The first contract was signed last November for the building of five post-primary schools and other projects are at advanced stages of procurement.</P>
      <P>In 1997 general government spending represented 37% of GDP. In 2002 general government spending is projected to represent 35% of GDP. However, it should be noted that the composition of spending changed over this period with general government current spending declining from 33% of GDP in 1997 to 29% of GDP in 2002. General government capital spending increased from 4% of GDP in 1997 to 6% of GDP in 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>At budget time, the forecast for the 2002 Exchequer balance was for a surplus of &euro;170 million. This estimate remains unchanged. Forecasts for the public finances are predicated on the level of activity in the economy. On budget day, an increase of 3.9% in gross domestic product in 2002 was forecast. Nothing which has occurred so far would lead me to change this view, which I feel is reasonable given the current economic climate.</P>
      <P>The end March Exchequer returns showed a surplus of &euro;608 million during the first quarter of 2002. This compares to a surplus of &euro;1,457 million for the same period in 2001 and, as I have already mentioned, a surplus of &euro;170 million budgeted for 2002 as a whole. The increase in tax receipts in 2002 over 2001 was forecast at budget time to be 8.6%. The end March Exchequer returns showed tax receipts in the first quarter at &euro;6,217 million, which is 20.5% of the budget day target. Year on year tax receipts, in the first quarter of this year, were 2.8% lower than the first quarter of 2001. However, it is important that this should be considered in the context of the budget day changes which will boost tax receipts later in the year. The standard rate of VAT will increase from 20% to 21% in March of this year and the impact of this increase should be evident from the May receipts onwards. The change in the corporation tax payment dates, which is estimated to yield almost &euro;800 million this year, will increase receipts from June onwards.</P>
      <P>As with tax receipts, it is difficult to draw conclusions for the year from one quarter's expenditure. Net voted spending in the first quarter was &euro;6,102 million compared to &euro;5,210 million in 2001, an increase of 17.1%. This compares to a figure of 14.4% in the Revised Estimates volume published recently. The rate of increase year on year dropped from 22.1% at end January to 17.1% at end March. Year on year spending can, however, vary from month to month influenced by both spending trends in the base year of 2001 as well as in the current year.</P>
      <P>The general expectation is that the economy is recovering and that this should be reflected in tax revenues during the remainder of the year. Spending plans by Departments are being closely monitored to ensure that these come in on target. The overall end year Exchequer position is, therefore, still as forecast on budget day.</P>

This result should be viewed in the context of the 2002 budget day changes which will boost tax receipts later in the year. The increase in the standard rate of VAT, which took effect from 1 March 2002, will be evident in the receipts from May. The change in the payment dates for corporation tax, which is estimated to yield almost &euro;800 million this year, will increase receipts from June 2002 onwards.</P>
      <P>Tax receipts for the early months of the year may not reliably predict the outcome for the year as a whole. The period under review is too short. The position is further complicated in 2002 as the Easter break occurred at the end of the quarter and therefore affected year on year comparisons. The general expectation is that the economy is recovering and that this should be reflected in tax revenues over the remainder of the year. The overall end year Exchequer position is, therefore, still as forecast on budget day.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 2 today which set out the position as regards implementation of the national development plan. Ongoing implementation of the plan will have to take account of the prevailing budgetary situation and this was clearly signalled in the plan as published. I assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to give priority in resource allocation to the NDP, especially the infrastructure programme of the plan. Physical progress has been good to date in the implementation of the infrastructure programme and the priority which the Government will continue to give to the area should assure that this will be maintained over the remainder of the plan. A comprehensive assessment of progress will take place under the mid-term review next year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of health related support services, including respite care, to people with disabilities is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Priorities for the allocation of funding available for the development of services, including respite care, are decided by the health boards in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for intellectual disabilities and for physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, additional revenue and capital funding of more than &euro;500 million has been provided for the maintenance and development of health related services, including respite care for people with disabilities. More than 490 additional respite places were provided between 1997 and 2001 and funding has been provided for an additional 75 places for people with an intellectual disability in 2002. It is my policy to continue to develop the services in line with the needs highlighted in the national intellectual disability database.</P>
      <P>In terms of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, my Department, in conjunction with the Health Research Board, the health boards and the voluntary sector service providers, is currently developing the national physical and sensory disability database which, when complete, will provide an accurate picture of the service requirements, including the respite care requirements, in the sector. The database will enable services to be planned and delivered in a co-ordinated and efficient manner to provide an effective and seamless service to people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the management and treatment of a person with an eating disorder rests with the <Col N="958" /> individual patient's clinician. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>Under the regulatory framework for private health insurance, insurers are obliged to provide prescribed minimum levels of benefit specified in the Health Insurance Act, 1994 (Minimum Benefit) Regulations, 1996. These minimum requirements were determined in the context of opening the market to competition under the EU Non-Life Insurance Directive 92/49/EEC &ndash; Third Directive &ndash; and by reference to the established minimum level of cover generally available to insured persons at the time. Health services relating to eating disorders or weight reduction are not prescribed.</P>
      <P>The prescribed health services include in-patient services, day patient services, out-patient services, the sole purpose of which is the medical investigation, treatment, cure, or alleviation of the symptoms, of illness or injury. My Department is aware that cover is made available in respect of treatment for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa on an in-patient basis. It is a matter for all insurers to determine what benefits they are in a position to provide over and above those required under minimum benefit arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The hospital system in general is experiencing increased pressure on available beds due to a number of factors, including the growth in population and increasing number of elderly people who have a higher than average length of stay. Available data indicates that about 70% of all hospital admissions are through accident and emergency departments. This Government has taken a number of initiatives to improve services in accident and emergency departments. A &euro;40.63 million investment package was provided in the winter of 2000-01 aimed at alleviating service pressures and maintaining services to patients, particularly in the acute hospital sector. This investment package provided for the recruitment of additional 29 accident and emergency consultants and for the contracting of additional private nursing home places for patients whose acute phase of treatment has been completed but who require additional care in an alternative setting. The ERHA and the health boards contracted more than 700 beds under this initiative in the winter of 2000-01. This level of funding was repeated over the period October 2001 to March <Col N="961" /> 2002 and has been of significant benefit to health agencies in responding to the high level of demand for hospital beds over the winter periods.</P>
      <P>I have also provided funding to the ERHA and the health boards to support a further range of initiatives in accident and emergency departments. These include: £5.19 million towards the development of accident and emergency facilities at St. James's Hospital; the provision of minor injuries units in Beaumont, Mater, James Connolly Memorial, St. James's and Tallaght Hospitals; development of accident and emergency department at the Mater Hospital; extension to the accident and emergency department at St. Columcille's Hospital; development of pilot services for deep venous thrombosis in Beaumont Hospital; provision of a chest pain service at St. James's Hospital; the provision of a pilot discharge lounge in Beaumont Hospital; the recruitment of discharge planners and patient liaison personnel at accident and emergency sites in the eastern region; development of new accident and emergency department at St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park; development of new accident and emergency department at the Children's Hospital, Temple Street; planning of a new accident and emergency department for Cork University Hospital; development of accident and emergency department at Galway University Hospital; development of accident and emergency department at Castlebar General Hospital; development of accident and emergency department at Tullamore General Hospital; development of a new accident and emergency department at Portlaoise General Hospital; appointment of a design team for the development of a new accident and emergency department at Roscommon County Hospital; and the upgrading of accident and emergency facilities at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, Monaghan General Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.</P>
      <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners has conducted a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs. On foot of that review, entitled Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &ndash; A National Review, the Government has decided to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. I announced on 16 January a &euro;65 million investment package in the current year for the commissioning of 709 of these 3,000 beds in acute hospitals. My Department has been advised, by the ERHA and the health boards that 98 of these beds have been commissioned, that an additional 23 beds will come on stream by the end of April 2002, with a further 49 beds by the end of May 2002. The balance will be introduced on a phased basis during the rest of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major re-focus on primary care services, marked by the introduction of new models of care involving core multi-disciplinary primary care teams, which will work with a wider network of health and social care professionals and which <Col N="962" /> will offer 24 hour cover to patients, has taken place. This will also help to reduce demand from and treat appropriately patients who would otherwise have to attend at an accident and emergency department. This sector will therefore take on a pivotal role in helping to reduce pressures in accident and emergency departments. A sum of &euro;17.29 million is being invested in the development of this service in 2002.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives have been identified in the health strategy which are designed to improve the operation of accident and emergency departments. These include: the establishment of minor injury units to ensure appropriate treatment and management of non-urgent cases; the use of chest pain clinics, respiratory clinics and in-house specialist teams to fast-track patients as appropriate; the re-organisation of diagnostic services to ensure increased access to, and availability of, services at busy times in accident and emergency departments; the appointment of advanced nurse practitioners, ANPs &ndash; emergency, in acute hospitals; the use of admission protocols to ensure that emergency patients will be the only group of patients admitted to hospital through accident and emergency departments; the appointment of additional personnel to liaise with patients while they await diagnosis and treatment at accident and emergency departments; and the introduction of information systems that record comprehensive, comparable and reliable data on activity in accident and emergency departments. Such information will provide staff with a valuable tool in structuring services to meet the needs of patients.</P>
    <P>At my request, Comhairle na nOspidéal has undertaken a review of the structures, operation and staffing of accident and emergency departments. The report entitled &ldquo;Report of the Committee on Accident &amp; Emergency Services&rdquo; not only deals with the staffing of accident and emergency departments at consultant level but also links reform of accident and emergency departments with the need to look critically at hospital processes and patient flows through the hospitals. The report provides valuable advice on the structure of our emergency services and the necessary linkages which will be required to eliminate delays in emergency departments.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that action was recently taken by nursing staff employed in accident and emergency departments order to highlight difficulties being experienced in service provision. Proposals put forward by the Labour Relations Commission aimed at resolving the difficulties which had arisen were accepted by all parties. Proposals in the agreement included a requirement that a full security assessment would be undertaken, in each accident and emergency department in the country and that a national A&amp;E nursing staffing structures review group will be established to carry out an immediate examination of existing structures and staffing levels in accident and emergency Departments. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that considerable <Col N="963" /> progress is being made in implementing the proposals put forward by the commission.</P>
    <P>On 13 February this year, I announced the establishment of an accident and emergency forum to identify steps that can be taken immediately to alleviate current problems in accident and emergency services. The forum, which had its first meeting on 20 March 2002, was chaired by Dr. Danny O'Hare former president of Dublin City University. There were approximately 80 participants, representing hospital management, members of the medical and nursing professions, para-medical and non-nursing personnel, staff representative associations and unions, patient advocacy groups and other interested parties in attendance at day one of the forum. Day two of the forum is scheduled to take place on 1 May. The work of the forum will help to build on the existing and proposed policy framework for accident and emergency services as set out in the national health strategy. I am pleased with the response to the forum and I am confident that its work will contribute significantly to advancing the existing and proposed policy framework for accident and emergency services as set out in the national health strategy.     </P>

      <P>The effect of the revocation of the 1996 pharmacy regulations, for the awarding of new community pharmacy contracts, is that there are no restrictions on granting new contracts in terms of location, population or viability of existing pharmacies. However, the practice of pharmacy continues to be governed by the Pharmacy Acts. The revocation of the regulations does not affect the operation of the community pharmacy scheme, and existing contracts still stand.</P>
      <P>The Pharmacy Review Group is now being asked to report as quickly as possible and the type of framework, whether statutory or otherwise, required for community pharmacy services will be considered when the group reports. My Department and I are continuing to work towards introducing community pharmacy regulations to cover, on an interim basis, the period from now until the publication of the Pharmacy Review Group's report.</P>
      <P>Together with officials from my Department, I have been in close and ongoing consultation with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union in relation to the revocation of the 1996 regulations and resolution of the issues arising. The Deputy may be aware that the Competition Authority has indicated that, if the IPU and its members engage in industrial action, it may consider instituting legal action against the IPU for breaches of the Competition Acts.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, contains a specific commitment to support the establishment of a heart and lung transplant facility in Ireland and to ensuring that the programme, when introduced, will be in a position to match the highest international standards in lung transplantation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Mater Hospital, Dublin, has been designated as the surgical site for the programme. The provision of a lung transplant unit at the hospital forms part of a major capital development approved for the hospital. In order to progress this project an expert consultative group, chaired by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, was <Col N="966" /> established to advise my Department on various issues associated with the development of the programme. The report of the consultative group has been received and is being progressed as a priority by my Department in conjunction with the ERHA and the Mater Hospital. The report was the subject of a recent and very positive discussion with the ERHA and the Mater Hospital. My Department is currently awaiting some additional information from the hospital in order to advance the various issues associated with the establishment of this very complex service.</P>
    <P>In terms of progressing the establishment of the programme the Deputy will be pleased to know that a number of key clinical appointments have already been made at the Mater Hospital, including the appointment of a consultant surgeon and a consultant physician. Pending the establishment of the programme in this country, an agreement is in place with the Freeman Hospital in the UK for the treatment of Irish patients requiring a lung or heart and lung transplant. To date, 19 patients from this country have received a transplant at the Freeman Hospital under the agreement. This contract will continue while the necessary arrangements are being progressed in terms of establishing the programme in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is also important to note that lungs donated in Ireland have been retrieved by the medical team at Newcastle and have helped to facilitate this additional transplant work at Newcastle for the benefit of Irish patients. Finally, I wish to assure the Deputy that the establishment of the Irish programme will continue to be progressed as a priority by my Department in conjunction with the ERHA and the Mater Hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. The chief executive officer of the South Eastern Health Board has informed me that at the end of the March 2002 quarter, there were 446 patients awaiting orthodontic treatment and the average waiting time for treatment is 12 months. As my Department does not collate orthodontic treatment information by county, I have asked the chief executive officer of the SEHB to reply directly to the Deputy regarding the average waiting period for orthodontic treatment for children in the Waterford county area.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officer of the SEHB has also informed me that at the end of the March 2002 quarter, the number of patients in orthodontic treatment in the south eastern area was 2,138 which was an increase of 114 on the last quarter. I have initiated a range of measures to substantially increase the capacity of the orthodontic services and reduce the waiting times for orthodontic treatment. Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>A dentist from the SEHB, along with five other dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the North-Eastern Health Board, commenced training in October last for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. The general objectives of these training programmes is to educate dentists to become specialists in orthodontics with a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods. They are made possible by co-operation between health boards, consultants and dental teaching institutions. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence this year are also under way.</P>
      <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Post Graduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. My Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately &euro;1.27 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" />These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, namely, the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. The Dental Council has already established a register of dental specialists with a division of orthodontics. In addition, agreement has been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the introduction of the grade of specialist in orthodontics into the public service. This agreement resulted from complex and time-consuming negotiations and its introduction will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics.</P>
    <P>The grade of orthodontic therapist will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling a greater volume of treatment. However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of &euro;0.19 million was approved to the SEHB for orthodontic services in 2001, of which &euro;0.127 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This has enabled the health board to recruit additional staff.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, under this initiative, my Department is exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists. I am confident that when fully implemented this initiative, combined with the structural changes to the orthodontic service, will significantly increase the number of patients in and reduce waiting times for treatment.</P>

My Department has therefore asked the chief executive officer of that board to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and reply to him directly. The Deputy may also be aware that, in response to my concern regarding shortages of qualified therapy personnel &ndash; including speech and language therapists &ndash; my Department commissioned a report on Current and Future Supply and Demand Conditions in the Labour Market <Col N="969" /> for Certain Professional Therapists from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates.</P>
      <P>The Bacon report, which was published in July 2001, concluded that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of speech and language therapists requiring a very significant increase in training places to meet the long-term needs of the health service. The report therefore advocated an annual increase of 75 training places for speech and language therapy in order to achieve the fourfold increase in the number of speech and language therapists over the next decade recommended in the report.</P>
      <P>To advance this core recommendation of the report, an inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the Bacon report. The proposals received are currently being assessed by the inter-agency working group with a view to early progress in the provision of the extra training places recommended.</P>
      <P>Initiatives to progress other key recommendations included in the Bacon report are set out below: the planned establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators to support the provision of additional clinical placements; a concerted overseas recruitment of scarce therapy personnel undertaken on behalf of all the health boards by the Northern Area Health Board; the establishment of the health skills group under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to support the development of integrated workforce planning and improved human resource planning in the health service; the ongoing implementation of the report of the expert group on various health professions to address outstanding issues including workload, working practices and skills-mix issues highlighted in the Bacon report; and the preparation of a scheme for the statutory registration for health and social care professionals, consistent with the requirement for a person-centred health service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I recently visited Monaghan General Hospital and met with hospital management, staff and with representatives of local groups. I was happy to be in a position to allay any concerns with regard to the future development of the hospital. A significant level of capital investment in Monaghan General Hospital is proposed in the short-term; plans are being advanced by the North-Eastern Health Board for the development and upgrading of the high dependency unit at the hospital in addition to substantial upgrading and refurbishment of ward accommodation, the development of the emergency treatment unit and the development of a midwifery-led unit. The associated capital cost is of the order of &euro;7 million.</P>
      <P>Revenue funding is provided to health boards for the maintenance and continued development of existing services and for the provision-development of new services. Revenue funding in this regard has been provided to the North-Eastern Health Board in recent years as follows: 2000, £226.806 million; 2001, £289.122 million. In the current year this figure increased to &euro;450.053 million.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will of course, appreciate that it is a matter for the health board to determine its service priorities in the context of the funding made available to it for the maintenance, development and provision of services. I am advised by the board, however, that the development of new consultant-led services in dermatology and geriatric medicine at the hospital is proceeding and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department has recently issued formal approval to the board for the filling of two consultant posts in order to facilitate these developments.</P>
      <P>Further approval of a replacement consultant surgeon post and the upgrading of this temporary post to permanent status has recently issued to the North-Eastern Health Board from my Department. Additional medical support staff will also be recruited to support this post. In addition, approval has also issued for a replacement consultant anaesthetist post which will be committed to Monaghan General Hospital and which will support the service developments at the hospital.</P>
      <P>I am further advised by the board that management consultants have been retained to oversee the implementation of a consultants in management programme for the NEHB hospitals and to improve and enhance general management arrangements for the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have announced the immediate commissioning process for an additional 709 acute hospital beds in public hospitals nationwide at a cost of &euro;65 million in the current year. This is the first phase in the provision of the additional 3,000 <Col N="972" /> acute hospital beds by 2011. Some 38 of the additional 709 public hospital beds will be provided in the North-Eastern Health Board region with ten of these being provided in Monaghan General Hospital. All of the additional bed capacity at the hospital will be designated for public patients and will allow the hospital to significantly increase activity levels for its public patients.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the proposed development of additional consultant-led services at the hospital, together with the provision of additional bed capacity and the proposed significant level of capital investment is tangible evidence of additional funding for the provision of acute hospital services to the catchment area population served by the hospital.</P>

      <P>The hospital in-patient waiting times and the numbers on waiting lists for ENT, which includes tonsillectomy, procedures at the 31 December 2001, in each health board area and in the Eastern Region Health Authority area, in the format collected by my Department, are being communicated separately to the Deputy. Individual consultants within the hospital system are responsible for assessing and providing treatment to patients referred to them by general practitioners or through the emergency departments of hospitals. The question of placing patients on a waiting list for admission to hospital is a matter for the consultants concerned, who also have responsibility for the relative priority of individual cases on their waiting lists. It is not open to the Minister to determine the need for hospital treatment or the relative priority of any individual case.</P>

    <P>Proposals now being developed by my Department for the regulation and quality assurance of driving instruction involve a test of the competence of individual instructors, or exemption from this requirement where an instructor is accredited to an organisation of driving instructors recognised by my Department as meeting appropriate quality standards. The design of these standards is being formulated by a working group comprising representatives of my Department and of instruction interests. It is envisaged that as part of this process an organisation will have to seek accreditation from the National <Col N="975" /> Accreditation Board that they are operating to a set standard. The legislative basis for implementing these proposals has been updated in the recently enacted Road Traffic Act, 2002.</P>

Some &euro;593 million has been allocated to local authorities from the local government fund in general purpose grants for 2002. This represents an increase of 10% over the 2001 baseline allocation and is some 75% higher than the corresponding allocation in 1997. I am confident this level of allocation, together with income from local sources, is sufficient to meet the ongoing and special costs of local authority services in the present year. It is the responsibility of each individual local authority to ensure that its register of electors is accurately updated.</P>

The 2002 allocation represents an increase of 48% on the 2001 outturn of &euro;21.061 million. In 2002, Kildare County Council will spend &euro;34.749 million on non-national roads &ndash;&euro;31,079 million in State grants and &euro;3.670 million from its own resources. Grants under the restoration programme, which commenced in 1995 with the aim of restoring regional and local roads in county council areas by the end of 2005, continue to be the main thrust of the non-national roads programme. Under this programme, grants to Kildare County Council have increased from &euro;1.042 million in 1995 to &euro;7.253 million in 2002, an increase of almost 600%. I am satisfied that this significantly increased level of funding, supplemented by the council's own resources, is providing adequately for the ongoing maintenance and improvement needs of the non-national roads in County Kildare.</P>
      <P>All non-national road grants for 2002 have now been fully allocated and there are no further funds available, which would allow for any additional grants to be allocated over and above those already allocated in the current year.</P>

    <P>Under the regional operational programmes 2000-2006, funding is being provided by my Department to local authorities to implement a <Col N="978" /> wide range of urban and village renewal projects, including, where appropriate, the provision of community facilities.

Under the voluntary housing schemes operated by local authorities, a grant of &euro;5,800 per unit of accommodation being provided in a project is generally payable towards the cost of the provision of communal facilities in the project.

      <P>The person concerned reached age 65 in January 2002 and is getting a retirement pension from my Department. To qualify for maximum rate retirement pension, a person must have a yearly average of at least 48 reckonable social insurance contributions over the period from 1953, or from the start of the contribution year in which they entered insurance, if later, to the end of the last full contribution year before reaching age 65.</P>
      <P>According to my Department's records, the person concerned first entered insurable employment in January 1954 which is in the contribution year July 1953 to June 1954 applicable to women at that time. Accordingly her yearly average falls to be calculated over the 49 year period July 1953 to December, 2001. She has a total of 1,211 contributions paid or credited over this period resulting in a yearly average of 25. This qualifies her for a 98% retirement pension at the weekly personal rate of &euro;103.90.</P>

These people would not normally qualify for a pension because they could not satisfy the basic conditions required for pensions purposes, particularly the requirement to have entered insurance ten years before pension age. The special pension is paid at a flat-rate of 50% of the standard maximum rate with equivalent increases for adult and child dependants, where applicable.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by some 80 private transport operators. The vast majority of these private contractors operate in rural areas. My Department is always willing to consider further applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme. While my Department pays transport providers to operate the free travel scheme, it is not in a position to provide services where none exist.</P>
      <P>In this regard, an interdepartmental committee on rural transport, chaired by the Department of Public Enterprise, is considering issues relating to the availability of transport services in rural areas. I understand the committee will report during this year. In addition, my colleague Deputy Mary O'Rourke, Minister for Public Enterprise, recently announced that 19 community groups have been selected to receive funding under the rural transport initiative. The aim of the funding is to encourage innovative community-based initiatives to provide transport services in rural areas with a view to addressing the issue of social exclusion in rural Ireland which is caused by lack of access to transport. Funding of &euro;3.8 million has been provided for this purpose. My Department is in discussions with the Department of Public Enterprise on the role that the free travel scheme can play in supporting these pilot projects.</P>

The person in question has made two separate applications &ndash; the first is an application for refugee status and the second is an application for permission to remain in the State on the basis that he is residing here with his Irish citizen wife. Applications for refugee status are dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996. Under that Act, two independent statutory offices were established to consider applications-appeals for refugee status and make recommendations to the Minister on whether such status should be granted.</P>
      <P>These two offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which considers applications for a declaration as a refugee at first instance and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which considers applications for a declaration in the event of an appeal.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that an application for a Garda CCTV system in Portlaoise town has been received by the advisory committee that was established by <Col N="986" /> the Garda Commissioner to evaluate applications for Garda CCTV systems. The application from Portlaoise is currently under consideration &ndash; together with applications from other cities and towns throughout the country. Garda CCTV systems are currently in operation in the following areas: Dublin (North Central) &ndash; O'Connell Street and its surrounding areas; Dublin (South Central) &ndash; Grafton Street and its surrounding areas; Tralee, County Kerry.</P>
      <P>A Garda CCTV system is currently being completed in Cork city and I understand, in this regard, that most of the cameras in the system there are now fully operational.</P>
      <P>I announced late in 2000 that the number of Garda CCTV systems were to be extended. As part of the first tranche of this expansion, town centre systems are to be installed in the following ten areas: Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dun Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. Contracts for the installation of CCTV systems in Bray, Dundalk, Dun Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick, have now been awarded and it is intended that the systems will be in place by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The planning in respect of the town centre CCTV systems for Athlone, Clondalkin, Waterford and Tallaght is well advanced and it is expected that tenders will be invited via the EU Journal and the national newspapers soon.</P>
      <P>Work on installing Garda CCTV systems in a further seven areas &ndash; Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clonmel, Ennis, Kilkenny and Sligo, will also commence in 2003. This will bring the number of areas where Garda CCTV systems are to be extended to by 2003 to 17 in all.</P>
      <P>I also plan to introduce a grant scheme to cater for those communities who would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. While it will be up to the local communities to install and monitor the CCTV schemes, grant assistance will be provided. The details of this new scheme are being finalised and full particulars including relevant conditions and grant levels etc will be announced soon.</P>

      <P>The Victims' Commissioner, Mr. John Wilson, published his report, A Place and a Name, in August 1999. Since then a sub<Col N="987" /> stantial number of the recommendations have either been addressed or are being addressed. Last week I obtained Government approval for an implementation plan in relation to all outstanding recommendations. The following tabular statement groups the report's recommendations according to the Departments primarily responsible for dealing with them, and details the current position in respect of each one.  Imminent or proposed future action is outlined in the statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the time taken to implement the report's recommendations, the position is that Mr. Wilson recommended that an outline implementation plan be produced within six months. Interdepartmental consultation began almost as <Col N="988" /> soon as the report was published and a draft implementation plan was drawn up some months later. However, as the process had not yet yielded a definitive response on every issue to my own satisfaction, consultation continued on a number of the more complex matters raised by the report. I appreciate that it has been a lengthy process but I believe that a careful and considered approach was necessary for the process to result in a comprehensive, definitive and fully viable implementation plan.</P>
    <P>A review of the implementation of recommendations will take place under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach, a senior official of which is to be designated to advance and monitor the continued implementation of recommendations.</P>

            <entry>The emotional well-being of those affected by any major accidents or incidents is recognised as important. Health boards have established an integrated intra-board approach and have established cross-border links. The development of child and adolescent psychiatric services has been a priority in recent years. Significant additional revenue funding has been provided to the health boards in recent years, which has enabled them to develop mental health services.<br />The Mental Health Association of Ireland provides information, including specific school-based initiatives. Substantial additional revenue funding and lottery grants have been provided to voluntary organisations, both nationally and locally.</entry>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 22 April 2002 there were 376 prisoners in custody for sexual offences. As I have explained to the House on previous occasions there are actually four forms of direct therapeutic intervention available to sex offenders within the Irish prison system at present. These are as follows: individual counselling from the Department's psychology service and from the probation and welfare service; the multi-disciplinary Thinking Skills group work programme in Cork prison, Arbour Hill prison and the Curragh place of detention; the sex offender treatment programme. This has been in operation in Arbour Hill Prison since 1994 and was introduced in the Curragh place of detention early last year; and the psychiatric service which provides extensive support to prisoners in this category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every effort is made to assist sex offenders in custody who are willing to participate at some level in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention. While it is not possible to accurately quantify participation in all forms of rehabilitation, many of those in custody have availed of one or more of the forms of intervention referred to above. The number of offenders undergoing one to one counselling is difficult to define because of the varied nature of individual counselling provided to sex offenders in prison. This counselling can vary from one session addressing <Col N="994" /> a particular problem to intensive ongoing counselling.</P>
    <P>I can tell you, however, that there are currently 14 prisoners engaged in the sex offender treatment programme referred to above and 80 prisoners have completed the programme to date. In addition, the number of prisoners who attended the Thinking Skills programme last year was 48.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that it is not possible to compel sex offenders in custody to undergo treatment. Furthermore, I am advised that it would not be desirable to do so. The successful completion of any treatment course depends critically on the full and willing participation of self-motivated individuals. Otherwise, the key elements of the programme concerned with challenging the offender to take responsibility for his offending behaviour will not succeed.</P>

      <P>I have received a copy of the letter in question from the Rialto community drug team and I am aware of their concerns.</P>
      <P>A comparatively small number of projects presented by the local drugs task forces in their new action plans have been assessed as being more relevant to other mainstream programmes and initiatives and, accordingly, the inter-departmental group on drugs, IDG, and the national drugs strategy team, NDST, are currently exploring the possibility of funding them through such programmes.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should note that an amount of &euro;2.45 million was allocated for projects in the canal communities local drugs task force area to implement the first round of drug forces plans there. In addition, an amount of approximately &euro;935,000 was allocated to mainstream a number of projects in that same plan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile of funding allocated by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion to implement the second round of local drugs task force plans, the Canal Communities Local Drugs Task Force has been allocated an amount of &euro;930,083 under this round. Furthermore, another additional &euro;1,155,465 has also been allocated to address the premises needs of drugs projects in the area.</P>

      <P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, administered by my Department provides financial assistance to organisations, including national governing bodies of sport such as the Irish Underwater Council, for the provision of sporting and recreational facilities. The programme is advertised annually and applications for funding from clubs-organisations have to be made on an individual basis.</P>
      <P>The Sports Capital Programme for 2002 was advertised on 25 and 26 November 2001 with a closing date of 4 January 2002 for the receipt of completed applications. Allocations under this year's programme were recently announced. In excess of 1,350 applications were received before the closing date. While an application was submitted by the Irish Underwater Council to the 2002 Sports Capital Programme, it was not in relation to the provision of a hyperbaric chamber and did not make any reference to any such facility.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the 2003 sports capital programme will be advertised towards the end of the year and at that stage it will be again open to all sports organisations to submit applications for funding towards their projects.</P>

      <P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, provides funding to voluntary sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country towards the provision of sport and recreational facilities. The programme is advertised on an annual basis and the closing date for the receipt of completed applications under this year's programme was 4 January 2002. The 2002 round of grants under the programme were recently announced and grants in excess of &euro;75 million were allocated to 850 projects throughout the country. It is expected that the next programme will be advertised later this year and it will be open to the organisation concerned to apply for funding under this programme.</P>
      <P>My Department also provides the Chair and secretariat of the young people's facilities and services fund, YPFSF, and for which funding is channelled through the Department of Education and Science. The fund was established in 1998 as part of the Government's overall strategy to tackle drug misuse. The fund aims to assist in the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The objective of the fund is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse. The primary focus of the YPFSF to date has been on the 14 local drugs task force areas in Dublin &ndash; 12, Bray and Cork, and the urban centres of Limerick, Galway, Carlow and Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" />The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, at its meeting on 23 January 2002, sanctioned the putting in place of arrangements for a second round of funding under the YPFSF in the 14 local drugs task force areas only. No arrangements have been put in place for extending the next round of funding beyond Local Drugs Task Force areas. While some funding has been set aside for this from the overall NDP allocation no decisions on areas to be targeted outside of LDTF areas have yet been made. Arrangements and areas to be targeted will be considered during the course of 2002.</P>

      <P>On 26 March 2002, the position of executive chairman of Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited &ndash; CSID Limited &ndash; was abolished and was replaced by separate posts of chairman of the board and chief executive. The former executive chairman remains on the board of CSID Limited as a director for which he is paid the normal director's fee. No compensation was paid to the individual in question as a result of the change.</P>
      <P>On appointment as executive chairman of CSID Limited in May 2000, his remuneration paid by CSID Limited was set at &euro;39,997 per annum in respect of this position. The total level of remuneration paid by the Exchequer is in compliance with the Department of Finance regulations for retired civil servants, which prescribe that remuneration for all civil service posts, including pension, cannot exceed the level of salary before retirement.</P>
      <P>The former executive chairman also had the use of a car during the time he acted in that capacity for CSID Limited. I have been informed by CSID Limited that the executive chairman incurred &euro;18,364.40 in expenses during 2001, in respect of his duties at CSID Limited. The question of pension contributions did not arise and there were no other benefits to which the executive chairman was entitled.</P>

      <P>The principal teacher of each primary school has overall responsibility for the school's learning-support (remedial teacher) programme. In selecting pupils for remedial education, priority should be given to those pupils who achieve scores at or below the 10th percentile in standardised tests in literacy/numeracy. In order to allow for measurement error, consideration may be given to selecting pupils who achieve scores up to and including the 12th percentile. Once schools are satisfied that the needs of pupils who have very low achievement or serious learning difficulties have been met, a limited degree of flexibility may be exercised in the deployment of the learning support teacher. If the Deputy wishes to provide me with details of the school attended by the pupil in question, I will arrange to have the child's needs examined by my Department's inspectorate.</P>

    <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates the Government's commitment to improving the accommodation situation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997. Because of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since the Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment <Col N="1004" /> activity. A proposed building project for St. Enda's national school, will proceed to architectural planning, as soon as possible, under the expanded building programme.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the concerns of many leaving certificate students who find the higher and ordinary level Irish course extremely difficult; his further views on the fact that this often leads to negative attitudes to the Irish language; the reason the content of the Irish course is so academic and does not resemble the courses for European languages; and his plans for a review of these courses.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The perception that students find leaving certificate Irish extremely difficult is not borne out by the uptake of the higher level paper or by the leaving certificate results. During the period 1999-2001, the percentage of the cohort of students taking the higher level leaving certificate examination in Irish went from 24% to 31%. As a comparison during the same period, the percentage of the cohort taking higher level French went up by just under 1%. When results in Irish for 2001 are compared with results in a range of the most popular leaving certificate subjects, for example, English, French and biology, the percentage of students achieving a &ldquo;C&rdquo; grade or better at both higher and ordinary levels is higher than in the other subjects. The percentage of pupils achieving an &ldquo;E&rdquo; grade or lower in 2001 was 1.4% in higher level Irish as compared with 5.2% in higher level French, and 5.1% in ordinary level Irish as compared with 7.5% in ordinary level French. Students also have the option of taking a foundation level paper in leaving certificate Irish or of taking Irish in the leaving certificate applied.</P>
      <P>The structure of the leaving certificate syllabus for Irish is very similar to that for the modern languages. The syllabus is set out under notional/functional headings, the four language skills, viz., listening, speaking, reading and writing are covered and the implied teaching methodology is based on a communicative approach. It is true that at higher and ordinary levels there is some literature prescribed for candidates taking Irish. In the case of the ordinary level candidate, this consists only of five poems and five short prose pieces, chosen for their appeal to young people. It is only at higher level that candidates are required to study an integral text. Since students have studied Irish all the way through primary school, it is to be expected that they can cope with this prescription by the end of their post-primary studies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The syllabi studied in our schools are all prepared by the NCCA, National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, course committees. Representatives of the teaching profession sit on <Col N="1005" /> these committees and help to choose the literature that is prescribed. Review of all syllabi, including Irish, is an integral part of the work of the NCCA.</P>

      <Quest>if his Department has inquired into the circumstances of assaults on a person at a school (details supplied) in 1997 and 1998; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12361/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department first became aware of this matter when the school authorities notified it in 1998 that a teacher had been placed on suspension in connection with a Garda investigation into allegations of child abuse. This suspension was consistent with my Department's procedures relating to such allegations &ndash; these place child safety as the most important priority. Further inquiry in the matter had then to await resolution of the criminal charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 2000 my Department was informed that the teacher in question had been convicted on charges of abuse and had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Clearly such a conviction raised issues about procedures in the school and the safety of children generally in the school. My Department requested a report from the school <Col N="1006" /> authorities on the circumstances of the assault on the child concerned and their procedures for the protection of children in the school. A report has been received which sets out the procedures for child safety in the school.</P>
    <P>My Department also sought a report from the health board of its assessment of the school in so far as child safety was concerned, and on the adequacy of supports being provided to children by the school arising from the particular case. The board's response indicated that it had received a number of referrals connected to the charges against the teacher concerned and that the school had co-operated with the board and had been advised by the board. Overall, on the basis of the report of the health board my Department is satisfied that there are adequate child protection procedures in place in the school.</P>
    <P>As regards the teacher concerned, in June 2000 my Department commenced the process of withdrawal of recognition as a teacher in this case. Legal and constitutional demands require that the teacher, although convicted, be granted due process. In view of the fact that an appeal against conviction is now pending, the process for withdrawal of recognition has had to be suspended until the appeal is determined. Meanwhile, of course, the teacher concerned remains in prison and does not constitute a threat to children.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the report from the school, I remain of the view that further inquiry is needed into how the abuse occurred in this case and how the procedures in place in the school for child protection appear to have failed in this instance. It is appropriate, however, that further inquiry into this aspect of the case is carried out only when the appeal has been determined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that I launched the new disadvantage programme Giving Children An Even Break last year to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The programme will run over a three-year period and will cost some &euro;33 million. Giving Children An Even Break involves the creation of over 200 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to 2,143 primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
      <P>Giving Children an Even Break subsumes the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage. My Department's approach is now refined to ensure that the individual &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; pupils are targeted. Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, my Department now provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. These levels of disadvantage were established as a result of a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools, carried out in March/April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf.</P>
      <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to Giving Children An Even Break and the school referred to by the Deputy has been included in the urban dimension. Urban schools with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils are being supported, where necessary, over the three-year period, through staff allocations, to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes, infants through second class, and a pupil teacher ratio of 27:1 in senior classes, third through sixth classes. The school referred to by the Deputy was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the schools as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All participating primary schools under Giving Children An Even Break are receiving additional funding to be used in the provision of a range of in school and out of school supports for the pupils <Col N="1008" /> concerned over the three-year period. The school referred to by the Deputy has been allocated &euro;6,628 in respect of the 2000-01 school year and is eligible to receive &euro;5,879 in respect of the current school year.</P>
    <P>Where schools expressed concern about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they were advised to make representations to my Department outlining their circumstances. Schools were informed that these representations would then be referred to the Educational Research Centre for consideration and my Department would then consider the position of these schools.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the approach outlined, representations from the school referred to by the Deputy were forwarded to the Educational Research Centre. My Department has now received a report from the Educational Research Centre and the situation of this school and other such schools is currently under consideration. The school in question will be informed of the outcome in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 203 and 204 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The compulsory school starting age in a national school is six years of age and rule 64(1) of the rules for national schools provides that a child must be at least four years of age before she/he may be enrolled in a national school. Children of compulsory school-going age must have a <Col N="1011" /> place in a national school and overall there are more than enough places available.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.</P>
    <P>My Department will carry out an investigation where it is claimed that a board is operating its enrolment policy in a manner which discriminates against a particular child. On the basis of the details supplied by the Deputy this does not appear to be the case in this instance.</P>

      <P>I have received a detailed submission from Down Syndrome Ireland on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2002. I have also received the views of other bodies representing the interests of those with special educational needs arising from disabilities. There is no fundamental disagreement between the views of Down Syndrome Ireland, those other views and the underlying approach of the Bill. All those consulted to-date want a statutory based, effective right to education and all related support services for children with special educational needs from as early an age as those needs demand and continuing on into adulthood. That is my objective also and that is what my Bill is designed to do.  </P>
      <P>There are some areas of detail where the position adopted by Down Syndrome Ireland differs from that in the Bill. There are a number of areas where there is misunderstanding about the intent and effect of the Bill. My Department and I are available for further consultations with all those interested in the Bill, with a view to reaching a broad consensus on its content. On the basis of consultations held so far, I am confident that such a consensus can be reached.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of primary and secondary schools, my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in primary and secondary schools, and caretakers in primary schools. Under that scheme my Department meets the full cost of salary. Since 1985, pension scheme arrangements have applied to secretaries employed under this scheme.</P>
      <P>The question of introducing a pension scheme for caretakers employed under this scheme was also explored in 1985 but, at that time, it was considered that the high age profile of caretakers rendered the introduction of a pension scheme impractical. However, my Department is currently re-examining the feasibility of putting a pension scheme for these caretakers in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1978-79 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded by a more extensive school support grant scheme towards the funding of ancillary services in schools such as caretaking and secretarial. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives schools discretion as to <Col N="1014" /> the manner in which caretaking and secretarial services are provided. Secretaries and caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role regarding how they are employed. Such individualised arrangements preclude a central superannuation scheme. At second level, pension scheme provisions apply in the VEC, community and comprehensive sectors for secretaries and caretakers.</P>

      <P>Existing pre-service teacher training programmes provided by the colleges of education include specific elements aimed at equipping all primary teachers to recognise and cater for children with specific learning disabilities, including dyslexia.</P>
      <P>In addition, the learning support teacher service has a role to play in addressing the special educational needs of such children. This service, which was extended in 1999 to cover all primary schools with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above, is targeted specifically at the children in question. At present, there are 1,485 learning support teachers in primary schools.</P>
      <P>My Department is engaged in an ongoing programme of specialist training for learning support teachers. Such training will enhance their capacity to address the needs of children with literacy and numeracy difficulties.

      <P>Because of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity. A proposed building project for the school referred to by the Deputy will proceed to architectural planning, as soon as possible, under the expanded building programme.</P>

      <P>The National Educational Psychological Service Agency (NEPS) has assigned psychologists to all schools in Dublin 10. Sadly, the psychologist assigned to the named school recently died. Psychologists appointed following the recent recruitment competition will take up their posts during the coming months and this will permit NEPS to appoint a replacement psychologist to the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, the school has been informed that it may use the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments if necessary. A mem<Col N="1018" /> ber of the NEPS regional team will also be available to the school if issues of an urgent nature arise.</P>

      <Quest>the position regarding an application by the Ballybeg Community Development Project under the early school leavers initiative, given that they have fully complied with all requests from his Department and have received an endorsement from Waterford ESLI; if he will grant approval in view of the fact that this project is due to run out of funding shortly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to an application for funding under the fund for the development of targeted responses to children at risk which was received from Ballybeg Community Education Project in 2001. This fund is overseen by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin. The purpose of this fund is to develop preventative and supportive programmes that are targeted at children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage and social exclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In assessing applications, consideration was given to Department supported interventions already in place in the areas concerned so as to avoid duplication of effort and resources. In this regard, my Department is providing support for an eight to 15 Early School Leaver Project (ESLI) in the Ballybeg area. It was considered that there was a substantial overlap between the <Col N="1019" /> aims, objectives, the target group identified and the services provided under both the ESLI project and the Ballybeg Community Education Project. It was, therefore, decided that it would be inappropriate to continue to fund these projects on a separate basis. Accordingly, both project groups were requested in writing to come together to develop a joint proposal for consideration by my Department. I also arranged for a co-ordinator to work with both groups to assist them in developing a single holistic plan that would <Col N="1020" /> address the educational needs of the children at risk in the Ballybeg area. The co-ordinator has now recommended that the educational element of the Ballybeg Community Education Project should be supported through the existing ESLI project in the Waterford area. This recommendation is acceptable to me and this decision has been conveyed to both project groups. I hope both groups will work together to ensure that the educational needs of the children at risk in the Ballybeg area are addressed.</P>
